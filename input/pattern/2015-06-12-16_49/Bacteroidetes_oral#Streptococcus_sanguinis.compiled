TI  - Combinatorial effects of arginine and fluoride on oral bacteria.
AB  - Dental caries is closely associated with the microbial disequilibrium between acidogenic/aciduric pathogens and alkali-generating commensal residents within the dental plaque. Fluoride is a widely used anticaries agent, which promotes tooth hard-tissue remineralization and suppresses bacterial activities. Recent clinical trials have shown that oral hygiene products containing both fluoride and arginine possess a greater anticaries effect compared with those containing fluoride alone, indicating synergy between fluoride and arginine in caries management. Here, we hypothesize that arginine may augment the ecological benefit of fluoride by enriching alkali-generating bacteria in the plaque biofilm and thus synergizes with fluoride in controlling dental caries. Specifically, we assessed the combinatory effects of NaF/arginine on planktonic and biofilm cultures of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis with checkerboard microdilution assays. The optimal NaF/arginine combinations were selected, and their combinatory effects on microbial composition were further examined in single-, dual-, and 3-species biofilm using bacterial species-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We found that arginine synergized with fluoride in suppressing acidogenic S. mutans in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. In addition, the NaF/arginine combination synergistically reduced S. mutans but enriched S. sanguinis within the multispecies biofilms. More importantly, the optimal combination of NaF/arginine maintained a "streptococcal pressure" against the potential growth of oral anaerobe P. gingivalis within the alkalized biofilm. Taken together, we conclude that the combinatory application of fluoride and arginine has a potential synergistic effect in maintaining a healthy oral microbial equilibrium and thus represents a promising ecological approach to caries management.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of exogenous nitric oxide on periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Current treatments for periodontitis (e.g., scaling/root planing and chlorhexidine) have limited efficacy since they fail to suppress microbial biofilms satisfactorily over time, and the use of adjunctive antimicrobials can promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Herein, we report the novel application of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing scaffolds (i.e., dendrimers and silica particles) as anti-periodontopathogenic agents. The effectiveness of macromolecular NO release was demonstrated by a 3-log reduction in periodontopathogenic Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis viability. In contrast, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis, caries-associated organisms, were substantially less sensitive to NO treatment. Both dendrimer- and silica-based NO release exhibited substantially less toxicity to human gingival fibroblasts at concentrations necessary to eradicate periodontopathogens than did clinical concentrations of chlorhexidine. These results suggest the potential utility of macromolecular NO-release scaffolds as a novel platform for the development of periodontal disease therapeutics.
TI  - Antibacterial action of Chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The agar diffusion assay with Cervitec((R)) and CervitecPlus((R)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. In a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (CervitecPlus((R)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (Cervitec((R)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. Supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. Supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas intermedia. Friedman/Wilcoxon tests and U-test were used for statistical analysis (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: Cervitec((R))/CervitecPlus((R)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. Both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. However, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at any time. The total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. A tendency to higher counts of A. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. CONCLUSION: Both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.
TI  - Salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (CD) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [T-CD]). The same number of healthy children (HC) was used as controls. The salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. Metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. Compared to HC, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (P < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the T-CD children. As shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest Shannon's diversity and substrate richness were found in HC. Pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for HC. Levels of Lachnospiraceae, Gemellaceae, and Streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the T-CD children. Streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in T-CD children. The saliva of T-CD children showed the largest amount of Bacteroidetes (e.g., Porphyromonas sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of Actinobacteria. T-CD children were also characterized by decreased levels of some Actinomyces species, Atopobium species, and Corynebacterium durum. Rothia mucilaginosa was the only Actinobacteria species found at the highest level in T-CD children. As shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated T-CD children. Some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with T-CD children. Correlations (false discovery rate [FDR], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The findings of this study indicated that CD is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.
TI  - Transcriptional responses of Treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  - The classic organization by Socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. Socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes. While the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. In this study, we employed T. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (P. gingivalis and T. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using F. nucleatum and P. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using Streptococcus sanguinis and S. gordonii as representatives). RNA was extracted from T. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. Numerous genes related to motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in T. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. Further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. Most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, Msp, CTLP) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. In summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.
TI  - Does photodynamic therapy enhance standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether or not photodynamic therapy enhanced standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry. BACKGROUND DATA: Photodynamic therapy when used as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy kills more bacteria than when conventional periodontal therapy is used alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address the focused question, "Does photodynamic therapy enhance killing of oral bacteria?" PubMed/MEDLINE((R)) and Google Scholar databases were explored. Original human and experimental studies and studies using photodynamic therapy for killing oral bacteria were included. Letters to the Editor, historic reviews, and unpublished data were excluded. RESULTS: Photodynamic therapy significantly reduces periodontopathogenic bacteria including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Photodynamic therapy kills cariogenic bacteria (such as Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis), bacteria associated with infected root canals, and those associated with periimplantitis. CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic therapy, when used as an adjunct to conventional oral disinfection protocols, enhances standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry.
TI  - A tissue-dependent hypothesis of dental caries.
AB  - Current understanding of dental caries considers this disease a demineralization  of the tooth tissues due to the acid produced by sugar-fermenting microorganisms. Thus, caries is considered a diet- and pH-dependent process. We present here the first metagenomic analysis of the bacterial communities present at different stages of caries development, with the aim of determining whether the bacterial composition and biochemical profile are specific to the tissue affected. The data show that microbial composition at the initial, enamel-affecting stage of caries is significantly different from that found at subsequent stages, as well as from dental plaque of sound tooth surfaces. Although the relative proportion of Streptococcus mutans increased from 0.12% in dental plaque to 0.72% in enamel caries, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguinis were the dominant streptococci in these lesions. The functional profile of caries-associated bacterial communities indicates that genes involved in acid stress tolerance and dietary sugar fermentation are overrepresented only at the initial stage (enamel caries), whereas other genes coding for osmotic stress tolerance as well as collagenases and other proteases enabling dentin degradation are significantly overrepresented in dentin cavities. The results support a scenario in which pH and diet are determinants of the disease during the degradation of enamel, but in dentin caries lesions not only acidogenic but also proteolytic bacteria are involved. We propose that caries disease is a process of varying etiology, in which acid-producing bacteria are the vehicle to penetrate enamel and allow dentin degrading microorganisms to expand the cavity.
TI  - Altered phenotype and function of dendritic cells in individuals with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of periodontal bacterial lysates on maturation and function of mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (m-MDDCs) derived from individuals with chronic periodontitis (CP) or healthy periodontal tissue (HP). DESIGN: m-MDDCs derived from peripheral blood monocytes, cultured for 7 days in presence of interleukin (IL)-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), were stimulated with lysates of Streptococcus sanguinis, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, or Treponema denticola on day 4, and were then phenotyped. IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-gamma concentration in the supernatant of cultures were measured. RESULTS: Expression of HLA-DR was lower in bacterial-unstimulated mature m-MDDC from CP compared to HP (p=0.04), while expression of CD1a and CD123 were higher in CP. The expression pattern of HLA-DR, CD11c, CD123, and CD1a did not change on bacterial stimulation, regardless of the bacteria. Stimulation with P. intermedia upregulated CD80 and CD86 in CP cells (p</=0.05). Production of IL-12p70 by bacterial-unstimulated m-MDDCs was 5.8-fold greater in CP compared to HP. Bacterial stimulation further increased IL-12p70 production while decreasing IL-10. Significantly more IFN-gamma was produced in co-cultures of CP m-MDDCs than with HP m-MDDCs when cells were stimulated with P. intermedia (p=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial-unstimulated m-MDDC from CP exhibited a more immature phenotype but a cytokine profile biased towards proinflammatory response; this pattern was maintained/exacerbated after bacterial stimulation. P. intermedia upregulated co-stimulatory molecules and IFN-gamma expression in CP m-MDDC. These events might contribute to periodontitis pathogenesis.
TI  - Microcalorimetric determination of the effects of amoxicillin, metronidazole, and their combination on in vitro biofilm.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanism of action of adjuvant antibiotic therapy in the treatment of peri-implantitis is not well understood. The aim of this study is to investigate antibiotic susceptibility of an in vitro biofilm by isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC). METHODS: Titanium disks containing a 72-hour three-species biofilm (Streptococcus sanguinis DSM20068, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC10953, and Porphyromonas gingivalis DSM20709) were placed in a series of IMC ampoules with nutrient agar supplemented with increasing concentrations of amoxicillin, metronidazole, or their combination and incubated anaerobically for 10 days. Lag time and maximum growth rate were determined from continuous heat-flow recordings of metabolic activity. To validate the IMC biofilm results, adherent S. sanguinis and P. gingivalis were incubated anaerobically in medium supplemented with antibiotics at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, and their vitality was determined by live/dead staining, conventional culturing, and IMC. RESULTS: In all biofilm samples incubated with antibiotics, a prolonged lag phase was observed compared with controls (P <0.05). Maximum growth rate was significantly lower for samples treated with either amoxicillin or metronidazole compared with controls (P <0.05). Combining the antibiotics did not improve this effect. Concentrations exceeding 10 times the minimum inhibitory concentration completely inhibited the growth of adherent S. sanguinis and P. gingivalis, whereas lower concentrations resulted in only a delay in the lag phase. A poor correlation was observed between live/dead staining and conventional culturing. CONCLUSIONS: IMC gives new evidence about antibiotic effects on oral biofilms and is more informative than conventional culture and live/dead assays. The combination of antibiotics was found to be more efficient than metronidazole alone; however, only minor differences in growth inhibition were detected compared with amoxicillin alone.
TI  - The surface layer of Tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB  - Tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, Gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. The surface layer (S-layer) of T. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as TfsA and TfsB, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. Here we investigated the association of this S-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. The growth of the S-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (CS) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (WT). Next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. The survival ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated CS (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the WT (97% survival). Furthermore, significant C3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the WT. In a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with Fusobacterium nucleatum. These results indicated that the S-layer of T. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.
TI  - Suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppuration (SUP) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. The aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with SUP in patients with chronic (CP) and aggressive (AgP) periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 156 patients with CP and 66 with AgP were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). The counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. Comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. Associations between frequency of SUP and bacterial species were analyzed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The prevalence of SUP in patients with CP was 24.4%, and in patients with AgP it was 30.3%, and the percentage of SUP sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (P >0.05). SUP sites from patients with CP had significantly higher counts of Veillonella parvula, Dialister pneumosintes, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella nigrescens than SUP sites from patients with AgP (P <0.005). Significant positive correlations between high frequency of SUP and high levels of Actinomyces spp, Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with CP (P <0.05). In patients with AgP, Actinomyces oris, Propionibacterium acnes, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with SUP, whereas Prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with SUP (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SUP sites from patients with CP harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than SUP sites from patients with AgP. Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, T. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with SUP.
TI  - Oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies microbial biofilms.
AB  - This report describes the use of a novel model of multispecies biofilms to stimulate profiles of cytokines/chemokines from oral epithelial cells that contribute to local inflammation in the periodontium. Streptococcus gordonii (Sg)/S. oralis (So)/S. sanguinis (Ss) and Sg/Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn)/Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) biofilms elicited significantly elevated levels of IL-1alpha and showed synergistic stimulatory activity compared with an additive effect of the 3 individual bacteria. Only the Sg/Actinomyces naeslundii (An)/Fn multispecies biofilms elicited IL-6 levels above those of control. IL-8 was a primary response to the Sg/An/Fn biofilms, albeit the level was not enhanced compared with a predicted composite level from the monospecies challenges. These results represent some of the first data documenting alterations in profiles of oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies biofilms.
TI  - Isothermal microcalorimetry provides new insights into biofilm variability and dynamics.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate a three-species in vitro biofilm with peri-implantitis-related bacteria for its variability and metabolic activity. Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were suspended in simulated body fluid containing 0.2% glucose to form biofilms on polished, protein-coated implant-grade titanium disks over 72 h using a flow chamber system. Thereafter, biofilm-coated disks were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization/confocal laser scanning microscopy. To assess metabolic activity within the biofilms, their heat flow was recorded for 480 h at 37 degrees C by IMC. The microscopic methods revealed that the total number of bacteria in the biofilms varied slightly among specimens (2.59 x 10(4) +/- 0.67 x 10(4) cells mm(-2) ), whereas all three species were found constantly with unchanged proportions (S. sanguinis 41.3 +/- 4.8%, F. nucleatum 17.7 +/- 2.1%, and P. gingivalis 41.0 +/- 4.9%). IMC revealed minor differences in time-to-peak heat flow (20.6 +/- 4.5 h), a trend consistent with the small variation in bacterial species proportions as shown by microscopy. Peak heat flow (35.8 +/- 42.6 muW), mean heat flow (13.1 +/- 22.0 muW), and total heat over 480 h (23.5 +/- 37.2 J) showed very high variation. These IMC results may be attributed to differences in the initial cell counts and relative proportions of the three species, their distribution and embedment in exopolysaccharide matrix on the test specimens. The present results provide new insights into variability and dynamics of biofilms on titanium disks, aspects that should be explored in future studies of dental surfaces.
TI  - Levels of Selenomonas species in generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To compare the levels of Selenomonas sputigena and uncultivated/unrecognized Selenomonas species in subgingival biofilms from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen periodontally healthy subjects and 15 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were recruited and their clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. Nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and all were individually analyzed for the levels of 10 bacterial taxa, including cultured and uncultivated/unrecognized microorganisms, using the RNA-oligonucleotide quantification technique. Between-group differences in the levels of the test taxa were determined using the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: Subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis showed significantly higher mean counts of Porphyromonas gingivalis, S. sputigena and the Mitsuokella sp. Human Oral Taxon (HOT) 131 (previously described as Selenomonas sp. oral clone CS002), while higher mean counts of Actinomyces gerencseriae and Streptococcus sanguinis were found in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.01). Selenomonas sp. HOT 146 was only detected in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group. In the generalized aggressive periodontitis group, the levels of P. gingivalis and S. sputigena were higher in deep sites (probing depth >/= 5 mm) than in shallow sites (probing depth </= 3 mm) (p < 0.01). Furthermore, in subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis, sites with probing depth of </= 3 mm harbored higher levels of these two species than sites with the same probing depth in periodontally healthy subjects. There were positive correlations between probing depth and the levels of P. gingivalis (r = 0.77; p < 0.01), S. sputigena (r = 0.60; p < 0.01) and Selenomonas dianae (previously described as Selenomonas sp. oral clone EW076) (r = 0.42, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: S. sputigena and Mitsuokella sp. HOT 131 may be associated with the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis, and their role in the onset and progression of this infection should be investigated further.
TI  - Comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. The aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures. METHODS: Supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. Also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. Samples were analyzed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. RESULTS: Mean total DNA probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (P <0.01). Precleaning edentate biofilms had higher counts and proportions of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of Tannerella forsythia, Selenomonas noxia, and Neisseria mucosa. By day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day 7 (P <0.01). Succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. Both groups demonstrated increased proportions of S. mitis and S. oralis by day 1. N. mucosa, Veillonella parvula, and Eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. CONCLUSIONS: "Mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. Post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.
TI  - Effect of Streptococcus sanguinis/Porphyromonas gingivalis single and combined biofilms upon platelet aggregation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of two oral bacteria Streptococcus sanguinis and  Porphyromonas gingivalis upon platelet aggregation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Streptococcus sanguinis, P. gingivalis, S. sanguniis+P. gingivalis were added to platelet-rich plasma and platelet aggregation measured using a platelet aggregometer. Platelets were passed through a flow chamber with S. sanguinis, P. gingivalis or a biofilm of S. sanguinis and P. gingivalis coated with saliva. Platelet adhesion to the chamber was observed under a fluorescence microscope for 15min. The positive control was platelets treated with adrenaline; the negative control was platelets treated with phosphate-buffered saline. RESULTS: The mean (+/- s.e.) aggregation magnitude of S. sanguinis and P. gingivalis was 77.7+/-7.4% and 79.3+/-9.9%, respectively. The aggregation magnitude of S. sanguinis+P. gingivalis was 51.3+/-12.9%, which was significantly lower than that for S. sanguinis/P. gingivalis (P<0.05). In the flow chamber system, platelets adhered to S. sanguinis/P.gingivalis respectively within 3min, and reached a plateau at 5-15min. Under the condition of the S. sanguinis- and P. gingivalis-saliva biofilm, platelet adhesion to the biofilm was significantly reduced at 5-15min (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the static or dynamic flow system, platelets adhered to S. sanguinis or P. gingivalis. However, if S. sanguinis was mixed with P. gingivalis, the aggregation magnitude (%) was significantly reduced.
TI  - Connective tissue graft plus resin-modified glass ionomer restoration for the treatment of gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesions: microbiological and immunological results.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: It was previously reported the clinical results of placing subgingival resin-modified glass ionomer restoration for treatment of gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of this treatment on the subgingival biofilm and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) inflammatory markers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients presenting the combined defect were selected. The defects were treated with either connective tissue graft plus modified glass ionomer restoration (CTG+R) or with connective tissue graft only (CTG). Evaluation included bleeding on probing and probing depth, 5 different bacteria targets in the subgingival plaque assessed at baseline, 45, and 180 days post treatments, and 9 inflammatory mediators were also assessed in the GCF. RESULTS: The levels of each target bacterium were similar during the entire period of evaluation (p > 0.05), both within and between groups. The highest levels among the studied species were observed for the bacterium associated with periodontal health. Additionally, the levels of all cyto/chemokines analyzed were not statistically different between groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Within the limits of the present study, it can be concluded that the presence of subgingival restoration may not interfere with the subgingival microflora and with GCF inflammatory markers analyzed. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This approach usually leads to the placement of a subgingival restoration. There is a lack of information about the microbiological and immunological effects of this procedure. The results suggest that this combined approach may be considered as a treatment option for the lesion included in this study.
TI  - A comparative evaluation of the antibacterial efficacy of honey in vitro and antiplaque efficacy in a 4-day plaque regrowth model in vivo: preliminary results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Honey has a potent broad-spectrum antibacterial action that may make  it suitable for "anti-infective" treatment of periodontal disease. The aims of this study are as follows: 1) to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of honey against oral bacteria and compare the same with 0.2% chlorhexidine; and 2) to compare antiplaque efficacy in vivo with chlorhexidine. METHODS: The study was conducted in two parts. In the in vitro part, the inhibitory effects of three test agents, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate, honey mouthwash, and saline, against six oral bacteria at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 mug/mL were tested in duplicate. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was set as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. The in vivo part consisted of a double-masked parallel clinical trial based on a 4-day plaque regrowth model. Sixty-six volunteers, 20 to 24 years of age, participated in the study, and the plaque scores were compared at baseline and at the end of 4 days. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for significance, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for pairwise comparison of the groups. The mean plaque scores were 1.77 +/- 0.86, 1.64 +/- 0.90, and 3.27 +/- 0.83 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. RESULTS: The honey mouthrinse effectively inhibited the six tested microorganisms. The chlorhexidine gluconate rinse had the lowest MICs compared with honey and saline rinses for all test species examined. The in vivo results revealed that plaque formation was inhibited/reduced by chlorhexidine and honey rinses. CONCLUSION: Honey has antibacterial action against tested oral microorganisms and also has antiplaque action.
TI  - Oral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses.
AB  - Oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. However, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. This report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. Monoinfection biofilms were developed with Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. Biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, OKF4, for up to 24h. Gro-1alpha, IL1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, TGFalpha, Fractalkine, MIP-1alpha, and IP-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. P. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines, except MIP-1alpha. Generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited Gro-1alpha, TGFalpha, and Fractalkine production, while F. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and IP-10. A. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IP-10. The oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. The results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. Moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.
TI  - Oral bacterial DNA differ in their ability to induce inflammatory responses in human monocytic cell lines.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) of periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas  gingivalis (Pg) and Tannerella forsythia, stimulate cytokine production in human monocytic cells (THP-1) through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) and nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) is one of the most frequently isolated bacteria in periodontally diseased tissues and is reported to synergize with Pg, enhancing the pathogenicity. We investigate inflammatory mediator production in THP-1 cells challenged with Fn and Streptococcus sanguinis (Ss) DNA, a non-pathogenic oral bacteria, and further assess whether cytokines triggered by whole pathogens or Pg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are affected by TLR-9 signaling inhibitors (chloroquine). METHODS: THP-1 cells were stimulated with Pg-DNA (100 ng/muL), Fn-DNA (100 ng/muL), Ss-DNA (100 ng/muL), Pg-LPS (10 ng/muL), and heat-killed whole bacteria (multiplicity of infection, 1:100) for 16 hours with or without chloroquine pretreatment (10 mug/mL). Interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical analyses included analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using Dunnett or Tukey methods and paired t test. A value of P <0.05 was significant. RESULTS: Inflammatory mediator levels were increased in response to all the stimuli with the exception of Ss-DNA (P <0.05). Chloroquine pretreatment significantly decreased cytokine production from THP-1 cells with the exception of IL-6 production triggered by whole Fn and Ss (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Differences exist among oral bacterial DNA in inducing immune responses. By altering the conditions in cytosolic compartments, we can interfere with cellular responses triggered by extracellular receptor activation. Thus, alternative treatment approaches targeted to intracellular receptors might be of benefit in controlling periodontal inflammation.
TI  - Influence of gaseous ozone in peri-implantitis: bactericidal efficacy and cellular response. An in vitro study using titanium and zirconia.
AB  - Dental implants are prone to bacterial colonization which may result in bone destruction and implant loss. Treatments of peri-implant disease aim to reduce bacterial adherence while leaving the implant surface intact for attachment of bone-regenerating host cells. The aims of this study were to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of gaseous ozone on bacteria adhered to various titanium and zirconia surfaces and to evaluate adhesion of osteoblast-like MG-63 cells to ozone-treated surfaces. Saliva-coated titanium (SLA and polished) and zirconia (acid etched and polished) disks served as substrates for the adherence of Streptococcus sanguinis DSM20068 and Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC33277. The test specimens were treated with gaseous ozone (140 ppm; 33 mL/s) for 6 and 24 s. Bacteria were resuspended using ultrasonication, serially diluted and cultured. MG-63 cell adhesion was analyzed with reference to cell attachment, morphology, spreading, and proliferation. Surface topography as well as cell morphology of the test specimens were inspected by SEM. The highest bacterial adherence was found on titanium SLA whereas the other surfaces revealed 50-75% less adherent bacteria. P. gingivalis was eliminated by ozone from all surfaces within 24 s to below the detection limit (>/=99.94% reduction). S. sanguinis was more resistant and showed the highest reduction on zirconia substrates (>90% reduction). Ozone treatment did not affect the surface structures of the test specimens and did not influence osteoblastic cell adhesion and proliferation negatively. Titanium (polished) and zirconia (acid etched and polished) had a lower colonization potential and may be suitable material for implant abutments. Gaseous ozone showed selective efficacy to reduce adherent bacteria on titanium and zirconia without affecting adhesion and proliferation of osteoblastic cells. This in vitro study may provide a solid basis for clinical studies on gaseous ozone treatment of peri-implantitis and revealed an essential base for sufficient tissue regeneration.
TI  - Prunus mume extract exhibits antimicrobial activity against pathogenic oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prunus mume is a common fruit in Asia, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we focused on the antimicrobial properties of Prunus mume extract against oral pathogens related to dental caries and periodontal diseases. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 15 oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, P. gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Candida species were included in the study. Initially, agar diffusion assay was performed to screen the antimicrobial activities of Prunus mume extract. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were then determined for sensitive species. Effect of Prunus mume extract on human oral keratinocytes (HOK) viability was also tested. RESULT: In the agar diffusion assay, drug suspension of 2 g/mL was able to inhibit all the bacterial species tested, but not the fungal species. MIC and MBC range of Prunus mume extract against the oral bacteria was 0.15625-0.0003 g/mL and P. gingivalis being the most susceptible species. Prune extract did not cause any detrimental effect on HOK. CONCLUSION: Prunus mume extract may be a potential candidate for developing an oral antimicrobial agent to control or prevent dental diseases associated with oral pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Short- and medium-chain fatty acids exhibit antimicrobial activity for oral microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the antibacterial activity of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. METHODS: The short-chain fatty acids [formic acid (C1), acetic acid (C2), propionic acid (C3), butyric acid (C4), isobutyric acid (C4), isovaleric acid (C5), hexanoic acid (C6)], medium-chain fatty acids [octanoic acid (C8), capric acid (C10), lauric acid (12)], and long-chain fatty acids [myristic acid (C14), palmitic acid (C16)], were investigated for antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus sanguis, Candida albicans, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. RESULTS: The data demonstrated that the fatty acids exhibited patterns of inhibition against oral bacteria with some specificity that appeared related more to the bacterial species that the general structural characteristics of the microorganism. As a group the fatty acids were much less effective against C. albicans than the oral bacteria, with effectiveness limited to hexanoic, octanoic, and lauric acids. Formic acid, capric, and lauric acids were broadly inhibitory for the bacteria. Interestingly, fatty acids that are produced at metabolic end-products by a number of these bacteria, were specifically inactive against the producing species, whilst substantially inhibiting the growth of other oral microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the antimicrobial activity of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) could influence the microbial ecology in the oral cavity via at least 2 potential pathways. First, the agents delivered exogenously as therapeutic adjuncts could be packaged to enhance a microbial-regulatory environment in the subgingival sulcus. Second, it would be the intrinsic nature of these fatty acid inhibitors in contributing to the characteristics of the microbial biofilms, their evolution, and emergence of species within the biofilms. Further studies on these functions are required to better understand the nature of these potential microbial interactions in the biofilms.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide as an endodontic irrigant in a polymicrobial biofilm tooth model system.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to determine bactericidal efficacy of 0.04% stabilized chlorine dioxide, 3% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, and sterile distilled water in a polymicrobial biofilm model. METHODS: Roots of 35 permanent bovine incisors had pulps extirpated, and their apical size and root length were standardized. Teeth were coated with mucin, inoculated with standardized suspensions of Streptococcus sanguinis, Actinomyces viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Prevotella nigrescens and incubated anaerobically. Teeth were randomly divided into four groups and rinsed for 3 minutes with 15 mL of irrigant. Biofilms were harvested and spiral-plated on selective media. Numbers of bacteria in the harvested biofilms was determined via the standard spiral-plating methodology. Treatment groups were evaluated using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis procedure. Pair-wise comparisons among the four groups and five organisms were made using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney procedure. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were made using the Holm method with p < 0.05. RESULTS: Results provide strong evidence of a significant difference in levels of bactericidal activity associated with the type of irrigant for all five bacterial species tested. Levels of bactericidal activity were significantly higher for the NaOCl group than for the stabilized chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) group for S. sanguinis, A. viscosus, and P. nigrescens. Results for F. nucleatum and P. micros were not significant after the adjustment for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: The triple-inoculation bovine tooth model system is a robust, consistent, and reproducible model system to study polymicrobial biofilms. It should be used with the knowledge expansion of biofilm structure and function as well as the development of antimicrobial protocols.
TI  - Clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. The aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. METHODS: Dental plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific PCR amplification for Streptococcus mutans and Bifidobacteriaceae species. RESULTS: Children with severe caries (n = 39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). Analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16S rRNA clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. Using the Human Oral Microbiome Database, 139 different taxa were identified. Within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included Granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and Veillonella sp. HOT-780 (p < 0.01). The species associated with caries-free children included Capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), Abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), Lachnospiraceae sp. HOT-100 (p < 0.05), Streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and Streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). By specific PCR, S. mutans (p < 0.005) and Bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. CONCLUSION: Clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the association of S. mutans with caries was from specific PCR analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  - The subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. We tested the hypothesis that the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. Subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16S sequencing. Smokers demonstrated greater abundance of Parvimonas, Fusobacterium, Campylobacter, Bacteroides, and Treponema and lower levels of Veillonella, Neisseria, and Streptococcus. Several uncultivated Peptostreptococci, Parvimonas micra, Campylobacter gracilis, Treponema socranskii, Dialister pneumosintes, and Tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while Veillonella sp. oral clone B2, Neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Capnocytophaga sp. clone AH015 were at lower levels. The microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.
TI  - Surgical endodontic treatment of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study explored the effect of surgical endodontic treatment of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm. STUDY DESIGN: Endodontic surgery was conducted on a case of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm. During the procedure, the samples of periapical tissues were collected for microbiologic analysis. The resected root ends were observed under scanning electron microscope. The patient was recalled every 3 months to evaluate the treatment effect for 1 year. RESULTS: The samples yielded 1 type of facultative anaerobic bacteria (Streptococcus sanguis) and 2 types of obligate anaerobic bacteria (Porphynomonas endodontalis and Prevotella oralis). Mature bacteria biofilms were formed on the surface of the root apexes. At the 1-year recall visit, the radiograph and the clinic examination showed the refractory periapical periodontitis was cured successfully. CONCLUSIONS: The periapical bacterial biofilm may contribute to the refractory periapical periodontitis. Endodontic surgery is a good option for definitive removal of an established extraradicular infection.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of n-6, n-7 and n-9 fatty acids and their esters for oral  microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study is to assess the antibacterial activity of omega-6, -7, -9  (n-6, n-7, n-9) fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. METHODS: The n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids, such as gamma-linoleic acid (GLA), linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (ARA), palmitoleic acid (PA), and oleic acid (OA), their fatty acid ethyl esters, GLA-EE, LA-EE, ARA-EE, PA-EE, OA-EE, and their fatty acid methyl esters, GLA-ME, LA-ME, ARA-ME, PA-ME, OA-ME, were investigated for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Various concentrations of the fatty acids, their methyl and ethyl esters were tested against various oral pathogens in 96-well plates and blood-agar plate. The plates were incubated anaerobically or aerobically at 37 degrees C for 48h, and the colony forming units (CFU) were determined. RESULTS: The data demonstrated that select n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids and their esters exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against these oral microorganisms, demonstrating some specificity for individual microbial species. CONCLUSION: The potential use or the combinations of the n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids and/or their esters, provided in a local delivery vehicle to infected sites in the oral cavity, could be considered as an additional therapeutic approach to improving oral health.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Chinese medicine herbs against common bacteria in oral  biofilm. A pilot study.
AB  - Twenty traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against four common oral bacteria. TCMs were tested for sensitivity against Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Aliquots of suspension of each bacterial species were inoculated onto a horse blood agar plate with TCMs soaked separately on 6mm paper disks. The plates were incubated for 48h anaerobically and the mean diameters of growth inhibition of three different areas obtained. 0.2% (w/v) chlorhexidine was used as a positive control. Broth microdilution assay was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration. Fructus armeniaca mume was effective against all four bacteria. Thirteen TCMs demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis, including Cortex magnoliae officinalis, Cortex phellodendri, Flos caryophylli, Flos lonicerae japonicae, Fructus armeniaca mume, Fructus forsythiae suspensae, Herba cum radice violae yedoensitis, Herba menthae haplocalycis, Pericarpium granati, Radix et rhizoma rhei, Radix gentianae, Ramulus cinnamomi cassia and Rhizoma cimicifugae. Cortex phellodendri showed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, while Radix et rhizoma rhei was effective against Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis. Fructus armeniaca mume had inhibitory effects against Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of different laser systems on bacteria adhered to dental implant surfaces: an in vitro study comparing zirconia with titanium.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine in vitro the anti-bacterial  efficacy of two different laser systems (CO(2) and diode) applied to Streptococcus sanguinis or Porphyromonas gingivalis cells in suspensions or adhered to zirconia or titanium dental implant materials, with two different surfaces each. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacteria were irradiated at two different power settings with either a CO(2) (lambda=10,600 nm) or a diode laser (lambda=810 nm). The lower mode is used clinically (for CO(2) 100 J/cm(2), diode 50 J/cm(2)) and the higher may alter the materials' surface (for CO(2) 1200 J/cm(2), diode 150 J/cm(2)). After irradiation, the number of viable bacteria was determined by culture. RESULTS: Planktonic cells of both species were more resistant to the laser irradiations than bacteria that adhered to surfaces. Adhered P. gingivalis were effectively killed at both wavelengths lambda=10,600 and 810 nm even at the lower settings, independent of the material. S. sanguinis cells that adhered to either zirconia surface were effectively killed by the CO(2) laser at the lower setting of 100 J/cm(2). However, the higher settings of both lasers were needed to reduce S. sanguinis that adhered to titanium surfaces. The CO(2) laser at the lower setting and the diode laser at the higher setting effectively reduced the viability of S. sanguinis or P. gingivalis that adhered to zirconia surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: Under irradiation conditions known not to alter zirconia implant surfaces in vitro, both CO(2) laser (100 J/cm(2)) and the diode laser (150 J/cm(2)) effectively reduced the viability of adhered S. sanguinis or P. gingivalis.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Streptococcus cristatus attenuates Fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. Various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. Evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. The aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, Streptococcus cristatus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: KB, TERT-2, TR146 and SCC15 cells were cocultured with F. nucleatum and S. cristatus, either alone or in combination, at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 under various conditions. The mRNA expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: F. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas S. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. When present together, S. cristatus attenuated the F. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. The inhibitory effect of S. cristatus was independent of its viability and its co-aggregation with F. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. Similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that S. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to F. nucleatum challenge.
TI  - SMAP29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. SMAP29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of SMAP29, SMAP28, and three congeners (SMAP18A, SMAP18D, and SMAP14A). METHODS: The peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity against multiple strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. Cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. RESULTS: SMAP28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, P < 0.05); however, the activity of SMAP28 and SMAP29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). The congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). Overall, F. nucleatum was the most susceptible organism, while P. gingivalis was the least susceptible. Keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. SMAP28 was the most cytotoxic, while SMAP14A was the least cytotoxic. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of SMAP29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other oral diseases.
TI  - Microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the microbial flora in specific oral sites in 13 dentate subjects, 6-8 months after completed radiation therapy (RT group) and in 13 matched controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The microflora on the tongue, buccal mucosa, vestibulum, supragingival plaque and subgingival region was analysed using duplicate sampling and cultivation technique. A clinical examination was also performed. RESULTS: Candida albicans was found in one or more sites in 54% of the RT subjects and in 15% of the controls. In three RT subjects, C. albicans was found at all four sites analysed. An unexpected finding was that enterococci were found in all RT subjects and in high number in 38%. None of the controls harboured enterococci. In supragingival plaque, Lactobacillus spp. were detected in 92% of the RT subjects and the number and proportion of Lactobacillus spp. were extremely high compared with the controls. Mutans streptococci were detected in high numbers in 31% of the RT subjects, while they were not detected in 23%. CONCLUSION: The microbial results explain why some RT subjects have an increased susceptibility to oral diseases and stress that site-specific microbial analysis is an important diagnostic tool when planning oral health preventive care for RT subjects.
TI  - Reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. In many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. An alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. METHODS: Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus crista, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were evaluated as potential antagonists against P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, P. intermedia ATCC 49046, and A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718 as periodontopathogens. Adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. RESULTS: The largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for P. gingivalis. All antagonistic strains except S. crista ATCC 49999 inhibited the adhesion of P. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for A. naeslundii ATCC 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). Adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718. Intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for P. intermedia, most notably caused by S. mitis BMS. CONCLUSION: The adhesion of P. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while S. mitis BMS appeared to be the most successful antagonist.
TI  - Stimulation of Fusobacterium nucleatum biofilm formation by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bacterial infection is a major cause of periapical periodontitis. Eradication of these microorganisms from apical lesions is essential to the success of endodontic treatment. The aim of this study was to clarify the molecular interaction between Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and other microorganisms associated with periapical periodontitis. METHODS: Microorganisms isolated from periapical lesions were inoculated into type-I collagen-coated polystyrene microtiter plates and maintained at 37 degrees C under anaerobic conditions for 2 days, after which, the quantity of organized biofilm on the plates was evaluated by crystal violet staining. Growth enhancement via soluble factor was evaluated by separated coculture using a 0.4-mum membrane filter. RESULTS: F. nucleatum exhibited strong adherence to type-I collagen-coated polystyrene microplates. Biofilm formation by F. nucleatum was significantly enhanced by P. gingivalis. It was complemented by compartmentalized coculture with P. gingivalis. Enhancement of biofilm formation by P. gingivalis was only slightly reduced by inactivation of its autoinducer-2-producing gene luxS. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that P. gingivalis enhances biofilm formation by F. nucleatum by releasing diffusible signaling molecules other than autoinducer-2.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Mahonia aquifolium and two of its alkaloids against oral bacteria.
AB  - Extracts or alkaloids isolated from Mahonia aquifolium exhibit antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. In this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activities of a M. aquifolium extract and two of its major alkaloids, berberine chloride and oxyacanthine sulphate, were tested in vitro against nine different oral bacteria. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from < or = 0.0031% to 0.1993% for the M. aquifolium extract, from 0.002% to > 0.125% for berberine chloride, and from 0.0156% to > 0.0625% for oxyacanthine sulphate. The values for the minimum bactericidal concentrations were in the same range, indicating that the test substances most probably acted in a bactericidal manner. The most susceptible bacterium against all three test substances was Porphyromonas gingivalis.
TI  - Innate immune responses of gingival epithelial cells to nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We have previously reported different susceptibilities  of periodontopathic and nonperiodontopathic bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and phagocytosis by neutrophils. Differences between the two groups of bacteria may exist also in their ability to induce immune responses from the host. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of various oral bacteria on innate immune responses by gingival epithelial cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: HOK-16B cells were cocultured with live or lysed nonperiodontopathic (n = 3) and periodontopathic (n = 5) bacterial species. The levels of human beta defensin-1, -2 and -3, and of the cathelicidin, LL-37, were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the accumulated interleukin-8 and interleukin-1 alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Nonperiodontopathic bacteria up-regulated some antimicrobial peptides without affecting the levels of cytokines. In the periodontopathic group, the orange-complex bacteria induced antimicrobial peptides and interleukin-8 efficiently, but the red-complex bacteria often demonstrated suppressive effects. In contrast to live bacteria, bacterial lysates had no suppressive effects. In addition, some bacterial lysates demonstrated a reduced ability to induce antimicrobial peptides compared with live bacteria. CONCLUSION: The nonperiodontopathic, the orange-complex, and the red-complex bacteria had different effects on the innate immune responses from gingival epithelial cells, which may affect the outcome of their host-microbial interaction in gingival sulcus.
TI  - Sensitivity of oral bacteria to 254 nm ultraviolet light.
AB  - AIM: To explore the sensitivity of bacteria commonly found in root canals to 254  nm ultraviolet (UV) light, either as individual cells or as participants of a bacterial multilayer. METHODOLOGY: The sensitivity of oral bacteria, as individual cells, to UV light was tested by subjecting plates streaked with bacteria to 254 nm UV, at a fluence of 1-20 mJ cm(-2). An experimental model was designed to produce a bacterial multilayer and to study absorption of UV light by bacteria in an outer layer and its effect on the elimination of bacteria in the inner layer. RESULTS: Direct exposure to relatively low doses of UV light (2-7 mJ cm(-2)) effectively eliminated all bacterial strains tested. Furthermore, an Enterococcus faecalis strain, partially resistant to a 24 h exposure to calcium hydroxide, was effectively eliminated within several seconds of exposure to UV light (P < 0.001). UV was absorbed by a multilayer of bacteria. When 4 bacterial cells microm(-2) were present in the light path, the UV light dose had to be increased by a factor of x10 to achieve 100% elimination of the bacteria in an inner layer. CONCLUSIONS: The application of UV light to eliminate endodontic pathogens may be possible. Nevertheless, its absorbance by outer layers of bacteria should be considered and the UV light dose adapted accordingly.
TI  - Expression of the short fimbriae of Porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  - The Mfa1 protein of Porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between P. gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii. We utilized a promoter-lacZ reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. Promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by S. gordonii, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mitis. In contrast, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus cristatus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. Expression of SspA/B, the streptococcal receptor for Mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. Proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of Mfa1 expression. Porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.
TI  - Bacterial profile and burden of periodontal infection in subjects with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontitis has been identified as a potential risk factor in cardiovascular diseases. It is possible that the stimulation of host responses to oral infections may result in vascular damage and the inducement of blood clotting. The aim of this study was to assess the role of periodontal infection and bacterial burden as an explanatory variable to the activation of the inflammatory process leading to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). METHODS: A total of 161 consecutive surviving cases admitted with a diagnosis of ACS and 161 control subjects, matched with cases according to their gender, socioeconomic level, and smoking status, were studied. Serum white blood cell (WBC) counts, high- and low-density lipoprotein (HDL/LDL) levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsC-rp) levels, and clinical periodontal routine parameters were studied. The subgingival pathogens were assayed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: Total oral bacterial load was higher in the subjects with ACS (mean difference: 17.4x10(5); SD: 10.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.2 to 17.4; P<0.001), and significant for 26 of 40 species including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis, and Treponema denticola. Serum WBC counts, hsC-rp levels, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis, were explanatory factors to acute coronary syndrome status (Nagelkerke r2=0.49). CONCLUSION: The oral bacterial load of S. intermedius, S. sanguis, Streptococcus anginosus, T. forsythensis, T. denticola, and P. gingivalis may be concomitant risk factors in the development of ACS.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - Is pre-term labour associated with periodontitis in a Danish maternity ward?
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To reveal differences in periodontal status and presence of subgingival bacteria in a Scandinavian population of women with pre-term birth compared with women who delivered at term. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one women with pre-term labour (before week 35) and 33 women with term labour (between weeks 38 and 41) were included in this case-control study. Periodontal measurements included plaque index (PlI), probing pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BOP). Inter-proximal distances from the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) to the marginal bone crest (MBC) were measured on bitewing radiographs. In 31 patients (16 cases and 15 controls) the subgingival plaque was analysed using "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Differences between the two examined groups were found related to "Twin births" (p=0.0064) and "Smokers" (p=0.03). None of the periodontal measurements showed any association. Significant differences were found concerning presence of Tannerella forsythensis, Treponema denticola, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis and Capnocytophaga ochracea but when defining sites with >10(5) bacteria as heavily colonized, no statistical difference was found between the two groups. CONCLUSION: A relation between pre-term birth and periodontitis was not revealed in the present study.
TI  - Effect of a stannous fluoride dentifrice on the sulcular microbiota: a prospective cohort study in subjects with various levels of periodontal inflammation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of an experimental 0.454% stannous fluoride (SnF2) dentifrice on the oral sulcular microbiota in patients with various stages of oral diseases using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present one-month, single center, single product, prospective cohort trial, 37 adults (mean age 37.6) were assigned to one of four oral health condition cohorts with seven to 10 subjects each: 1. mild gingivitis, 2. marked generalized gingivitis to moderate periodontitis, 3. caries-prone and 4. treated moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis in supportive periodontal care. All four groups were asked to use the test dentifrice and a power toothbrush twice a day for one minute during a four-week test period. Before and after the trial period, Plaque Indices (PII, Silness and Loe, 1964) and Gingival Indices (GI, Loe and Silness, 1963) were recorded. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from all patients at Baseline, as well as after two and four weeks. These samples were analyzed for content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: As a result of the only one minute brushing with the stannous fluoride dentifrice, the mean PII at Baseline was significantly lower (p < 0.05) from the mean PII at four weeks. No statistically significant differences were found between premolar and molar mean values. Moreover, no statistically significant differences were found between the mean GI at Baseline and at four weeks. The microbiological analysis showed that at baseline subjects in groups 2 and 4 had significantly higher bacterial loads of bacteria than groups 1, and 3 (i.e. A. actinomyctemcomitans P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola. Over the study period, the total bacterial load did not change in groups 2, 3 and 4. In groups 1 and 3, however, an increase in the loads of Streptococci spp. were noticed (p < 0.05) including S. mitis, S. intermedius, and S. sanguis (p < 0.01) suggesting an increase in the presence of early colonizing and health associated bacteria. CONCLUSION: One minute brushing with a 0.454% stannous fluoride dentifrice did--after four weeks--not affect the subgingival microbial profiles in patients with moderate periodontitis and treated moderate to advanced periodontitis. However, the sulcular microbial profiles of mild gingivitis and caries-prone patients were affected, indicating a shift towards a gingival health associated microbiota in the sulcular region of patients not affected by attachment loss. RUNNING HEAD: Effect of stannous fluoride on sulcular microbiota.
TI  - Multi-target antimicrobial actions of zinc against oral anaerobes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Zinc is used in oral care products as an antiplaque/antigingivitis agent. Our objective was to assess the antimicrobial actions of zinc against oral anaerobes associated with gingivitis, specifically Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia, with focus on catabolism and oxidative metabolism. METHODS: The oral anaerobes were grown in complex medium in an anaerobic chamber, harvested by centrifugation and used directly for experiments with suspensions. Biofilm growth involved super-infection by F. nucleatum of an initial biofilm formed by Streptococcus sanguis. RESULTS: Zn(2+) inhibited catabolism of glutamate, glutamyl-glutamate, glucose and fructose by F. nucleatum cells in suspensions with ID(50) values, respectively, of 0.05, 0.005, 0.01 and 0.01 mM. The ID(50) value for inhibition of glutamate catabolism by biofilms was 0.10 mM. Inhibition of glutamate catabolism could be related to inhibition of substrate uptake and of 2-oxoglutarate reductase. Zn(2+) also inhibited catabolism of aspartate or aspartyl-aspartate by P. intermedia with ID(50) values of 0.07 and about 0.03 mM, respectively. Respiration of intact cells of F. nucleatum and NADH oxidase in cell extracts were sensitive to zinc with ID(50) values, respectively, of about 1.0 and 1.4 mM. Zinc also inhibited production of hydrogen peroxide by F. nucleatum (ID(50) = ca. 0.04 mM.) but at high concentrations acted to potentiate and enhance peroxide killing of the anaerobe. CONCLUSION: Zn(2+) is a potent inhibitor of catabolism by F. nucleatum and P. intermedia, including catabolism of peptides, which can be degraded to yield inflammatory metabolic end products. Zn(2+) also inhibits O(2) metabolism of F. nucleatum by about 50% and hydrogen peroxide production nearly completely but also enhances killing by peroxide added to cells.
TI  - Scaling and root planing, systemic metronidazole and professional plaque removal  in the treatment of chronic periodontitis in a Brazilian population II--microbiological results.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions  of 39 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples after scaling and root planing (SRP) alone or in combination with systemic metronidazole and/or professional cleaning in subjects with chronic periodontitis. METHODS: Forty-four adult subjects (mean age 45+/-6 years) with periodontitis were randomly assigned in four treatment groups, a control (C, n=10) that received SRP and placebo and three test groups treated as follows: T1 (n=12): SRP and metronidazole (M, 400 mg tid) for 10 days; T2 (n=12): SRP, weekly professional supragingival plaque removal for 3 months (PC) and placebo; and T3 (n=10): SRP, M and PC. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from seven sites per subject at baseline and 90 days post-therapy. Counts of 39 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Significance of differences over time was determined using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test and among groups using ancova. RESULTS: The mean counts of the majority of the species were reduced post-therapy in the 4 treatment groups. Counts (x 10(5)+/-SEM) of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis and Treponema denticola were significantly reduced in groups T2 and T3. Levels of beneficial species, such as some Actinomyces species, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus gordonii were minimally affected in levels when the combined therapy was applied (T3). Mean proportions of red complex species decreased from 18.4% at baseline to 3% at 90 days post-therapy in group T3 (p<0.01), from 25.8% to 2.3% in group T2 (p<0.01), from 17.7% to 5.6% in group T1 (p<0.05) and from 19.4% to 8.8% in group C (NS). Proportions of the suspected periodontal pathogens from the orange complex were also markedly reduced in groups T2 and T3. CONCLUSIONS: All treatments reduced counts and proportions of red complex species. Adjunctive therapy appeared to have a greater effect and also affected members of the orange complex.
TI  - Single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  - The participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. This study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. Each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha points for 7 d. The gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. E. faecalis, Strep. sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The E. faecalis and Strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus. No biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with F. nucleatum, Prop. acnes, Porph. gingivalis and Prev. intermedia. These findings suggest that Gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.
TI  - Oral streptococcal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mediates interaction  with Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae.
AB  - Interaction of Porphyromonas gingivalis with plaque-forming bacteria is necessary for its colonization in periodontal pockets. Participation of Streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and P. gingivalis fimbriae in this interaction has been reported. In this investigation, the contribution of various oral streptococcal GAPDHs to interaction with P. gingivalis fimbriae was examined. Streptococcal cell surface GAPDH activity was measured by incubation of a constant number of streptococci with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and analysis for the conversion of NAD+ to NADH based on the absorbance at 340 nm. Coaggregation activity was measured by a turbidimetric assay. Cell surface GAPDH activity was correlated with coaggregation activity (r = 0.854, P < 0.01) with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. S. oralis ATCC 9811 and ATCC 10557, Streptococcus gordonii G9B, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC 10556, and Streptococcus parasanguinis ATCC 15909 exhibited high cell surface GAPDH activity and coaggregation activity; consequently, their cell surface GAPDHs were extracted with mutanolysin and purified on a Cibacron Blue Sepharose column. Subsequently, their DNA sequences were elucidated. Purified GAPDHs bound P. gingivalis recombinant fimbrillin by Western blot assay, furthermore, their DNA sequences displayed a high degree of homology with one another. Moreover, S. oralis recombinant GAPDH inhibited coaggregation between P. gingivalis and the aforementioned five streptococcal strains in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that GAPDHs of various plaque-forming streptococci may be involved in their attachment to P. gingivalis fimbriae and that they may contribute to P. gingivalis colonization.
TI  - [Purification and characterization of sanguicin--a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus sanguis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Streptococcus sanguis plays an important Role in maintaining the periodontal microecological balance. Previous studies have demonstrated that sanguicin--a kind of bacteriocin produced by S. sanguis has a prominent function of inhibiting the growth of putative periodontopathic bacteria (PPB). The aim of this study was to purify sanguicin and investigate its characters. METHODS: The raw extract of sanguicin was obtained from cells of S. sanguis by ultrasonication, salting out and dialysis. Then the diethyl-aminoethyl-sepharose gradual washing was done in conjunction with glucosan gel filtration for in the purfication of sanguicin. The characters of purified sanguicin were determined and its inhibitiory effect on PPB was measured by agar diffusion test. RESULTS: The purifed sanguicin was obtained; it was heat labile and proteinaceous; and by SDS-PAGE, it showed a main band with the relative molecular mass of 65 x 10(3). The purifed sanguicin had a strong inhibitory effect on P. gingivalis, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our methods are useful for the purification of sanguicin. Sanguicin has inhibitory effect on PPB obviously and will have a good prospect in periodontal ecological therapy.
TI  - Susceptibility of oral bacteria to Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil in vitro.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil against 161 isolates of oral bacteria from 15 genera was determined. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) ranged from 0.003 to 2.0% (v/v). MIC90 values were 1.0% (v/v) for Actinomyces spp., Lactobacillus spp., Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis, and 0.1% (v/v) for Prevotella spp. Isolates of Porphyromonas, Prevotella and Veillonella had the lowest MICs and MBCs, and isolates of Streptococcus, Fusobacterium and Lactobacillus had the highest. Time kill studies with Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus rhamnosus showed that treatment with > or = 0.5% tea tree oil caused decreases in viability of >3 log colony forming units/ml after only 30 s, and viable organisms were not detected after 5 min. These studies indicate that a range of oral bacteria are susceptible to tea tree oil, suggesting that tea tree oil may be of use in oral healthcare products and in the maintenance of oral hygiene.
TI  - Proteome analysis of oral pathogens.
AB  - The oral environment contains diverse communities of micro-organisms including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Studies of oral ecology have led to an appreciation of the complexity of the interactions that oral micro-organisms have with the host in both health and disease. Despite this, diseases such as dental caries and periodontal diseases are still worldwide human ailments, resulting in a high level of morbidity and an economic burden to society. Proteomics offers a new approach to the understanding of holistic changes occurring as oral micro-organisms adapt to environmental change within their habitats in the mouth.
TI  - Activity of human beta-defensin 3 alone or combined with other antimicrobial agents against oral bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3) alone or combined with lysozyme, metronidazole, amoxicillin, and chlorhexidine were investigated with the oral bacteria Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. hBD-3 showed bactericidal activity against all of the bacterial species tested. The bactericidal effect was enhanced when the peptide was used in combination with the antimicrobial agents mentioned above.
TI  - [Investigation on interaction between Streptococcus sanguis and Porphyromonas gingivalis in specific pathogen-free rats].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether endogenous S. sanguis could prevent, or reduce the  colonization of the virulent P. gingivalis strain. METHODS: First, 10 specific pathogen-free Wistar rats were divided into 2 groups. Doxycycline was administered in the drinking water for 7 days. Successful implantation of the endogenous strain of S. sanguis, isolated from one of the rats before doxycycline administration, and P. gingivalis 381 within 14 days of observation were demonstrated in the rats of each group respectively. Then, 30 SPF rats were divided into 6 groups. Doxycycline was administered in the drinking water for 7 days to all the rats. Afterwards, the rats in group A and B were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with P. gingivalis, the rats in group C and E were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with S. sanguis. Then, the rats in group A were inoculated for 5 days with S. sanguis, and rats in group C and D were inoculated for 5 days with P. gingivalis. The rats in group F served as negative control. After inoculation, the levels of S. sanguis and P. gingivalis in the mouths of the rats were determined after 12, 24, 36 hours, 7 days and 14 days. RESULTS: Both pre-colonization of S. sanguis and superinfection with S. sanguis did reduce the level of P. gingivalis in experimental rats. However, the reduction only maintained quite short time, about 36 hours. It was not caused by the decreased level of S. sanguis after 36 hours because the level of S. sanguis kept stable during the observation period of 14 days. CONCLUSION: That S. sanguis function as the effector strain requires the successful implantation of S. sanguis as well as S. sanguis producing antagonistic action efficiently in vivo.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of zirconia ceramic surfaces: an in vitro and in vivo study.
AB  - PURPOSE: The microbial colonization of new ceramic materials developed for abutment manufacturing was assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The materials used in these experiments were disks of 'as-fired' and 'rectified' ceramic material made of tetragonal zirconia polycrystals stabilized with yttrium (Y-TZP) and commercially pure grade 2 titanium (Ti) with corresponding eluates. They were tested in vitro with the following bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Proliferation was evaluated on plates by inhibitory halos around pits, previously inoculated with eluates obtained from the materials. Bacterial adhesion on materials was quantified by spectrophotometric evaluation of the slime production by the same bacteria. Moreover, early bacterial adhesion was evaluated in human volunteers and observed with SEM. RESULTS: No inhibition of bacterial proliferation using eluates was observed. In vitro as-fired and rectified Y-TZP showed significantly more adherent S. mutans than did Ti disks, while S. sanguis seemed to adhere easily to Ti specimens. No differences were noted for Actinomyces spp and P. gingivalis. In vivo Y-TZP accumulated fewer bacteria than Ti in terms of the total number of bacteria and presence of potential putative pathogens such as rods. No differences were observed between rectified and as-fired Y-TZP. DISCUSSION: Overall, Y-TZP accumulates fewer bacteria than Ti. CONCLUSION: Y-TZP may be considered as a promising material for abutment manufacturing.
TI  - Enhanced neutrophil emigration and Porphyromonas gingivalis reduction following PGG-glucan treatment of mice.
AB  - Periodontal disease is the consequence of a mixed Gram-negative infection in the  gingival sulcus and has been associated with deficits in the neutrophil response. A novel, and heretofore untested, alternative approach to therapy is the use of biological-response modulators that enhance the neutrophil response. Poly-beta1-6-glucotriosyl-beta1-3-glucopyranose glucan (PGG-glucan) is an immunomodulator, derived from yeast, which specifically enhances neutrophil priming, phagocytosis and bacterial killing while failing to induce inflammatory cytokine expression. The hypothesis tested was that PGG-glucan could enhance host resistance to a Gram-negative periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis. Chambers were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsolumbar region of C57BL/6J mice and allowed to heal for 14 days. PGG-glucan was administered subcutaneously to one-half of the animals and saline to the other half. In the first set of experiments the chambers were inoculated with P. gingivalis (A7436) at 4 x 10 (6), 4 x 10 (7), and 4 x 10 (8) colony-forming units (CFU). In the second set of experiments the chambers were inoculated with 5 x 10 (8) CFU of either P. gingivalis or Streptococcus sanguis, a Gram-positive oral microbe that is not periodontopathic. Chambers were sampled over the following 2 weeks. The results demonstrated that: (1). bacterial CFU and neutrophils increased with increasing bacterial inoculum (P<0.02); (2). bacterial CFU were lower in the PGG-glucan-treated animals than in the saline controls (P<0.02); and (3). neutrophil counts were higher in the PGG-glucan-treated animals than in the saline controls (P<0.01). These results indicate that PGG-glucan significantly enhances neutrophil emigration and bacterial killing, thus decreasing the bacterial infection in this model system.
TI  - [Research on inhibition of sodium fluoride on five subgingival bacteria in vitro].
AB  - This in vitro study was aimed at observing inhibition action of fluoride on 5 common periodontal bacteria in subgingival microflora. The liquid media two-fold dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of sodium fluoride (NaF) to 9 strains of bacteria representing the main periodontopathic species(P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedius) and the periodontal beneficial species (S. sanguis) and 1 strain of S. sorbrinus. The results showed that all the bacteria were inhibited at different concentration of NaF. The MIC values ranged from 128 micrograms/ml for P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans, 256 micrograms/ml for S. sorbrinus, 1024 micrograms/ml for P. intermedius to 2048-4096 micrograms/ml for S. sanguis. The results suggest that NaF can also be used as a periodontal anti-bacterium agent and those preparations containing about 1000 micrograms/ml fluoride can be used effectively against the periodontopathic bacteria without disturbing the local ecological balance.
TI  - Influence of secondary colonizers and human plasma on the adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro.
AB  - The influence of secondary colonizers (Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces naeslundii) and the effect of human plasma on the adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. Hydroxyapatite (HAP) discs coated with Streptococcus sanguis were immersed in a 3H-labeled bacterial cell suspension of F. nucleatum or A. naeslundii and then in a 14C-labeled P. gingivalis cell suspension. Bacterial cells on the discs were pyrolysed to quantify the radioisotopes released. The cell numbers of secondary colonizers on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in significantly elevated adherence of P. gingivalis. These two secondary colonizers had very similar positive effects on the adherence of P. gingivalis. Human plasma significantly inhibited the adherence of P. gingivalis and secondary colonizers to S. sanguis-coated HAP discs. Adherence of P. gingivalis and A. naeslundii was strongly inhibited by plasma, while that of F. nucleatum was affected the least. Treatment with plasma, after immersion of streptococcal-coated discs in individual cell suspension of secondary colonizers, also reduced subsequent adherence of P. gingivalis. The rate of decrease was much smaller in F. nucleatum. These results indicate that both F. nucleatum and A. naeslundii enhance the adherence of P. gingivalis, and that the former may play a more important role in the establishment of P. gingivalis in dental plaque where plasma-derived components are present.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  - Antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. Previous studies suggested that 1 mM NaF reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. The present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mM, 10 ppm NaF) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. Nine oral species were grown at pH 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the pH for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of NaF. In addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without NaF, and the pH change followed by microelectrode. After 10 days, chemostat pH dropped to ca. pH 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by Streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total CFU) and Veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). In comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final pH was significantly higher (ca. pH 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). The culture was predominated by V. dispar (70%) and Actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas S. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. Biofilm pH fell to only pH 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). Analysis of the data suggests that fluoride exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. Fluoride prevents enrichment of S. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic pathogens. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (AH26, AH plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (N2), and one calcium hydroxide-based sealer (Sealapex). The testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia). The freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. After varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. All the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial activity. The sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types and bacterial strains. N2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. The extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.
TI  - Efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (II). Effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (Crest Complete) or power (Braun 3D Plaque Remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. METHODS: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. At baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. After random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. Clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. Significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the Quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. Streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while Streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. Mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. Major reductions occurred in both groups for A. naeslundii, A. israelii/gerencseriae, Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella parvula, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis and S. constellatus/intermedius. All taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. The reductions in prevalence were greater for A. naeslundii, S. constellatus/intermedius, V. parvula, A. israelii/gerencseriae, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis, P. micros, Streptococcus mutans and P. intermedia/nigrescens. Mean prevalence was decreased more for Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus/showae, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. CONCLUSIONS: The major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the subgingival microbiota. Counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. This reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. Further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.
TI  - The effect of oral bacteria on Candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  - A total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral Candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. Briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a C. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive Candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. In general, out of eight bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis SK21A, Streptococcus salivarius SK56, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and S. salivarius OBU3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different C albicans isolates. Porphyromonas gingivalis Pg 50, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 7469 and Prevotella intermedia OBU4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas S. sanguis OBU 2 had no effect. E. coli ATCC 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). A significant increase in the germ tube production of C. albicans isolated from HIV-infected compared with HIV-free individuals was also noted. The current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of C. albicans isolates.
TI  - A microbiological study of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. METHODS: Bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. Some isolates were also subjected to partial 16S rDNA sequencing. Plaque samples were also assayed for the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: The culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly Capnocytophaga spp and Streptococcus spp. The latter included S. constellatus, S. oralis, and S. sanguis. Other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. The aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. Anaerobic species included Prevotella intermedia, P. melaninogenica, and P. nigrescens, as well as Peptostreptococcus spp. ELISA detected P gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. Prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PLS have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. However, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with PLS.
TI  - Investigation on interaction between Streptococcus sanguis and Porphyromonas gingivalis in specific pathogen-free rats.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether endogenous Streptococcus can prevent or reduce the  colonization of the virulent Porphyromonas gingivalis strain. METHODS: Successful implantation of the endogenous strain of S. sanguis and P. gingivalis 381 within 14 days was demonstrated in the study rats following administration of doxycycline for 7 days. Thirty specific pathogen-free (SPF) rats were divided into 6 groups. After administration of doxycycline for 7 days, groups A and B were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with P. gingivalis. Group C and E were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with S. sanguis. Then, group A was inoculated for 5 days with S. sanguis, and rats in group C and D were inoculated for 5 days with P. gingivalis. Group F served as a negative control. After inoculation, the levels of S. sanguis and P. gingivalis in the mouths of the rats were determined at 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 7 days, and 14 days. RESULTS: Both precolonization of S. sanguis and superinfection with S. sanguis reduced the level of P. gingivalis in experimental rats. However, the reduction was maintained for only 24 to 36 hours. The level of S. sanguis remained stable during the 14-days observation period. CONCLUSION: S. sanguis to function as the effector strain, the successful implantation of S. sanguis and the antagonistic action efficiently produced in vivo by S. sanguis is required.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of antibacterial effects of Nd:YAG laser irradiation in root canals and dentinal tubules.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of the Nd:YAG laser on contaminated root canals and dentinal tubules were observed as the aim of this study. The samples were inoculated with Streptococcus sanguis (NCTC 7853) and Prevotella intermedia (NCTC 93336), and the effects of Nd:YAG laser were tested on these teeth. The specimens were lased with 1.8 W and 2.4 W Nd:YAG laser for 30 s, and the presence of bacteria in tubules was observed under light microscopy. The 1.8 W laser sterilized the tubules in 86.3% of sections inoculated with S. sanguis, whereas 2.4 W laser sterilized in 98.5% of the sections. Both laser powers sterilized all samples inoculated with P. intermedia. The scanning electron microscopic observations supported the light microscopic findings.
TI  - In vitro study of the penetration of Streptococcus sanguis and Prevotella intermedia strains into human dentinal tubules.
AB  - The persistent presence of bacteria in the root canal system often leads to the failure of treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine in vitro penetration of Streptococcus sanguis and Prevotella intermedia into dentinal tubules. Samples obtained from human teeth were inoculated with a strain of S. sanguis (NCTC 7853) and P. intermedia (NCTC 93336) for 20 days. Bacterial penetration into tubules was investigated at scanning electron microscopy and light microscopic level. The results showed that S. sanguis could penetrate into dentinal tubules 382.3 microns, whereas P. intermedia could penetrate 25.9 microns. It was observed that P. intermedia had not penetrated into all dentinal tubules. If penetration occurred the depth was quite limited.
TI  - The clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole in sites with and without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole (ORN) in sites with or without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis (EOP) patients. METHODS: Two pooled bacterial samples consisting of 4 sites each (scaled and non-scaled sites) were obtained from 30 individuals exhibiting EOP. All patients received oral hygiene instruction (OHI), supragingival scaling and ORN. Subgingival scaling and root planing (SRP) was carried out only in scaled sites. Bacterial samples were taken at baseline (BL) and 1 week and 2, 6, and 12 months after systemic ornidazole administration (500 mg/bid for 7 days). One more sample was taken at scaled sites, one week after SRP. RESULTS: One week following SRP (scaled sites) Gram-negative facultative and anaerobic rods were significantly reduced while Gram-positive facultative cocci were significantly increased. After ORN administration, P. gingivalis, P. denticola, P. intermedia, B. forsythus, C. rectus, and S. sputigena were no longer detectable in either scaled or non-scaled sites. A statistically significant long-term (2, 6, and 12 months) reduction of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. loescheii, B. forsythus, and C. rectus and a pronounced increase of S. milleri, S. oralis, and S. sanguis counts in both scaled and non-scaled sites were detected in comparison to baseline. A sustained reduction of bleeding tendency and of probing depth was also observed in both scaled and non-scaled sites. CONCLUSIONS: ORN combined with SRP effects beneficial shifts in the bacterial population associated with substantial clinical improvement, thereby indicating that ORN is effective adjunct in the treatment of EOP deep periodontal pockets where anaerobic bacteria are predominant.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis platelet aggregation activity: outer membrane vesicles are potent activators of murine platelets.
AB  - Recent evidence has established an association between chronic periodontitis and  cardiovascular disease. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a small group of gram-negative bacteria, of which Porphyromonas gingivalis is considered an important causative agent. It has been proposed that dental plaque bacteria and their products can disseminate into the bloodstream from the site of infection and promote thromboembolic events associated with atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. In this regard, Streptococcus sanguis and P. gingivalis have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. Here we report that P. gingivalis was able to induce platelet aggregation, and that oral strains of Actinobaillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Trepenoma denticola failed to aggregate platelets when tested for platelet aggregation activity under similar conditions. Additionally, we show that vesicles (outer membrane evaginations that are shed into the environment by the bacteria) of P. gingivalis are potent inducers of mouse platelet aggregation in vitro. In summary, our data show that i) initial adherence of the bacterium to platelet may be facilitated by P. gingivalis fimbriae and ii) P. gingivalis vesicles possess platelet aggregation-inducing activity.
TI  - Dental plaque formation.
AB  - Dental plaque is a complex biofilm that accumulates on the hard tissues (teeth) in the oral cavity. Although over 500 bacterial species comprise plaque, colonization follows a regimented pattern with adhesion of initial colonizers to the enamel salivary pellicle followed by secondary colonization through interbacterial adhesion. A variety of adhesins and molecular interactions underlie these adhesive interactions and contribute to plaque development and ultimately to diseases such as caries and periodontal disease.
TI  - Automated immunofluorescence for enumeration of selected taxa in supragingival dental plaque.
AB  - The present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. Following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. Test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. Due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. Automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. Results are shown for six taxa (Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia/Prev. nigrescens, Streptococcus gordonii/Strep. oralis/Strep. sanguis, Strep. sobrinus, and Veillonella dispar/ V. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. Results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. This work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.
TI  - Microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). METHODS: A total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. The counts (levels), % DNA probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. Significance of differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: All 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. Actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 Actinomyces species. Supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts of Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Neisseria mucosa, Streptococcus gordonii, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. Subgingival plaque samples presented significantly higher counts of Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Bacteroides forsythus and Porphykromonas gingivalis. Subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as Actinomyces species. Suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival samples were negative for the same species. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.
TI  - Antibody-targeted lethal photosensitization of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated that Porphyromonas gingivalis is susceptible to killing by toluidine blue O (TBO) when irradiated with light from a helium-neon (HeNe) laser. The aim of this study was to determine whether a TBO-antibody conjugate (Ab-TBO) could be used to specifically target P. gingivalis to lethal photosensitization in the presence of Streptococcus sanguis or human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs). When a mixture of P. gingivalis and S. sanguis was exposed to 4 microg of TBO/ml and irradiated with HeNe laser light, there were 1.5- and 4.0-log(10)-unit reductions in the viable counts, respectively. In contrast, when TBO was conjugated with a murine monoclonal antibody against P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide, the reductions in viable counts of P. gingivalis and S. sanguis amounted to 5.0 and 0.1 log(10) units, respectively. Lethal photosensitization of P. gingivalis in the presence of HGFs using unconjugated TBO resulted in a 0.7-log(10)-unit reduction in P. gingivalis viable counts and a 99% reduction in the incorporation of tritiated thymidine ([(3)H]Tdr) by the HGFs. In contrast, when the Ab-TBO conjugate was used, there was a 100% reduction in P. gingivalis viable counts but no significant reduction in the incorporation of [(3)H]Tdr by HGFs. These results demonstrate that specific targeting of P. gingivalis can be achieved using TBO conjugated to a monoclonal antibody raised against a cell surface component of this organism.
TI  - Effect of an essential oil-containing antiseptic mouthrinse on induction of platelet aggregation by oral bacteria in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: With an increasing body of data suggesting an association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease, studies have been conducted to elucidate potential mechanisms by which oral bacteria might exert systemic effects. 2 oral bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis and Porphyromonas gingivalis, have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. This study was conducted to determine the effect of treatment with an essential oil mouthrinse (Listerine Antiseptic) on the platelet-aggregating activity of these organisms. METHOD: Bacteria were grown under standard culture conditions. S. sanguis ATCC strain 10556 was exposed for 3 min to the essential oil mouthrinse at either full strength or a 1:1 dilution, while P. gingivalis FDC strain 381 was exposed to the essential oil mouthrinse at a 1:10 dilution. Positive control cells were treated with Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS). Aggregation was measured using a recording platelet aggregometer. The assay of each organism in its respective mouthrinse dilution(s) or HBSS was repeated 5 times. RESULTS: In all cases, the HBSS-treated organisms induced platelet aggregation, with mean(+/-S.E.) lag times of 12.30 (+/-1.36) min and 11.36 (+/-0.58) min for P. gingivalis and S. sanguis, respectively. In contrast, treatment with the essential oil mouthrinse completely inhibited the platelet aggregating activity of P. gingivalis and of S. sanguis exposed to the 1:1 mouthrinse dilution in all assays; the aggregating activity of S. sanguis treated with full-strength mouthrinse was completely inhibited in 4 of 5 assays, and inhibited by 75% in the 5th, for a mean inhibition of 95 +/- 1.5%. CONCLUSION: This study provides additional evidence that the essential oil mouthrinse can interfere with bacterial cell surface-associated activities which may have clinical relevance.
TI  - Namibian chewing stick, Diospyros lycioides, contains antibacterial compounds against oral pathogens.
AB  - The twigs of Diospyros lycioides, a plant commonly known as "muthala", are frequently used as chewing sticks for the cleaning of teeth by rural and urban people in Namibia. Preliminary studies showed that a methanol extract of D. lycioides inhibited growth of selected oral pathogens. Subsequent bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of four novel bioactive naphthalene glycosides, diospyrosides A, B, C, and D (1-4), and two known bioactive naphthoquinones, juglone (5) and 7-methyljuglone (6). The structures of the new compounds were elucidated using spectroscopic techniques including 1D and 2D NMR. These compounds inhibited the growth of oral cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis) and periodontal pathogens (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia) at minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.019 to 1.25 mg/mL. Juglone exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity among these compounds.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and Arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  - Arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. They possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. Although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. Also, the antimicrobial activity of Arnica has not been extensively investigated. Therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by Arnica and propolis extracts. Arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from Minas Gerais State were compared with controls. Fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: Candida albicans--NTCC 3736, F72; Staphylococcus aureus--ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis--ATCC 29212; Streptococcus sobrinus 6715; Strep. sanguis--ATCC 10556; Strep. cricetus--HS-6; Strep. mutans--Ingbritt 1600; Strep. mutans--OMZ 175; Actinomyces naeslundii--ATCC 12104, W 1053; Act. viscosus OMZ 105; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Porph. endodontalis and Prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). Antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. To assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. To assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 M sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. Arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. The propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for Actinomyces spp. The Arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. Cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. The Arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for Strep. mutans and 15% for Strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same concentrations. Thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the Arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.
TI  - Synthesis, microbicidal activity, and solution structure of the dodecapeptide from bovine neutrophils.
AB  - The dodecapepetide sequence R-L-C-R-I-V-V-I-R-V-C-R with a disulfide bridge between the cysteine residues found in bovine neutrophils was synthesized by solid-phase procedures. Its antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus gordonii was examined, and its structural features were examined by CD and determined by two-dimensional (2D) nmr. The strains P. gingivalis (W50 and 381), A. actinomycetemcomitans (Y4 and 67), S. gordonii (DL1), and S. mutans (GS5) are found to be highly sensitive to this peptide at 2-2.5 microM concentrations, suggesting that the dodecapeptide is a potent antibiotic for oral pathogens. The weak negative n-sigma* band observed at approximately 265-270 nm in the CD spectra of this peptide provides evidence for the presence of a disulfide bridge. The negative n-pi* band at approximately 200 nm and the positive pi-pi* band at 185 nm suggest a folded structure for this peptide. The negative n-pi* shifts from 200 to 206 nm with an increase in intensity in dipalmitoylphosphotidylcholine vesicles, suggesting that the peptide might associate to form higher order aggregates in lipid medium. The assignment of backbone and side-chain proton resonances has been accomplished by the combined analysis of 2D total correlated and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. The temperature dependence of amide NH chemical shifts and (1)H-(2)H exchange effect on amide NH resonances indicate the involvement of amide NH groups of Cys3, Ile5, Ile8, Val10, and Arg12 in intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The coupling constant (J(NH-C(alpha)H)) values, the set of medium-, short-, and long-range nuclear Overhauser effects, and the results of restrained structure calculation using the distance geometry algorithm for nmr applications provide evidence for a folded, loop-like structure with a type I (III) beta-turn involving Ile5, Val6, Val7, and Ile8, and two antiparallel beta-strands involving the N-terminal Arg1, Leu2, Cys3, and Val4 and the C-terminal Arg9, Val10, Cys11, and Arg12 residues. The structure of the dodecapeptide mimics the amphiphilic structure of large 30-35 residue defensins and the peptide appears to exhibit similar antimicrobial potency.
TI  - Periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in Behcet's disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. Recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. The aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with Behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with Behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. Plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. Serum IgG antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. RESULTS: Significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with Behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (P <0.0001). Antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, and Prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with Behcet's disease than in controls (P <0.001-0.05). In contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 compared to controls (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the patients with Behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. Decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to A. actinomycetemcomitans. These results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in Behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.
TI  - The effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  - Susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. We investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. In a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a continuous culture system comprised of Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia. Ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/mL of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic Gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. Ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. For ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. In both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). Although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.
TI  - Effects of hydrogen peroxide on growth and selected properties of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - In this study we first evaluated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on growth and selected properties of Porphyromonas gingivalis, and compared them with those obtained by a reducing agent (cysteine). The growth of P. gingivalis was only moderately affected when H2O2 was added at concentrations up to 30 mM in a complex culture medium. However, when a defined basal medium was used, H2O2 at a concentration of 3 mM completely inhibited growth of P. gingivalis. Incorporation of cysteine at concentrations up to 30 mM in both media had no effect on growth. The effects of H2O2 and cysteine on cell-associated hemagglutinating and Arg-gingipain activities were evaluated using bacteria grown in the complex culture medium. Both activities were strongly decreased when H2O2 was added in the assay mixtures. This inhibitory effect of H2O2 was reversible. On the other hand, including cysteine in the assay mixtures increased both activities. H2O2 and cysteine had no effect on the expression of heat shock protein (HSP)-68 and HSP-75 by P. gingivalis, as determined by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting analysis. In the second part of the study, we tested whether growth of selected oral bacterial species may modify the oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) of the environment. It was found that certain species were able to either decrease (P. gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus mutans) or increase (Streptococcus sanguis) the Eh of the medium. Our study provides evidence that an oxidizing agent such as H2O2 may affect the biology of P. gingivalis. Moreover, growth of some members of the oral microflora can generate oxidizing and reducing conditions, and thus potentially influence the ecology of subgingival sites by affecting strictly anaerobic bacteria such as P. gingivalis.
TI  - The importance of fimbriae in the virulence and ecology of some oral bacteria.
AB  - Cumulative evidence indicates that bacterial adherence to mucosal and tooth surfaces as well as bacterial coaggregation are essential steps for colonization of various oral bacterial species. Bacterial fimbriae have been shown to play an important role in the interaction between bacteria and host cells or among bacterial cells. The properties of fimbriae from selected species of oral bacteria are discussed in terms of virulence traits and ecological significance. Among others, Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae have been most extensively studied. The fimbrial structure is composed of 41-kDa fimbrillin proteins. DNA sequencing of the fimbrillin gene (fimA) from nine strains of P. gingivalis suggests intraspecies variation in the structure of fimA, while retaining common immunochemical specificities. P. gingivalis fimbriae exhibit a wide variety of biological activities including immunogenicity, binding to various host proteins, stimulation of cytokine production and promotion of bone resorption, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans also possesses fimbriae; however, little is known concerning their chemical, genetical, and biological properties. Fimbriae of Prevotella intermedia are shown to induce hemagglutination reaction, while those of Prevotella loescheii are found to cause coaggregation with other bacteria, i.e., Actinomyces viscosus and sanguis streptococci. Fimbriae from gram-positive oral bacteria such as oral Actinomyces and sanguis streptococci are described. These fimbriae may participate in coaggregation, binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite or glycoprotein of the surface layer of oral epithelial cells. Taken together, fimbriae are key components in cell-to-surface and cell-to-cell adherence of oral bacteria and pathogenesis of some oral and systemic diseases.
TI  - Oral microbiota and implant type membranes.
AB  - Candida albicans (Ca), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), Streptococcus sanguis (Ss), Actinomyces naeslundii (An), Actinomyces odontolyticus (Ao), Porphyromona spp (P spp), Candida glabrata (Cg), Candida krusei (Ck), and Rhodotorula spp (R spp) were tested with equal pieces of biodegradable membranes. Membranes pretreated with saliva or clorhexidine and nontreated control membranes were tested in three different culture media containing 0.1 mL homologous suspension for each strain under study. Incubation was performed at 37 degrees C for 48 hours for aerobiosis and for five days for anaerobiosis. Macroscopy and microscopy were carried out. Membranes were removed, washed, and resuspended. Samples were sonicated, and the supernatant was disseminated on brain heart infusion broth or blood agar. Incubation was repeated, colony-forming unit counts were performed, and statistical analysis was carried out using analysis of variance transforming results to Log10 (x + 1), the highest interaction level was used to calculate standard error. Orthogonal contrast was used to compare the different microorganisms under study. Highest adhesion was found with Ca, Cg, Ck, Sa, and Ss. A sufficient quantity of Actinomyces could not be recovered from the membranes. Results with P spp were poor, confirming lower gram-negative adhesion. Replicate flasks with Ss and Ca were cultivated. Membranes were removed after washing and subjected to scanning electron microscopy, as were untreated control pieces. A cavelike surface was observed. Streptococcus sanguis adhering to the membranes showed extracellular projections. Candida and gram-positive cocci showed great recovery capacity.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of a bioactive glass paste on oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bioactive glasses contain oxides of calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and silicon in a proportion that provides the material with surface activity and concomitantly with the property of forming a strong bond with bone. Bioactive glasses have been tested as bone substitutes in different clinical situations. In an aqueous environment, Ca2+, Na+, PO4(3-) , and Si4+ are released from the glass, resulting in a rise in pH and in osmotic pressure in its vicinity. Since these are factors that potentially influence the viability of oral microorganisms at the dentogingival margin, we studied the effects of bioactive glass S53P4 on the oral microorganisms Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguis. This was done by incubating each microbe in a suspension, in the presence of bioactive glass S53P4 in powder form. A. naeslundii was found to lose its viability within 10 min under the experimental conditions. A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and S. mutans lost their viability within 60 min. Also for S. sanguis a significant loss of viability was seen within 60 min, but it was the only microbe that had any viable cells left after 60 min. Thus, in aqueous solutions the powdered bioactive glass S53P4 appears to have a broad antimicrobial effect on microorganisms of both supra- and subgingival plaque. Consequently, it could be useful as an ingredient in tooth-care products that may have beneficial effects on oral health both from a cariologic and a periodontal point of view.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota in healthy, well-maintained elder and periodontitis subjects.
AB  - This investigation compared the site prevalence of 40 subgingival species in 30 periodontally healthy (mean age 36+/-9 years), 35 elders with a well-maintained periodontium (mean age 77+/-5) and 138 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 46+/-11). Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth (up to 28 samples) in the 203 subjects at baseline. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 5003 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. The % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject. Differences in prevalence and levels among groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Commonly detected species, such as Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus oralis did not differ significantly among subject groups. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, 4 species were significantly elevated and at greater prevalence in the periodontitis group. Mean % of sites (+/-SEM) colonized by Bacteroides forsythus was 10+/-3, 12+/-2 and 40+/-2 (p<0.001) for healthy, elder and periodontitis groups respectively. The odds ratio was 14.4:1 that a subject had periodontitis when B. forsythus was detected at > or = 5% of sampled sites. Mean prevalence for Porphyromonas gingivalis in healthy, elder and periodontitis subjects was 4+/-2, 5+/-2 and 23+/-2 respectively (p<0.001); for Treponema denticola 12+/-4, 10+/-3 and 30+/-2 (p<0.001) and for Selenomonas noxia 6+/-2, 7+/-2 and 19+/-2 (p<0.01). Similar differences among subject groups were observed when only sites with PD 0-4 mm were analyzed. The data suggest an etiologic role for B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, T. denticola and S. noxia in adult periodontitis.
TI  - Coronal leakage of obturated root canals after long-term storage using a polymicrobial marker.
AB  - This in vitro study investigated the effect of long-term storage on the coronal leakage of a microbial marker on teeth root filled with lateral condensation of cold gutta-percha and one of two sealers. Sixty single-rooted teeth were prepared chemomechanically to a size 40 master apical file. The teeth were divided into two groups of 20 teeth each and obturated with gutta-percha using either Apexit or Tubliseal EWT sealer. The teeth were stored for 6 months in artificial saliva and tested for leakage using a marker consisting of S. sanguis and P. intermedia. The teeth were checked for bacterial leakage daily for 90 days. All positive control teeth leaked after 24 h, while the negative control teeth remained uncontaminated throughout the test period. Leakage reached the apex through the experimental teeth at the earliest at 17 days and at latest at 88 days. Fifty percent and 70% of the specimens of the Apexit and Tubliseal EWT groups respectively showed leakage at 90 days. There was no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) between the two groups.
TI  - Comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern Cameroon.
AB  - Our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult Cameronians. The aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched Cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction. We also compared cultivation and the Affirm DP test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined and the results were compared statistically. Each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. Results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of the 18 bacterial species. The Gram-positive species Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. Cultivation demonstrated P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared to the checkerboard technique. Furthermore, the Affirm DP test detected P. gingivalis and B. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the Affirm DP test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. Overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the healthy and diseased adult Cameronians were similar to those reported for adults in the West and in some developing countries.
TI  - "Checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  - The present study compared the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect to the following species: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Bacteroides forsythus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans. Species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled DNA probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial test panels. We found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data. If the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. The use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87. The checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. It was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.
TI  - Extracts of Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
AB  - In order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as Escherichia coli on bone formation, clone MC3T3-E1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. The addition of the sonicated extracts from Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. By contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Streptococcus milleri and Streptococcus sanguis, and Escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. The addition of Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. Polymyxin B did not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. The inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kDa eluted from Sephadex G-200 column. The inhibitory substances of Prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results indicate that Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase isoform activities released by human neutrophils in response to dental and periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes which has been used, experimentally, as an indicator of periodontal disease activity when measured in gingival crevicular fluid. There are three myeloperoxidase isoforms: MPO I, MPO II and MPO III. We examined the activities of myeloperoxidase isoforms released by neutrophils in response to serum-opsonized Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Streptococcus sanguis. Isoform activities were determined using intermediate-pressure liquid chromatography and microenzyme assay. A. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated higher levels of myeloperoxidase release than any other oral bacteria unless pre-opsonized with serum (or protein-A-purified immunoglobulin) from an individual with localized juvenile periodontitis. Most oral bacteria stimulated the release of all myeloperoxidase isoforms with a profile enriched in MPO I and diminished in MPO III. Exceptionally, serum-opsonized A. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated myeloperoxidase isoform release in proportion to the neutrophil granule constituency with or without localized juvenile periodontitis serum pre-opsonization. Because myeloperoxidase isoform profiles reflect how neutrophils were stimulated, isoform analysis may refine future diagnostic tests based upon myeloperoxidase.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  - Microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). The study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. In each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (P1, P2, M1, M2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). These teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). A 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with an external sling suture. With oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (A. actinomycetemcomitans, A. viscosus, B. melaninogenicus, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, S. mutans, S. sanguis, Selenomonas sputigena, T. denticola, and T. vincentii) were present. Semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and Pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (P < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. These results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.
TI  - The effect of oral commensal bacteria on candidal adhesion to human buccal epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  - The effect of Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius, Escherichia coli and Porphyromonas gingivalis on the adhesion of Candida albicans and C. krusei to human buccal epithelial cells (BEC) was investigated with a modified membrane filter system. The filters (12 microns diameter pores) acted as a support for the BEC which were pre-exposed to known concentrations of bacterial suspensions (for 45 min-1 h), and then re-incubated with standardised concentrations of yeast suspensions for various periods. The BEC with adherent yeasts were then transferred on to a glass slide, gram-stained and counted by light microscopy. Three of the four bacterial species significantly suppressed adhesion of C. albicans to BEC; S. sanguis had no effect. Both S. sanguis and S. salivarius suppressed adhesion of C. krusei to BEC pre-exposed to three different bacterial concentrations, although variable results were obtained with P. gingivalis and E. coli. Significant differences in the relative adhesion of C. albicans and C. krusei to BEC were also recorded. These results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to BEC is modulated both by the composition and the quantity of the pre-existing bacterial flora on the BEC.
TI  - Effects of sublethal exposure to an antiseptic mouthrinse on representative plaque bacteria.
AB  - Although the mechanism responsible for the clinical antiplaque efficacy of oral antiseptics is generally considered to be primarily one of bactericidal activity, it has been suggested that oral antiseptics may have additional effects on bacteria exposed to sublethal levels. Studies reported herein, investigated the effects of sublethal levels of an essential oil-containing antiseptic mouthrinse (Listerine Antiseptic, Warner-Lambert Co., Morris Plains, NJ) on selected activities of representative plaque microorganisms using in vitro models. These studies demonstrated that sublethal exposure to the tested oral antiseptic can have significant effects in reducing intergeneric coaggregation, increasing bacterial generation time, and extracting endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria. These in vitro activities can be correlated with features of plaque formation and pathogenicity seen in vivo; however, additional studies will be necessary to confirm that these mechanisms are, in fact, operative clinically.
TI  - The effect of oral commensal bacteria on candidal adhesion to denture acrylic surfaces. An in vitro study.
AB  - The effect of four different species of oral bacteria (Streptococci (X 2); Escherichia; Porphyromonas) on the adhesion of Candida albicans and Candida krusei to denture acrylic surfaces was studied using a previously described in vitro adhesion assay. Clear acrylic strips immersed in known concentrations of bacterial suspensions and incubated for 45 min to 1 h, at 37 degrees C, were transferred to yeast suspensions of known concentrations and incubated for a similar period, and the adherent yeasts were quantified using an image analysis system. Pre-exposure to different bacterial concentrations resulted in suppression of candidal adhesion to varying degrees. Of three selected concentrations, exposure to the highest bacterial concentration (10(6) organisms/ml) resulted in a consistent reduction in candidal adhesion, except for E. coli-C. albicans and S. salivarius-C. albicans combinations. Candidal adhesion was significantly reduced on pre-exposure to S. sanguis and P. gingivalis, but not E. coli. There were also significant differences in relative adhesion between C. albicans and C. krusei. Taken together, these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to acrylic strips is modulated both by the quantity and the quality of pre-existing bacterial flora on acrylic surfaces.
TI  - Effect of titanium on selected oral bacterial species in vitro.
AB  - Titanium granules were tested for their antibacterial effect on strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Fusobacterium spp. and Prevotella intermedia in comparison with amalgam and two of its components, copper and tin. Glass beads were used as controls. The number of viable bacteria was estimated in samples exposed to the various materials for 1, 3, 6 and 24 h, respectively, and the viable counts were related to the baseline value. Titanium showed low antibacterial effect on the species tested. Copper and amalgam showed an expressed toxicity to all species and differed significantly from titanium and glass particles. Gram positive Streptococcus spp. and A. naeslundii showed a lower susceptibility to the metals than the Gram negative species. The antibacterial effect of copper and amalgam test particles on S. sanguis and P. intermedia was significantly decreased in the presence of serum. This study showed that some metals have a toxic effect in vitro on oral bacteria, a fact that may play a role in plaque formation when these materials are used for dental restorations. Titanium did not have a similar antibacterial effect.
TI  - Studies into the microbial spectrum of apical periodontitis.
AB  - This study examined the variety of obligate and facultative anaerobic bacterial species recovered from cases of acute apical periodontitis. A total of 19 root canal samples and 24 periapical granuloma samples were taken from patients suffering pain and discomfort. Bacteria were identified by applying the following techniques: culturing on various media, Gram-staining and using commercially available biochemical test strips. In addition, Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas endodontalis were differentiated on a molecular genetic level using species-specific oligodeoxynucleotide probes. The most frequently identified bacteria were Prevotella intermedia, Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus milleri-group and Bacteroides spp. Obligate anaerobes occurred at a rate of 82.3%, and the average number of isolates was 6.4 per sample.
TI  - Characterization of inhibitory effects of suspected periodontopathogens on osteogenesis in vitro.
AB  - By using an in vitro bone-forming culture system, the chick periosteal osteogenesis (CPO) model, the direct effects on osteogenesis of sonicated extracts derived from oral bacteria were examined. Both extracts from bacterial species having strong associations with periodontal diseases (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Prevotella intermedia, hereinafter referred to as suspected periodontopathogens) and extracts from species not correlated with periodontal disease (Streptococcus sanguis, Veillonella atypica, and Prevotella denticola, hereinafter referred to as nonpathogenic bacteria) were tested. All bacterial cultures were grown under standard anaerobic culture conditions. Sonicated bacterial extracts were prepared from the bacterial pellet. These were added in various proportions to the CPO cultures. Parameters of osteogenesis, including alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium and P(i) accumulation, and collagen synthesis, were measured in 6-day-old cultures. Compared with controls grown in the absence of bacterial products, osteogenesis was inhibited significantly in cultures treated with extracts derived from the suspected periodontopathogens. No osteogenic inhibition was observed in cultures treated with extracts from the nonpathogenic bacteria. These results suggest that the ability to inhibit osteogenesis in vitro may be a pathogenic property shared by a limited group of species. Further characterization of the P. gingivalis extracts revealed that both proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous products, including lipopolysaccharide, were able to inhibit osteogenesis. P. gingivalis extract-mediated inhibition of osteogenesis in CPO cultures was blocked by indomethacin, implicating prostaglandins in the regulation of the bacterial effects. The bacterial extracts had either reversible or irreversible inhibitory effects on osteogenesis when added after differentiation or before/during differentiation of bone cells, respectively.
TI  - Bacteremia in conjunction with endodontic therapy.
AB  - This study characterizes oral microorganisms believed to have spread from the root canal into the blood stream during and after endodontic therapy of teeth with Asymptomatic apical periodontitis. Microbiological samples were taken under aseptic conditions from the root canal of 26 single-rooted teeth in 26 patients. In the endodontic treatment of 13 of the patients (Group 1), the first 3 reamers, sizes 15, 20 and 25, were used to a level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. In the other 13 patients (Group 2), the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. Blood samples were taken from the patients during the instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. Anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from all root canals. In 7 patients of Group 1, Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were recovered from the blood. In 4 patients of Group 2, P. intermedia, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius and Streptococcus sanguis were isolated from the blood. Biochemical tests and antibiograms revealed that the isolates from the root canal and blood had identical profiles within the patients, strongly suggesting that the microorganisms isolated from the blood had the root canal as their source.
TI  - Delmopinol interactions with cell walls of gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  - The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of delmopinol hydrochloride on the cell surface morphology of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells by using transmission electron microscopy. A second purpose was to evaluate the extraction of cell wall material caused by delmopinol and the binding of radiolabelled delmopinol to the various strains. Fresh isolates and type strains of gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and strains of the gram-positive streptococci Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius, were exposed to 3.2 mM (0.1%) or 6.4 mM (0.2%) delmopinol hydrochloride from 1 to 90 min. For electron microscopy the cells were fixed and negatively contrast-stained. Treatment with 6.4 mM delmopinol for 1 min resulted in marked ultrastructural changes of cell wall components and the outer cell membrane of the 3 gram-negative species compared with control cells, whereas the gram-positive streptococci treated with delmopinol showed little or no morphologic alteration as compared with untreated cells. The result from the electron microscopy was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins released from bacterial cells treated as for electron microscopy. More material was extracted from the gram-negative rods than from the gram-positive cocci. Significantly more delmopinol bound to the gram-negative rods than to the streptococci. It appears that the amphiphilic properties of delmopinol make gram-negative rods more vulnerable to delmopinol than gram-positive streptococci.
TI  - Bacterial-stimulated cytokine production of peripheral mononuclear cells from patients of various periodontitis categories.
AB  - Periodontitis is a general term for disease categories, including juvenile periodontitis (JP), rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP), and adult periodontitis (AP), which may or may not share a common etiology and pathogenesis. These disease categories are characterized by differences in progression of tissue destruction and differences in age group susceptibility, but not, to our knowledge, by differences in cytokine responses of inflammatory cells. The present study examined blood cell counts and interindividual variation in the ability of PBMC of patients in three different categories of periodontitis to produce cytokines after stimulation with different oral bacterial species in vitro. The AP group had a significantly lower production of IL-1ra when stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g.) and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) (P < 0.05). Streptococcus sanguis (S.s.), which is associated with normal periodontal conditions, induced extremely high levels of IL-1 alpha and TNF alpha production in all groups. The RPP group had a significantly higher number of monocytes (MC) than the AP group (P < 0.05). Additionally, JP patients had a significantly higher concentration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes compared to juvenile controls (P < 0.05). In conclusion, IL-1 alpha, TNF alpha, or IL-6 production by peripheral blood MC after in vitro stimulation with oral bacterial type stains may not distinguish different categories of periodontitis. The results support the hypothesis that the cytokine IL-1ra is produced in different concentrations in the two groups: RPP and AP. Furthermore, elevated MC concentration in the RPP group compared to the AP group may be an important pathogenic feature in RPP.
TI  - Oral bacterial attachment to titanium surfaces: a scanning electron microscopy study.
AB  - Despite the wide use of dental implants, the understanding of the mechanism(s) of bacterial attachment to implant surfaces and of the factors that affect such attachment is limited. In this study, the attachment of oral bacteria--including Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis--to titanium (Ti) discs with different surface morphology (smooth, grooved, or rough) was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The most bacterial attachment was observed on the rough BSA-coated Ti surfaces. The smooth surfaces promoted poor attachment for S. sanguis and A. viscosus. However, P. gingivalis attached equally well to both the smooth and grooved coated Ti surfaces, based on direct cell quantitation and examination with SEM. Cell-surface fimbriae (which may play a role in adhesion) of both A. viscosus and P. gingivalis observed were associated with the Ti surfaces. Ti implant surface characteristics appeared to influence oral bacterial attachment in vitro. The in vitro attachment system has proven its usefulness for future bacterial attachment studies with model implant surfaces.
TI  - Effect of binding of fibrinogen to each bacterium on coaggregation between Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus oralis.
AB  - Fibrinogen inhibits the coaggregation between Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus oralis. In this study, we determined which bacterium interacts with fibrinogen in this inhibitory process. Although preincubation of each bacterium with fibrinogen did not inhibit coaggregation, its activity was completely eliminated by the addition of protease inhibitors such as N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate and N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone to the preincubation mixture with fibrinogen and P. gingivalis. However, the inhibition of coaggregation was not found after preincubation of S. oralis with fibrinogen in the presence or absence of the protease inhibitors. Labelled materials were recovered from the extract of P. gingivalis cells incubated with radioiodinated fibrinogen in the presence of NEM but not in the absence of NEM. In the binding experiment, P. gingivalis showed a much higher binding activity to fibrinogen than S. oralis. These findings suggest that fibrinogen and its fragment(s) may mask directly or indirectly the aggregation site with S. oralis on the P. gingivalis cells in its inhibitory process of coaggregation.
TI  - Short-term microbiological and clinical effects of subgingival irrigation with an antimicrobial mouthrinse.
AB  - Fifty chronic adult periodontitis patients completed a 6-week controlled, double-blind, split mouth clinical study to determine the effects of subgingival irrigation with an antimicrobial mouthrinse on periodontal microflora, supragingival plaque, and gingivitis when used as an adjunct to normal oral hygiene. Qualifying subjects had at least four sites, two on each side of the mouth, with probing depths between 4 and 6 mm, which bled on gentle probing. Following baseline examinations, subjects received a half mouth scaling and prophylaxis and full mouth subgingival irrigation with either the antimicrobial mouthrinse or sterile colored water control professionally delivered. Subjects continued irrigation at home once daily for 42 days with their assigned rinse delivered via a subgingival delivery system. All sites in the mouth were scored at baseline and at day 42 for supragingival plaque, bleeding on probing, and redness. For the four selected periodontitis sites, probing depth and attachment level were measured at baseline and on day 42; additionally, supragingival plaque and gingival redness were scored on days 7 and 21. Subgingival plaque samples for microbiological analysis were harvested from the selected periodontal sites at baseline and on days 7, 21, and 42. Microbiologically, irrigation with the antimicrobial mouthrinse resulted in statistically significant reductions compared to control in putative periodontopathogens, including black pigmenting species, which persisted at 42 days. Clinically, subgingival irrigation with the antimicrobial mouthrinse produced a significant reduction in supragingival plaque (P < 0.001), bleeding on probing (P = 0.019), and redness (P = 0.017) compared to the control, whether or not the area irrigated received a prophylaxis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Involvement of Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae in adherence to Streptococcus gordonii.
AB  - Adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis to early plaque bacteria, such as Streptococcus gordonii, is considered an important colonization mechanism. The molecules that mediate this interspecies binding have not been determined. Fimbriae were prepared from P. gingivalis 33277 by mild agitation, ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. In a nitrocellulose blot adherence assay, purified fimbriae inhibited S. gordonii G9B-P. gingivalis 33277 binding by up to 54%. In addition, fimbriae bound to S. gordonii cells in a dot-blot assay. Incubation of fimbriae with S. gordonii cells followed by washing, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), electroblotting and probing with P. gingivalis antibodies also revealed that the fimbriae bind to S. gordonii. In contrast, S. gordonii did not interact with fimbriae that were first subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotting or deposited on a nitrocellulose membrane, suggesting that conformational determinants of the fimbriae may be important in binding. The results indicate that binding between P. gingivalis and S. gordonii is mediated, at least in part, by the porphyromonads' fimbriae.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of Prevention mouthrinse.
AB  - Prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. To determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. A spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Serratia marcescens and Candida albicans. Microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. Inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. MIC determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to Prevention mouthrinse, with MICs ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold dilutions. Bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. Brief (5-minute) exposure of S. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. Under the constraints of this type of study, Prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. We support the notion that Prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. A 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of Prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.
TI  - In vitro study of the penetration of three bacterial strains into root dentine.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess in vitro migration of the following three bacterial species into dentinal tubules: Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii and Prevotella intermedia. Twenty-seven bovine incisors were randomly divided into three groups. Only the root dentin was used for the experiment. Within each group, the nine incisors were sectioned into 36 dentin blocks that were incubated with one of the tested bacterial suspensions. Twelve samples were taken after 10, 20, and 28 days. Half the samples were observed with scanning electron microscopy and the others with light microscopy after standard histologic procedures, and the depth of bacterial penetration was measured. Analysis of the examinations showed that whatever the technique used, only one strain on this experimental model migrated into dentinal tubules. S. sanguis was observed at a depth of 792 microns, but no migration was observed for either A.naeslundii or P.intermedia. The differences in migration of the bacteria tested appear to be related to their morphologic factors and cellular arrangement.
TI  - Serum immunoglobulin G antibodies to Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus sanguis during experimental gingivitis in young adults.
AB  - Twenty-eight young, healthy adults completed an experimental gingivitis study in  which blood and clinical recordings were obtained at baseline; after a 4-week period of thorough oral hygiene; after a subsequent 3-week period of plaque accumulation; and after another 2 weeks of thorough oral hygiene. Serum immunoglobulin G antibodies against whole cells of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus sanguis were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mean serum immunoglobulin G antibody levels to P. intermedia, F. nucleatum and S. sanguis remained essentially constant during the experiment, whereas the immunoglobulin G antibodies to P. gingivalis declined during the initial period of oral hygiene and the subsequent period of plaque accumulation to an average of 84.5% of the baseline value. This reduction could be attributed to the people who developed marked gingival inflammation during the period of plaque accumulation, indicating that the systemic host response may be associated with local tissue responses to variations in oral hygiene. These people were, however, also characterized by higher initial serum immunoglobulin G responses to P. gingivalis than people who developed less pronounced gingival inflammation during the experiment. The variability and individuality noted in the host response to potential pathogens have important implications for attempts to use such measures for establishing a diagnosis or prognosis for the individual patient.
TI  - Agglutination of Streptococcus mutans serotype C cells but inhibition of Porphyromonas gingivalis autoaggregation by human lactoferrin.
AB  - The ability of various forms of human lactoferrin (LF) to agglutinate oral Streptococcus mutans, Strep. sobrinus, Strep. rattus, Strep. sanguis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells was studied spectrophotometrically. Fe3+ saturated LF was unable to agglutinate these bacteria, whereas iron-free LF (apo LF) effectively agglutinated Strep. mutans cells but not the other bacteria. The efficiency and rate of agglutination of Strep. mutans were somewhat lower with apo LF than with human whole saliva. However, secretory IgA, phosphate and whole saliva almost totally abolished the apo LF-mediated agglutination of Strep. mutans, suggesting binding to the same target sites on bacterial cell surfaces, or to each other. The presence of exogenous iron (Fe2+, Fe3+), lactoperoxidase or serum albumin did not affect the agglutination by apo LF. Low Ca2+ (50-100 microns) slightly enhanced the agglutination by apo LF but higher concentrations (0.5-1.0 mM) totally blocked the apo LF-mediated agglutination of Strep. mutans. Both saliva and apo LF significantly delayed the rapid autoaggregation of P. gingivalis cells. Aggregation of P. gingivalis is considered a potential virulence factor and a protective mechanism against the host's cellular defences in the gingival crevice. These findings show a novel, strain-specific antibacterial mechanism for LF against Strep. mutans and P. gingivalis and adds a new compound to the group of agglutinating proteins in human saliva.
TI  - The effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of Triclosan and zinc citrate. The inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/L Triclosan and 39.8 mumol/L zinc citrate. When dosed, Triclosan inhibited A. viscosus and all five Gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. Similar effects were seen when Triclosan was pulsed, except that S. mutans was the most sensitive Gram-positive species and V. dispar was unaffected. However, when the inhibitors were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against Gram-negative species, although S. gordonii and S. oralis were relatively unaffected. The data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.
TI  - Development and characterization of Porphyromonas gingivalis-specific rat T-cell  clones.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as a major pathogen in periodontitis. To determine the role of T cells in the regulation of this disease, a method was developed for the generation and characterization of rat T-cell clones with antigen specificity to P. gingivalis whole cells. The clones studied so far demonstrated a T-helper (Th) phenotype W3/13+, W3/25+, OX8- and OX22-. These T-cell clones proliferated in vitro in response to P. gingivalis, but not to other bacteria (Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Wolinella recta, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sanguis). Limiting dilution analysis showed W3/25+, OX8- T cells preferentially respond to P. gingivalis, rather than W3/25-, OX8+ T cells. P. gingivalis-reactive W3/25+ T cells belonged to the OX22- population, suggesting that the OX22- T cells may represent memory cells. All clones tested produced interferon gamma, but not interleukin 2. The cloned T-cell F1 significantly enhanced P. gingivalis-specific antibody production (p < 0.03). The availability of these cloned T cells should bring new insight into the mechanism by which T cells regulate oral health and periodontal disease.
TI  - Sensitization of oral bacteria in biofilms to killing by light from a low-power laser.
AB  - Biofilms of Streptococcus sanguis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were prepared on the surfaces of agar plates and a number of compounds were screened for their ability to sensitize bacteria in these biofilms to killing by light from a 7.3 mW Helium/Neon (He/Ne) laser. Toluidine blue O and methylene blue enabled detectable killing of all four target organisms after exposure to He/Ne light for 30 s. Aluminium disulphonated phthalocyanine, haematoporphyrin HCl and haematoporphyrin ester were effective photosensitizers of only some of the target organisms. These findings suggest that lethal photosensitization may be an effective means of eliminating periodontopathogenic bacteria from dental plaque.
TI  - Periodontal bone loss in Porphyromonas gingivalis-infected specific pathogen-free rats after preinoculation with endogenous Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria dominate in periodontitis locations, while Gram-positive bacteria characterize healthy sites. A well-established Gram-positive flora might therefore inhibit the colonization of Gram-negative pathogens. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine whether endogenous S. sanguis could prevent, or reduce, periodontal bone loss in rats infected with a virulent P. gingivalis strain. Sixty specific pathogen-free Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups. Doxycycline was administered in the drinking water for 2 weeks to the groups A, B, C, and D to suppress the preexisting microflora in the mouth. Rats in groups A and C were subsequently inoculated with an S. sanguis strain, isolated from one of the rats, once a day for 5 d. Infection with P. gingivalis 381 was then carried out for 5 d in groups A, B, and E. Group F was not treated with doxycycline nor infected with bacteria and served as untreated control. Six weeks after the P. gingivalis inoculation, the rats were killed. Periodontal bone levels were assessed radiographically and morphometrically, and serum antibody against P. gingivalis 381 was determined by a fluorescence immunoassay. Periodontal bone support, determined radiographically, was reduced in group B (doxycycline-treated, P. gingivalis-inoculated) compared with the other groups. In contrast, the morphometric determination showed no differences between the groups. In group B antibody levels against two different P. gingivalis 381 cell surface antigens were significantly elevated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of gels containing stannous fluoride on oral bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  - The purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of (1) twelve 0.4 per cent stannous fluoride (SnF2) commercial products and (2) different concentrations of SnF2 (range = 0.02 to 3.28 per cent). The antibacterial inhibitory effect of various SnF2 gels was evaluated as to their effectiveness against oral plaque bacteria including strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, A. viscosus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and B. intermedius. When twelve different commercial preparations of 0.4 per cent SnF2 were compared for inhibitory effect on plaque bacteria, several of the SnF2 preparations were significantly more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria (p < 0.05). With increasing concentration of SnF2, there was a comparable increase in the inhibitory effect on the oral bacteria tested (r2 ranged from 0.867 to 0.996). SnF2 at a concentration of 0.4 per cent had a similar antibacterial effect to 0.12 per cent chlorhexidine. This in vitro study demonstrated that certain SnF2 products are highly effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in plaque, and this inhibitory effect is directly related to the concentration of the SnF2.
TI  - Characterization of the adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis to oral streptococci.
AB  - Adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis to strains of Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis deposited on nitrocellulose paper was investigated. A variety of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of P. gingivalis bound to both S. sanguis and S. mitis. Binding of P. gingivalis to all but one of the streptococci was not inhibited by salivary molecules. Pretreatment of P. gingivalis with periodate and pretreatment of S. sanguis and S. mitis with pronase decreased binding, suggesting that adherence may be mediated by a protein on the streptococci interacting with a carbohydrate on P. gingivalis. Binding was not inhibited by a selection of simple sugars. The ability to adhere to early plaque bacteria such as S. sanguis and S. mitis may be important in the colonization of the mouth by P. gingivalis.
TI  - Subgingival temperature (III). Relation to microbial counts.
AB  - The present investigation examined the relationship of selected bacterial species and subgingival temperature. 35 subjects were measured at 6 sites per tooth for clinical parameters and subgingival temperature. Measurements were repeated for 21 subjects at 2 month intervals providing a total of 66 subjects visits. At each visit, subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non-selective media. After anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes. Species enumerated were; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes a and b, B. forsythus, B. gingivalis, B. intermedius I and II, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum ss. vincentii, P. micros, S. intermedius, S. sanguis I and II, V. parvula and W. recta. Total viable counts and counts of Capnocytophaga sp. were determined directly from the primary isolation plates. A total of 1581 samples were evaluated. Subject visits with higher mean subgingival temperatures had significantly higher mean %s of B. intermedius I and P. micros, and lower mean %s of Capnocytophaga sp. Sites with higher subgingival temperatures had elevated proportions of B. intermedius I and II, A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a and B. gingivalis more frequently than sites with lower temperatures, while Capnocytophaga sp. were elevated more often at cooler sites. 43 of the subject visits had follow up attachment level measurements at 2 months. The 1026 microbial samples and the subgingival temperature measurements from these visits were related to longitudinal attachment change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Modulation of human neutrophil adherence by oral bacteria.
AB  - Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) comprise over 90 per cent of leukocytes in the oral cavity. Although these phagocytic cells have primary defence roles in the gingiva, their stimulation by micro-organisms may also cause substantial tissue damage due to the release of lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals. Adherence of PMNs to the endothelium and their subsequent diapedesis and egress to areas of infection are considered early vital events in the inflammatory process. In this study, oral bacteria were screened to determine their direct effects on PMN activation using an in vitro method of measuring PMN adherence to Dacron fibres. Most of the bacteria investigated increased PMN adherence, indicating their potential to cause tissue damage through the release of PMN lysosomal enzymes and other products. In contrast, Bacteroides species suppressed PMNs, indicating their ability to circumvent the phagocytic cells, thus gaining a potential advantage in dental colonization. The modulatory effects of oral bacteria on PMN activation may have significant roles in the immunopathogenesis of oral disease.
TI  - Isolation and properties of the Capnocytophaga ochracea bacteriocin.
AB  - A bacteriocin from a subgingival plaque isolate of Capnocytophaga ochracea was purified and characterized. It was isolated from cell extract and had a molecular weight of 100,000. Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Propionibacterium acnes were susceptible to the bacteriocin.
TI  - Microbiology of healthy and diseased periodontal sites in poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetics.
AB  - A group of poorly-controlled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients  were examined in a cross-sectional design for total microbial levels, microbial incidence, and the percent levels of selected periodontal microorganisms. These organisms were selected on the basis of prior reports that associated them with either periodontal disease or health. One periodontally-healthy and one periodontally-diseased site were examined in each IDDM patient. Increased levels of the periodontal pathogens Prevotella intermedia, P. melaninogenica spp., Bacteroides gracilis, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Campylobacter rectus (formerly Wolinella recta) were found at the periodontal diseased sites. Increased prevalence of the organisms P. intermedia, P. melaninogenica spp., and C. rectus were found at the diseased sites. A significantly higher percentage of P. intermedia was found at the sites exhibiting deep pockets and attachment loss.
TI  - Enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  - This study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and DNA probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. Fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on Trypticase soy agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Colonies of reference strains were lifted onto Nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial DNA to the filters. Positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. Cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of Streptococcus mitis reacted with the probe to Streptococcus sanguis II. Subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of 26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. Samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees C. Colonies were lifted as described above. Filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes. The probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. The colony lift method and DNA probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. In addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.
TI  - The use of DNA probes to examine the distribution of subgingival species in subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction.
AB  - The present investigation examined the distribution of 14 subgingival species at  a total of 2299 sites in 90 subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction. Subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non selective media. After anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxygenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes. The mean total viable count for all sites in all subjects was 8.3 x 10(6). The probes accounted for an average of 27.8% of the total viable count. The % of subjects in which each species was detected was as follows; V. parvula, 98; B. intermedius I, 98; S. sanguis II, 96; B. intermedius II, 95; C. ochracea, 94; B. gingivalis, 91; S. sanguis I, 85; W. recta, 83; F. nucleatum ss. vincentii, 82; S. intermedius, 80; B. forsythus, 76; P. micros, 74; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a, 62 and A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, 52. The % of sites colonized by each of the 14 test species varied considerably within different subjects. The median number of sites colonized by different species ranged from 3.6% for A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b to 43.5% for V. parvula. In half the subjects, the mean % of the total viable counts for each of the test species was less than 4%. When subjects were divided on the basis of % of sites at baseline with greater than 3 mm attachment loss, the 14 probes accounted for 29.9% of the microbiota in the localized disease group and 25% in the widespread disease group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  - The effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish Cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (ADT-test in vitro). As positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. The test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one Candida strain. The positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. No antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. Toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against S. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. The results from this study support earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. The possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.
TI  - Effect of calcium ions on cell surface electrostatics of Bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria.
AB  - Surface electrostatics of Bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria were examined. A polarization circuit was employed using platinum electrodes exposed in each bacterial suspension and the number of bacteria adsorbed to the anode and cathode were then estimated. In all bacteria (B. gingivalis, Streptococcus sobrinus, S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus), the number of cells adsorbed to the anode were much greater than the number of cells adsorbed to the cathode. Treating these bacteria with calcium ions tended to decrease the ratio of the number of cells adsorbed to the anode to the number of cells adsorbed to the cathode in all bacteria examined. Moreover, in the case of B. gingivalis, the number of cells adsorbed to the anode and cathode was in an inverse relationship to the number counted before calcium ion treatment. These findings indicate that the cell surfaces of oral bacteria are generally negatively charged but only the cell surface electrostatics of B. gingivalis was dramatically affected by calcium ion treatment. Thus, divalent metal bridges such as calcium bridges contribute to the adherence of the periodontopathic bacterium, B. gingivalis rather than to that of other oral bacteria including cariogenic bacteria.
TI  - Adherence of Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis to Streptococcus sanguis in vitro.
AB  - Intergeneric bacterial adherence is responsible for the complexity of the microbiota in human dental plaque and is believed to enable some extraneous bacteria to initially colonize the human oral cavity. Some current evidence indicates that Streptococcus sanguis, an early colonizer of teeth, enhances subsequent colonization by Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis, a bacterium associated with advanced adult periodontitis. In this study, selected strains of P. gingivalis and S. sanguis were tested for their adherence activities in vitro. A differential filtration assay was devised in which one member of the test pair was radiolabeled. Heterogeneous aggregates that formed in mixed suspensions were collected on polycarbonate filters (8-microns pore size) and were washed free of individual bacteria and small homologous clumps. P. gingivalis 381, W50, JKG7, and 33277 adhered to S. sanguis G9B, M5, Challis 6, and 38. P. gingivalis A7A1-28 did not adhere well to S. sanguis under these conditions. More precise measurements of intergeneric adherence were obtained with an alternative assay with radiolabeled P. gingivalis and an artificial dental plaque composed of S. sanguis coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated agarose beads. CNBr-agarose was selected as the supporting matrix for the plaque because it was uniformly and permanently coated with S. sanguis and because P. gingivalis had negligible adherence activity for streptococcus-free beads. P. gingivalis W50 grown to the early stationary phase adhered to S. sanguis-coated beads in higher numbers than either midlogarithmic- or late-stationary-phase cells. Intergeneric adherence was not inhibited or reversed by the presence of lactose or other monosaccharides or disaccharides. Pretreatment of either bacterium with trypsin or proteinase K reduced subsequent adherence by 86 to 100%. Neuraminidase treatment of P. gingivalis caused 98% reduction of adherence, whereas similar treatment of S. sanguis caused only a 2% loss. Preincubation of P. gingivalis at 60 degrees C for 30 min decreased subsequent adherence to S. sanguis-coated beads by 94%. Adherence was reduced by 96% when bacteria were assayed while suspended in human whole saliva or when pretreated with saliva and subsequently assayed in buffer. The concentration of whole human saliva required to inhibit 50% adherence in this assay was 23 micrograms per ml (1:200 dilution). Suspension of the bacteria in normal rabbit serum resulted in 94% inhibition of adherence. These data indicate that saliva and serum may be important host defense factors for controlling Porphyromonas-Streptococcus adherence.
TI  - In vitro survival of Bacteroides intermedius in five transport media, alone or in the presence of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The survival rate of Bacteroides intermedius was first tested in monoculture, and Streptococcus sanguis was then added in 5 different transport media; 2 nonnutritious media, the viability-preserving medium of the University of Goteborg No. IV (VMG IV), reduced transport fluid (RTF), and 3 nutritious media, thioglycolate medium (TG), peptone yeast extract medium (PY) and PY medium with 1% glucose (PYG). All manipulations were carried out in an anaerobic chamber. After a given transport time (6 or 24 h) aliquots were spread on plates containing solid PY medium by means of an automated spiral system device, thus permitting counts after incubation. The slight variations in the counts of B. intermedius in monoculture, not exceeding 0.5 log10 in the 5 media tested, indicated its good survival capability, i.e. at least 24 h. By contrast, when S. sanguis was added, it was only possible to use nutritious media such as PY or TG for 6 h. In the glocose-containing media (PYG, TG), the multiplication of rapidly glucose-fermenting microorganisms such as streptococci influenced the B. intermedius survival rate. Therefore, the transport time for oral microbiological samples needs to be reduced as much as possible. The use of excessively rich media (particularly media containing a high level of glucose) should be avoided.
TI  - Studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  - Two unique forms of periodontal disease, HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis, have been described in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in AIDS patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 AIDS patients with periodontitis. The presence of putative periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly B. gingivalis), and Wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 AIDS patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. Of 666 bacterial strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, Streptococcus sanguis II was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), Actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. Enteric species including Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium difficle as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. Immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, and P. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four times more periodontitis patients demonstrated W. recta. Subgingival yeast was a frequent finding in these AIDS patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. This study indicates that subgingival plaque in AIDS patients with periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-HIV infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - Structure of a streptococcal adhesin carbohydrate receptor.
AB  - Interactions between complementary protein and carbohydrate structures on different genera of human oral bacteria have been implicated in the formation of dental plaque. The carbohydrate receptor on Streptococcus sanguis H1 (one of the primary colonizing species) that is specific for the adhesin on Capnocytophaga ochracea ATCC 33596 (a secondary colonizer) has been isolated from the streptococcal cell wall, purified, and structurally characterized. The hexasaccharide repeating unit of the polysaccharide was purified by reverse-phase, amino-bonded silica, and gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography. Earlier studies established that the repeating unit was a hexasaccharide composed of rhamnose, galactose, and glucose in the ration of 2:3:1, respectively. In the present study, determination of absolute configuration by gas chromatography of the trimethylsilyl (+)-2-butyl glycosides revealed that the rhamnose residues were of the L configuration while the hexoses were all D. 252Californium plasma desorption mass spectrometry of the native, the acetylated and the reduced and acetylated hexasaccharide determined that the molecular mass of the native hexasaccharide was 959, and that the 2 rhamnose residues were linked to each other at the nonreducing terminus of the linear molecule. Methylation analysis revealed the positions of the glycosidic linkages in the hexasaccharide and showed that a galactose residue was present at the reducing end. The structural characterization of the hexasaccharide was completed by one and two dimensional 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Complete 1H and 13C assignments for each glycosyl residue were established by two-dimensional (1H,1H) correlation spectroscopy, homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn, and (13C,1H) correlation experiments. The configurations of the glycosidic linkages were inferred from the chemical shifts and coupling constants of the anomeric 1H and 13C resonances. The sequence of the glycosyl residues was determined by a heteronuclear multiple bond correlation experiment. These data show that the structure of the hexasaccharide repeating unit derived from the cell wall polysaccharide of S. sanguis H1 is: alpha-L-Rhap-(1----2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1----3)-alpha-D-Galp- (1----3)-beta-D-Galp-(1----4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1----3)-alpha/beta-D-Gal.
TI  - Selective modulation of bacterial attachment to oral epithelial cells by enzyme activities associated with poor oral hygiene.
AB  - The present investigation explored the hypothesis that elevated levels of certain enzymes in the gingival crevicular environment of individuals with poor oral hygiene and/or gingival inflammation may modify the surfaces of epithelial cells and thereby modulate the types of bacteria which attach and colonize. Buccal epithelial cells treated with neuraminidase and certain proteases were used as a model for study. Bacteria studied included Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitis which have been associated with gingival health, Actinomyces species which are increased in plaque associated with developing gingivitis, and Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans which are associated with destructive periodontal diseases. Treatment of epithelial cells with the enzymes studied produced selective effects on their receptivity for bacteria. Neuraminidase treatment of epithelial cells greatly reduced the attachment of all strains of S. sanguis and S. mitis studied. In contrast, the number of Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii and A. israelii cells which attached was significantly increased. Neuraminidase treatment also appeared to enhance attachment of B. intermedius and B. gingivalis. Treatment of buccal cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin or papain also selectively affected bacterial attachment. Such protease treatment greatly reduced the numbers of streptococci and A. viscosus cells which attached, while the numbers of B. gingivalis and B. intermedius were significantly increased. Treatment of epithelial cells with preparations of lysosomal enzymes derived from human PMNs produced similar selective effects. The changes in bacterial adhesion observed by the enzyme treatments studied are consistent with the shifts in the composition of the gingival crevice flora which occur when oral hygiene is terminated and gingivitis develops.
TI  - Some aspects of protease production by a strain of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Our previous studies indicated that Arginine (Arg) plays a key nutritional role in Streptococcus sanguis P4A7 and that this organism can grow on whole casein as the sole nitrogen source. Its protease activities were therefore studied after glucose-limited continuous culture in a chemically-defined medium with either free amino acids or casein as the nitrogen source. Both culture supernatant and cell-associated endopeptidase (EP) and exopeptidase (amino-AP and carboxy-CP) activities were determined. Growth rate (mu) had little effect on EP, 75% of which was consistently in culture supernatants; AP and CP both decreased as mu was increased and both were predominantly cell-associated. At high growth pH, EP was substantially increased while AP and CP activities were optimal at pH 7. The most striking nutritional effect occurred under nitrogen limitation (glucose excess) when EP and AP were greatly increased and CP greatly decreased. It was concluded that S. sanguis is well equipped to scavenge its environment for Arg under a wide range of growth conditions.
TI  - Identification of the rhamnose-sensitive adhesin of Capnocytophaga ochracea ATCC  33596.
AB  - The coaggregation of the Gram-negative microorganism Capnocytophaga ochracea ATCC 33596 with several Gram-positive bacteria, including streptococci, actinomyces and rothia, is mediated by rhamnose-sensitive adhesin(s). In the present study, MAbs against the C. ochracea adhesin(s) were prepared. These antibodies inhibited all the rhamnose-sensitive interactions, indicating that they recognize epitopes at or near the rhamnose binding site of the adhesin. The monoclonals served as probes in immunoblot analysis and recognized a polypeptide of Mr 155 K present in the wild-type organism but absent in a coaggregation defective mutant. It is concluded that the rhamnose-sensitive interactions of C. ochracea are mediated by a 155 K Mr polypeptide present on its outer surface.
TI  - Bacteroides gingivalis vesicles mediate attachment of streptococci to serum-coated hydroxyapatite.
AB  - Outer membrane vesicles purified from Bacteroides gingivalis culture supernatant  bound to serum coated hydroxyapatite (SeHA). The immobilized vesicles served as receptors for a number of species of oral streptococci. The binding of Streptococcus sanguis 12 to SeHA was increased 10 times by the vesicles. Vesicle-associated binding increased proportionally with an increase in the number of bound vesicles. Arginine and lactose both partially reduced binding of S. sanguis. Heating the vesicles destroyed their binding ability whereas heating S. sanguis reduced but did not eliminate vesicle-mediated binding.
TI  - Relationship of subgingival plaque flora to lysosomal and cytoplasmic enzyme activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  - Examining the relationships among indicators of the acute inflammatory response in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and specific bacterial species in subgingival plaque may provide indications of which bacterial species or groups of species may be associated with potentially destructive host-derived processes. Here we report on the relationship of the subgingival plaque flora to the activity of mammalian forms of the enzymes beta-glucuronidase (beta G), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and arylsulfatase (AS) in GCF from a total of 54 4-6 mm periodontal sites from 13 periodontitis patients. Sites were scored for probing depth (PD) and bleeding on probing, and GCF was collected using filter paper strips inserted into the sulcus for 30 s, eluted in buffer and assayed for enzyme activity. 1 week later, the patients were again evaluated for PD and bleeding, and subgingival plaque was removed with a curette oriented toward the pocket epithelium. Plaque samples were examined by darkfield microscopy and cultured anaerobically on selective and non-selective media. Various groups of bacteria, including species of black pigmenting Bacteroides (BPB), Fusobacterium sp., Capnocytophaga sp, Streptococcus sanguis, and total facultative organisms were enumerated. Relationships among the enzymes and bacterial groups expressed as colony-forming unit (CFU) counts or as a % of the total cultivable flora were assessed by Spearman correlation analysis. beta G levels were significantly correlated with populations of spirochetes, B. intermedius, B. gingivalis, and total lactose negative BPB's. Correlation between beta G and F. nucleatum sp. or Capnocytophaga sp. approached but did not reach statistically significant levels. In contrast, LDH activity showed a significant positive correlation with levels of B. gingivalis and total lactose negative BPB's. AS levels were significantly correlated only with B. gingivalis. beta G and LDH showed a significant negative correlation with levels of coccoid forms. Thus, beta G, an acid hydrolase which can serve as a marker for primary granule release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes, was most closely correlated with the micro-organisms found in other studies to be associated with chronic adult periodontitis.
TI  - Comparison of different assays for the aggregation of oral bacteria by human whole saliva.
AB  - For comparison, human whole saliva-induced aggregation was studied by phase-contrast microscopy, spectrophotometry combined with macroscopic observations, and in microtiterplate assay under identical experimental conditions for Actinomyces viscosus HG 85 (T14-V) and HG 380 (T14-AV), Bacteroides gingivalis HG 66 (W 83), Streptococcus rattus HG 59 (BHT), and Streptococcus sanguis I HG 169. The entire process of formation, extension, and sedimentation of aggregates could merely be observed by the combination of these assays. The very first stages of aggregation could only be detected and quantitated by phase-contrast microscopy. Within 2 1/2 min, 50% of the A. viscosus, S. rattus, and S. sanguis cells were aggregated, denoted as T50. In microtiterplates, however, aggregates were observed in general only after sedimentation at 30-45 min of incubation, expressed as TA. For interpretation of the spectrophotometric curves, additional microscopic and macroscopic data were a prerequisite. The small decline in absorbance during the first 30-45 min (phase 1) corresponded to the formation and extension of nonsedimenting aggregates, whereas the subsequent pronounced fall in absorbance (phase 2) was caused by the massive sedimentation of aggregates. The moment of inflexion between both phases, TI, marked the onset of sedimentation of aggregates and corresponded very well with TA, at which time already 92-98% of the cells were aggregated as quantitated by microscopy. In conclusion, only by microscopy the formation and extension of aggregates could be observed within a few minutes and quantitated in terms of aggregation rate. From 30-45 min, merely the sedimentation of aggregates was visualized in microtiterplates, whereas the time course of the overall process was recorded indirectly by spectrophotometry.

TI  - The effects of periodontal therapy on serum antibody (IgG) levels to plaque microorganisms.
AB  - The influence of periodontal therapy on serum antibody titers to selected periodontal disease-associated microorganisms was assessed in 23 patients having chronic inflammatory periodontal disease (CIPD). The immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers were determined by the microELISA technique in serum samples obtained prior to treatment; following a hygienic phase which included scaling, root planing, and oral hygiene instruction; following surgical treatment; and one year and two years following hygienic phase (maintenance phase). Considerable individual variability existed in the magnitude of immune response to specific bacterial preparations. Significant reductions in the mean antibody titers were seen to A. viscosus, S. sanguis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, B. melaninogenicus, T. vincentii, and T. denticola by the end of the second year of maintenance. There was no consistent response to Capnocytophaga. When individual patient responses were examined, 6 of the 23 were found to have elevated titers to at least one of the microorganisms in the interval between pretreatment and the end of the hygienic phase; however, in all but one case, the titers at the end of the second year of maintenance were below pretreatment levels. Antibody levels to bacteria such as S. sanguis were modified during therapy. This would indicate that immune responses to microbes not generally considered to be "periodontal pathogens" may be modified by adjuvant activity associated with subgingival plaque or changes in the environment of the sulcus and that subsequent changes in titer do not necessarily reflect a role of that microorganism in the disease process.
TI  - Intergeneric rosettes: sequestered surface recognition among human periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The human oral bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis and Bacteroides loescheii, when mixed in equal numbers in vitro, formed large settling coaggregates. As the relative number of each cell type was changed, coaggregates became smaller until at cell-type ratios of 10 to 1, rosettes formed. Rosettes consisting of a streptococcal cell in the center surrounded by bacteroides cells exhibited surface recognition properties of only the bacteroides, which coaggregated with many other cell types such as Actinomyces naeslundii, and formed large settling multigeneric aggregates. The ecological significance of these results derives from the following: (i) the direct demonstration that intergeneric coaggregates can protect the central cell from or prevent its access to other cells in the environment, and (ii) the potential for these effects to occur during bacterial succession of various cell types observed in progressively more severe stages of human periodontal disease.
TI  - Microbiological and immunological studies of adult periodontitis in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
AB  - The subgingival microflora and serum antibody response was examined in periodontitis patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and normal glucose tolerance (NGT). The predominant cultivable microflora was determined for subgingival plaque sampled from two deep periodontal pockets in each of eight adult periodontitis patients with NIDDM. Indirect immunofluorescence for Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans was used to examine these same samples as well as 186 additional subgingival plaque samples from 47 patients with moderate to severe generalized periodontitis including 25 subjects with NIDDM, six subjects with IGT, and 16 subjects with NGT. Serum antibody levels to 13 microorganisms including seven oral bacterial species and one nonoral control species were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in 377 subjects including 84 normal subjects without periodontal disease, 112 normal subjects with periodontitis, 19 periodontally normal subjects with IGT, 65 periodontitis patients with IGT, 15 periodontally normal subjects with NIDDM, and 82 periodontitis patients with NIDDM. Three hundred eighty-two bacterial isolates were recovered from the eight patients. B. intermedius was the most frequently isolated microorganism constituting 16% of the total isolates followed by Wolinella recta and B. gingivalis, which each accounted for 13% of the total. Streptococcus sanguis was the most prevalent microorganism, which was found in 75% of the sites. Subgingival plaque samples examined by immunofluorescence demonstrate a high prevalence of black-pigmented Bacteroides and suggest that the proportion of B. gingivalis but not B. intermedius is higher in NIDDM with periodontitis than in other groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial antigens induce collagenase and prostaglandin E2 synthesis in human gingival fibroblasts through a primary effect on circulating mononuclear cells.
AB  - Our previous work suggests that one mechanism through which connective tissue breakdown might occur in periodontal diseases is the production of metalloproteinases, including collagenase, by gingival fibroblasts. In this study we investigated whether highly purified preparations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from a number of putative periodontal pathogens could induce monolayer cultures of human gingival fibroblasts to synthesize collagenase and prostaglandin E2. Using both biochemical assays and immunocytochemical techniques, we found that cells synthesized only very small amounts of collagenase in direct response to LPS or LTA (0.1 to 20.0 micrograms/ml). At the highest dose of both antigens, prostaglandin E2 production was increased. We then studied whether LPS and LTA could signal collagenase production by interacting primarily with a different cell type. Our results show that LPS and LTA were each able to stimulate cultures of human blood mononuclear cells (greater than 95% monocytes) to release collagenase-inducing cytokines. By indirect immunocytochemistry, we found that a large proportion of human gingival fibroblasts was activated to produce collagenase by supernatants from LPS- and LTA-stimulated mononuclear cells, whereas gingival fibroblasts cultured with supernatants from unstimulated mononuclear cells were not. Furthermore, in a population of activated fibroblasts we demonstrated, using a double-labeling technique, that some cells made collagenase and the specific tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) simultaneously. As yet, the collagenase-inducing signals remain poorly characterized but the interleukins-1 and tumor necrosis factors seem likely candidates.
TI  - Fimbria-associated proteins of Bacteroides loescheii PK1295 mediate intergeneric  coaggregations.
AB  - Bacteroides loescheii PK1295 serves as a coaggregation bridge between Streptococcus sanguis 34 and Actinomyces israelii PK14, two gram-positive oral bacteria that are otherwise unable to coaggregate. Whereas coaggregation with S. sanguis 34 is inhibited by lactose, no simple sugar was found that inhibited coaggregation with A. israelii PK14. Coaggregation-defective (Cog-) mutants of B. loescheii PK1295 were isolated for the purpose of identifying the surface components responsible for the interaction with each coaggregation partner. Selection for spontaneously occurring Cog- mutants gave rise to two phenotypic classes of mutants. Type I lost the ability to coaggregate with S. sanguis 34, whereas type II failed to coaggregate with either S. sanguis 34 or A. israelii PK14. Purified fimbriae from the parent agglutinated cells of both partners, and agglutination with S. sanguis 34 was inhibited by lactose. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis demonstrated the presence of both a 75- and a 43-kilodalton (kDa) protein associated with parental fimbriae, but only a 43-kDa protein was seen with fimbriae prepared from the type I mutant. Neither polypeptide was found in similar preparations from the type II mutants. Our data suggest that coaggregation of B. loescheii PK1295 with both gram-positive partners is mediated by fimbria-associated proteins present on the surface of the gram-negative organism and that the 75- and 43-kDa polypeptides are responsible for the recognition of S. sanguis 34 and A. israelii PK14 cells, respectively.
TI  - A mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. The advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. The effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (CHX) and (ii) three pulses of CHX (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/L) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. Only L. casei survived the continuous provision of CHX; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to CHX. After each CHX pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. Again, L. casei was least affected, while A. viscosus, B. intermedius, and F. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. Counts of S. mutans were affected more by CHX than those of S. sanguis or S. mitior. The effect of successive pulses of CHX on the viability of some bacteria and on acid production (as measured by pH-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to CHX had occurred. The fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.
TI  - Effect of crevicular fluid and lysosomal enzymes on the adherence of streptococci and bacteroides to hydroxyapatite.
AB  - Samples of hydroxyapatite (HA) beads smaller than 1 mg were coated with 10 microliter of either saliva, serum, or human crevicular fluid before being added to a suspension of Streptococcus sanguis or Bacteroides gingivalis. In some assays, preparations of a granular fraction, elastase, or cathepsin G from human leukocytes were used to coat HA or to treat saliva-coated HA (SHA) before mixing with bacteria. The number of cells adhering to the beads was then counted under a scanning electron microscope by a standardized procedure. More cells were found to adhere to SHA in this assay than in the conventional large-scale assay. Human crevicular fluid, even when diluted up to three times, completely inhibited the adherence of S. sanguis to HA. A 100% inhibition of S. sanguis adherence was also observed when HA was coated with the granular fraction of leukocytes, and a 65% inhibition observed when SHA was treated with the enzyme preparation. When used to coat HA, elastase and cathepsin G reduced the adherence of S. sanguis by 30 and 50%, respectively. The binding of S. sanguis to elastase- or cathepsin G-treated SHA was also reduced. B. gingivalis 33277 was found to adhere in high numbers to SHA. Coating HA with crevicular fluid or with the lysosomal enzyme preparation had a limited negative effect. We postulate that crevicular fluid prevents the adherence of S. sanguis by virtue of either its enzyme content or its albumin content or both.
TI  - Characterization of lectinlike surface components on Capnocytophaga ochracea ATCC 33596 that mediate coaggregation with gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  - The interactions between Capnocytophaga ochracea ATCC 33596 and Streptococcus sanguis H1, Actinomyces naeslundii PK984, or Actinomyces israelii PK16 are dependent on specific recognitions between heat-sensitive adhesins on C. ochracea and heat-stable structures (probably carbohydrate-containing receptors) on the surfaces of these gram-positive coaggregation partners. The coaggregation of C. ochracea with each of these three organisms was inhibited by L-rhamnose and D-fucose and to a lesser extent by beta-methyl-galactoside. The reaction with S. sanguis was the most sensitive, while the coaggregation with A. israelii was the least sensitive and was only partially inhibited by each of the sugars that were considered to be effective inhibitors. A more effective inhibition of the coaggregation between C. ochracea and A. israelii was achieved by adding a combination of the 6-deoxysugars and N-acetylneuraminic acid. To further characterize the coaggregations, naturally occurring coaggregation-defective (Cog-) mutants of C. ochracea were obtained from several different selections. Three phenotypically distinct groups of mutants were were isolated. Type 1 mutants failed to coaggregate with S. sanguis only. Type 2 mutants lost ability to interact with both S. sanguis and A. naeslundii. Type 3 mutants failed to coaggregate with all three coaggregation partners. Characterization of the Cog- mutants by sugar inhibition studies made it possible to distinguish three classes of adhesin activity.
TI  - Multigeneric aggregations among oral bacteria: a network of independent cell-to-cell interactions.
AB  - A radioactivity-based assay was developed to define the participation of radioactively labeled cell types within the milieu of unlabeled partners in multigeneric aggregates. The cell types in these multigeneric aggregations consisted of various combinations of 21 strains representing five genera of human oral bacteria. The coaggregation properties of each cell type, when paired individually with various strains, were delineated and were unchanged when the microbes took part in the more complex multigeneric aggregations. Competition between homologous labeled and unlabeled cells for binding to a partner cell type was achieved only when the homologous cells were mixed together before the addition of their partner cells. Attempts to displace a labeled cell type from an aggregate by subsequent addition of a large excess of the same unlabeled cell type were unsuccessful, which suggested that the forces that bound different cell types together were very strong and the cell-to-cell interactions were stable. However, a cell type that exhibited only lactose-reversible coaggregations with partners was easily and selectively released by the addition of lactose to multigeneric aggregates otherwise consisting solely of lactose-nonreversible cell-to-cell interactions. This not only indicates the independent nature of individual coaggregations but also suggests the involvement of lectinlike adhesins in these sugar-inhibitable coaggregations. Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for multigeneric aggregations are unknown, the principle of a common partner cell type serving as a bridge between two otherwise noncoaggregating cell types was firmly established by the observation of sequential addition of one cell type to another. Thus, competition, bridging, coaggregate stability, independent nature of interactions, and partner specificity are the key principles of adherence that form the framework for continued studies of multigeneric aggregates. While the human oral cavity is a prime example of a complex microbial community, collectively the community appears to consist of simple and testable individual interactions.
TI  - Coagglutination reactions between Candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  - An agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of Candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, S. mitis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with C. albicans. No interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of C. albicans. Preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of F. nucleatum and A. viscosus to C. albicans is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. Other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to C. albicans. The possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral candidal clearance are discussed.
TI  - The effect of lowering the pH on the composition and metabolism of a community of nine oral bacteria grown in a chemostat.
AB  - Nine oral bacteria, associated with both healthy and diseased sites in the mouth, were grown at D = 0.05 h-1 (mean generation time 13.9 h) in a glucose-limited chemostat. After an initial period of steady-state growth at pH 7.0, pH control was discontinued. The pH then decreased until it stabilized at pH 4.1 after 9 d (16 generations), while the Eh rose from -165 mV to +160 mV. The lowering in pH resulted in the composition and metabolism of the flora being altered and in increased bacterial aggregation. At pH 7.0, 'Streptococcus mitior', Veillonella alcalescens and S. sanguis were most numerous while at pH 4.1 the counts of all bacteria fell except for Lactobacillus casei, which became predominant. The proportions of S. mutans within the community also increased while S. sanguis was recovered only occasionally and Bacteroides intermedius was not detected below pH 4.6. The survival at pH 4.1 of several other species would not have been predicted from earlier pure culture studies. Relative to pH 7.0, the community growing at pH 4.1 produced more lactic acid, washed cells had a greater glycolytic activity over a wider pH range but amino acid metabolism decreased. In general, when pH control was restored, so were the original patterns of metabolism and bacterial counts, except for B. intermedius, which was still not detected. The inverse relationship between S. sanguis and S. mutans, and the increase in proportions of L. casei and S. mutans during growth in a low pH environment parallel observations made in vivo and suggest that the chemostat can be used as a model for microbial behaviour in dental plaque.
TI  - The establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  - Nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant pH 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. The bacterial populations were Streptococcus mutans ATCC 2-27351, Strep. sanguis NCTC 7865, Strep. mitior EF 186, Actinomyces viscosus WVU 627, Lactobacillus casei AC 413, Neisseria sp. A1078, Veillonella alkalescens ATCC 17745, Bacteroides intermedius T 588 and Fusobacterium nucleatum NCTC 10593. All nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although Strep. sanguis and Neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. In contrast, even following repeated inoculations, Strep. mutans, B. intermedius and Neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. A more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (Y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. Microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring among community members. To compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. The bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. Although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.
TI  - Coaggregation of oral Bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  - Seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 Bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. None coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Strains of Bacteroides buccae, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, and B. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. However, six Bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. Most isolates of B. buccalis, B. denticola, B. intermedius, B. loescheii, B. oris, and B. veroralis coaggregated with strains of Actinomyces israelii, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. odontolyticus, Rothia dentocariosa, or Streptococcus sanguis. The strongest coaggregations involved B. denticola, B. loescheii, or B. oris; 22 of 25 strains coaggregated with A. israelii. Only B. loescheii interacted with certain strains of S. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between A. viscosus and the same strains of S. sanguis. In fact, B. loescheii and A. viscosus were competitors for binding to S. sanguis. Many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., S. sanguis and A. israelii). Evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.
TI  - The relationships between streptococcal species and periodontopathic bacteria in  human dental plaque.
AB  - The existence of antagonistic and commensal relationships between microorganisms  was investigated. The predominant cultivable flora in 172 plaque samples from active and non-active sites in 32 human subjects with destructive periodontitis was determined. The presence of putative periodontopathic organisms (Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Wolinella recta, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Eikenella corrodens) in a site was correlated with the absence of certain viridans streptococci (Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus intermedius), and vice versa. A strong commensal relationship was found between B. gingivalis and Strep. intermedius. The second study involved 3 subjects with intractable periodontitis whose plaque harboured large numbers of one or more of these periodontopathic organisms. This plaque contained fewer organisms capable of inhibiting the growth of the periodontopathic strains in vitro when compared with a clinically-healthy control subject. Intermediate levels of inhibitors were found in plaque taken from non-active lesions. The majority of inhibitors in plaque from the healthy control were viridans streptococci. Hydrogen-peroxide production by these organisms appears to be the principal mechanism of growth inhibition for periodontopathic organisms. Bacterial interactions may thus be causally related to both periodontal health and disease.
TI  - Human neutrophil migration under agarose to bacteria associated with the development of gingivitis.
AB  - In clinically healthy gingiva and increasingly with the development of inflammation, neutrophils are found in the gingival tissues and sulcus. This study evaluated the relative ability of bacteria associated with gingival health and developing inflammation to stimulate this increase in neutrophil accumulation. Dialyzed bacterial sonic extracts (BE) in buffer and pooled human serum (PHS) from pure cultures of Streptococcus sanguis. Actinomyces viscosus, A naeslundii, Bacteroides intermedius, Fusobacterium sp and Veillonella sp were tested for stimulation of human neutrophil migration under agarose. In addition, fractions of S sanguis culture fluids (CFs) from Sephadex G-10 chromatography were evaluated. All BE solutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C and heat-inactivated prior to testing. All BEs in buffer attracted neutrophils, with the greatest responses seen to S sanguis and B intermedius followed by A viscosus. Migration to all BEs in PHS was greater than in buffer, suggesting that all BEs are capable of generating serum chemoattractants. A viscosus BE activated serum attractants to the greatest degree. CFs of S sanguis, A viscosus, and to a lesser degree, Fusobacterium sp, also attracted neutrophils. Evidence from [3H]FMLP competitive ligand-binding assays indicated that S sanguis CFs contained low molecular weight (less than 700) chemoattractants, which were probably formylmethionyl oligopeptide-like materials. Of the bacteria associated with health, S sanguis and A viscosus appeared at least as able to generate chemoattractants during growth or with exposure to serum as bacteria associated with gingivitis. This observation suggests that these "healthy" bacteria, which are found in greater numbers with developing inflammation, may mediate increased neutrophil transmigration in early disease.
TI  - Immunogold electron microscopy of surface antigens of oral bacteria.
AB  - Colloidal gold particles 3-6 nm in diameter were prepared and stabilized with the IgG fraction of polyspecific rabbit antisera produced against four different oral bacteria. The immunogold markers were used in homologous reactions to label the bacteria in a preembedding procedure for electron microscopy. An indirect immunofluorescence procedure was concurrently used to optimize the labelling conditions before observation with the electron microscope. The immunogold markers labelled fibrillar structures extending outward 50-275 nm from the Gram-positive cell envelopes and a fuzzy 5-10 nm thick capsulelike layer on the outer aspect of Bacteroides gingivalis. The immunogold method appears to be a simple, rapid, and inexpensive procedure suitable for the study of bacterial surface antigens and can be upgraded with the use of monospecific antibodies.
TI  - Colonization of the subgingival area by Bacteroides gingivalis.
AB  - The initial event in colonization of the subgingival area by B. gingivalis is its attachment to host cells and Gram-positive bacteria in pre-formed plaque. The level of B. gingivalis is partly governed by products of other plaque bacteria, especially by sanguicin. Once B. gingivalis resides in its nidus and starts to proliferate, expulsion of pre-existing residents may occur, especially of attached Gram-positive bacteria, through the inhibitory action of the B. gingivalis product, hematin. The bacteriocin produced by black-pigmented Bacteroides also seems to play an important role in their establishment. Melaninogenicus possessed strong inhibitory activity against Actinomyces species. This was not completely confirmed with fresh isolates of B. gingivalis from advanced periodontitis patients. Various factors other than inhibitory substances produced by B. gingivalis and related bacteria can also affect the colonization of this species. Since the crevice area is influenced by gingival fluid, the nature of specific antibody and the other affecting components should be considered collectively with the interaction between new predominant colonizers and other pre-existing residents.
TI  - Coaggregation of human oral Cytophaga species and Actinomyces israelii.
AB  - A total of 19 strains of oral Cytophaga sp. obtained from subgingival plaque deposits were tested for their ability to coaggregate with strains of Actinomyces israelii, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus sanguis, S. mutans, S. salivarius, and S. mitis. Coaggregation was observed only with A. israelii. Based on their coaggregation patterns with eight A. israelii strains, the Cytophaga strains were distributed among three distinct groups: those that coaggregated with A. israelii PK16 but not with A. israelii W1011 (ATCC 29322), those that coaggregated with A. israelii ATCC 29322 but not with A. israelii PK16, and those that coaggregated with none of the eight A. israelii strains. In each of the coaggregations, prior heat treatment (85 degrees C, 30 min) of the Cytophaga cells prevented coaggregation, whereas identical treatment of the A. israelii cells had no effect. The ability of A. israelii PK16 to form adherent plaque on a tooth surface previously coated with Cytophaga plaque was tested with one of the coaggregating Cytophaga strains. White patches of A. israelii plaque were found covering both the amber-colored Cytophaga plaque on the cementum surface as well as the enamel surface to which Cytophaga strains do not adhere. Electron micrographs of thin-sectioned mixed-plaque material revealed both cell types in close proximity. In addition, electron micrographs of negatively stained coaggregated cells showed interbacterial adherence between surface fimbrae on A. israelii and outer membrane blebs on the gram-negative Cytophaga sp. The kinetics of binding of A. israelii to spheroidal hydroxyapatite and to root powder were indicative of a high-affinity binding system with comparatively large numbers of available binding sites on both substrata. These results indicate the highly specific nature of Cytophaga sp.--A. israelii recognition. The contribution of such recognition toward the mechanisms that are responsible for the indigenous nature of these oral bacteria is discussed.
TI  - Regulatory effect of monocytes on T cell proliferative responses to oral microbial antigens.
AB  - Mononuclear cell preparations isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation from human peripheral blood were found to vary considerably in the number of monocytes they contained (mean, 20.3%; range, 13 to 33%). The regulatory role of monocytes in T cell proliferative responses to sonic extracts of a panel of oral microorganisms was therefore investigated. T cells were fractionated by anti-immunoglobulin chromatography and depleted of monocytes by treatment with a monoclonal anti-human Ia-like (DR locus antigen) antibody and complement. Purified populations of monocytes were obtained by extensive adherence procedures. The resultant cell populations were greater than 95% pure, as judged by indirect immunofluorescence on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Monocyte-depleted T cells failed to respond by proliferation to the nonoral antigen tetanus toxoid, as well as to any oral microorganism, but retained responsiveness to phytohemagglutinin. Readdition of monocytes in final concentrations of from 5 to 15% resulted in the restoration of maximal T cell proliferation. Monocytes in greater numbers suppressed T cell responses to all sonic extracts tested.
TI  - Humoral immune response to oral microorganisms in periodontitis.
AB  - Serum antibody titers from patients with periodontitis were compared with those from periodontally healthy subjects. With the micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM antibody titers to isolates of Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides ochraceus, and Fusobacterium nucleation were determined. Antibody titers of the IgG and IgA classes to B. melaninogenicus, B. ochraceus, F. nucleatum, and S. sanguis were found to be significantly higher in the controls than in the patients. No correlations were found with serum IgM titers. These findings indicate that periodonitis may be associated with depressed antibacterial serum antibody titers of the IgG and IgA classes.
TI  - Enzymatic modification of bacterial receptors on saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  - Certain properties of experimental pellicles formed by the adsorption of salivary components on hydroxyapatite surfaces change over time. To determine whether enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment could induce such changes, pellicles were treated with saliva which had been incubated for 18 h at 35 degrees C to promote the elaboration of microbial enzymes. This treatment markedly reduced the numbers of Streptococcus mutans MT3 and JBP and S. sanguis FC-1 and C5 cells which attached, but it had little or no effect on the attachment of S. mitis RE7, Actinomyces viscosus LY7 and CK-8, Bacteroides gingivalis 381, or B. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius 581. Heating the incubated saliva at 60 degrees C for 30 min partially reduced its pellicle-modifying activity, whereas heating at 80 degrees C for 30 min or 100 degrees C for 15 min completely eliminated such activity. This indicated that the saliva contained heat-labile substances, presumably enzymes, which could affect the pellicle receptors involved in the attachment of S. mutans and S. sanguis. Treatment of saliva-treated hydroxyapatite with commercially obtained enzyme preparations also affected bacterial attachment. Thus, treatment with galactose oxidase reduced the numbers of the S. mutans strains which attached, whereas treatment with neuraminidase reduced the adsorption of S. sanguis FC-1 but not that of S. sanguis C5. Treatment with beta-glucosidase preparations derived from almonds significantly reduced the attachment of all of the streptococcal strains studied, but, when subjected to isoelectric fractionation, the adherence-inhibiting activity did not correlate directly with beta-glucosidase activity. Treatment of the pellicles with trypsin or eight other glycosidases did not affect streptococcal attachment. Exposure of the enzymatically modified pellicles to fresh saliva did not restore the streptococcal receptors. Collectively, the data suggest that some bacterial receptors in the pellicle coating of teeth can be modified by enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment, and these interactions may affect oral bacterial ecology.
TI  - Bacterial invasion of pulpal dentin wall in vitro.
AB  - Instrumented root canals of extracted human teeth were inoculated with known pulpal bacterial isolates. The inoculated teeth were immersed in the appropriate culture media and incubated at 37 degrees C for varying periods. Streptococci multiplied in the root canals and invaded the radicular dentinal tubules. The extent of bacterial invasion was time-dependent. This experimental model of bacterial invasion was time-dependent. This experimental model may be useful in investigating the effect of intra-canal medicaments on microorganisms lodged in the pulpal dentin wall.
TI  - Microbial surface interactions: reduction of the haemagglutination activity of the oral bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum by absorption with Streptococcus and Bacteroides.
AB  - Oral strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum showed haemagglutination (HA) of sheep red blood cells and attachment of HA-active F. nucleatum fragments to other microorganisms allowed a means of studying microbial surface interactions. HA-active sonicated fragments (SF) prepared from F. nucleatum were mixed with whole cell suspensions of 48 bacterial strains and, after incubation, the whole cells were separated from the non-absorbed fragments by differential centrifugation. Attachment of F. nucleatum fragments to the cells was indicated by a reduction in the HA activity of the SF in the supernatant fluid remaining after absorption with whole cells. HA activity of the microbial cells used for absorption and the detection of F. nucleatum fragments on these cells by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique provided further evidence of attachment. Of the 48 strains tested, 10 absorbed F. nucleatum HA-active fragments. They included Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides fragilis subsp. distasonis, Bacteroides corrodens, Streptococcus morbillorum, Streptococcus sanguis (Blackburn and JC 74) and Streptococcus mutans AHT, BHT, 10449 and 6715. Chelators revealed that F. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a Ca2+-dependent interaction. Sugar inhibition demonstrated that F. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a D-galactose-containing moiety on their surface. A reduction in the absorption of F. nucleatum HA-active fragments by Strep. mutans grown in a higher concentration of sucrose was observed.

TI  - Attachment of oral Cytophaga species to hydroxyapatite-containing surfaces.
AB  - Model systems simulating the cementum portion of teeth were used to characterize  the attachment process by which certain species of oral Cytophaga initiate the colonization of the tooth root surface in vitro. The adsorption of these bacteria to spheroidal hydroxyapatite beads and mechanically powdered root material followed Langmuir isotherm kinetics. From such data, the number of binding sites per 20 mg of substrate and the affinity constants were evaluated for two strains of Cytophaga sp. Resting cells of the two strains tested adhered relatively tenaciously to hydroxyapatite beads in numbers similar to those observed with cells of Streptococcus sanguis. Attachment of bacteria to the substrates was partially inhibited by (i) coating the substrates with human serum or saliva, (ii) pretreating cell suspensions with proteinase K or phospholipase C or D, or (iii) exposing the cells to temperatures greater than 60 degrees C for 15 min. Treating resting cell suspensions with pronase, neuraminidase, phospholipase A2, or 0.1 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid had no effect on the attachment process.
TI  - Lymphoproliferative responses to oral bacteria in humans with varying severities  of periodontal disease.
AB  - We assessed in vitro the lymphocyte blastogenic resp onsess of peripheral blood lymphocytes to antigen extracts of a large battery of oral microorganisms in a population of humans with varying severities of periodontal disease. When the magnitudes and frequencies of statistically positive blastogenic responses to various oral microorganisms were compared, three general patterns emerged. The Actinomyces species proved to be potent stimulators of lymphocyte blastogenesis in most subjects tested, whereas Streptococcus sanguis, Campylobacter, and Eikenella corrodens stimulated few individuals. The response to these organisms correlated poorly with the severity of periodontal disease in the tested patients. However, several gram-negative anaerobic organisms, including Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and Treponema denticola, elicited statistically more frequent positive response in subjects with destructive periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis. These results, taken together with recent microbiological findings, suggest that the specificity of the lymphocyte blastogenic response to antigens of oral bacteria correlates with the presence of these organisms in the subgingival microflora during various periodontal disease states.
TI  - Modulation of immunoreactivity to periodontal disease-associated microorganisms during pregnancy.
AB  - The lymphocyte blastogenic response to a panel of antigens and mitogens was assessed in a group of 20 women throughout their pregnancy. In addition, a group of five nonpregnant women was monitored simultaneously to identify variations in response to the same stimulants. The stimulants included orally associated bacterial antigens (Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides [Capnocytophaga] ochraceus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) and non-orally associated-stimulants (streptokinase-streptodornase, tetanus toxoid, concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, and pokeweed mitogen). Intrinsic (cells cultured in male AB plasma) suppression of the lymphocyte response to these stimulants was observed to occur by the second trmester of pregnancy and was resolved after parturition. Additionally, an extrinsic (cells cultured in autologous plasma) suppression was also suggested to occur in a similar manner. There was no detectable enhancement of the blastogenic response to oral bacteria associated with elevated gingivitis, which is generally reported to occur during nonpregnancy gingivitis. We propose that concomitant immunosuppression occurs during the second trimester, which masks such enhancement.
TI  - The effect of intensive antibacterial therapy on the sulcular environment in monkeys. Part I. Changes in the bacteriology of the gingival sulcus.
AB  - The changes induced in the bacteriology of the gingival sulcus were evaluated as  part of a study considering the keratinizing potential of the sulcular epithelium when bacterial plaque was essentially eliminated. Two Rhesus monkeys were scaled and placed on a daily therapeutic regimen which included a prophylaxis, systemic tetracycline, and topical chlorhexidine. Over the 40 day experimental period and 74 days post-therapy, subgingival plaque samples were taken periodically. The plaque samples were cultured anaerobically and aerobically to determine the predominant bacterial flora. The total cultivable bacterial flora decreased from initial levels by greater than 99.9% with the antibacterial therapy. The flora shifted with therapy from one dominated by anaerobic organisms, including Bacteroides melaninogenicus (18%) and Fusobacterium species (13.9%), to a flora dominated by organisms growing aerobically. During treatment B. melaninogenicus and Fusobacterium species were not detected in any sample. After cessation of all therapy the anaerobes increased to dominance again, but B. melaninogenicus remained undetectable through 74 days post-therapy.

TI  - Attachment of Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus to oral surfaces and its possible role in colonization of the mouth and of periodontal pockets.
AB  - This investigation examined the ability of cells of Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 to adhere to surfaces that might be important for its initial colonization of the mouth and its subsequent colonization in periodontal pockets. Of 48 asaccharolytic strains of B. melaninogenicus, 47 agglutinated human erythrocytes, whereas none of 20 fermentative strains, which included reference cultures of the subspecies intermedius and melaninogenicus, were active. Electron microscopy indicated that both asaccharolytic and fermentative strains possessed pili; hence, the presence of pili did not correlate with the hemagglutinating activities of B. melaninogenicus strains. Both asaccharolytic and fermentative B. melaninogenicus strains suspended in phosphate-buffered saline adhered in high numbers to buccal epithelial cells and to the surfaces of several gram-positive bacteria tested, including Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. israelii, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. mitis. B. melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 also attached, but in comparatively low numbers, to untreated and to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. Addition of clarified whole saliva to suspensions of strain 381 almost completely eliminated adherence to buccal epithelial cells and to hydroxyapatite surfaces, but saliva had no detectable effect on attachment to gram-positive plaque bacteria. Both fermentative and nonfermentative strains of B. melaninogenicus also attached in high numbers to crevicular epithelial cells derived from human periodontal pockets, but normal human serum strongly inhibited attachment. Serum also inhibited attachment of strain 381 to saliva- and serum-treated hydroxyapatite, but it had little effect upon attachment to gram-positive bacteria. These observations suggested that salivary and serum components would strongly inhibit the attachment of B. melaninogenicus cells to several oral surfaces, but not to the surfaces of certain gram-positive bacteria commonly present in human dental plaque. This was confirmed by an in vivo experiment in which streptomycin-labeled cells of B. melaninogenicus 381-R were introduced into the mouths of two volunteers. After 10 min, several hundred-fold higher numbers of the organism were recovered from preformed bacterial plaque present on teeth than from clean tooth surfaces or from the buccal mucosa and tongue dorsum. High numbers of B. melaninogenicus cells were also recovered from preformed plaque after 150 min, but virtually no cells of the organism were recovered from the other surfaces studied. These data suggest that the presence of dental plaque containing Actinomyces and other gram-positive bacteria may be essential for the attachment and colonization of B. melaninogenicus cells after their initial introduction into the mouth. Similarly, the presence of subgingival plaque containing gram-positive bacteria may be necessary for its secondary colonization in periodontal pockets.

TI  - Effect of bacterial products on inflammatory reactions in the dental pulp.
AB  - Culture filtrates (extracellular components) and material obtained from disintegrated cells (intracellular components) of cultured plaque bacteria were studied for their capacity to induce inflammatory reactions in the dental pulp. Class V cavities were prepared on the buccal surface of 94 teeth: 42 test and 52 control teeth in six adult monkeys. lyophilized bacterial components were sealed into the test cavities either alone or following an 8-h topical application of a solution of the same components in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Culture medium and PBS were applied in two sets of control cavities. A third set was restored with zinc oxide-eugenol cement. The animals were killed 32 h after the initiation of the experiment and the pulps were examined histologically. Teeth treated trophil leukocytes in the area of the pulp subjacent to the cut dentin tubules. Abscess formation was frequently found. The severe reactions which developed were independent of differences between individual animals and differences in thickness of the remaining dentin. The controls showed damage to the odontoblasts but little or no neutrophil infiltration. The findings confirm that products of bacteria applied to exposed dentin initiate inflammatory reactions in the dental pulp.
