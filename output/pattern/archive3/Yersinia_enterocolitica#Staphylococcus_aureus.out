synthesis and antibacterial properties of 2,3-dideoxyglucosides of terpene alcohols and phenols.
essential oils and their oxygenated terpene constituents possess potent antimicrobial properties. in the present study, a facile synthetic route to the 2,3-dideoxy 1-o-glucosides of important phenols and terpene alcohols in excellent yields (85-96%) has been delineated. studies on their antimicrobial action against four food-borne pathogens - bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica - demonstrated that the zone of inhibition, in general, was higher for the 2,3-unsaturated 1-o-glucoside derivatives (1b-6b) and the corresponding saturated glucosides (1c-5c) when compared to the parent alcohols/phenols (1-6). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) values for these derivatives too were generally lower than those of the parent compounds. furthermore, the time-kill and bacteriolysis assays too demonstrated the greater antimicrobial potential of the derivatives. the 2,3-dideoxy 1-o-glucosides of phenols and terpene alcohols were more effective in their antimicrobial action than the corresponding parent compounds. the study indicated that these novel derivatives can find useful application in control of food-related pathogenic microbes in foods.
green conversion of agroindustrial wastes into chitin and chitosan by rhizopus arrhizus and cunninghamella elegans strains.
this article sets out a method for producing chitin and chitosan by cunninghamella elegans and rhizopus arrhizus strains using a green metabolic conversion of agroindustrial wastes (corn steep liquor and molasses). the physicochemical characteristics of the biopolymers and antimicrobial activity are described. chitin and chitosan were extracted by alkali-acid treatment, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, viscosity and x-ray diffraction. the effectiveness of chitosan from c. elegans and r. arrhizus in inhibiting the growth of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica were evaluated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc). the highest production of biomass (24.60 g/l), chitin (83.20 mg/g) and chitosan (49.31 mg/g) was obtained by r. arrhizus. chitin and chitosan from both fungi showed a similar degree of deacetylation, respectively of 25% and 82%, crystallinity indices of 33.80% and 32.80% for chitin, and 20.30% and 17.80% for chitosan. both chitin and chitosan presented similar viscosimetry of 3.79-3.40 cp and low molecular weight of 5.08x10(3) and 4.68x10(3) g/mol. they both showed identical mic and mbc for all bacteria assayed. these results suggest that: agricultural wastes can be produced in an environmentally friendly way; chitin and chitosan can be produced economically; and that chitosan has antimicrobial potential against pathogenic bacteria.
presence of enterotoxigenic staphylococcus aureus in artisan fruit salads in the  city of san luis, argentina.
an increase in the consumption of fruit juices and minimally processed fruits salads has been observed in recent years all over the world. in this work, the microbiological quality of artisan fruit salads was analysed. faecal coliforms, salmonella spp, shigella spp, yersinia enterocolitica and escherichia coli o157:h7 were not detected; nevertheless, eleven strains of staphylococcus aureus were isolated. by multiplex pcr, all isolates showed positive results for s. aureus 16s rrna gene and 63.6% of them were positive for sea gene. furthermore, pcr sea positive strains were able to produce the corresponding enterotoxin. finally, the inactivation of these strains in fruit salads by nisin, lysozyme and edta, was studied. edta produced a total s. aureus growth inhibition after 60 h of incubation at a concentration of 250 mg/l. the presence of s. aureus might indicate inadequate hygiene conditions during salad elaboration; however, the enterotoxigenicity of the strains isolated in this study, highlights the risk of consumers' intoxication. edta could be used to inhibit the growth of s. aureus in artisan fruit salads and extend the shelf life of these products.
differential modulation of intracellular survival of cytosolic and vacuolar pathogens by curcumin.
curcumin, a principal component of turmeric, acts as an immunomodulator regulating the host defenses in response to a diseased condition. the role of curcumin in controlling certain infectious diseases is highly controversial. it is known to alleviate symptoms of helicobacter pylori infection and exacerbate that of leishmania infection. we have evaluated the role of curcumin in modulating the fate of various intracellular bacterial pathogens. we show that pretreatment of macrophages with curcumin attenuates the infections caused by shigella flexneri (clinical isolates) and listeria monocytogenes and aggravates those caused by salmonella enterica serovar typhi ct18 (a clinical isolate), salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica. thus, the antimicrobial nature of curcumin is not a general phenomenon. it modulated the intracellular survival of cytosolic (s. flexneri and l. monocytogenes) and vacuolar (salmonella spp., y. enterocolitica, and s. aureus) bacteria in distinct ways. through colocalization experiments, we demonstrated that curcumin prevented the active phagosomal escape of cytosolic pathogens and enhanced the active inhibition of lysosomal fusion by vacuolar pathogens. a chloroquine resistance assay confirmed that curcumin retarded the escape of the cytosolic pathogens, thus reducing their inter- and intracellular spread. we have demonstrated that the membrane-stabilizing activity of curcumin is crucial for its differential effect on the virulence of the bacteria.
[antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
isolation of bacteriocin-like substances producing bacteria from finished cattle-manure compost and activity evaluation against some food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria.
a finished compost sample was examined for bacteriocin-like substance production  against five pathogenic bacteria: salmonella typhimurium ef 85-9, escherichia coli o157:h7 atcc 43888, enterococcus faecalis jcm 8726, staphylococcus aureus jcm 2151, and yersinia enterocolitica jcm 7577. at the preliminary detection of bacterial strains exhibiting antimicrobial activity from the compost sample, thirteen strains could be isolated. screening of the inhibitory activity was done using agar-well diffusion assay and microtiter plate growth assay. six bacterial strains from the compost showed an antimicrobial activity against one or more of the tested indicator strains. four strains (m1-m4) belonged to shigella species and the other two strains (m5 and m6) belonged to salmonella species. the antimicrobial activity was sensitive for alpha-chymotrypsin and papain. the antimicrobial substances from m3, m4 and m6 were heat stable when heated for 15 min at 121 degrees c with 100% relative activity. the bacteriocin-like substance produced by strain m2 was partially characterized. it exhibited an inhibitory activity against the tested food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, except enterobacter aerogenes jcm 1235 and lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum jcm 1149. it was stable at a wide range of ph (3-11). there was no loss of activity for up to 3 weeks when stored at 4 and -20 degrees c or for up to 2 weeks when stored at 28 and -80 degrees c. this is the first report indicating the presence of bacteriocin-like activity in animal manure compost.
cationic compounds with activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria: interest of a new compound compared with two older antiseptics, hexamidine and chlorhexidine.
use of antiseptics and disinfectants is essential in infection control practices  in hospital and other healthcare settings. in this study, the in vitro activity of a new promising compound, para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene (cx1), has been evaluated in comparison with hexamidine (hx) and chlorhexidine (chx), two older cationic antiseptics. the mics for 69 clinical isolates comprising methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (with or without meca), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, enterobacteriaceae producing various beta-lactamases and non-fermenting bacilli (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were determined. cx1 showed similar activity against s. aureus, cons and enterococcus spp., irrespective of the presence of meca or van genes, or associated resistance genes, with very good activity against cons (mic <1 mg/l). variable activities were observed against enterobacteriaceae; the mics determined seemed to be dependent both on the genus (mics of 2, 8 and 64 mg/l for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia enterocolitica, respectively) and on the resistance phenotype production of [extended spectrum beta-lactase (esbls) or other beta-lactamases; overproduction of ampc]. poor activity was found against non-fermenting bacilli, irrespective of the resistance phenotype. chx appeared to be the most active compound against all strains, with broad-spectrum and conserved activity against multidrug-resistant strains. hx showed a lower activity, essentially against gram-positive strains. consequently, the differences observed with respect to cx1 suggest that they are certainly not the consequence of antibiotic resistance phenotypes, but rather the result of membrane composition modifications (e.g. of lipopolysaccharide), or of the presence of (activated) efflux-pumps. these results raise the possibility that cx1 may be a potent new antibacterial agent of somewhat lower activity but significantly lower toxicity than chx.
comparing the antimicrobial effectiveness of nacl and kcl with a view to salt/sodium replacement.
a study using a small range of pathogenic bacterial species (aeromonas hydrophila, enterobacter sakazakii, shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica and 3 strains of staphylococcus aureus) has shown that potassium chloride has an equivalent antimicrobial effect on these organisms when calculated on a molar basis. combined nacl and kcl experiments were carried out and data was analysed using a modification to the lambert and lambert [lambert, r.j.w., and lambert, r., 2003. a model for the efficacy of combined inhibitors. journal of applied microbiology 95, 734-743.] model for combined inhibitors and showed that in combination kcl is a direct 1:1 molar replacement for the antimicrobial effect of common salt. if this is a general finding then, where salt is used to help preserve a product, partial or complete replacement by kcl is possible.
isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
antimicrobial activity of extracts of the lichen parmelia sulcata and its salazinic acid constituent.
the antimicrobial activity of the acetone, chloroform, diethyl ether, methanol, and petroleum ether extracts of the lichen parmelia sulcata and its salazinic acid constituent have been screened against twenty eight food-borne bacteria and fungi. all of the extracts with the exception of the petroleum ether extract showed antimicrobial activity against aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida glabrata, aspergillus niger, aspergillus fumigatus, and penicillium notatum. salazinic acid did not show antimicrobial activity against l. monocytogenes, p. vulgaris, y. enterocolitica, and s. faecalis but showed activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium as well. the mic values of the extracts and the acid for the bacteria and fungi have also been determined.
a study on inhibitory effects of sigla tree (liquidambar orientalis mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
in this study, sigla (liquidambar orientalis mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, b. brevis, b. cereus, b. megaterium, b. subtilis, corynebacterium xerosis, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, klebsiella pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus luteus, mycobacterium smegmatis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. the storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. pure ethanol was used for the control. the antibacterial activity of the sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. the growths of a. hydrophila, b. amyloliquefaciens, b. megaterium, e. coli, e. coli o157:h7, l. monocytogenes and y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of sigla storax. the results showed that sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
antimicrobial activity of reuterin in combination with nisin against food-borne pathogens.
antimicrobial activity of reuterin individually or in combination with nisin against different food-borne gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens in milk was investigated. reuterin (8 au/ml) exhibited bacteriostatic activity against listeria monocytogenes, whereas its activity was slightly bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus at 37 degrees c. higher bactericidal activity was detected against escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella choleraesuis subsp. choleraesuis, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila subsp. hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni. a significant synergistic effect on l. monocytogenes and a slight additive effect on s. aureus after 24 h at 37 degrees c were observed when reuterin was combined with nisin (100 iu/ml). the combination of reuterin with nisin did not enhance the antimicrobial effect of reuterin against gram-negative pathogens.
sensitization of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to jenseniin g by sublethal injury.
jenseniin g, a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p126, is active  against related propionibacteria and some lactic acid bacteria and is sporostatic to botulinal spores. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sublethal stress on jenseniin g activity. bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica were subjected to temperature, acid, and osmotic stresses in the presence of jenseniin g. the bacteriocin reduced the viability of sublethally injured cultures, although the extent of reduction varied with strain and treatment. e. faecalis was the most sensitive to temperature stress; no reduction of viable counts occurred in the absence of jenseniin g, and a 1.5-log reduction occurred in the presence of jenseniin g. b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. aureus were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to heat stress than when exposed to cold stress, whereas e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and s. flexneri were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to cold stress than when exposed to heat stress. when comparing an acid stress test alone to a combination of acid stress and jenseniin g, e. faecalis and l. monocytogenes showed the greatest sensitivities with 4.87- and 2.82-log reductions, respectively, after 7 days. all cultures except for s. aureus were adversely affected by the combination of salt stress and jenseniin g. salmonella typhimurium showed the greatest sensitivity to salt stress with jenseniin g (a 1.54-log reduction at day 7) when compared to salt stress alone (a 0.55-log reduction at day 7). jenseniin g, like bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive species, has broader activity against stressed organisms.
[diagnostic value of a novel nutrient medium for isolation and cultivation of pathogens causing enteric yersiniosis and pseudotuberculosis].
a new nutrient medium for isolation and cultivation of the causative agents of enteric yersiniosis and pseudotuberculosis was found to have advantages over endo medium in its differentiating and inhibiting properties. this medium permitted the easy differentiation of yersinia pseudotuberculosis from y. enterocolitica, as well as from escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. rhinoscleromatis, hafnia, enterobacter and citrobacter by color; from proteus inconstans by swarming. in addition, weakly swarming of p. vulgaris differed by their light bluish color and pseudomonas aeruginosa, by the brilliance and size of colonies. endo medium could be used only for differentiation of e. coli from lactose-negative yersinia colonies, klebsiella (by mucous growth) and, to a certain extent, all proteus species (by swarming). the medium under test and the control medium inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus. in contrast to endo medium, the medium under test partially inhibited the growth of k. rhinoscleromatis and the swarming of p. inconstans. the new medium is now introduced into practice.
functional expression of adhesive peptides as fusions to escherichia coli flagellin.
an expression system for studying epitopes of adhesion proteins based on fusion of gene fragments into flic(h7) of escherichia coli is described. we constructed the system by an in-frame insertion of dna fragments encoding one, two or three of the fibronectin-binding d repeats present in the fibronectin-binding protein a (fnbpa) of staphylococcus aureus, into the flic(h7) gene region encoding the variable domain of the h7 flagellin. the constructs were expressed by in trans complementation in the e. coli strain jt1 which harbours knock-out mutations for the expression of flic as well as of the mannoside-binding fimbrial adhesin. the resulting chimeric flagella, which contained 39, 77 or 115 heterologous amino acid residues, efficiently bound soluble and immobilized human plasma and cellular fibronectin, and the binding was most efficient with the flagella containing the three d repeats of fnbpa. the chimeric flagella bound to frozen sections of human kidney and to cultured human cells. antibodies raised against the chimeric flagella bound to protein a-deficient s. aureus cells and inhibited the binding of staphylococci to immobilized fibronectin. we also expressed peptides, ranging in size between 48 and 302 amino acids, of the collagen-binding yada adhesin of yersinia enterocolitica. a fragment of 302 amino acids representing the middle region of yada was needed for collagen binding. chimeric flagellar filaments expressing hundreds of intimately associated adhesive epitopes offer versatile tools to analyze adhesin-receptor interactions and functional epitopes of adhesion proteins.
safe poultry meat production in the next century.
the revolutionary industrialisation of the poultry industry in the last 30 years  has made the food poultry meat available for large groups of consumers. due to its nutritional, sensory and economical characteristics, poultry meat is by far the most popular animal food product world-wide. epidemiological reports, however, incriminate poultry meat as a source for outbreaks of human food poisoning. the organisms involved are salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and, to a lesser extent, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium perfringens and aeromonas spp. contamination of the end-product with pathogenic microorganisms is a reflection of the contamination of the live birds and, therefore, measures to be taken by industry to avoid contamination of the consumer-ready product should start at that level. in terms of the critical control point approach of the haccp concept, the quantitative contribution of critical phases in the production chain towards end-product contamination should be estimated in order to take the necessary intervention or corrective steps. to guarantee the production of safe poultry meat, knowledge of the capability of microorganisms to colonise the gastrointestinal tract is needed and the use of vaccines, antimicrobials and competitive exclusion microfloras as well as the implementation of new processing technology should be encouraged.
role of yops in inhibition of phagocytosis and killing of opsonized yersinia enterocolitica by human granulocytes.
the virulence plasmid of yersinia enterocolitica codes for the production of the  outer membrane protein yada and the secretion of several proteins, called yops, which may play a role in the interaction between granulocytes and this bacterium. we investigated whether the expression of yada or the secretion of yops affected the phagocytosis and killing of opsonized y. enterocolitica by human granulocytes. the rates of phagocytosis and killing of y. enterocolitica by granulocytes in suspension in the presence of rabbit yersinia antibodies and complement were determined by microbiological assays. in addition, noningested cell-adherent bacteria were differentiated from ingested yersiniae by immunofluorescence microscopy. plasmid-bearing opsonized y. enterocolitica was able to inhibit phagocytosis and killing by human granulocytes. the inhibition of phagocytosis was specific for the plasmid-bearing strain of y. enterocolitica, since granulocytes were still able to phagocytose and kill staphylococcus aureus in the presence of y. enterocolitica. plasmid-cured y. enterocolitica was readily phagocytosed and killed by these cells. to investigate the role of yada or yops in the inhibition of phagocytosis by granulocytes, the phagocytosis of mutant strains unable to express yada or to secrete yops was studied. a y. enterocolitica mutant unable to secrete yops lost its ability to inhibit phagocytosis; a mutant expressing only yada was readily ingested by granulocytes. these results indicate that after attachment of opsonized y. enterocolitica to granulocytes, yops play an important role in inhibiting the ingestion of y. enterocolitica by human granulocytes.
comparative in vitro activity of fk-037, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
the in vitro activity of fk-037, a novel parenteral oxime-type cephalosporin, was compared with that of cefepime, cefpirome, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin against a total of 668 recent clinical isolates. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure, and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) colony forming units). fk-037 inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, providencia stuartii, citrobacter freundii, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas species, and haemophilus influenzae at < or = 1 microgram/ml. fk-037 was less active against enterobacter species, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas species, requiring 16 micrograms/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and was inactive against xanthomonas maltophilia. fk-037 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus at < or = 1 microgram/ml and 90% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus at < or = 8 micrograms/ml.
seroreactivity to bacterial antigens is not a unique phenomenon in patients with  autoimmune thyroid diseases in canada.
it has been suggested elsewhere that the enteric pathogen yersinia enterocolitica (y.e.) might be implicated etiologically in autoimmune thyroid disease (aitd). to reevaluate this hypothesis in the canadian population, where the prevalence of anti-y.e. antibodies in the general population is very low (< 1%), we have studied the occurrence of antibacterial reactivity (against y.e. 0:3 and 0:9, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus) in the sera of patients with hashimoto's thyroiditis (ht), graves' disease (gd), nontoxic nodular goiter (ntg), and autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ard) as well as normal controls (c). using the tube agglutination method, no single positive sample was detected in these subjects. no differences in the mean levels of anti-y.e. 0:3 or 0:9 by elisa were observed between various groups of patients. immunoreactivity in the course of medical therapy during 5-12 months did not show significant changes in any of 12 ard and aitd patients. some serological reactivity to the plasmid containing strain of y.e. 0:3 was demonstrated in all subjects by the western blotting technique. however, weaker signals and fewer bands were noticed in these sera compared to sera from patients with acute yersiniosis. analysis of the pattern of reactivity did not show any difference in reactivity to any protein between the groups of subjects. the immunodominant antigen in y.e. 0:3 to which igg reacted in almost all subjects was the plasmid encoded 240-kda protein. our study favors the view that there is a merely coincidental incidence of seroreactivity to bacterial antigens, which appears to be irrespective of diagnosis.
comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase i. its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total of 650 recent clinical isolates. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90 0.06 mg/l) and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
an agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and haemophilus influenzae with an mic90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and legionella pneumophila with an mic of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin inhibited staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (mic90) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and some other gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. the results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against gram-negative and gram-positive species.
in vitro activity and stability against novel beta-lactamases of investigational  beta-lactams (cefepime, cefpirome, flomoxef, sce2787 and piperacillin plus tazobactam) in comparison with established compounds (cefotaxime, latamoxef and piperacillin).
the therapeutic perspectives of flomoxef, sce 2787, cefpirome, cefepime, latamoxef, cefotaxime and of piperacillin plus tazobactam were comparatively evaluated by their in vitro activity against 1119 clinical isolates of 83 bacterial species. escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. enterobacter sakazakii, proteus spp. and shigella spp. were about equally susceptible to the cephalosporins (mic90: 0.06 to 0.5 mg/l), while the mic90 for piperacillin plus tazobactam was between 2 and 16 mg/l. enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and serratia spp. were most susceptible to sce 2787, cefpirome and cefepime (mic90: 0.06 to 2 mg/l) followed by latamoxef, cefotaxime, flomoxef and piperacillin plus tazobactam. for citrobacter spp., providencia spp. and yersinia enterocolitica mic90 were between 0.06 and 0.5 mg/l. flomoxef was between 2 to 4 log2 less active against these species but more active than piperacillin plus tazobactam (mic90: 2 and 8 mg/l). morganella morganii and hafnia alvei were most susceptible to cefepime, cefpirome and latamoxef (mic90: 0.13 to 0.5 mg/l) while cefotaxime (mic90: 8 mg/l) and piperacillin plus tazobactam (mic90: 8 and greater than 64 mg/l) were the least active compounds. sce 2787, cefepime and cefpirome were the most potent beta-lactams against the majority of the 13 species of non-fermentative bacilli (nfb) investigated (mic90: 0.5 to 16 mg/l). the oxacephems were the least active compounds against nfb. cefepime was the most active of the compounds included against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90: 16 mg/l). haemophilus spp., neisseria gonorrhoeae and bordetella pertussis were most susceptible to cefotaxime (mic90: 0.03 to 0.06 mg/l). latamoxef had the lowest activity of all compounds against gram-positive cocci. flomoxef was the most active compound against penicillinase producing staphylococcus aureus and about equally active as the other betalactams against methicillin susceptible staphylococci of other staphylococcal species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
associative growth of yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 with pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus in a diffusion apparatus. (ecologen).
to evaluate associative growth of psychorotrophic p. aeruginosa and s. aureus with y. enterocolitica 0:3, microorganisms were grown in trypticase soy broth in a diffusion apparatus (ecologen) and incubated for 9 days at 4 degrees c. the effects of culture interactions were determined by growth curves, lag times, generation times, ph changes and acid production. the observed growth curves for y. enterocolitica 0:3, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus, shows the stimulating effects of y. enterocolitica 0:3 on growth of psychotrophic microorganisms in associative culture at 4 degrees c, although it was later inhibited by these organisms as they reached the stationary phase, thus proving itself to be a poor competitor with common spoilage microorganism.
in-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ly163892.
ly163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. it inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group b streptococci and groups c, f, g and bovis streptococci with mics of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. mic90 of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. ly163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with mic90 values of 16 mg/l for escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis. it had no activity against enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and pseudomonas and bacteroides spp. ly163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. it was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. for tem-1, the km = 354.7 microm, vmax = 2.5 micromoles/min/mg of protein, p99 km = 24.3 microm, vmax = 28.9 microm/min/micrograms of protein, staph. aureus pc km = 47.4 microm, vmax = 2.7 micromoles/min/mg of protein. overall it had beta-lactamase stability similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.
comparative in vitro activity of a-56268 (te-031) against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and chlamydia trachomatis.
the in vitro activity of a-56268 (te-031) was determined and compared with that of 13 antibiotics against 401 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and 11 strains of chlamydia trachomatis. a-56268 was very active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and neisseria gonorrhoeae, and was among the most active of the agents tested against listeria monocytogenes, streptococci and chlamydia trachomatis. it was moderately active against haemophilus spp., vibrio spp., campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus. it was inactive against enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter coli, salmonella spp., shigella spp. and yersinia enterocolitica. a-56268 was not consistently bactericidal or more active than erythromycin for any organism except chlamydia trachomatis.
in vitro activity of ro 23-6240, a new fluorinated 4-quinolone.
the in vitro activity of ro 23-6240 (am833), 6,8-difluoro-1-(2-fluoroethyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7(4-methyl-1-piper azinyl) quinolone-3-carboxylic acid, was compared with those of norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. ro 23-6240 inhibited the majority of enterobacteriaceae isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml. it was especially active against shigella sp., salmonella sp., escherichia coli, and yersinia enterocolitica, with an mic for 90% of the strains of less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. the mic for 90% of the strains was 1 microgram/ml for serratia marcescens and 8 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa. staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant strains, were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. streptococcal and anaerobic species were inhibited by 8 to 16 micrograms/ml. ro 23-6240 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing bacteria resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins. the overall activity of ro 23-6240 was similar to those of enoxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. the frequency of spontaneous resistance was low, although resistant bacteria could be isolated by repeated subculture. the activity of ro 23-6240 was decreased in the presence of magnesium at concentrations similar to those present in urine.
