TI  == the use of maldi-tof mass spectrometry, ribotyping and phenotypic tests to identify lactic acid bacteria from fermented cereal foods in abidjan (cote d'ivoire).
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) protein analysis, automated ribotyping, and phenotypic tests (e.g., cell morphology, gas production from glucose, growth and acid production on homofermemtative-heterofermentative differential (hhd) agar medium, sugar fermentation patterns) were used to identify 23 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from fermented cereal foods available in abidjan, cote d'ivoire. pediococcus acidilactici (56.5%), lactobacillus fermentum (30.4%), l. salivarius  (4.3%), p. pentosaceus (4.3%) and l. plantarum subsp. plantarum (4.3%) were the species and subspecies identified. protein based identification was confirmed by  automated ribotyping for selected isolates and was similar to that provided by the phenotypic characterization. maldi-tof ms protein analysis provided a high level of discrimination among the isolates and could be used for the rapid screening of lab starter cultures.

TI  == administration of lactobacillus salivarius li01 or pediococcus pentosaceus li05 improves acute liver injury induced by d-galactosamine in rats.
AB  == this work investigated the effect of the intragastric administration of five lactic acid bacteria from healthy people on acute liver failure in rats. sprague-dawley rats were given intragastric supplements of lactobacillus salivarius li01, lactobacillus salivarius li02, lactobacillus paracasei li03, lactobacillus plantarum li04, or pediococcus pentosaceus li05 for 8 days. acute liver injury was induced on the eighth day by intraperitoneal injection of 1.1 g/kg body weight d-galactosamine (d-galn). after 24 h, samples were collected to  determine the level of liver enzymes, liver function, histology of the terminal ileum and liver, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, bacterial translocation, and composition of the gut microbiome. the results indicated that pretreatment with l. salivarius li01 or p. pentosaceus li05 significantly reduced elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, prevented the increase in total bilirubin, reduced the histological abnormalities of both the liver and the terminal ileum, decreased bacterial translocation, increased the serum level of interleukin 10 and/or interferon-gamma, and resulted in a cecal microbiome that differed from that of the liver injury control. pretreatment with l. plantarum li04 or l. salivarius li02 demonstrated no significant effects during this process, and pretreatment with l. paracasei li03 aggravated liver injury. to the best of our knowledge, the effects of the three species-l. paracasei, l. salivarius, and p. pentosaceus-on d-galn-induced liver injury have  not been previously studied. the excellent characteristics of l. salivarius li01  and p. pentosaceus li05 enable them to serve as potential probiotics in the prevention or treatment of acute liver failure.

TI  == potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria of human origin induce antiproliferation of colon cancer cells via synergic actions in adhesion to cancer cells and short-chain fatty acid bioproduction.
AB  == the activities and modes of probiotic action of lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant feces were investigated for alternative application in the prevention and biotherapy of colon cancer. from a total of 81 isolates of gram-positive rod  and cocci bacteria obtained from healthy infants, only 15 isolates had the probiotic criteria which included growth inhibition against eight food-borne pathogens, no blood hemolysis, and tolerance to gastrointestinal tract properties such as ph 2.5 and 0.3 % bile salt. four probiotic bacteria showed antiproliferation of colon cancer cells with the use of mtt and trypan blue exclusion assay at the rates of 17-35 %. through comparison of probiotic 16s rrna sequences, they were identified as pediococcus pentosaceus fp3, lactobacillus salivarius fp25, l. salivarius fp35, and enterococcus faecium fp51. finding the mechanism of proliferative inhibition of colon cancer cells in this study indicated synergic induction by probiotic bacteria directly adhered to these cancer cells and triggered the bioproduction of short-chain fatty acids, mainly butyric and propionic acids. this study suggested that the use of these probiotics may be suitable as an alternative bioprophylactic and biotherapeutic strategy for colon cancer.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == genotypic characterization and safety assessment of lactic acid bacteria from indigenous african fermented food products.
AB  == background: indigenous fermented food products play an essential role in the diet of millions of africans. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are among the predominant microbial species in african indigenous fermented food products and are used for  different applications in the food and biotechnology industries. numerous studies have described antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of lab from different parts  of the world. however, there is limited information on antimicrobial resistance profiles of lab from africa. the aim of this study was to characterize 33 lab previously isolated from three different african indigenous fermented food products using (gtg)5-based rep-pcr, sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and species-specific pcr techniques for differentiation of closely related species and further evaluate their antibiotic resistance profiles by the broth microdilution method and their haemolytic activity on sheep blood agar plates as  indicators of safety traits among these bacteria. results: using molecular biology based methods and selected phenotypic tests such as catalase reaction, co2 production from glucose, colonies and cells morphology, the isolates were identified as lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus ghanensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella confusa. the bacteria were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol,  clindamycin and erythromycin but resistant to vancomycin, kanamycin and streptomycin. variable sensitivity profiles to tetracycline and gentamicin was observed among the isolates with lb. plantarum, lb. salivarius, w. confusa (except strain sk9-5) and lb. fermentum strains being susceptible to tetracycline whereas pediococcus strains and lb. ghanensis strains were resistant. for gentamicin, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lb. ghanensis and ped. acidilactici strains were resistant to 64 mg/l whereas some w. confusa and lb. plantarum strains had a mic value of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l respectively. no beta-haemolytic activity was observed, however, alpha-haemolytic activity was observed in 27% (9) of the strains comprising lb. salivarius (6), w. confusa (2) and lb. delbrueckii  (1) isolates. conclusions: the resistance to kanamycin and vancomycin is probably an intrinsic feature since similar observations were reported in the literature for lab. low prevalence of pathogenicity indicator traits were observed among the isolates especially with the presence of poor haemolytic activities and they could therefore be considered as interesting candidates for selection of starter  cultures or probiotics for different applications.

TI  == the effect of prebiotics on production of antimicrobial compounds, resistance to  growth at low ph and in the presence of bile, and adhesion of probiotic cells to  intestinal mucus.
AB  == aims: screening of five bile salt-resistant and low ph-tolerant lactic acid bacteria for inhibitory activity against lactic acid bacteria and bacterial strains isolated from the faeces of children with hiv/aids. determining the effect of prebiotics and soy milk-base on cell viability and adhesion of cells to intestinal mucus. methods and results: lactobacillus plantarum 423, lactobacillus casei lhs, lactobacillus salivarius 241, lactobacillus curvatus df 38 and pediococcus pentosaceus 34 produced the highest level of antimicrobial activity (12,800 au ml(-1)) when grown in mrs broth supplemented with 2% (m/v) dextrose. growth in the presence of raftilose synergy1, raftilose l95 and raftiline gr did  not lead to increased levels of antimicrobial activity. cells grown in the presence of raftilose synergy1 took longer to adhere to intestinal mucus, whilst  cells grown in the absence of prebiotics showed a linear rate of binding. conclusions: a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were inhibited. dextrose stimulated the production of antimicrobial compounds. adhesion to intestinal mucus did not increase with the addition of prebiotics. significance and impact of the study: the strains may be incorporated in food supplements for hiv/aids patients suffering from gastro-intestinal disorders.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from aoc salers cheese.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

TI  == relative ability of orally administered lactobacillus murinus to predominate and  persist in the porcine gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == five porcine-derived lactobacillus or pediococcus isolates administered to pigs (n = 4), either singly or as a combination at approximately 10(10) cfu per day varied with respect to intestinal survival and persistence. two lactobacillus murinus strains survived best and were excreted at approximately 10(7) to 10(8) cfu/g of feces. in contrast, pediococcus pentosaceus dpc6006 had the lowest fecal count at approximately 10(5) cfu/g and was excreted at a significantly lower level than both l. murinus strains. fecal l. murinus dpc6003 counts were also significantly higher than both lactobacillus salivarius dpc6005 and lactobacillus pentosus dpc6004 ( approximately 10(6) cfu/g). the l. murinus strains persisted for at least 9 days postadministration in both the feces and the cecum. animals fed a combination of all five strains excreted approximately 10(7) cfu of the administered strains/g, with l. murinus predominating, as determined by randomly  amplified polymorphic dna pcr. postadministration, variation was observed between animals fed the strain combination, but in general, l. murinus dpc6002 and dpc6003 and l. pentosus dpc6004 predominated in the feces and the cecum while p.  pentosaceus dpc6006 was detected only in the cecum. fifteen days after the start  of culture administration, mean fecal enterobacteriaceae counts were significantly lower in some of the treatment groups. in addition, when mean preadministration counts were compared with those obtained after 21 days of culture administration, enterobacteriaceae counts were reduced by approximately 87 to 98% in pigs fed l. salivarius dpc6005, p. pentosaceus dpc6006, l. pentosus  dpc6004, and the culture mix. in conclusion, the porcine intestinal isolates have potential as probiotic feed additives for pigs, with differences in strain performance highlighting the advantages of using culture combinations.

TI  == two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy fa from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy fa. two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(s)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(s)-oh 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic  acid (10,13-oh 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including l. casei subsp. casei, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. lactis subsp. cremoris, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-oh 18:1). seven strains of l. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-oh 18:0) through 10-oh 18:1. linoleic acid at 2 g/l was converted by l. acidophilus  ifo13951t to 1.3 g of 13(s)-oh 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-oh 18:0 in 7 d. lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 1111 produced 10-oh 18:1 in 91% yield, and l. plantarum jcm 8341, 10-oh 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/l) under optimal conditions. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the  production of 13(s)-oh 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria,  and of 10,13-oh 18:0 by any bacteria.

TI  == microbiological characterization and probiotic potential of koko and koko sour water, african spontaneously fermented millet porridge and drink.
AB  == aims: to identify and examine the diversity of predominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) in koko and koko sour water (ksw) from different ghanaian production sites  with regard to pattern of fermentation (api 50 chl), genotype, antimicrobial activity, and resistance to low ph and bile salts. methods and results: in total  215 lab were isolated from koko and ksw. the isolates were identified using intergenic transcribed spacers (its)-pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp), api 50 chl, restriction enzyme analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (rea-pfge) and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the dominating micro-organisms in koko was found to be weisella confusa and lactobacillus fermentum, followed by lact. salivarius and pediococcus spp. chemometric data analysis were used to link the lab species to the different production stages and production sites. at intra-species level the isolates were found to have a great  diversity. the isolates were investigated for antimicrobial activity using agar diffusion assays, and acid and bile tolerance. most isolates showed low levels of antimicrobial activity towards the indicator strain listeria innocua, but not towards the bacteriocin-sensitive lact. sakei. growth of all lab isolates was unaffected by the presence of 0.3% (v/v) oxgall bile. the isolates were able to survive, but were not able to grow in growth medium adjusted to ph 2.5. conclusions: the dominating lab of koko and ksw were w. confusa and lact. fermentum showing a pronounced taxonomic biodiversity at sub-species level between stages within the production as well as between production sites. other species observed in ksw were lact. salivarius, ped. pentosaceus, ped. acidilactici and lact. paraplantarum. they occurred in levels of 108 cfu ml-1 in  fresh ksw and showed uniform antimicrobial activity, and acid and bile tolerance. significance and impact of the study: the present study gives a detailed picture  of the taxonomy and diversity of lab in an african-fermented millet product that  may have potential as a probiotic product for the local population. the chemometric tools principal component analysis and anova partial least squares regression were proven to be useful in the analysis of microbial groupings and associations with specific sites and stages in the production of koko and ksw.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == characterization and frequency distribution of species of lactic acid bacteria involved in the processing of mawe, a fermented maize dough from benin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria involved in the natural fermentation of both home-produced and commercial mawe were investigated during a 72 h fermentation period. lactobacillus spp. constitute the majority (94%) of the strains of the lactic acid bacteria isolated, among which 89% represent the betabacterium group. they include l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) (41%), l. fermentum or l. reuteri (19%), l. brevis (26%), l. confusus (less than 2%), l. curvatus (less than 1%) and l. buchneri (less than 1%). other isolated lactic acid bacteria were l. salivarius, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici and leuconostoc mesenteroides. several species were detected at the early stage of fermentation, but the final stage was dominated by l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) and l. fermentum or l. reuteri totalling 90% of the isolated strains. the trend was the same for both home-produced and commercial mawe. no strains of l. plantarum, generally reported as dominating lactic acid bacteria at the final stage of fermentation of most plant foods, were isolated.
