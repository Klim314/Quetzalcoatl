TI  == cofactor specificity of the bifunctional alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase (adhe) in wild-type and mutants of clostridium thermocellum and thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum.
AB  == clostridium thermocellum and thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum are thermophilic bacteria that have been engineered to produce ethanol from the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of biomass respectively. although engineered strains of t. saccharolyticum produce ethanol with a yield of 90% of the theoretical maximum, engineered strains of c. thermocellum produce ethanol at lower yields ( approximately 50% of theoretical maximum). in the course of engineering these strains, a number of mutations have been discovered in their adhe genes, which encode both alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh) enzymes. to understand the effect of these mutations, the adhe genes from six strains of c. thermocellum and t. saccharolyticum were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, followed by purification by affinity chromatography and enzyme activity measurement. in wild type strains of both organisms, nadh was the preferred cofactor for both aldh and adh activity. in high ethanol-producing ("ethanologen") strains of t. saccharolyticum, both aldh and adh activities showed increased nadph-linked activity. interestingly, the ethanologenic strain of c. thermocellum, adhe has acquired high nadph-linked adh  activity while maintaining nadh-linked aldh and adh activity at wild-type levels. when single amino acid mutations in adhe, that caused increased nadph-linked adh  activity, were introduced into c. thermocellum and t. saccharolyticum, ethanol production increased in both organisms. structural analysis was performed for the wild-type and mutant adhe proteins to provide explanations for the cofactor specificity change on a molecular level. importance: this work describes the characterization of the adhe enzyme from different strains of c. thermocellum and t. saccharolyticum. c. thermocellum and t. saccharolyticum are thermophilic anaerobes that have been engineered to make high yields of ethanol and can solubilize components of plant biomass and ferment the sugars to ethanol. in the  course of engineering these strains, several mutations arose in the bifunctional  alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase adhe, changing both enzyme activity and cofactor specificity. we show that changing adhe cofactor specificity from mostly nadh-linked to mostly nadph-linked resulted in higher ethanol production in c. thermocellum and t. saccharolyticum.

TI  == the bifunctional alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase gene, adhe, is necessary for  ethanol production in clostridium thermocellum and thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum.
AB  == thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum and clostridium thermocellum are anaerobic  thermophilic bacteria being investigated for their ability to produce biofuels from plant biomass. the bifunctional alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase gene, adhe, is present in these bacteria and has been known to be important for ethanol formation in other anaerobic alcohol producers. this study explores the inactivation of the adhe gene in c. thermocellum and t. saccharolyticum. deletion of adhe reduced ethanol production by >95% in both t. saccharolyticum and c. thermocellum, confirming that adhe is necessary for ethanol formation in both organisms. in both adhe deletion strains, fermentation products shifted from ethanol to lactate production and resulted in lower cell density and longer time  to reach maximal cell density. in t. saccharolyticum, the adhe deletion strain lost >85% of alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) activity. aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh)  activity did not appear to be affected, although aldh activity was low in cell extracts. adding ubiquinone-0 to the aldh assay increased activity in the t. saccharolyticum parent strain but did not increase activity in the adhe deletion  strain, suggesting that aldh activity was inhibited. in c. thermocellum, the adhe deletion strain lost >90% of aldh and adh activity in cell extracts. the c. thermocellum adhe deletion strain contained a point mutation in the lactate dehydrogenase gene, which appears to deregulate its activation by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, leading to constitutive activation of lactate dehydrogenase. importance: thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum and clostridium thermocellum are bacteria that have been investigated for their ability to produce biofuels from plant biomass. they have been engineered to produce higher yields of ethanol, yet questions remain about the enzymes responsible for ethanol formation in these bacteria. the genomes of these bacteria encode multiple predicted aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenases which could be responsible for alcohol formation. this study explores the inactivation of adhe, a gene encoding a bifunctional alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase. deletion of adhe reduced ethanol production by >95% in both t. saccharolyticum and c. thermocellum, confirming that adhe is necessary for ethanol formation in both organisms. in strains without adhe, we note changes in biochemical activity, product formation, and growth.

TI  == functional heterologous expression of an engineered full length cipa from clostridium thermocellum in thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum.
AB  == background: cellulose is highly recalcitrant and thus requires a specialized suite of enzymes to solubilize it into fermentable sugars. in c. thermocellum, these extracellular enzymes are present as a highly active multi-component system known as the cellulosome. this study explores the expression of a critical c. thermocellum cellulosomal component in t. saccharolyticum as a step toward creating a thermophilic bacterium capable of consolidated bioprocessing by employing heterologously expressed cellulosomes. results: we developed an inducible promoter system based on the native t. saccharolyticum xyna promoter, which was shown to be induced by xylan and xylose. the promoter was used to express the cellulosomal component cipa*, an engineered form of the wild-type cipa from c. thermocellum. expression and localization to the supernatant were both verified for cipa*. when a deltacipa mutant c. thermocellum strain was cultured with a cipa*-expressing t. saccharolyticum strain, hydrolysis and fermentation of 10 grams per liter sigmacell 101, a highly crystalline cellulose, were observed. this trans-species complementation of a cipa deletion demonstrated the ability for cipa* to assemble a functional cellulosome. conclusion: this study is the first example of an engineered thermophile heterologously expressing a structural component of a cellulosome. to achieve this goal we developed and tested an inducible promoter for controlled expression in t. saccharolyticum as well as a synthetic cipa. in addition, we demonstrate a high degree of hydrolysis (up to 93%) on microcrystalline cellulose.

TI  == redirecting carbon flux through exogenous pyruvate kinase to achieve high ethanol yields in clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == in clostridium thermocellum, a thermophilic anaerobic bacterium able to rapidly ferment cellulose to ethanol, pyruvate kinase (ec 2.7.1.40) is absent based on both the genome sequence and enzymatic assays. instead, a new pathway converting  phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate via a three-step pathway involving phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, nadh-linked malate dehydrogenase, and nadp-dependent malic enzyme has been found. we examined the impact of targeted modification of enzymes associated with this pathway, termed the "malate shunt",  including expression of the pyruvate kinase gene from thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum, mutation of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and deletion of malic enzyme gene. strain yd01 with exogenous pyruvate kinase, in which phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression was diminished by modifying the start codon from atg to gtg, exhibited 3.25-fold higher ethanol yield than the wild-type strain. a second strain, yd02 with exogenous pyruvate kinase, in which  the gene for malic enzyme and part of malate dehydrogenase were deleted, had over 3-fold higher ethanol yield than the wild-type strain.

TI  == urease expression in a thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum ethanologen allows high titer ethanol production.
AB  == genes encoding the enzyme urease were integrated in a thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum ethanologen. the engineered strain hydrolyzed urea, as evidenced  by increased cellular growth and elevated final ph in urea minimal medium and urease activity in cell free extracts. interestingly, replacement of ammonium salts with urea resulted in production of 54 g/l ethanol, one of the highest titers reported for thermoanaerobacterium. the observed increase in ethanol titer may result from reduced ph, salt, and osmolality stresses during fermentation. urea utilization is attractive for industrial scale fermentation, where ph control is technically challenging and increased ethanol titer is desirable.

TI  == thermochemical pre- and biological co-treatments to improve hydrolysis and methane production from poultry litter.
AB  == the biochemical methane potential (bmp) of raw poultry litter waste was assessed  in batch assays. biological co-treatment with clostridium cellulolyticum, caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticum and clostridium thermocellum as bioaugmentation strains, and thermochemical pre-treatments with lime and sodium hydroxide performed at different temperatures and pressures were applied as strategies to improve the bmp by favouring the hydrolysis of the cellulolytic material in the waste. anaerobic digestion of the raw waste allowed a specific methane production of 145 +/- 14 lch(4)kg(-1)vs, with 1% total solids and 0.72 g  vs(inoculum)g(-1)vs(waste). the pre- and co-treatments contributed to a significant increase (up to 74%) in the waste solubilisation when using c. saccharolyticum, but methane production did not improve considerably. therefore,  the conversion of soluble organic matter to methane was the limiting step of the  anaerobic digestion process of poultry litter waste.

TI  == high ethanol titers from cellulose by using metabolically engineered thermophilic, anaerobic microbes.
AB  == this work describes novel genetic tools for use in clostridium thermocellum that  allow creation of unmarked mutations while using a replicating plasmid. the strategy employed counter-selections developed from the native c. thermocellum hpt gene and the thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum tdk gene and was used to delete the genes for both lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and phosphotransacetylase (pta). the deltaldh deltapta mutant was evolved for 2,000 h, resulting in a stable strain with 40:1 ethanol selectivity and a 4.2-fold increase in ethanol yield over the wild-type strain. ethanol production from cellulose was investigated with an engineered coculture of organic acid-deficient engineered strains of both c. thermocellum and t. saccharolyticum. fermentation of 92 g/liter avicel by this coculture resulted in 38 g/liter ethanol, with acetic and  lactic acids below detection limits, in 146 h. these results demonstrate that ethanol production by thermophilic, cellulolytic microbes is amenable to substantial improvement by metabolic engineering.

TI  == role of spontaneous current oscillations during high-efficiency electrotransformation of thermophilic anaerobes.
AB  == current oscillations at about 24 mhz were observed during electrotransformation (et) of the thermophilic anaerobes clostridium thermocellum atcc 27405, c. thermocellum dsm 1313, and thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum ys 485, using a  pulse gated by a square signal generated by a custom generator. in experiments in which only the field strength was varied, all three of these strains resulted in  a one-to-one correspondence between the appearance of current oscillations and successful et. oscillations accompanied et of both c. thermocellum strains only at field strengths of > or =12 kv/cm, and et was only observed above the same threshold. similarly, for t. saccharolyticum, oscillations were only observed at  field strengths of > or =10 kv/cm, and et was only observed above the same threshold. when a passive electrical filter consisting of an inductor and resistor in parallel was added to the system to prevent the development of oscillations, et efficiencies were reduced dramatically for all three strains at  all field strengths tested. the maximum tested field strength, 25 kv/cm, resulted in the maximum measured transformation efficiency for all three strains. at this  field strength, the efficiency of et in the absence of oscillations was decreased compared to that observed in the presence of oscillations by 500-fold for c. thermocellum atcc 27405, 2,500-fold for c. thermocellum dsm 1313, and 280-fold for t. saccharolyticum. controls using the same apparatus with escherichia coli cells or a resistor with a value representative of the direct current resistance  of typical cell samples did not develop oscillations, and et efficiencies obtained with e. coli were the same with or without the electrical filter included in the pulse generator circuit. the results are interpreted to indicate  that spontaneously arising oscillations have a large beneficial effect on transformation efficiency in the system employed here and that the development of oscillations in this system is affected by the cell species present.

TI  == advances in development of a genetic system for thermoanaerobacterium spp.: expression of genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes, development of a second shuttle  vector, and integration of genes into the chromosome.
AB  == despite recent success in transforming various thermophilic gram-type-positive anaerobes with plasmid dna, use of shuttle vectors for the expression of genes other than antibiotic resistance markers has not previously been described. we constructed new vectors in order to express heterologous hydrolytic enzymes in our model system, thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum jw/sl-ys485. transformed  thermoanaerobacterium expressed active enzyme, indicating that this system may function as an alternate expression host, especially for genes with a thermophilic origin. to develop further the genetic system for t. saccharolyticum jw/sl-ys485, two improved escherichia coli-thermoanaerobacterium shuttle vectors, prkm1 and prukm, were constructed. furthermore, the kanamycin resistance cassette alone and the kanamycin resistance cassette plus the cellobiohydrolase gene (cbha) from clostridium thermocellum jw20 were integrated into the xylanase gene  (xyna) region of the thermoanaerobacterium chromosome via homologous recombination using puc-based suicide vectors puxk and puxkc.

TI  == family 10 and 11 xylanase genes from caldicellulosiruptor sp. strain rt69b.1.
AB  == three family 10 xylanase genes (xyna, xynb, and xync) and a single family 11 xylanase gene (xynd) were identified from the extreme thermophile caldicellulosiruptor strain rt69b.1 through the use of consensus pcr in conjunction with sequencing and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these genes appear to comprise the complete endoxylanase system of rt69b.1. the xyna gene was found to be homologous to the xyna gene of the closely related caldicellulosiruptor strain rt8b.4, and primers designed previously to amplify the rt8b.4 xyna gene could amplify homologous full-length xyna gene fragments from rt69b.1. the complete nucleotide sequences of the rt69b.1 xynb, xync, and xynd genes were obtained using genomic walking pcr. the full-length xynb and xync genes are more than 5 kb in length and encode highly modular enzymes that are the largest xylanases reported to date. xynb has an architecture similar to the family 10 xylanases from thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum (xyna) and clostridium thermocellum (xynx) and may be cell wall associated, while xync is a  bifunctional enzyme with an architecture similar to the bifunctional beta-glycanases from caldicellulosiroptor saccharolyticus. the xynd gene encodes  a two-domain family 11 xylanase that is identical in architecture to the xynb family 11 xylanase from the unrelated extreme thermophile dictyoglomus thermophilum strain rt46b.1. the sequence similarities between the rt69b.1 xylanases with respect to their evolution are discussed.

TI  == cela, another gene coding for a multidomain cellulase from the extreme thermophile caldocellum saccharolyticum.
AB  == caldocellum saccharolyticum is an extremely thermophilic anaerobic bacterium capable of growth on cellulose and hemicellulose as sole carbon sources. cellulase and hemicellulase genes have been found clustered together on its genome. the gene for one of the cellulases (cela) was isolated on a lambda genomic library clone, sequenced and found to comprise a large open-reading frame of 5253 base pairs that could be translated into a peptide of 1751 amino acids. to date, it is the largest cellulase gene sequenced. the translated product is a  multidomain structure composed of two catalytic domains and two cellulose-binding domains linked by proline-threonine-rich regions (pt linkers). the n-terminal domain of cela encodes for an endoglucanase activity on carboxymethylcellulose, consistent with its high homology to the sequences of several other endo-1, 4-beta-d-glucanases. the carboxyterminal domain shows sequence homology with a cellulase from clostridium thermocellum (cels), which is known to act synergistically with a second component to hydrolyze crystalline cellulose. in the absence of a caldocellum homologue for this second protein, we can detect no  activity from this domain.

TI  == evidence for a general role for non-catalytic thermostabilizing domains in xylanases from thermophilic bacteria.
AB  == a genomic library of clostridium thermocellum dna constructed in lambda zapii was screened for xylanase-expressing clones. cross-hybridization experiments revealed a new xylanase gene isolated from the gene library, which was designated xyn y. the encoded enzyme, xylanase y (xyly), displayed features characteristic of an endo-beta1,4-xylanase: the enzyme rapidly hydrolysed oat spelt, wheat and rye arabinoxylans and was active against methyl-umbelliferyl-beta-d-cellobioside, but did not hydrolyse any cellulosic substrates. the ph and temperature optima of the enzyme were 6.8 and 75 degrees c respectively, and the recombinant xyly, expressed by escherichia coli had a maximum mr of 116000. the nucleotide sequence of xyn y contained an open reading frame of 3228 bp encoding a protein of predicted mr 120 105. the encoded enzyme contained a typical n-terminal 26-residue signal peptide, followed by a 164 amino acid sequence, designated domain a, that was not essential for catalytic activity. downstream of domain a was a 351-residue xylanase family f catalytic domain, followed by a 180-residue sequence that exhibited 28% sequence identity with a thermostable domain of thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum xylanase a. the c-terminal portion of xyly  comprised the 23-residue duplicated docking sequence found in all other c. thermocellum plant cell wall hydrolases that are constituents of the bacterium's  multienzyme complex, termed the cellulosome, followed by a 286-residue domain which exhibited 32% sequence identity with the n-terminal region of c. thermocellum xylanase z. the enzyme did not contain linker sequences found in other c. thermocellum plant cell wall hydrolases. analysis of truncated forms of  xyly and hybrid proteins, comprising segments of xyly fused to the e. coli maltose binding domain, confirmed that xyly contained a central catalytic domain  and an adjacent thermostable domain. the c-terminal domain did not bind to cellulose or xylan. western blot analysis using antiserum raised against xyly showed that the xylanase was located in the cellulosome and did not appear to be  extensively glycosylated. the non-catalytic domains of xyly are discussed in relation to the general stability of thermophilic xylanases.

TI  == domain structure of the acetogenium kivui surface layer revealed by electron crystallography and sequence analysis.
AB  == the three-dimensional structure of the acetogenium kivui surface layer (s-layer)  has been determined to a resolution of 1.7 nm by electron crystallographic techniques. two independent reconstructions were made from layers negatively stained with uranyl acetate and na-phosphotungstate. the s-layer has p6 symmetry  with a center-to-center spacing of approximately 19 nm. within the layer, six monomers combine to form a ring-shaped core surrounded by a fenestrated rim and six spokes that point towards the axis of threefold symmetry and provide lateral  connectivity to other hexamers in the layer. the structure of the a. kivui s-layer protein is very similar to that of the bacillus brevis middle wall protein, with which it shares an n-terminal domain of homology. this domain is found in several other extracellular proteins, including the s-layer proteins from bacillus sphaericus and thermus thermophilus, omp alpha from thermotoga maritima, an alkaline cellulase from bacillus strain ksm-635, and xylanases from  clostridium thermocellum and thermoanaerobacter saccharolyticum, and may serve to anchor these proteins to the peptidoglycan. to our knowledge, this is the first example of a domain conserved in several s-layer proteins.

TI  == cloning and dna sequence of the gene coding for clostridium thermocellum cellulase ss (cels), a major cellulosome component.
AB  == clostridium thermocellum atcc 27405 produces an extracellular cellulase system capable of hydrolyzing crystalline cellulose. the enzyme system involves a multicomponent protein aggregate (the cellulosome) with a total molecular weight  in the millions, impeding mechanistic studies. however, two major components of the aggregate, ss (m(r) = 82,000) and sl (m(r) = 250,000), which act synergistically to hydrolyze crystalline cellulose, have been identified (j. h. d. wu, w. h. orme-johnson, and a. l. demain, biochemistry 27:1703-1709, 1988). to further study this synergism, we cloned and sequenced the gene (cels) coding for  the ss (cels) protein by using a degenerate, inosine-containing oligonucleotide probe whose sequence was derived from the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the cels protein. the open reading frame of cels consisted of 2,241 bp encoding 741 amino acid residues. it encoded the n-terminal amino acid sequence and two internal peptide sequences determined for the native cels protein. a putative ribosome binding site was identified at the 5' end of the gene. a putative signal peptide of 27 amino acid residues was adjacent to the n terminus of the cels protein. the predicted molecular weight of the secreted protein was 80,670. the cels gene contained a conserved reiterated sequence encoding 24 amino acid residues found in proteins encoded by many other clostridial cel or xyn genes. a  palindromic structure was found downstream from the open reading frame. the cels  gene is unique among the known cel genes of c. thermocellum. however, it is highly homologous to the partial open reading frame found in c. cellulolyticum and in caldocellum saccharolyticum, indicating that these genes belong to a new family of cel genes.

TI  == sequence analysis of the clostridium stercorarium celz gene encoding a thermoactive cellulase (avicelase i): identification of catalytic and cellulose-binding domains.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the celz gene coding for a thermostable endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (avicelase i) of clostridium stercorarium was determined. the structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 2958 bp which encodes a  preprotein of 986 amino acids with an mr of 109,000. the signal peptide cleavage  site was identified by comparison with the n-terminal amino acid sequence of avicelase i purified from c. stercorarium culture supernatants. the recombinant protein expressed in escherichia coli is proteolytically cleaved into catalytic and cellulose-binding fragments of about 50 kda each. sequence comparison revealed that the n-terminal half of avicelase i is closely related to avocado (persea americana) cellulase. homology is also observed with clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase d and pseudomonas fluorescens cellulase. the cellulose-binding region was located in the c-terminal half of avicelase i. it consists of a reiterated domain of 88 amino acids flanked by a repeated sequence  about 140 amino acids in length. the c-terminal flanking sequence is highly homologous to the non-catalytic domain of bacillus subtilis endoglucanase and caldocellum saccharolyticum endoglucanase b. it is proposed that the enhanced cellulolytic activity of avicelase i is due to the presence of multiple cellulose-binding sites.

TI  == cloning, sequence analysis, and expression of genes encoding xylan-degrading enzymes from the thermophile "caldocellum saccharolyticum".
AB  == a lambda recombinant bacteriophage coding for xylanase and beta-xylosidase activity has been isolated from a genomic library of the extremely thermophilic anaerobe "caldocellum saccharolyticum." partial sau3ai fragments of the lambda recombinant dna were ligated into pbr322. a recombinant plasmid with an insertion of ca. 7 kilobases of thermophilic dna expressing both enzymatic activities was isolated. the location of the genes has been established by analyzing deletion derivatives, and the dna sequence of 6.067 kilobases of the insert has been determined. five open reading frames (orfs) were found, one of which (orf1; mr 40,455) appears to code for a xylanase (xyna) which also acts on o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside. another, orf5 (mr 56,365), codes for a beta-xylosidase (xynb). the xyna gene product shows significant homology with the xylanases from the alkalophilic bacillus sp. strain c125 and clostridium thermocellum.
