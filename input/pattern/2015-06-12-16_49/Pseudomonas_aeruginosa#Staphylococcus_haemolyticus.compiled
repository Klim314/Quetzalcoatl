TI  - Bacterial bloodstream infections and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in pediatric hematology/oncology patients after anticancer chemotherapy.
AB  - PURPOSE: Bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology and oncology represent a  major problem worldwide, but this has not been studied in Qatar. In this study, we investigated the burden of infection and the resistance pattern in the bacterial etiology, in the only tertiary pediatric hematology and oncology center in Qatar. METHODS: All pediatric cancer patients (n=185) were evaluated retrospectively during the period 2004-2011; a total of 70 (38%) patients were diagnosed with bloodstream infections. Bacterial etiology was determined, along with their susceptibility patterns. Neutropenia, duration of neutropenia, fever, duration of fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated throughout the study. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients (38%) were diagnosed with acute leukemias, lymphomas, solid tumors, or brain tumors; those patients experienced 111 episodes of bacteremia. The most common Gram-positive (n=64 [55%]) isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=26), Staphylococcus hominis (n=9), and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=7), and the common Gram-negative (n=52 [45%]) isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=10), and Escherichia coli (n=7). There was a significant association observed between fever with positive blood culture and different types of cancer (P=0.035). The majority of bacteremia (n=68 [61.3%]) occurred in nonneutropenic episodes. Elevated values of CRP (>/=5 mg/L) were detected in 82 (95.3%) episodes and were negatively correlated with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (r=-0.18; P=0.248) among all cases. However, the infection-related fatality rate was 2.2% (n=4), with three caused by Gram-negative pathogens. Multidrug resistant organisms were implicated in 33 (28.4%) cases and caused three of the mortality cases. CONCLUSION: Multidrug resistant organisms cause mortality in pediatric cancer patients. Investigation of antimicrobial susceptibility of these organisms may guide successful antimicrobial therapy and improve the surveillance and quality of pediatric malignancy care.
TI  - Etiologic diagnosis and clinical treatment of multiple drug-resistant bacteria infection in elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia after neurosurgery.
AB  - Our objective is to analyze the etiology and antibiotics resistance rate of multiple drug-resistant bacteria infection in elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia from Neurosurgery Department, providing a reference for clinical treatment. Sputum of 372 elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) from Neurosurgery Department was collected for sputum culture and drug sensitivity test, and pathogenic bacteria distribution and drug resistance rate of antibiotics were discussed. Among 372 pathogenic bacteria, there were 95 cases with Gram-positive cocci, the percentage was 15.32 %; there were 277 cases with Gram-negative bacilli, the percentage was 59.95 %; there were 54 cases with fungus, the percentage was 14.51 %; the common Gram-positive cocci included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with percentages of 15.32 %, 2.96 % and 4.30 % respectively; the common Gram-negative bacilli included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with percentages of 23.92 %, 14.25 % and 9.95 % respectively; the highest drug resistance rates of Staphylococcus aureus were 100.00 % to penicillin, erythrocin and oxacillin, the highest drug resistance rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis was 87.50 % to erythrocin, the highest drug resistance rate of Staphylococcus haemolyticus was 100.00 % to penicillin and erythrocin, the lowest drug resistance rates of three Gram-negative bacilli were 0 % to teicoplanin and vancomycin; the highest drug resistance rates of Escherichia coli were 100.00 % to ceftriaxone and ticarcillin, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 11.32 % to ciprofloxacin; the highest drug resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100.00 % to ceftriaxone, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 22.47 % to imipenem; the highest drug resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae was 81.08 % to aztreonam, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 0.00 % to imipenem. Stroke-associated pneumonia is common clinically in elderly patients from Neurology Department, the early-stage and rational use of antibiotics should be applied according to the etiologic distribution and drug resistance characteristics. Meanwhile, prevention measures should be applied.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates recovered from a tertiary care hospital in Al Qassim, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergences of antimicrobial-resistances have become an important  issue in global healthcares. Limitations in surveying hinder the actual estimates of resistance in many countries. THE AIM: the present study was designed to retrospectically survey antimicrobial susceptibility for resistance profiling of dominant pathogens in a tertiary-care center in Buraidah, Saudi Arabia from January-2011 to December-2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: the design was cross-sectional and spanned records of a 1000 bacterial non-related isolates. Antibiograms were based on the 2012 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli, were the most resistant. All isolates of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were resistant to penicillin (100%), and oxacillin with 52%, 75%, and 82%, respectively. Interestingly, an increasing trend of resistance-pattern was seen for the three species against gentamicin 26%, 50%, 68% ciprofloxacin 22%, 50%, 68%, tetracycline 30%, 44%, 27%, erythromycin 26%, 64%, 73%, and clindamycin 20%, 47%, 50% suggesting potential between-species transfer of resistances. Acinetobacter baumannii was resistances to all antibiotics tested including ciprofloxacin (90%), ceftazidime (89%), cefepime (67%), Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (66%), amikacin (63%), gentamicin (51%), tetracycline (43%), piperacillin-tazobactam (42%), and imipenem (9%). A similar pattern was seen by P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, a typical pattern of resistance in K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms was observed. CONCLUSION: we have shown staphylococci, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteric bacteria were the most resistant species in this region.
TI  - [Identification of microorganisms based on the effect of giant Raman scattering].
AB  - AIM: Development and evaluation of express diagnostics of microorganisms for reduction of time spent on study execution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Giant Raman scattering effect and proposed substrate with metallic nano-balls of silver were used for identification and indication of microorganisms. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtillis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as objects of study. All the microorganisms were cultivated in dense nutrient media and non-fluorescent microbiological membrane filters. RESULTS: Giant Raman scattering method on the substrates used increases sensitivity of indication and specificity of identification of microbes compared with other existing express methods and allows to see the signal from a single bacterium when exposed to laser light. The methodic proposed was also used to determine sensitivity of bacteria to antimicrobial preparations. CONCLUSION: The proposed hardware and method may be used for express diagnostics of processes of microbial nature.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of various topical antimicrobial agents in different time periods from contamination to application against 6 multidrug-resistant bacterial strains isolated from burn patients.
AB  - AIM: In vitro efficacy evaluation of eleven topical antimicrobials against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria isolated from burn wounds of our patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Growth of six MDR bacterial strains: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 strains), Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli in burn-wound models was evaluated 24-h after application of the tested agents. Four different wound models were created to investigate the role of time elapsed between inoculation of bacteria and application of the agents on their antimicrobial activity and efficacy. RESULTS: The efficacy against all the 6 bacteria in freshly contaminated wounds was excellent in majority of the tested agents. The longer was the time interval between inoculation and application of the topical antimicrobial agents, the higher failure of the agents was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Topical antimicrobials play an important role in treatment of burn wounds, but they should be used according to their efficacy against bacterial strains present in patients' wounds. In cases where topical agents have been applied after 24 h, when formation of mature biofilm in the wound could be expected, it would probably not be possible to kill all the bacteria using topical antimicrobial therapy only.
TI  - Comparison on conjunctival sac bacterial flora of the seniors with dry eye in Ganzi autonomous prefecture.
AB  - AIM: To compare the bacterial flora in palpebral conjunctiva of xerophthalmia seniors of Tibetan, Yi and Han, and analyze the differences and similarities of the bacteria. METHODS: The test subjects were selected from 2 Tibetan, 2 Yi and 3 Han populated places, respectively. Total 222 seniors (444 eyes) with dry eye were examined. Secretion was collected from the palpebral conjunctiva of the subjects and then inoculated onto a blood agar plate. After 48h of incubation, the bacteria were examined for the differences and similarities between different ethnics. RESULTS: There was no significant difference (P>0.05) of Gram stain characterization, dominant bacteria and number of the bacterial species present in oxrophthalmia patients among Tibetan, Yi and Han nationalities. The bacteria presented in all groups include staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacteria detected from the two of three ethnic groups were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae, and staphylococcus heads. The incidence rate of bacteria-associated dry eye in Tibetan population was significantly lower than that of Han and Yi population. CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference in the bacteria flora of palpebral conjunctiva observed among dry eye elder populations of Tibetan, Yi and Han people. All of staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae and staphylococcus heads are common bacteria flora of the three nationalities inhibiting in this area.
TI  - [Atypical agents of wound infection and targeted samples].
AB  - All open wounds are primarily contaminated and subsequently colonized by microorganisms, predominantly bacteria. Only about 30% of chronic wounds are also infected. Factors which favor the development of infection are the following: large quantity of bacteria, presence of virulence factors, their quantity and number, predominantly the synergy of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and formation of biofilm. Common agents of infection of acute and chronic wounds are Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides spp., and Candida albicans. Difference between acute and chronic wound is in the predominance of individual agents, with an observation that Staphylococcus aureus is predominant in both cases. Atypical agents of chronic wound infection are rare, unusual, not found in the area in which we live, not proven by standard microbiological methods, but molecular methods are needed instead. They are predominantly opportunists, varying in the expression of virulence factors, or they have changed their phenotype characteristics and are not the agents of primary wound infections. They are the agents of secondary infections. Atypical agents of the chronic wound infection are diverse, from the anaerobe group, Peptoniphilus spp., Anaerococcus spp., Bacteroides ureolyticus, Finegoldia magma, the group of gram positive rods of the Corynebacterium genus, the group of bacteria from aquatic environment Mycobacterium fortuitum complex, and Vibrio alginolyticus. The targeted samples are biopsy sample as the "gold standard" and/or aspirate, when a significant quantity of exudate is present. Targeted samples are obligatory when there is a progression and decomposition of the base of the wound, increase in the size or depth of the wound, isolation of multiresistant microbes, or absence of clinical response to empirical antimicrobial therapy. In the diagnosis of opportunistic pathogens or atypical agents of chronic wound infection, it is necessary to be thorough, meticulous, and conduct revision of the patient, diagnosis, treatment and samples. Crucial for the detection of the agents atypical wound infection is discussion and agreement with clinical microbiologist. Essential for the quality diagnosis is decontamination of the wound before taking targeted samples. The targeted sample is biopsy specimen as the "gold standard", less frequently aspirate, depending on the quantity and content of the wound. Swab as a sample is not recommended. If there is no other choice, only exceptionally surface swabs may be taken, but only under the following conditions: decontamination of the wound with the application of Levine's or Z-technique of taking of swabs.
TI  - Comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. By use of a sensitive enrichment broth, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the Referral Clinic in Eritrea and at a German University Hospital. In the German cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for Gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (n=8; MRSA (n=2)), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), Corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and Streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). In comparison, the Eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. Among the identified species were S. aureus (n=2), S. epidermidis (n=13), Streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and Gram-negative rods including Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), Enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), Escherichia coli (n=2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). Noteworthy, none of the Eritrean patients were positive for MRSA. In both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. However, we observed in two subjects of the Eritrean cohort co-colonization with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. The occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the German cohort, whereas in the Eritrean cohort Gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. Continued surveillance of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.
TI  - Validation of the BacT/ALERT(R) 3D System for Rapid Sterility Testing of Biopharmaceutical Samples.
AB  - The BacT/ALERT(R) 3D system was validated to determine the sterility of different types of biopharmaceutical samples such as water for injection, unprocessed bulk, and finished bulk. The installation, operation, and performance qualification were completed and verified under good manufacturing practices. During the installation and operation validation stages, the functionality and security of the system and software were completed and verified. For the performance qualification, 11 microorganisms were evaluated, six compendial (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, Clostridium sporogenes), one representing the number one microbial species in sterile product recalls (Burkholderia cepacia), and four environmental isolates (Kocuria rhizophila, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Methylobacterium radiotolerans, and Penicillium spp.). Nine of the microorganisms were spiked into three different types of biopharmaceutical samples by three different analysts on different days to ascertain the equivalence, ruggedness, sensitivity, time of detection, and repeatability. In all samples, the BacT/ALERT(R) exhibited equivalent or better detection than the standard test. With the exception of M. radiotolerans, all 11 microorganisms were detected within 2.5 days using the BacT/ALERT(R) system and the standard test. The detection times for M. radiotolerans in the three sample types averaged 5.77 days. The minimum detectable level of cells for all the microorganisms tested was found to be within 1 to 2 CFU. The system optimized sterility testing by the simultaneous on-line, non-destructive incubation and detection of microbial growth.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and phytochemical screening of serial extracts from leaves of Aegle marmelos (Linn.).
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of serial petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol extracts from leaves of Aegle mawmelos were investigated against bacterial and fungal species. All the extracts exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity with zones of inhibition ranging from 10 to 22 mm against bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, beta Streptococcus haemolyticus group A, Proteus mimrabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aenrginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, fungi: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Aspergillusflavus. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and the minimal microbicidal concentrations (MMC) of the extracts ranged from 1.25 to 10 mg/mL and 2.5 to 20 mg/mL respectively. Assessment of antibacterial efficacy of different extract revealed that Staphylococcus aureus, beta Streptococcus haemolyticus group A, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli showed high susceptibility to petroleum ether extract. Proteus mimrabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae showed high susceptibility to chloroform extract and Salmonella typhi showed high susceptibility to methanol extract. Petroleum ether extract exhibited the highest antifungal efficacy against all tested fungal species. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of phenols, sterols in petroleum ether and chloroform extracts, whereas tannins, flavonoids, coumarins, saponins and triterpenoids in methanol extract. The ability of the leaf extracts of Aegle manmelos to inhibit growth of bacteria and fungi is an indication of its broad spectrum antimicrobial activity which could be a potential source for development of novel bioactive antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Identification of unknown ocular pathogens in clinically suspected eye infections using ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis.
AB  - DNA sequence-based identification of pathogens from ocular samples of patients with clinically suspected eye infections was accomplished using 16S and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis. PCR was positive for 24 of 99 samples tested. Both culture and 16S rDNA sequence analysis identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococci and Enterobacteriaceae. Isolates misidentified as Burkholderia cepacia by biochemical tests were identified as Ralstonia mannitolilytica by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Sequence analysis identified the following microorganisms from 19 culture-negative samples: Haemophilus influenzae, Sphingomonas sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Morganella morganii, Mycobacterium sp., Chryseobacterium sp., Pseudomonas saccharophila (Xanthomonas) and the fungus, Phaeoacremonium inflatipes.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - Metabolism of azo dyes by human skin microbiota.
AB  - Reduction of Methyl Red (MR) and Orange II (Or II) by 26 human skin bacterial species was monitored by a rapid spectrophotometric assay. The analysis indicated that skin bacteria, representing the genera Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Micrococcus, Dermacoccus and Kocuria, were able to reduce MR by 74-100 % in 24 h, with only three species unable to reduce completely the dye in that time. Among the species tested, only Corynebacterium xerosis was unable to reduce Or II to any degree by 24 h, and only Staphylococcus delphini, Staphylococcus sciuri subsp. sciuri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were able to reduce completely this dye within 24 h. MR reduction started with early-exponential growth in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and around late-exponential/early-stationary growth in P. aeruginosa. Reduction of Or II, Ponceau S and Ponceau BS started during late-exponential/early-stationary growth for all three species. Using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analyses, MR metabolites produced by Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa were identified as N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and 2-aminobenzoic acid. Searches of available genomic and proteomic data revealed that at least four of the staphylococci in this study, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staph. epidermidis, Staphylococcus cohnii and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, have hypothetical genes with 77, 76, 75 and 74 % sequence identity to azo1 encoding an azoreductase from Staph. aureus and hypothetical proteins with 82, 80, 72 and 74 % identity to Azo1, respectively. In addition, Staphylococcus capitis has a protein with 79 % identity to Azo1. Western analysis detected proteins similar to Azo1 in all the staphylococci tested, except Staph. delphini, Staph. sciuri subsp. sciuri and Staphylococcus auricularis. The data presented in this report will be useful in the risk assessment process for evaluation of public exposure to products containing these dyes.
TI  - The epidemiological analyses of trauma patients in Chongqing teaching hospitals following the Wenchuan earthquake.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Well-equipped comprehensive hospitals may provide better emergency and patient services for the recovery of injured patients from the earthquake zone. This study aimed to provide an overview of injuries among the patients admitted to the six teaching hospitals in Chongqing, China, after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 533 earthquake victims who were treated and followed-up by the six hospitals were analysed retrospectively. Patients' demographic data, diagnosis, microbiological assessment and dispositions were reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 533 patients, 45.0% patients had an Injury Severity Score (ISS) below 8, 41.1% had an ISS between 9 and 14 and 13.9% had an ISS above 15. The patients were classified based on their fracture sites as follows: head and neck (7.9%), face (1.3%), chest (21.4%), abdomen and pelvis (15.2%), limb and pelvis (58.9%) and body surface (38.5%). Of the 533 patients, 41.6% had a single fracture site, 32.1% had two combined fracture sites and 26.3% had more than three combined fracture sites, while 32 (6.0%) patients suffered from amputation, 3.9% suffered from crush syndrome and 52.7% underwent surgical operations at the hospitals. Seventy-nine (14.8%) patients suffered from infections, including 87.3% of pre-hospital infections. The results from bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility assays showed that the infectious bacteria mainly involved Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Baumanii, Aerobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, C type chain coccus and Bacillus aerogenes capsulatus. The sensitivity of various bacterial strains to antibiotics did not exhibit obvious changes, except that the previously multi-drug-resistant hospital bacteria were sensitive to antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: For emergency conditions after a catastrophe, comprehensive hospitals must be prepared to meet the massive numbers of severely injured patients. Trauma patients from delayed rescue and admission should be given broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as cephalosporin and macrolide antibiotics. The selection of antibiotics in the combination therapy, as described in this study, may greatly enhance the effectiveness of early specific treatments and prevent severe trauma complications in future natural disasters.
TI  - [Effect of phytosubstances with antioxidant activity on persistence properties of microorganisms].
AB  - The in vitro effect of phytosubstances containing flavonoids and phenylpropanoids on the antilysozyme activity of varioous groups of microorganisms, such as staphylococci, bacilli, enterobacteria and nonfermenting bacteria was studied. The second fraction of the pink carbonic acid extract showed high antioxidant activity and most efficiently inhibited the ability of various microorganisms to inactivate the host lysozyme. The selected phytosubstance could be useful in clinical practice as an additional antimicrobial agent in etiotropic therapy or prophylaxis of some infections.
TI  - Tuberculosis in southern Chinese renal-transplant recipients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the characteristics of tuberculosis (TB) in Southern Chinese renal transplant recipients, and summarize the corresponding experiences in diagnosis and management. METHOD: Retrospectively study 41 documented post-transplant TB cases out of the 2333 patients who received kidney transplantation in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between Jan. 1991 and Apr. 2007. RESULTS: TB in the post-renal-transplant population in Southern China displayed the following characteristics: (i) high incidence within a short time after transplantation, the median interval between renal transplantation and diagnosis of TB was 8 months (range: 1-156 months) and 56.1% were diagnosed within the first year post-transplant; (ii) high prevalence (51.2%) of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis; (iii) high co-infection rate (19.5%), pathogens included candida albicans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter haemolyticus and cytomegalovirus; (iv) fever (82.9%), cough (56.1%) and sputum (39.0%) are the most common clinical manifestations; (v) purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD) skin test had little diagnostic value in this group with a negative result in all 41 cases; (vi) acute rejection (29.3%) and liver function damage (17.1%) were the main adverse effects of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy; (vii) mortality of patients with post-transplant tuberculosis reached up to 22.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese renal transplant recipients face a high risk of TB because of their immuno-compromised state and epidemiological prevalence of the disease. Therefore, attention should be given to this differential diagnosis in clinical practice. Balancing the benefits and disadvantages of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy is of importance for this specific population.
TI  - Bacterial colonization in suspected sexually abused children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies concluded that symptomatic prepubertal children with  Gardnerella vaginalis infection should be investigated for child sexual abuse. Gardnerella vaginalis is only one out of a group of organism that cause bacterial vaginosis. The aim of the study was to report the frequency of bacterial colonization as well as sexually transmitted diseases and to correlate these data with patient characteristics. METHODS: Data were collected from 1996 to 2006. Medical records of 180 girls, median age at first sexual abuse 7.44 years (range 1-16, SD 3.937), have been evaluated retrospectively. SPSS software 12.0 has been used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Only 18.3% of patients complained of vaginal discharge or pruritus. Sexually transmitted diseases were documented: Gonorrhoea 1 (1.8%, 56 tested), Chlamydia trachomatis 1 (1.6%, 62 tested), Syphilis 0 (0%, 5 tested), Trichomonas vaginalis 1 (0.7%, 136 tested) and HIV 0 (0%, 27 tested). Bacterial colonization were documented (121 tested): Gardnerella vaginalis 29 (24%), Enterobacteriaceae 50 (41.3%), Haemophilus influenzae 11 (9.1%), Streptococcus a haemolyticus 35 (28.9%), Streptococcus Group B 8 (6.6%), Staphylococcus Koag neg. 37 (30.6%), Staphylococcus aureus 10 (8.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (4.1%), Bacteroides 19 (15.7%), Prevotella 24 (19.8%), Klebsiella 4 (3.3%), Corynebacteria 20 (16.5%) and Ureaplasma 9 (7.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Sexually transmitted diseases are infrequent in children suspected for child sexual abuse. Bacterial colonization is common, however, not correlated with clinical symptoms (except for Bacteroides) and hymenal/vaginal injuries.
TI  - Spectrum and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens isolated from hospital and community patients with urinary tract infections in two large hospitals in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the spectrum of microbial etiology and antibiotic resistance pattern of the uropathogens that cause urinary tract infections in 2 large teaching hospitals in Kuwait over a period of 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Vitek identification card system was used to identify the uropathogens. Susceptibility of the isolates against 18 antibiotics was performed by the microbroth dilution method using the Vitek automated system. In addition, gram-positive bacteria were tested in parallel by the disk diffusion technique. RESULTS: The six overall most common isolates were: Escherichia coli, accounting for 47% of isolates in both hospitals, followed by Candida spp. (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.6%), Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS; 9.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (4.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%). Amikacin provided the widest coverage amongst all the antibiotics tested followed by ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam. For the gram-negatives, high resistance (26-63%) to the beta-lactam antibiotics was noted, especially to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin and cefuroxime. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also high. None of the enterococci was resistant to the glycopeptides, but 38-60% of the Staphylococcus haemolyticus were resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: These data show the high level of antimicrobial resistance amongst the uropathogens causing urinary tract infection in the two hospitals studied.
TI  - Increase of faecal bifidobacteria due to dietary oligosaccharides induces a reduction of clinically relevant pathogen germs in the faeces of formula-fed preterm infants.
AB  - In a previous study on formula-fed preterm infants, we were able to demonstrate that dietary oligosaccharides (a mixture of 90% galacto-oligosaccharides and 10% fructo-oligosaccharides in a concentration of 1 g/dl) stimulate the growth of faecal bifidobacteria. In the present explorative analysis of this study, we focus on the effect of the dominance of bifidobacteria on the presence of clinically relevant pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Streptococcus group B, Clostridium difficile, Bacillus subtilis and Acinetobacter). CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that stimulation of bifidobacteria by prebiotic oligosaccharides reduces the presence of clinically relevant pathogens in the faecal flora, indicating that prebiotic substances might have the capacity to protect against enteral infections.
TI  - Increasing ciprofloxacin resistance among prevalent urinary tract bacterial isolates in Gaza Strip, Palestine.
AB  - This article presents the incidence of ciprofloxacin resistance among 480 clinical isolates obtained from patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) during January to June 2004 in Gaza Strip, Palestine. The resistance rates observed were 15.0% to ciprofloxacin, 82.5% to amoxycillin, 64.4% to cotrimoxazole, 63.1% to doxycycline, 32.5% to cephalexin, 31.9% to nalidixic acid, and 10.0% to amikacin. High resistance to ciprofloxacin was detected among Acinetobacter haemolyticus (28.6%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (25.0%),Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.0%), Klebsiella pneumonia (17.6%), and Escherichia coli (12.0%). Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin evenly ranged from 4 to 32 mu g/mL with a mean of 25.0 mu g/mL. This study indicates emerging ciprofloxacin resistance among urinary tract infection isolates. Increasing resistance against ciprofloxacin demands coordinated monitoring of its activity and rational use of the antibiotics.
TI  - Increasing ciprofloxacin resistance among prevalent urinary tract bacterial isolates in the Gaza Strip.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aims to assess common organisms causing urinary tract infection (UTI) in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian Authority and to examine the incidence of ciprofloxacin resistance in the strains of bacteria isolated from patients suspected with UTI over a six-month period. METHODS: Ciprofloxacin was evaluated along with other commonly-used antibiotics against a total of 480 clinical isolates obtained from urine samples. The samples were collected from community patients from different parts of the Gaza Strip. Susceptibility tests were done by the Kerby Bauer method. RESULTS: Among the tested drugs, the percent resistance rate to ciprofloxacin was 15.0 percent. However, high resistance to ciprofloxacin was detected among Acinetobacter haemolyticus (28.6 percent), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (25.0 percent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.0 percent), Klebsiella pneumonia (17.6 percent) and Escherichia coli (12.0 percent). Minimal inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin was measured for all resistant UTI isolates. CONCLUSION: This study indicates emerging ciprofloxacin resistance among most UTI bacterial pathogens. Increasing resistance against ciprofloxacin demands coordinated monitoring of its activity and rational use of the antibiotics.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  - We examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods. Compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of EGCg against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, and S. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher MICs (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against Gram-negative rods, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. And difference was observed between the binding abilities of EGCg with viable S. aureus and with E. coli. The bactericidal activity of EGCg for S. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide or dextran. It was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of EGCg. These results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different affinities of EGCg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to EGCg.
TI  - [Prostate histopathology of NIH category IV prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  - Asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category IV in NIH classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). No report concerning this category has been present. We investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. Among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (PSA) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between January, 1996 and December, 2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as NIH category IV prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). We observed all pathological specimens stained with Hematoxylin-Eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by True et al. (1999). We also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as PSA values, PSA density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. In the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. Location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88) in stromal. No relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. However, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate cancers, later. Pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). Bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). Isolated bacteria were 4 strains of Enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Gram positive rod, and Candida sp. No relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. These results indicated that the incidence of NIII category IV prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. However, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Microbiology of acute otitis externa.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate and characterize bacteria and fungi from acute otitis externa (AOE) and to obtain susceptibility profiles on each bacterial isolate. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective core series. METHODS: Specimens were collected from the external canals of subjects with clinically diagnosed acute otitis externa. Species-level identification for each bacterial isolate recovered was obtained by combining phenotypic and genotypic data. End point mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing was performed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) recommended methods. RESULTS: In Alcon-sponsored clinical studies conducted in 1998 to 2000, microbiology specimens were collected from 2039 subjects (2240 diseased ears) by 101 investigators throughout the United States. A total of 2838 bacteria, 32 yeast, and 17 molds were recovered from 2048 ears clinically diagnosed as acute otitis externa. Of the 202 bacterial species recovered, the species most frequently isolated was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (38%). The next 10 species most frequently isolated were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, 9.1%; Staphylococcus aureus, 7.8%; Microbacterium otitidis, 6.6%; Microbacterium alconae, 2.9%; Staphylococcus caprae, 2.6%; Staphylococcus auricularis, 2.0%; Enterococcus faecalis, 1.9%; Enterobacter cloacae, 1.6%; Staphylococcus capitis subsp. Ureolyticus,1.4%; and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 1.3%. Susceptibility profiles of S. epidermidis isolates revealed the greatest frequency of high-level resistance to selected antibiotics (>/=8 microg/mL): 23%, neomycin-resistant; 11%, oxacillin-resistant; and 12%, ofloxacin-resistant. Susceptibility profiles of S. aureus isolates revealed a lower frequency of high-level resistance: 6.3%, neomycin-resistant; 2.7%, oxacillin-resistant; and 4.5%, ofloxacin-resistant. P. aeruginosa with high-level resistance to quinolones (>/=128 mcg/mL for ofloxacin) was recovered from only 1 subject. Likewise, resistance of P. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides was rare. Twenty isolates had neomycin MICs >/=64 mcg/mL and 10 isolates had gentamicin MICs >/=16 mcg/mL. The coryneform isolates identified as Microbacterium otitidis had an intrinsic lack of susceptibility to quinolones (ofloxacin MICs >/=16 mcg/mL) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin MICs >/=32 mcg/mL and gentamicin MICs >/=8 mcg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infections of the external ear canal are most often caused by P. aeruginosa. However, there are a great number of other gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species that are recovered from patients with acute otitis externa. Because of this diverse etiology, the best topical therapeutic choice for topical therapy is for the most potent, broad-spectrum (especially anti-P. aeruginosa) antibiotic available.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against isolates from complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem was measured using 4725 strains isolated from  patients with complicated urinary tract infections (CUTIs) between 1988 and 2000. Imipenem was inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium and some non-fermenting Gram-negative rods. Resistant strains (MIC>16 mg/l) were observed in Staphylococcus haemolyticus (22%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterococcus avium (8%), Serratia marcescens (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Although the prevalence of imipenem-resistant strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa was sporadically high in some years, no steady increase was seen over the period. Resistant strains were rare in other major uropathogenic species. These results suggest that imipenem is still one of the most reliable antimicrobial drugs.
TI  - [Infectious endocarditis in intravenous drug abusers].
AB  - Clinical course of infectious endocarditis (IE) was analysed for 43 intravenous drug abusers. 42 of them had primary IE, one patient--secondary. Acute course and high activity of the disease were registered in 86% of the patients. IE was provoked by Staphylococcus aureus (50%), Staphylococcus epidermidis 920%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (11%), E. coli (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%), Candida albicans (2%), mixed microflora (7%). Vegetations were detected on the tricuspid, mitral and aortic valves (52, 23 and 19%, respectively), on more than one valve (6%). Pneumonia, pleuricy, hydrothorax, enlargement of the liver, spleen, nephritis and anemia were found in 76, 44, 9, 100, 75, 70 and 88% of the patients, respectively. Cardiac failure aggravated the disease in half of the patients, lethality was 18%. Thus, IE in intravenous drug abusers is characterized by a primary form, acute active course, prevalent damage to the tricuspid valve, polyorganic involvement, high lethality. IE cure in such patients is feasible only in adequate antibacterial therapy, timely surgical correction and giving up drug abuse.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of pneumonia pathogens in newborns and problems of antibacterial therapy of the pathologic process].
AB  - The results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk of the fetus intranatal infection. During the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. On the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin B, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. The S.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. When the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently available antibiotics. Because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.
TI  - [Bacterial strains isolated from neutropenic patients and their resistance to antibiotics].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Gram negative as well as Gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of Gram positive bacteria is increasing. The objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the Haematological Clinic in 1995. Haemocultures (apparatus Bact/Alert 120, cultivation media Organon-Teknika) and urine were examined. The sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. In blood most frequently Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). In urine the following were detected: Staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), Enterococcus sp. (14.5%), Escherichia coli (13.1%), Enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and Enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). In all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.
TI  - Adhesion of bacteria to stainless steel and silver-coated orthopedic external fixation pins.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion to silver-coated orthopedic external fixation pins was compared with stainless steel controls in an in vitro study. Using five bacterial isolates from wound infections, the silver coating was found to reduce adhesion for Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two strains of Staphylococcus aureus while the converse applied for Staphylococcus haemolyticus. When placed in human serum, both surfaces were conditioned to a similar extent with serum proteins; this conditioning lead to further reductions in bacterial adhesion, ultimately approaching similar levels for both stainless steel and silver-coated samples.
TI  - Neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway colonization with Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. Whether GNB are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or to the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. Data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. The severity of BPD was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with GPC (Staphylococus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). Superimposed on 36% of these infants was GNB airway colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), Enterobacter cloacae (25%), Escherichia coli (25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Serratia marcescen (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii and Haemophilus influenzae (5%). Comparison between 174 GPC- and 86 GNB-colonized infants showed that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. Fifteen percent of GNB-colonized infants developed BSI caused by GNB and 14% developed BSI caused by GPC. No significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and BSI was noted. GNB infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with GPC. GNB colonization was a predictor of severe BPD after controlling for ventilation. Ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of GNB-colonized and 33% of noncolonized infants and was not a predictor of BPD severity. CONCLUSION: GNB airway colonization creates a moderate risk for BSI. Antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate GNB. GNB airway colonization is associated with severe BPD, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate GNB from the airways should be undertaken.
TI  - [Multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  Portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  - In 1994, Microbiology Laboratories of ten Portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. From 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were Staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples significant numbers of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp. were isolated. Escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A great variation in resistance values of P. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. Resistance to methicillin in S. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an average of 47%, and it was even higher with S. epidermidis (c.3000) and S. haemolyticus (c.650). Only vancomycin was always active against these strains. In E. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. E. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. Vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  - We have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. After eight years of use, 97-100% of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. After six years of use, 94%-100% of Enterobacteriaceae (except Providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of P. stuartii, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa declined from 100% to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. There were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. Enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal MIC of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/L; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/L decreased from 94% to 64%. Imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [A new device for the disinfection of handpieces and turbines].
AB  - Dental handpieces are often difficult to disinfect. This is one of the main reasons for the considerable risk of cross-infections in dental offices. The aim of the present study was the evaluation of the disinfectant property of a recent, commercially available, automatic instrument, described as capable to clean, disinfect and lubricate dental handpieces. The following experimental evaluations were made: 1) antimicrobial activity of the disinfectant (glyoxalaldehyde) used. The method described by the European Committee for Standardization was followed. Test microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. 2) disinfection of dental handpieces (69 contra-angles and 97 turbines of different marks). They were naturally infected using them on patients for 30 minutes at least. 3) disinfection of dental handpieces infected with bacterial suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes (beta-haemolyticus, group A), Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results of the first experiment showed a strong bactericidal power of the disinfectant with both the tested strains, after a contact time of only 1 minute. A great proportion of the dental handpieces tested during the second experiment were found disinfected: from 84% through 89% out of the various models of turbine handpieces; from 89% through 100% out of the models of contra-angle handpieces. Even though bacterial contamination level was low (about 10(3) microorganisms per handpiece), a satisfactory disinfectant ability in natural conditions was found. The results of the third experiment were unclear. The tested instrument reduced 10(5)-10(8) times the original bacterial count when the gram positive microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes) were used. On the other hand, when Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were used, the results were different: the bacterial count was reduced 10(6)-10(7) times in some cases, and only 10(2) times in other cases. This difference was found in the tests made using the same attachment and in those made using various attachments. In conclusion, the tested instrument showed, in most cases, a good disinfectant property, but the presence of unclear results suggests that some technical modifications are required.
TI  - Bacterial flora of semen collected from Danish warmblood stallions by artificial  vagina.
AB  - Semen samples were collected from 21 Danish Warmblood stallions by the Colorado artificial vagina (Colorado AV, 14 samples) or by the Missouri artificial vagina (Missouri AV, 7 samples). The semen was examined bacteriologically by direct plating (DP) on blood agar plates, and by plating of semen swabs stored in Stuart's transport media (TM) at 4 degrees C for 1-4 days. No significant differences were observed between results obtained by DP and cultures of identical TM samples. Of the 21 samples examined, only 1 TM (4.8%) and 2 DP samples (9.5%) were sterile, while the rest yielded a predominantly mixed flora comprising 1 to 4 bacterial genera. The natural flora was dominated by coagulase-negative staphylococci (Staphylococcus lentus, S. capitis, S. haemolyticus, S. xylosus) (16/21 = 76%), coryneforms (11/21 = 52%) and alpha-hemolytic streptococci and lactobacilli (7/21 = 33%). Potential venereal pathogens were isolated from 7 stallions (33%). Beta-hemolytic streptococci were found in 4 stallions used for natural service, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype 6 (2 samples) and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae capsule type K5 (1 sample) were isolated from 3 stallions used exclusively for artificial insemination. The role of the stallion as a carrier of potential venereal pathogens, and the artificial vagina as a source of contamination, is discussed in the context of mare endometritis.
TI  - Rapid identification of micro-organisms from urinary tract infections by beta-glucuronidase, phenylalanine deaminase, cytochrome oxidase and indole tests on isolation media.
AB  - Two commercially available media recommended for the isolation and rapid identification of Escherichia coli from urinary tract infections were supplemented with L-phenylalanine and L-tryptophan. The non-selective medium proved suitable for the direct detection of lactose fermentation, beta-glucuronidase and phenylalanine deaminase activities, indole production and the oxidase test. It was highly efficient in making a presumptive identification at species level of the most common gram-negative urinary pathogens, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that account for c. 85% of all urinary isolates. Among the gram-positive isolates, most colonies were non-fluorescent and could be separated into staphylococci and enterococci on the basis of the catalase test. Fluorescent colonies were found to be Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates, 61% of which were fluorescent. The selective medium proved suitable for the same biochemical tests, with the exception of indole, which was not visible against the red colour of the medium. Therefore, the differentiation of P. mirabilis from other Proteus-Providencia species was impossible on this medium.
TI  - In vitro activity of FK-037, a novel parenteral cephalosporin, against bacterial  isolates from neutropenic cancer patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK-037, a novel parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, aztreonam and piperacillin (agents often used in empiric regimens in cancer patients) against recent bacterial isolates from patients with cancer. FK-037 was either equal to or 2 to 16-fold more active than the comparative agents against members of the Enterobacteriaceae. It was also active against Acinetobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other Pseudomonas spp. Xanthomonas maltophilia and Alcaligenes denitrificans were relatively resistant to all four agents. FK-037 was also 4 to 16-fold more active against most gram-positive organisms (including some methicillin-resistant staphylococci) than was ceftazidime. Enterococcus spp., Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus haemolyticus were relatively resistant to FK-037 and ceftazidime. Overall, FK-037 has a broad antimicrobial spectrum that includes the majority of gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of CP-99,219, a novel azabicyclo-naphthyridone.
AB  - CP-99,219 is a trifluoronaphthyridone with significant antibacterial activity that includes the family Enterobacteriaceae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested [MIC90s], < or = 0.015 to 0.5 micrograms/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and gonococci (MICs, < or = 0.015 micrograms/ml). Legionella spp. were also CP-99,219 susceptible, with MICs of 0.008 to 0.12 micrograms/ml. CP-99,219 demonstrated activity greater than that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or enoxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml), Xanthomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml), and pneumococci (MIC90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). Numerous ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were susceptible to CP-99,219, a new compound showing potential value for further in vivo trials.
TI  - Infection problems for the 1990's--do we have an answer?
AB  - There is and has been continued change in organisms causing infection in the hospital. In the past few years, although Gram-negative bacteria have remained a major cause of mortality, Gram-positive bacteria and fungi have become increasingly important. This has caused organisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, Xanthomonas maltophilia and multiply resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa to be common pathogens. Can this difficult state of affairs be changed by better antimicrobial prescribing practices? Yes and no. Virtually any agent will select MRSA and MRSE since the chromosomal location of the resistance of multiple-antibiotics makes such selection common and explains the rapid rate of the fluoroquinolones as therapy of MRSA. Restriction of oral vancomycin will markedly reduce the pressure to select Enterococcus faecium and thus limit the spread of the organisms and delay transmission of glycopeptide resistance to S. aureus. Judicious use of antibiotics in the intensive care environment will be major factor in "saving" antibiotics for other patients since the ICU patient goes to other parts of the hospital carrying with him/her the baggage of resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, klebsiella, P. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter, xanthomonas and Pseudomonas cepacia. All of these organisms have the potential to become resistant to the agents heretofore used to treat them and are common in ICU patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. Ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and all Aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. The MIC for 90% of isolates (MIC90) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. All group A and B streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. All methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of Ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the MIC90 for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; MIC90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. Ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of E-4695, a new fluoro-naphthyridine.
AB  - Compound E-4695, a C-7 azetidinyl fluoro-naphthyridine, was compared to six structurally related quinolones and was generally two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin. E-4695 was particularly active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 0.06 mg/l), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MIC90 0.5 mg/l), Klebsiella spp. (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), Serratia marcescens (MIC90 0.06 mg/l), Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 0.5 mg/l), Xanthomonas maltophilia (MIC90 0.5 mg/l), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.001 mg/l). This new quinolone-like drug requires further investigations to confirm these promising in vitro findings.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Treatment of posttraumatic osteitis with intravenous ofloxacin.
AB  - The subjects were 25 patients with osteomyelitis (n = 17) or other bone or joint  infections, scheduled for surgical procedures, including debridement, sequestrectomy, and bone resection and reconstruction. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 22 patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis in one, Streptococcus haemolyticus in one, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one, and a Pasteurella species in one. During surgery and for a mean of four days after surgery, each patient received 200 mg of ofloxacin intravenously twice daily (one patient received 300 mg and another received 400 mg twice daily). The patients were then given 200 mg of ofloxacin orally twice daily until the wound was healed (after a mean of 18 days). The wound was healed in all patients and no cases of reinfection occurred. It is concluded that intravenous ofloxacin given perioperatively may be more effective than oral ofloxacin in the management of osteomyelitis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  - In in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of Acinetobacter spp. and Aeromonas hydrophila. They were also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. Other Pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. Both agents were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing Branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. Neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher MICs. Gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and Campylobacter coli/jejuni usually susceptible. Both antibiotics had good activity against Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and Staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. All streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. Both antibiotics had little useful activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group or Bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. Clostridium difficile and some other Clostridium species were resistant.
TI  - Oral ciprofloxacin for treatment of acute bacterial pharyngotonsillitis.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and tolerability of ciprofloxacin orally administered at the dosage of 250 mg twice a day was evaluated in 25 patients affected by acute bacterial pharyngotonsillitis. All patients were non-responders to previous conventional antibiotic therapies due to in vitro resistance of the responsible bacteria, or possibly the low antibiotic concentration at the infection site. None of the patients had infections caused by group A beta-haemolyticus streptococcus. Treatment with ciprofloxacin lasted for 5-10 days (mean 6.7). A favorable clinical response was observed in 92% of patients (15 resolutions and 7 improvements) at the end of the therapy and two weeks later (follow-up). One patient was not evaluable because of the unfortunate onset of glossitis that caused the interruption of the treatment. No other side-effects were recorded in the other 24 patients. The bacteriological response was excellent: 83% bacteriological eradication, 13% persistence and super-infection in only one patient (4%). Ciprofloxacin administered orally at low dosages is highly effective in the treatment of bacterial pharyngotonsillitis and is also well tolerated.
TI  - Bacteria causing respiratory infections in children and their sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  - The author lists the most frequent bacterial agents isolated from the nose and pharynx samples of children that visited the Child Health Centre from 1983 to 1986. The gram-positive bacteria found most often were: Staphylococcus aureus (44% in 1983, 40% in 1986). Streptococcus pneumoniae (6% in 1983, 12% in 1986), and Streptococcus haemolyticus of group "A" (14% in 1983, 19% in 1986). The isolated gram-negative bacteria were: E. coli (14%), Klebsiella enterobacter (8%), and Proteus species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 to 4% [4, 6, 7, 16]). According to the author's analyses Staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to cloxacilline (96%, no changes in the 4-year period), then to sulphametoxasol-trimetropin (95%), to lincomycine (85% no change), while to penicillin it is entirely resistant. Streptococcus pneumoniae proved sensitive to ampicillin, lincocine and erythromycin (96%), to cephalosporins (83%) and to sulphamides (85%). Streptococcus haemolyticus from group "A" reacted to penicillin excellently. The greatest sensitivity to gram-negative bacteria E. coli related to aminoglycosides (97%), sulphonamides (96%), chloramphenicol (91%), and to cephalosporines (90%, in 1986 only 60%). Klebsiella enterobacter reacted to aminoglycosides (97%), sulphonamides (92%) and chloramphenicol (83%) and Pseudomonas to aminoglycosides (95%), gentamycin (92%), while to cephalosporines and ampicillin preparations it proved totally resistant.
TI  - [The antibacterial activity of diphenhydramine (author's transl)].
AB  - Diphenhydramine (N,N-dimethyl-2-diphenyl-methoxy-ethylamine) [N,N-dimethyl-2-(diphenylmethoxy)-ethylamin] (DPH) is a well-known local anaesthetic and an antagonist of both acetylcholine and histamine. We tested its antibacterial efficacy by means of three different investigation methods, i.e. microcalorimetry, continuous density measurement and the microdilution test to find out the MIC of this compound against various bacteria. DPH inhibits the growth of E. coli and Klebsiella strains at a concentration of 0.18% of Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus at 0.37%, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 0.75% and Streptococcus faecalis strains at 1.5%. The results of microcalorimetry and continous density measurements showed that the addition of 0.2% DPH to a broth with growing bacteria interferes very quickly with cell metabolism and stops further reproduction. The microcalorimetric findings were carried out with Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus strain No. 13,665 an- the E. coli strain No. 3579.
TI  - Endophthalmitis following cataract extraction. A study of 24 cases in 4,498 operations.
AB  - The incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis in a series of 4,498 consecutive cataract operations, performed in a period of 10 years, was examined and found to equal 0.533%. Paracentesis of the anterior chamber was done in two cases and revealed Staphylococcus albus to be the causative organism in both instances. Conjunctival cultures were recovered in a further 17 cases, and showed S. albus in pure culture in eight cases and in combination with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteous morgani in two cases. Streptococcus haemolyticus was isolated in pure culture in one case, while the cultures from six other patients were negative. The role of such factors as age, diabetes mellitus, chronic bronchitis, "weak ocular tissue", and persurgical complications which predisposed to postoperative infections was examined and found to have no significance on the occurrence of endophthalmitis in the present study. The visual end results were assessed and showed a better prognosis than generally expected. Of 24 cases, five achieved good visual acuity (6/6-6/12), 13 had a useful vision (6/18-6/60), while five remained actually blind (less than 6/60). In only one case was the eye enucleated. Methods of treatment and prophylaxis are described and discussed. A total suppression or elimination of all regional bacteria at the time of surgery seems to be the logical goal.
TI  - [Addition of gentamicine to polymethyl methacrylate for therapy of infectious bone diseases. Expeimental in vivo tests].
AB  - In experimental in vivo tests the therapeutic effect of Gentamicin added to Palacos is detected in a standardized osteomyelitic infection caused by Staph. aureus haemolyticus. The number of germ populations is reduced significantly by the antibiotic which is released in a microbiologically active concentration. On the other hand the number of germ populations in control trials (without adding an antibiotic) is remaining on a high level. During the time of the tests the appearance of other bacterial is registrated.
