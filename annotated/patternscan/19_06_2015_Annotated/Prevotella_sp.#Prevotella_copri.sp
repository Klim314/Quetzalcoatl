TI  == prevotella copri sp. nov. and prevotella stercorea sp. nov., isolated from human  faeces.
AB  == six strains (cb7(t), cb18, cb23, cb26, cb28 and cb35(t)) were isolated from human faeces. based on phylogenetic analysis, phenotypic characteristics, cellular fatty acid profiles and menaquinone profiles, these strains could be included within the genus prevotella and made up two clusters. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis indicated that five strains were most closely related to prevotella veroralis, sharing about 92 % sequence similarity; the remaining strain was most  closely related to prevotella shahii, sharing about 90 % sequence similarity. all six strains were obligately anaerobic, non-pigmented, non-spore-forming, non-motile, gram-negative rods. the cellular fatty acid compositions of the six strains differed significantly from those of other prevotella species. five strains (cb7(t), cb18, cb23, cb26 and cb28) contained dimethyl acetals and the major menaquinones of these strains were mk-11, mk-12 and mk-13. the major menaquinones of cb35(t) were mk-12 and mk-13. based on phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, two novel species, prevotella copri sp. nov. and prevotella stercorea sp. nov., are proposed, representing the two different strain clusters. the dna g+c contents of strains cb7(t) and cb35(t) were 45.3 and 48.2 mol%, respectively. the type strains of p. copri and p. stercorea are cb7(t) (=jcm 13464(t)=dsm 18205(t)) and cb35(t) (=jcm 13469(t)=dsm 18206(t)), respectively.
