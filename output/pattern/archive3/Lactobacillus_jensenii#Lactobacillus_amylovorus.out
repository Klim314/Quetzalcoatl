the in vitro antimicrobial activities of metabolites from lactobacillus strains on candida species implicated in candida vaginitis.
background: research from developing countries, such as nigeria, on lactobacillus species in the female urogenital tract and their role as a barrier to vaginal infection is limited. therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical biotherapeutic potential of indigenous lactobacillus species. methods: antimicrobial metabolites production were characterised using simple and easily reproducible qualitative and quantitative methods. the in vitro inhibitory effect of lactobacillus antimicrobials on vulvovaginal candidiasis-associated candida species was investigated using modified agar spot and agar well-diffusion methods. results: the maximum levels of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl from 20 vaginal lactobacillus strains from diseased subjects were 1.46 mg/l, 1.36 mmol/l, and 1.72 mg/l respectively. from the 4 healthy subjects, the maximum level of lactic acid was 1.08 mg/l; hydrogen peroxide, 1.36 mmol/l; and diacetyl, 0.86 mg/l. the maximum productions of these substances occurred between 72 and 120 hours of incubation. the in vitro antagonistic activities of vaginal l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. delbrueckii, and l. jensenii from diseased subjects inhibited a maximum of 5.71% of the 35 candida species tested, while vaginal l. acidophilus and l. plantarum from healthy subjects inhibited between 57.1% and 68.6% of candida species in vitro. conclusion: antimicrobial-producing lactobacilli can be considered as adjunct biotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.
lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l. gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.
antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.
lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
