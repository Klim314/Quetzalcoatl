TI  == phylogenetic distribution of three pathways for propionate production within the  human gut microbiota.
AB  == propionate is produced in the human large intestine by microbial fermentation and may help maintain human health. we have examined the distribution of three different pathways used by bacteria for propionate formation using genomic and metagenomic analysis of the human gut microbiota and by designing degenerate primer sets for the detection of diagnostic genes for these pathways. degenerate  primers for the acrylate pathway (detecting the lcda gene, encoding lactoyl-coa dehydratase) together with metagenomic mining revealed that this pathway is restricted to only a few human colonic species within the lachnospiraceae and negativicutes. the operation of this pathway for lactate utilisation in coprococcus catus (lachnospiraceae) was confirmed using stable isotope labelling. the propanediol pathway that processes deoxy sugars such as fucose and rhamnose was more abundant within the lachnospiraceae (based on the pdup gene, which encodes propionaldehyde dehydrogenase), occurring in relatives of ruminococcus obeum and in roseburia inulinivorans. the dominant source of propionate from hexose sugars, however, was concluded to be the succinate pathway, as indicated by the widespread distribution of the mmda gene that encodes methylmalonyl-coa decarboxylase in the bacteroidetes and in many negativicutes. in general, the capacity to produce propionate or butyrate from hexose sugars resided in different species, although two species of lachnospiraceae (c. catus and r. inulinivorans) are now known to be able to switch from butyrate to propionate production on different substrates. a better understanding of the microbial ecology of short-chain fatty acid formation may allow modulation of propionate formation by the human gut microbiota.

TI  == mechanism of conjugated linoleic acid and vaccenic acid formation in human faecal suspensions and pure cultures of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == faecal bacteria from four human donors and six species of human intestinal bacteria known to metabolize linoleic acid (la) were incubated with la in deuterium oxide-enriched medium to investigate the mechanisms of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) and vaccenic acid (va) formation. the main cla products in faecal suspensions, rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11-cla; ra) and trans-9,trans-11-cla, were labelled at c-13, as were other 9,11 geometric isomers. traces of trans-10,cis-12-cla formed were labelled to a much lower extent. in pure culture, bifidobacterium breve ncfb 2258 formed labelled ra and trans-9,trans-11-cla, while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 16.4, roseburia hominis a2-183t, roseburia inulinivorans a2-192t and ruminococcus obeum-like strain a2-162 converted la to va, labelled in a manner indicating that va was formed via c-13-labelled ra. propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii dsm 4902t, a  possible probiotic, formed mainly ra with smaller amounts of trans-10,cis-12-cla  and trans-9,trans-11-cla, labelled the same as in the mixed microbiota. ricinoleic acid (12-oh-cis-9-18 : 1) did not form cla in the mixed microbiota, in contrast to cla formation described for lactobacillus plantarum. these results were similar to those reported for the mixed microbiota of the rumen. thus, although the bacterial genera and species responsible for biohydrogenation in the rumen and the human intestine differ, and a second route of ra formation via a 10-oh-18 : 1 is present in the intestine, the overall labelling patterns of different cla isomers formation are common to both gut ecosystems. a hydrogen-abstraction enzymic mechanism is proposed that may explain the role of a 10-oh-18 : 1 intermediate in 9,11-cla formation in pure and mixed cultures.
