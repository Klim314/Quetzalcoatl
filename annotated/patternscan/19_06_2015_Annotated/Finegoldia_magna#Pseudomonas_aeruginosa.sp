TI  == the microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of france.
AB  == background: breast implant infections are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. methods: thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from january 2008 to june 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. results: the prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. s. aureus was identified in 18 cases, gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative staphylococcus species. in addition to propionibacterium acnes and actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, corynebacterium simulans, dermabacter hominis, finegoldia magna, and peptoniphilus harei. seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. all cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. conclusions: the microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of gram-negative bacteria  and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of maldi-tof ms and molecular identification for diagnosis.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  == an in vitro comparison of two silver-containing antimicrobial wound dressings .
AB  == preclinical studies have shown that release of silver by different wound dressings varies. the purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of silver alginate (sa) and silver carboxymethylcellulose  (scm) dressings. an- timicrobial activity was tested using nine bacterial strains with log10 reduction and corrected zone of inhibition (czoi) as- says. antimicrobial effect was visualized using confocal microscopy (clsm). log10 reduction was comparable between both dressings for staphylococcus aureus ncimb 9518, candida albicans atcc 90028, finegoldia magna nctc 11804t, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa nctc 10662. log10 reduction was higher for scm than sa dressing-exposed escherichia coli (p = 0.035) and p. aeruginosa atcc 15692 (p = 0.032), and lower for scm than sa dressing-exposed streptococcus pyogenes (p = 0.007), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (p = 0.045), and s. aureus nctc 8325 (p =  0.012). both dressings were equivalent against four strains (5 to 8 days' activity) in the czoi assay. sa dressing silver activity lasted >24 hours longer  than scm activity when exposed to c. albicans (9 days' activity), e. coli (7 days' activity), f. magna (5 days' activity), and p. asaccharolyticus (5 days' activity), whereas the smc exhibited greater persistence against s. pyogenes (13  days' activity). clsm showed complete kill of s. aureus after 20 hours for both dressings. the results of this study confirm the broad-spectrum, in vitro activity of some dressings containing ionic silver. the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of both wound dressings was comparable, but clinical studies comparing the efficacy and effectiveness of silver-containing dressings to nonionic silver-containing dressings are needed.

TI  == surface bacteriology of venous leg ulcers and healing outcome.
AB  == aim: bacteria can be cultured from all venous leg ulcers (vlus) regardless of healing status, and the significance of a positive swab result in non-clinically  infected ulcers is unknown. the aim of this study was to characterise the bacteriological flora of vlus by routine culture to determine whether the data generated had prognostic value. methods: the ulcers of 178 patients were sampled  weekly for 12 weeks and healing outcome monitored while the limb was treated with graduated compression. wound bacteriology was assessed using culture methodology  standardised to ensure data reproducibility. results: 153 individual bacterial species were identified. the species most frequently found were staphylococcus aureus (64.3% of assessments), corynebacterium striatum (60.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (32.6%), helcococcus kunzii (22.0%), finegoldia magna (21.4%) and proteus mirabilis (16.1%). no single species or the presence of anaerobes and increasing diversity of bacterial species, previously thought to be predictive of impaired healing, was shown to be associated with healing outcome. the presence of c striatum was associated with healing outcome but not after adjusting for the known prognostic factors of wound area and duration. conclusion: routine bacteriological culture analysis of the vlu wound surface may be used to identify diverse flora in all ulcers. however, the data generated are of no additional value as a prognostic indicator of healing outcome. the presence of c striatum may represent colonisation of non-healing vlu by normal skin flora.
