TI  == killing of neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus), haemophilus ducreyi, and vaginal lactobacillus by 3-o-octyl-sn-glycerol.
AB  == the microbicide candidate octylglycerol inactivates sexually transmitted bacterial pathogens at concentrations which spare normal vaginal flora (lactobacillus). standard minimum microbicidal concentration assays and time-kill assays revealed the drug concentrations and times required for inactivation. octylglycerol concentrations must exceed the binding capacity of any human serum  albumin to be effective.

TI  == franksum: new feature selection method for protein function prediction.
AB  == in the study of in silico functional genomics, improving the performance of protein function prediction is the ultimate goal for identifying proteins associated with defined cellular functions. the classical prediction approach is  to employ pairwise sequence alignments. however this method often faces difficulties when no statistically significant homologous sequences are identified. an alternative way is to predict protein function from sequence-derived features using machine learning. in this case the choice of possible features which can be derived from the sequence is of vital importance to ensure adequate discrimination to predict function. in this paper we have successfully selected biologically significant features for protein function prediction. this was performed using a new feature selection method (franksum) that avoids data distribution assumptions, uses a data independent measurement (p-value) within the feature, identifies redundancy between features and uses an  appropriate ranking criterion for feature selection. we have shown that classifiers generated from features selected by franksum outperforms classifiers  generated from full feature sets, randomly selected features and features selected from the wrapper method. we have also shown the features are concordant  across all species and top ranking features are biologically informative. we conclude that feature selection is vital for successful protein function prediction and franksum is one of the feature selection methods that can be applied successfully to such a domain.

TI  == sialylation of group b streptococcal capsular polysaccharide is mediated by cpsk  and is required for optimal capsule polymerization and expression.
AB  == several bacterial pathogens have evolved the means to escape immune detection by  mimicking host cell surface carbohydrates that are crucial for self/non-self recognition. sialic acid, a terminal residue on these carbohydrates, inhibits activation of the alternate pathway of complement by recruiting the immune modulating molecule factors h, i, and ic3b. sialylation of capsular polysaccharide (cps) is important for virulence of group b streptococci (gbs), a  significant human pathogen. we previously reported that cpsk, a gene within the cps locus of type iii gbs, could complement a sialyltransferase deficient lst mutant of haemophilus ducreyi, implicating its role in sialylation of the gbs capsule. to explore the function of cpsk in gbs capsule production, we created a  mutant in cpsk. immunoblot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-type iii cps antisera demonstrated that the mutant cps did not contain sialic acid. this was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography after mild acid hydrolysis of the cps. although increased cps chain length was seen for this strain, cps production was <20% of the parental isolate. an episomal cpsk copy restored synthesis of sialo-cps to wild-type levels. these data support our  hypothesis that cpsk encodes the gbs cps sialyltransferase and provide further evidence that lack of cps oligosaccharide sialylation reduces the amount of cps expressed on the cell surface. these observations also imply that one or more of  the components involved in synthesis or transport of oligosaccharide repeating units requires a sialo-oligosaccharide for complete activity.

TI  == therapy of other bacterial infections.
AB  == cutaneous bacterial disease continues to account for a significant proportion of  clinical visits. the continuing emergence of strains that are resistant to available antibacterial agents creates a challenge for dermatologists, who need to keep abreast of current treatment strategies. in this article, antibacterial regimens are presented for skin infections caused by organisms such as staphylococcus, streptococcus, pseudomonas, neisseria, haemophilus ducreyi, treponema pallidum, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, pasteurella multocida, vibrio vulnificus, actinomyces, and nocardia.

TI  == cpsk of streptococcus agalactiae exhibits alpha2,3-sialyltransferase activity in  haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae (gbs) is a major cause of serious newborn bacterial infections. crucial to gbs evasion of host immunity is the production of a capsular polysaccharide (cps) decorated with sialic acid, which inactivates the alternative complement pathway. the cps operons of serotypes ia and iii gbs have  been described, but the cps sialyltransferase gene was not identified. we identified cpsk, an open reading frame in the cps operon of most serotypes, which was homologous to the lipooligosaccharide (los) sialyltransferase gene, lst, of haemophilus ducreyi. to determine if cpsk might encode a sialyltransferase, we complemented a h. ducreyi lst mutant with cpsk. cpsk was expressed in h. ducreyi  and los was isolated and analysed for sialic acid content by sds-page and high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). sialo-los was seen in the wild-type, cpsk- or lst-complemented mutant strains, but not in the mutant without cpsk. addition of neu5ac to the los was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. lectin binding studies detected terminal neu5ac(alpha 2-->3)gal(beta 1- on los produced by the wild-type, cpsk or lst-complemented mutant strain los, compared with the mutant alone. our data characterize the first sialyltransferase gene from a gram- positive bacterium and provide compelling evidence that its product  catalyses the alpha2,3 addition of neu5ac to h. ducreyi los and therefore the terminal side-chain of gbs cps. phylogenetic studies further indicated that lst and cpsk are related but distinct from sialyltransferases of most other bacteria  and, along with their similar codon usage bias and g + c content, suggests acquisition by lateral transfer from an ancestral low g + c organism.

TI  == rifampin, a useful drug for nonmycobacterial infections.
AB  == rifampin has clinical efficacy against a wide variety of organisms, including staphylococcus aureus, legionella pneumophila, group a streptococcus, brucella sp, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis, as well as in vitro activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, haemophilus ducreyi, and many gram-negative rods. rifampin is a useful drug for several types of bacterial infections because of its broad spectrum of activity, excellent tissue penetration, and low side effect profile. in combination with other antibiotics, it may be effective when conventional therapies are not.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  == rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. high concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic50, 0.06 microgram/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 0.25 microgram/ml). rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting bacteroides bivius-disiens, gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., and mobiluncus spp. strains (all mics < or = 1 microgram/ml). strains of haemophilus  ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. however, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were  rifaximin resistant, for example, candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, trichomonas vaginalis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to  rifamycin resistance.

TI  == in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. fce 22101 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, h. ducreyi, neisseria gonorrhoeae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis and group b streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with mic90 of greater than 32 mg/l. streptococcus faecalis displayed mic90 of 16 mg/l. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium spp., peptococcus spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated mics. fce 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of quinolones.
AB  == the quinolones are new antimicrobial agents that are descendants of nalidixic acid. as a new class of synthetic antimicrobials they exhibit a wide spectrum of  activity. newer quinolones such as ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, enoxacin, and pefloxacin are highly active against gram negative bacilli of the enterobacteriaceae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus ducreyi. they exhibit less activity against pseudomonas sp. and staphylococcus sp., and little in vitro activity against streptococcus pneumoniae or enterococci. their activity against mycobacterium sp. is variable, and obligate anaerobes are usually considered resistant. of the quinolones reviewed, ciprofloxacin displays the highest degree of in vitro activity.

TI  == roxithromycin. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  == roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. it has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against staphylococcus aureus, s.  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, chlamydia trachomatis, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. the results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial  activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. in a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be  as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.

TI  == the comparative in-vitro activity of ofloxacin.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was evaluated against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared with that of nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, enoxacin, pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics). ofloxacin was very active against nalidixic acid-susceptible isolates of the enterobacteriaceae (mic less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l) and was also active against strains resistant to nalidixic acid (mic less than or equal to 2 mg/l). the activity was similar to norfloxacin, enoxacin and pefloxacin but some four-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin. all of the fluoroquinolones were highly active against vibrio cholerae (mic less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), v. parahaemolyticus (mic less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l) aeromonas hydrophila (mic less than or equal to 0.03  mg/l), plesiomonas shigelloides (mic less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), campylobacter jejuni (mic less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l), neisseria spp., haemophilus influenzae, h. ducreyi, bordetella pertussis and legionella pneumophila (mic less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l for all species). ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin (mic less than or equal to 1, 2 and 2 mg/l, respectively) showed similar activity against staphylococcus spp. and were somewhat more active than enoxacin (mic less than or equal to 4 mg/l) and norfloxacin (mic less than or equal to 8 mg/l). ofloxacin was moderately active against beta-haemolytic streptococcus spp. (mic less than or equal to 2 mg/l), corynebacterium diphtheriae (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and cory. jeikeium (mic less than or equal to 2 mg/l) and somewhat less active against alpha- and non-haemolytic streptococcus spp., str. pneumoniae and listeria monocytogenes (mic less than or equal to 4 mg/l for all species) and str. faecalis (mic less than or equal to 8 mg/l). the activity of ofloxacin, against these species, was similar to ciprofloxacin and four to eight times greater than norfloxacin, enoxacin and pefloxacin. ofloxacin, and all of the fluoroquinolones, were less active against anaerobic than aerobic bacteria. clostridium perfringens (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) was more susceptible to ofloxacin than were other anaerobic species and cl. difficile (mic less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was more  resistant. ofloxacin was the most active compound tested against chlamydia trachomatis sa2f (mic less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l) with only ciprofloxacin (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) approaching similar activity.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the clinical use of macrolides.
AB  == macrolides are active against streptococcus pneumoniae, legionella spp. and mycoplasma pneumoniae, the main causes of community-acquired pneumonia they may therefore be used for the empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, although emergent resistance in str. pneumoniae limits their use in some parts of the world. in patients with bronchitis the use of macrolides reduces the severity and duration of symptoms. macrolides have also been used successfully in the treatment of otitis media and sinusitis; combination with sulphonamides may be desirable. they may be effective in eradicating the carrier state of str. pyogenes, bordetella pertussis, corynebacterium diptheriae, and neisseria meningitidis. macrolides provide alternative therapy for the prophylaxis of recurrent acute rheumatic fever and of infective endocarditis after dental treatment. the cure rate with macrolides of streptococcal skin infections and of  minor staphylococcal infections is equal to that achieved with penicillins. in diarrhoea due to campylobacter jejuni, the administration of macrolides shortens  the duration of the faecal excretion of organisms and may give clinical improvement in severe disease. macrolides are the drugs of choice for infections  due to chlamydia trachomatis in pregnancy and for haemophilus ducreyi infections. they are effective alternative therapy to benzylpenicillin for the treatment of n. gonorrhoeae and treponema pallidum infections.
