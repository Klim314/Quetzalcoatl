TI  == isolation and identification of microorganisms including lactic acid bacteria and their use in microbial deacidification of wines from domestic vineyards.
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify various bacteria isolated from grapes and their wines. additionally we investigated the capacity of lactic acid bacteria for microbiological deacidification of wines produced in poland. we have identified oenococcus oeni, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii. during the microbial deacidification process, we observed decreases  of total acidity and increases of volatile acidity, with statistically significant changes noted for o. oeni in marechal foch and seyval blanc, and for  lb. acidophilus in frontenac. on the other hand, a statistically significant increase in ph was observed in marechal foch and seyval blanc following deacidification by o. oeni.
