TI  - Accurate identification of fastidious Gram-negative rods: integration of both conventional phenotypic methods and 16S rRNA gene analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate identification of fastidious Gram-negative rods (GNR) by conventional phenotypic characteristics is a challenge for diagnostic microbiology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of molecular methods, e.g., 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis for identification of fastidious GNR in the clinical microbiology laboratory. RESULTS: A total of 158 clinical isolates covering 20 genera and 50 species isolated from 1993 to 2010 were analyzed by comparing biochemical and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis based identification. 16S rRNA gene homology analysis identified 148/158 (94%) of the isolates to species level, 9/158 (5%) to genus and 1/158 (1%) to family level. Compared to 16S rRNA gene sequencing as reference method, phenotypic identification correctly identified 64/158 (40%) isolates to species level, mainly Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Pasteurella multocida, and 21/158 (13%) isolates correctly to genus level, notably Capnocytophaga sp.; 73/158 (47%) of the isolates were not identified or misidentified. CONCLUSIONS: We herein propose an efficient strategy for accurate identification of fastidious GNR in the clinical microbiology laboratory by integrating both conventional phenotypic methods and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. We conclude that 16S rRNA gene sequencing is an effective means for identification of fastidious GNR, which are not readily identified by conventional phenotypic methods.
TI  - Increased frequency of isolation of Pasteurella and Actinobacillus species and related organisms.
AB  - Ninety-six clinical isolates of Pasteurella, Actinobacillus and related organisms were submitted to our reference laboratory for identification. The procedures for detecting the 11 identified species, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella ureae, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Actinobacillus lignieresii, Actinobacillus equuli, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Cardiobacterium hominis, and two unnamed species of CDC groups, HB-5 and EF-4, are described and their clinical importance is discussed. These organisms have been increasingly isolated in Japan and are most often associated with respiratory infections and endocarditis.
TI  - [On the phenotypical characteristics of human pasteurella, and pasteurella-like isolates (author's transl)].
AB  - Fourty-two human isolates that had been designated Pasteurella, or pasteurella-like organisms in the bacteriological routine laboratory were phenotypically characterized considering conventional, morphological and physiological features, and respiratory quinones. Thirty-seven of these strains fitted into the large traditional species, P. multocida, the majority of them being associated with alterations of the respiratory tract, and the rest with intestinal diseases, or putrid wound secretions mostly following animal bite or scratch lesions. Two strains isolated from sputum, or sinus maxillaris punctate, respectively, were P. ureae, and one strain recovered from a septicemic blood samle proved to be Cardiobacterium hominis. A pasteurella-like strain isolated from putrid sputum and an unusual organism that had been isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of an infant with putrid meningitis remained unidentified. The bacteriological data are discussed with respect to the diagnostics of Pasteurella and similar organisms and especially, the range of phenotypical variation within the species, P. multocida.
