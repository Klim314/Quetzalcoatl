TI  == microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute copd exacerbation in daily clinical practice: comparison to current guidelines.
AB  == background: the aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate current microbiological approaches, microbiology, and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease (aecopd) in clinical practice and to compare them with current  international guidelines. methods: a total of 362 patients with suspected cap were enrolled in 14 european centers in a prospective multicenter study. results: a total of 279 inpatients (cap, n = 222; aecopd, n = 57) were evaluated. a total  of 83 (37 %) cap patients and 25 (44 %) aecopd patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. in patients with cap/aecopd, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. the most frequent pathogens in cap were streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, l. pneumophila, staphylococcus aureus, and enterobacter cloacae; in aecopd they were escherichia coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. all cap patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of aecopd patients (mean = 8.9 days) received  antibiotics. cap patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and aecopd patients were given mostly cephalosporins. conclusions: pathogens isolated in cap and aecopd and the antibiotic therapy used are in good  accordance with the guidelines. blood culture, recommended for all cap patients,  was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. this duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy.

TI  == in young children, persistent wheezing is associated with bronchial bacterial infection: a retrospective analysis.
AB  == background: young children with persistent wheezing pose a diagnostic and therapeutical challenge to the pediatrician.we aimed to evaluate bacterial bronchial infection as a possible reason for non response to conventional asthma  therapy, and to identify and characterise the predominant pathogens involved. methods: we retrospectively analysed microbiological and cytological findings in  a selected population of young wheezers with symptoms unresponsive to inhaled corticosteroid (ics) therapy, who underwent flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (bal). procedural measures were taken to limit contamination risk and quantitative bacterial culture of bal fluid (significance  cut-off >/= 10(4) colony-forming units/ml) was used. modern microbiological methods were used for detection of a wide panel of pathogens and for characterisation of the bacterial isolates. results: 33 children aged between 4 and 38 months, without structural anomalies of the conductive airways were evaluated. significant bacterial bal cultures were found in 48,5 % of patients. haemophilus influenzae was isolated in 30,3 %, streptococcus pneumoniae in 12,1 % and moraxella catarrhalis in 12,1 %. all h. influenzae isolates were non-encapsulated strains and definitely distinguished from non-haemolytic h. haemolyticus. respiratory viruses were detected in 21,9 % of cases with mixed bacterial-viral infection in 12,1 %. cytology revealed a marked neutrophilic inflammation. conclusions: bacterial infection of the bronchial tree is common in persistent preschool wheezers and provides a possible explanation for non response to ics therapy. non-typeable h. influenzae seems to be the predominant pathogen involved, followed by s. pneumoniae and m. catarrhalis.

TI  == antimicrobial characterisation of cem-101 activity against respiratory tract pathogens, including multidrug-resistant pneumococcal serogroup 19a isolates.
AB  == cem-101 is a novel fluorinated macrolide-ketolide with potent activity against bacterial pathogens that are susceptible or resistant to other macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b (mls(b))-ketolide agents. cem-101 is being  developed for oral and parenteral use in moderate to moderately severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. the objective of this study was to assess the activity of cem-101 and comparators against contemporary respiratory tract infection (rti) isolates. a worldwide sample of organisms was used, including streptococcus pneumoniae [n=168; 59.3% erythromycin-resistant and 18 multidrug-resistant (mdr) serogroup 19a strains], moraxella catarrhalis (n=21; 11 beta-lactamase positive), haemophilus influenzae (n=100; 48 beta-lactamase positive), haemophilus parainfluenzae and haemophilus haemolyticus (n=12), and legionella pneumophila (n=30). testing and interpretation were performed using reference clinical and laboratory standards institute methods. cem-101 was very potent against s. pneumoniae [minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms (mic90)=0.25 mg/l; highest mic at 0.5 mg/l] and was 2- and > or =32-fold more active than telithromycin and clindamycin, respectively. cem-101 also demonstrated potent activity against s. pneumoniae mdr-19a strains (mic90=0.5 mg/l). cem-101 was the most potent antimicrobial agent tested against  l. pneumophila, with all mic values at < or = 0.015 mg/l (telithromycin mic90=0.03 mg/l). cem-101 was as potent as azithromycin against haemophilus spp.  rti pathogens (mic90=2 mg/l), with no variations for beta-lactamase production. cem-101 mic values against m. catarrhalis were all at < or =0.5mg/l. interestingly, cem-101 potency was ca. 6 log(2) dilutions greater than telithromycin mic results among 44 beta-haemolytic streptococci having telithromycin mics > or = 2 mg/l. cem-101 exhibited the greatest potency and widest spectrum of activity against rti pathogens among the tested mls(b)-ketolide agents (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin, clindamycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) and was comparable overall with levofloxacin.

TI  == airway bacterial concentrations and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == rationale: increased bacterial concentration (load) in the lower airways and new  bacterial strain acquisition have been posited as mechanisms for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) exacerbations. bacterial concentrations are  higher during exacerbation than during stable disease; however, these studies are cross sectional and devoid of strain typing. objectives: to determine if the increased bacterial concentrations function as a separate mechanism for exacerbation induction independent of new strain acquisition. methods: in a prospective, longitudinal cohort of patients with copd, the relationship between  exacerbation occurrence, sputum bacterial concentrations, and new strain acquisition was examined. measurements and main results: clinical information, quantitative sputum cultures, and molecular typing of potential bacterial pathogen isolates. over 81 months, 104 subjects completed 3,009 clinic visits, 560 (19.6%) during exacerbations and 2,449 (80.4%) during stable disease. among preexisting strains, sputum concentrations of nontypeable haemophilus influenzae  and haemophilus haemolyticus were not different in exacerbation versus stable disease. moraxella catarrhalis (stable, 10(8.38 +/- 0.13) [mean +/- sem] vs. exacerbation, 10(7.78 +/- 0.26); p = 0.02) and streptococcus pneumoniae (stable,  10(8.42 +/- 0.21) vs. exacerbation, 10(7.76 +/- 0.52); p = 0.07) concentrations were lower during exacerbations compared with stable periods. concentrations of new strains of h. influenzae (stable, 10(7.28 +/- 0.15) vs. exacerbation, 10(7.76 +/- 0.17); p = 0.04) and m. catarrhalis (stable, 10(7.85 +/- 0.15) vs. exacerbation, 10(8.37 +/- 0.14); p = 0.02), were increased during exacerbations;  however, the differences were small. conclusions: change in bacterial load is unlikely to be an important mechanism for exacerbations. better understanding of  the host-pathogen interaction, rather than enumerating bacteria in respiratory samples, is required to provide new insights into bacterial infection in copd.

TI  == pd-140248 (parke-davis & co).
AB  == pd-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase ii inhibitor under development by parke-davis and co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in september 1999, the company confirmed that pd-140248 is still in active development [338530]. the compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being pd-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. pd-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (s aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis (s epidermidis), staphylococcus haemolyticus (s haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant s aureus, streptococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae (s pneumoniae) and enterococcus faecalis (e faecalis). an mic90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against haemophilus influenzae (h influenzae) and moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. the (3r,1s) enantiomer, pd-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == in vitro activities of rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32  times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than  methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428  had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == in vitro activity of ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae and all aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or  equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. it was also active against acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. the mic for 90% of isolates (mic90) of pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. all group a and b streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were  inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. all methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the mic90 for staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. staphylococcus haemolyticus and enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; mic90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == laboratory and clinical studies on rokitamycin (rkm) dry syrup, a new macrolide antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. the results are summarized as follows. 1. plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates after  oral administration on fasting of rkm dry syrup at doses of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg to 2 and 1 cases, respectively, were determined. peak plasma levels were obtained in 30 minutes after administration of both dosages with half-lives of 1.5 to 2.2  hours. a clear-cut dose response was observed. urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration ranged from 1.75 to 2.26%. 2. the mics of rkm  against 80 clinical isolates (streptococcus pyogenes 9, streptococcus pneumoniae  14, branhamella catarrhalis 4, haemophilus influenzae 27, haemophilus parainfluenzae 9, haemophilus haemolyticus 2, haemophilus parahaemolyticus 14 and campylobacter jejuni 1) were compared with mics of midecamycin acetate (mom), josamycin (jm) and erythromycin (em). the antibacterial activity of rkm was superior to those of mom and jm and slightly inferior to that of em. 3. twenty-eight pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (acute tonsillitis 4, streptococcal infection 4, acute bronchitis 9, pneumonia 4, mycoplasmal pneumonia 2 and campylobacter enteritis 5) were treated with rkm dry syrup at a daily dose of 12-42.9 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. efficacy rates were 92.9% clinically and 58.6% bacteriologically. 4. no adverse reactions were observed. abnormal laboratory findings were mild; thrombocytosis in 2 and eosinophilia in 1. 5. the taste and the odor of rkm dry syrup preparation were sufficiently tolerable for the pediatric patients to accept it.

TI  == in vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  == flurithromycin is an (8,s)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of streptomyces erythraeus atcc 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. the range of mic for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group a is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline ph. among anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, other species of bacteroides and peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. flurithromycin also showed some  activity on mycobacterium bovis, m. scrofulaceum and m. phley. the determination  of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 x mic. a combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. the possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. at concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.

TI  == effect of oral administration of a variety of bacteria on depressed macrophage functions in tumour-bearing rats.
AB  == in consideration of the well documented influence of normal microbial flora on the level of activation of macrophages, we evaluated the effects of oral administration of bacteria on rats with depressed macrophage functions. an oral,  killed polyvalent vaccine (diplococcus pneumoniae types i, ii and iii, streptococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae), the live lyophilized streptococcus faecium and spores of bacillus subtilis, respectively, were administered orally to immuno-depressed rats. results demonstrate the restoration of phagocytosis, intracellular killing and the chemotactic activity of macrophages. these experimental observations suggest that bacterial flora associated with mucosae can influence the level of activation of  peritoneal macrophages.

TI  == bacteriology and clinical significance of hemolytic haemophilus in the throat.
AB  == hemolytic haemophilus are rarely isolated in the clinical laboratory, as they do  not grow on sheep or human blood-agar alone. on rabbit blood-agar they grow well  and are hemolytic, but they grow less well and are not hemolytic on sheep blood-agar with added x and v factors. a survey was made to determine their incidence in pharyngitis. from 28 of 100 sore throats and from 57 of 100 normal throats, only normal bacterial flora were isolated. beta-streptococci were present in significant numbers in 9 sore and 11 normal throats; staphylococci in  8 sore and 4 normal throats; pneumococci in 20 sore and 11 normal throats; h. influenzae or h. parainfluenzae in 13 sore and no normal throats; hemolytic haemophilus in 30 sore and 18 normal throats; enteric bacilli in 1 of each; candida and neisseria in 2 sore throats each. all of the 33 hemolytic haemophilus isolates identified to species were h. parahaemolyticus. all were sensitive in vitro to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and tetracycline; 30 were sensitive to ampicillin and 30 to penicillin, 26 to novobiocin, and 12 to methicillin. h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, and h. haemolyticus are indistinguishable by gram  stain morphology, but h. parahaemolyticus is larger than the other three. hemolytic and nonhemolytic species are indistinguishable by colonial morphology or by nutritional requirements; only hemolysis gives positive differentiation. nevertheless, only rarely would this be of clinical importance. h. parahaemolyticus apparently may cause pharyngitis, but it is almost always susceptible to penicillin and rarely if ever causes sequelae.
