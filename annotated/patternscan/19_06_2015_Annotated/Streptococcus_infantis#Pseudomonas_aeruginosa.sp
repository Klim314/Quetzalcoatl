TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == the intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
