TI  == phylogenetic analysis of antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria from farmed seabass dicentrarchus labrax.
AB  == the use of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the prevention or reduction of fish diseases is receiving increasing attention. in the present study, 47 lab strains  were isolated from farmed seabass ( dicentrarchus labrax ) and were phenotypically and phylogenetically analysed by 16s rdna and randomly amplified polymorphic dna - polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr). their antimicrobial effect was tested in vitro against a wide variety of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. most of the strains isolated were enterococci belonging to the following species: enterococcus faecium (59%), enterococcus faecalis (21%), enterococcus sanguinicola (4 strains), enterococcus mundtii (1 strain), enterococcus pseudoavium (1 strain), and lactococcus lactis (1 strain). an aerococcus viridans strain was also isolated. the survey of their antimicrobial susceptibility showed that all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and exhibited resistance to between 4 and 10 other antibiotics relevant for therapy in human and animal medicine. different patterns of resistance were noted for skin and intestines isolates. more than 69% (32 strains) of the isolates inhibited the growth of the majority of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria tested,  including listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas salmonicida, vibrio anguillarum, and carnobacterium sp. to our knowledge, this is the first report of bioactive enterococcal species isolated from seabass that could potentially inhibit the undesirable bacteria found in food systems.

TI  == effect of lactococcus lactis clfp 100 and leuconostoc mesenteroides clfp 196 on aeromonas salmonicida infection in brown trout (salmo trutta).
AB  == aeromonas salmonicida is the etiological agent of furunculosis in salmonid fish.  this pathogen is important from an epizootic perspective because fish surviving an outbreak can remain lifelong asymptomatic carriers, serving as reservoirs of infection. as a result, the early detection and the control of infection are essential to prevent the spread of new furunculosis outbreaks. we have thus analyzed the effect of probiotic administration on the incidence of a. salmonicida in brown trout (salmo trutta), that were subjected to temperature stress. treatment with probiotic strains (lactococcus lactis clfp 100 and leuconostoc mesenteroides clfp 196) resulted in a higher survival rate after challenge, activation of phagocytic cells in the head kidney, and a lower rate of pathogen proliferation in the intestine as determined by real-time pcr.

TI  == enhancement of the immune response and protection induced by probiotic lactic acid bacteria against furunculosis in rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss).
AB  == we analysed the effect of probiotic strains on the cellular and humoral immune responses of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss), and their capacity to prevent furunculosis during a challenge trial. probiotic strains (lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis clfp 100, leuconostoc mesenteroides clfp 196, and lactobacillus sakei clfp 202) were administered orally to fish for 2 weeks at 10(6) cfu g(-1) of feed. in  comparison to untreated control fish, the phagocytic activity of head kidney leukocytes and the alternative complement activity in serum were significantly greater in all probiotic groups at the end of the second week. with the exception of the group fed with lactobacillus sakei, superoxide anion production was also significantly increased in the probiotic groups. analysis of lysozyme activity did not exhibit any significant difference in the probiotic and control groups. fifteen days after the start of the probiotic feeding, fish were challenged with  aeromonas salmonicida ssp. salmonicida. the fish supplemented with probiotics exhibited survival rates ranging from 97.8% to 100%, whereas survival was 65.6% in fish not treated with the probiotics. these results demonstrate that probiotic supplementation to fish can reduce the severity of furunculosis, and suggest that this reduction may be associated with enhanced humoral and cellular immune response.

TI  == immune modulation by probiotic strains: quantification of phagocytosis of aeromonas salmonicida by leukocytes isolated from gut of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) using a radiolabelling assay.
AB  == a method is described for the rapid and sensitive assay of phagocytosis that utilizes radioactively labelled bacteria. with this method, we observed that phagocytosis of heat-inactivated aeromonas salmonicida by leukocytes isolated from gut of rainbow trout fed with different viable probiotics (lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus sakei, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) was significantly higher (p<0.05) after 2 weeks of probiotic-feeding than the control group. however, only phagocytosis of live a. salmonicida by the leukocytes isolated from gut of rainbow trout fed with l. lactis subsp. lactis was significantly higher (p<0.05) than the control group.

TI  == identification of lactococcus garvieae by pcr.
AB  == lactococcus garvieae junior synonym enterococcus seriolicida) is an emerging zoonotic agent isolated from economically important fish (rainbow trout and yellowtail), from cattle, and from humans. clindamycin susceptibility is the only phenotypic test which can differentiate l. garvieae from lactococcus lactis, another emerging agent in humans. a pcr assay for the identification of l. garvieae was developed and resulted in an amplified fragment of 1,100 bp in size. the pcr assay was shown to be specific to l. garvieae. the pcr assay was positive for all the l. garvieae strains tested, which originated from three different continents (asia, australia, and europe). the pcr assay was negative for the phenotypically similar l. lactis and for all the other fish pathogens tested, including streptococcus iniae and aeromonas salmonicida. the pcr assay was applied to plasma obtained from diseased animals and was found sensitive enough to detect bacteria from 1 microl of plasma. the pcr assay that was developed is the only practical test besides the clindamycin test which can specifically identify the zoonotic agent l. garvieae and which can differentiate it from l. lactis.
