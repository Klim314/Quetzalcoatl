TI  == role of emerging campylobacter species in inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == the gut microbiota is a central player in the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases. as such, there is intense scientific interest in elucidating the specific group/s of bacteria responsible for driving barrier damage and perpetuating the chronic inflammation that results in disease. because of their ability to colonize close to the surface of the host intestinal epithelium, mucosa-associated bacteria are considered key players in the initiation and development of both crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. the leading bacterial candidates include adherent and invasive escherichia coli, helicobacter, fusobacteria, mycobacteria, and campylobacter species. of these, a member of the  campylobacter genus, campylobacter concisus, has recently emerged as a putative player in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. current research indicates that this bacterium possesses extraordinarily diverse pathogenic capacities as well as unique genetic and functional signatures that are defined by their ability to adhere to and invade host cells, secrete toxins, and the presence of a virulence-associated restriction-modification system. these characteristics enable the potential classification of c. concisus into distinct  pathotypes, which we have named adherent and invasive c. concisus and adherent and toxinogenic c. concisus. in this review, we evaluate evidence for the role of emerging campylobacter species in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  == psychometric scores and persistence of irritable bowel after campylobacter concisus infection.
AB  == objective: gastroenteritis with campylobacter concisus is an emerging infection,  but the risk of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) following it is unknown. material  and methods: in a prospective, community-based study of gastroenteritis with c. concisus and c. jejuni/coli, we invited adult patients to participate in a questionnaire study, including ibs symptoms and psychometric scores, at baseline  and at 6 months. we estimated adjusted rr (rradj) (for age, sex and comorbidity)  for ibs as the primary outcome. results: the development of ibs symptoms at 6 months was reported in 26/106 (25%) patients with c. concisus infection, and in 30/162 (19%) of c. jejuni/coli patients. the baseline predictors for ibs in c. concisus infection were high anxiety scores (rradj 2.0; 95% ci 1.1-3.6, p<0.05),  chills (rradj 1.9; 95% ci 1.0-3.6, p<0.05), headache (rradj 2.5; 95% ci 1.1-6.0,  p<0.05), dizziness (rradj 2.6; 95% ci 1.2-5.8, p<0.05) and muscle ache (rradj 3.6; 95% ci 1.4-8.9, p<0.01). for all campylobacter patients (n=268), we confirmed previous reports of anxiety (rradj 2.0; 95% ci 1.3-3.1), depression (rradj 2.3; 95% ci 1.3-4.0) and high somatization scores (rradj 3.0; 95% ci 1.5-6.0) as predictors for post-infectious ibs (pi-ibs). conclusions: gastroenteritis with c. concisus carries a 25% risk of ibs at 6-month follow-up.  the risk factors for ibs are chills, headache, dizziness and muscle ache in the acute stage, as well as preexisting high psychometric scores for anxiety. our findings suggest that psychological factors play a role in the development of pi-ibs.

TI  == clinical manifestations of campylobacter concisus infection in children.
AB  == background: there is only sparse information about the clinical impact of campylobacter concisus infections in children. methods: a study was performed during a 2-year period to determine the clinical manifestations in c. concisus-positive children with gastroenteritis. a case patient was defined as a  child or teenager (<18 years) with a c. concisus-positive stool sample during the study period. clinical data were obtained with use of a questionnaire study supplemented with the patients' medical records. the clinical manifestations in these patients were compared with those of patients with campylobacter jejuni/coli infection. results: two thousand three hundred seventy-two diarrheic  stool samples from 1867 children were cultured for pathogenic enteric bacteria during the study period, and 85 and 109 children with c. concisus and c. jejuni/coli, respectively, were identified. comparison of the acute clinical manifestations in 44 c. concisus patients with those in 64 c. jejuni/coli patients showed a significantly lower prevalence of fever, chills and blood in stools in the former. however, half of c. concisus patients compared with one-fourth of c. jejuni/coli patients had prolonged diarrhea for more than 2 weeks and two-thirds of all children with c. concisus reported loose stools after 6-month follow-up. conclusions: c. concisus infection in children seems to have a milder course of acute gastroenteritis compared with c. jejuni/coli infection but is associated with more prolonged diarrhea. children with c. concisus have the same degree of late gastrointestinal complaints as children diagnosed with c. jejuni/coli infection.

TI  == a culture-independent sequence-based metagenomics approach to the investigation of an outbreak of shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli o104:h4.
AB  == importance: identification of the bacterium responsible for an outbreak can aid in disease management. however, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult, particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an outbreak strain. objective: to explore the potential of metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of dna extracted from microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture. design, setting, and patients: in a retrospective investigation, 45 samples were  selected from fecal specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli (stec) o104:h4 in germany. samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (august-september 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (november 2012-february 2013). in phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. in phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. in phase 3, sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak  strain. main outcomes and measures: the recovery of genome sequence data for the  purposes of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and other  pathogens from fecal samples. results: during phase 1, a draft genome of the stec outbreak strain was obtained. during phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. sequences from the shiga-toxin genes were detected  in 27 of 40 stec-positive samples (67%). in phase 3, sequences from clostridium difficile, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter concisus, and salmonella enterica  were recovered. conclusions and relevance: these results suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of diarrheal disease. challenges include improving diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing costs.

TI  == occurrence and characteristics of fastidious campylobacteraceae species in porcine samples.
AB  == this study investigated the prevalence and characteristics of campylobacteraceae  including a range of fastidious species in porcine samples. over a thirteen month period caecal contents (n=402) and pork carcass swabs (n=401) were collected from three pork abattoirs and pork products (n=399) were purchased at point of sale in the republic of ireland. campylobacteraceae isolates were recovered by enrichment, membrane filtration and incubation in antibiotic free media under a modified atmosphere (3% o2, 5% h2, 10% co2 and 82% n2). campylobacteraceae isolates were identified as either genus campylobacter or arcobacter and then selected species were identified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). campylobacteraceae were isolated from 103 (26%) caecal samples, 42 (10%) carcass  swabs, and 59 (15%) pork products. campylobacter coli was the most commonly isolated species found in (37%) all sample types but many fastidious species were also isolated including campylobacter concisus (10%), arcobacter butzleri (8%), campylobacter helveticus (8%), campylobacter mucosalis (6%), arcobacter cryaerophilus (3%), campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus (1%), campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni (1%), campylobacter lari (0.5%), campylobacter curvus (0.5%) and arcobacter skirrowii (0.5%). among all isolates, 83% contained cadf and 98% flaa. in this study 35% of porcine c. coli were resistant to ciprofloxacin but none of  the fastidious species demonstrated any resistance to this drug. the level of resistance to erythromycin was very high (up to 100%) in c. concisus and c. helveticus and this is a real concern as this is the current empiric drug of choice for treatment of severe gastroenteritic campylobacter infections. the study shows that there is a much wider range of fastidious campylobacteraceae present in porcine samples than previously assumed with c. concisus the second most common species isolated. the majority of fastidious campylobacteraceae isolates obtained contained virulence genes and antibiotic resistance indicating  potential public health significance.

TI  == evaluation of fecal calprotectin in campylobacter concisus and campylobacter jejuni/coli gastroenteritis.
AB  == calprotectin (cp) is a calcium-binding cytosolic neutrophil protein and the concentration in feces reflects the migration of neutrophils into the gut lumen.  testing for fecal cp (f-cp) in patients with negative cultures for enteric pathogens is widely accepted as a useful screening tool for identifying patients  who are most likely to benefit from endoscopy for suspected inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) with the assumption that a negative f-cp is compatible with a functional disorder. campylobacter concisus has recently been reported to have a  high incidence in the danish population almost equal to campylobacter jejuni and  campylobacter coli and has been reported to cause prolonged watery diarrhea. however, isolation of c. concisus from feces requires the filter method in a hydrogen-enriched microaerobic atmosphere, which is not commonly used in the laboratory, and the diagnosis may consequently be missed. the aim of this study was to evaluate the f-cp levels, as a marker for the intestinal inflammation in c. jejuni/coli- and c. concisus-infected patients. the authors found a high concentration of f-cp (median 631: iqr 221-1274) among 140 patients with c. jejuni/coli infection, whereas the f-cp level among 99 c. concisus-infected patients was significantly lower (median 53: iqr 20-169). the data correlate to the severe inflammatory gastroenteritis seen in patients infected with c. jejuni/coli, whereas c. concisus-infected patients have a much lower intestinal inflammation which could be compared with viral gastroenteritis. nevertheless, clinicians should be aware of c. concisus infection, especially in patients with  prolonged mild diarrhea, in the differential diagnosis to ibd.

TI  == assessment of the prevalence and diversity of emergent campylobacteria in human stool samples using a combination of traditional and molecular methods.
AB  == this study aims to assess the diversity of campylobacteria (campylobacter and arcobacter) in human fecal samples from patients with diarrhea (n = 140) and asymptomatic controls (n = 116) in chile, using a combination of traditional culture and molecular methods. the culture methods detected campylobacteria in 10.7% of the patients with diarrhea and in 1.7% of the controls. in contrast, the molecular methods detected campylobacteria more often than the traditional culture, with a prevalence of 25.7% and 5.2%, respectively. the traditional methods only recovered the species campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, and  arcobacter butzleri, whereas the molecular methods additionally detected the emergent species campylobacter concisus and campylobacter ureolyticus.

TI  == detection of campylobacter species and arcobacter butzleri in stool samples by use of real-time multiplex pcr.
AB  == the presence of campylobacter (or campylobacter-like) species in stools from patients suspected of infectious gastroenteritis (n = 493) was investigated using real-time pcr for detection of arcobacter butzleri (hsp60 gene), campylobacter coli (ceue gene), campylobacter jejuni (mapa), five acknowledged pathogenic campylobacter spp. (c16s_lund assay), and the campylobacter genus (c16s_lvi assay). in total, 71.4% of the samples were positive for campylobacter dna (n = 352) by a campylobacter genus-specific (c16s_lvi) assay. a total of 23 samples (4.7%) were positive in the c16s_lund assay, used for detection of c. jejuni, c.  coli, c. lari, c. upsaliensis, and c. hyointestinalis. subsequent identification  of these samples yielded detection frequencies (df) of 4.1% (c. jejuni), 0.4% (c. coli), and 0.4% (c. upsaliensis). the df of a. butzleri was 0.4%. interestingly,  sequencing of a subgroup (n = 46) of c16s_lvi pcr-positive samples resulted in a  considerable number of campylobacter concisus-positive samples (n = 20). pcr-positive findings with the c16s_lund and c. jejuni/c. coli-specific assays were associated with more serious clinical symptoms (diarrhea and blood). threshold cycle (c(t)) values of c. jejuni/c. coli pcr-positive samples were comparable to those of the c16s_lund pcr (p = 0.21). c(t) values for both assays  were significantly lower than those of the c16s_lvi assay (p < 0.001 and p < 0.00001, respectively). in conclusion, this study demonstrated that in combination, the c. jejuni/c coli-specific assays and the c16s_lund assay are both useful for routine screening purposes. furthermore, the df of the emerging pathogen c. concisus was at least similar to the df of c. jejuni.

TI  == multilocus sequence typing methods for the emerging campylobacter species c. hyointestinalis, c. lanienae, c. sputorum, c. concisus, and c. curvus.
AB  == multilocus sequence typing (mlst) systems have been reported previously for multiple food- and food animal-associated campylobacter species (e.g., c. jejuni, c. coli, c. lari, and c. fetus) to both differentiate strains and identify clonal lineages. these mlst methods focused primarily on campylobacters of human clinical (e.g., c. jejuni) or veterinary (e.g., c. fetus) relevance. however, other, emerging, campylobacter species have been isolated increasingly from environmental, food animal, or human clinical samples. we describe herein four mlst methods for five emerging campylobacter species: c. hyointestinalis, c. lanienae, c. sputorum, c. concisus, and c. curvus. the concisus/curvus method uses the loci aspa, atpa, glna, glta, glya, ilvd, and pgm, whereas the other methods use the seven loci defined for c. jejuni (i.e., aspa, atpa, glna, glta, glya, pgm, and tkt). multiple food animal and human clinical c. hyointestinalis (n = 48), c. lanienae (n = 34), and c. sputorum (n = 24) isolates were typed, along with 86 human clinical c. concisus and c. curvus isolates. a large number of sequence types were identified using all four mlst methods. additionally, these methods speciated unequivocally isolates that had been typed ambiguously using other molecular-based speciation methods, such as 16s rdna sequencing. finally, the design of degenerate primer pairs for some methods permitted the typing of related species; for example, the c. hyointestinalis primer pairs could be used to type c. fetus strains. therefore, these novel campylobacter mlst methods will prove useful in differentiating strains of multiple, emerging campylobacter species.

TI  == short-term and medium-term clinical outcomes of campylobacter concisus infection.
AB  == there are only sparse data on the short-term and medium-term clinical impacts of  campylobacter concisus infection. a clinical study was performed during a 2-year  period to determine the clinical manifestations in c. concisus-positive adult patients. a case patient was defined as an adult patient (>/=18 years) with a c.  concisus-positive stool sample during the study period. clinical data were obtained with use of a questionnaire supplemented with the patients' medical records, if any. the short-term and medium-term clinical manifestations in these  patients were compared with those of patients with campylobacter jejuni/campylobacter coli infection. one hundred and seventy-four c. concisus patients and 196 c. jejuni/c. coli patients participated in the study. patients with pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease or microscopic colitis or enteric co-infection were excluded from review of the clinical manifestations. comparison of the short-term clinical manifestations in 139 c. concisus patients with those  in 187 c. jejuni/c. coli patients showed a significantly lower prevalence of fever, chills, mucus and blood in stools, and weight loss. however, 80% of c. concisus patients, but only 32% of c. jejuni/c. coli patients, had diarrhoea for  >2 weeks. after a 6-month follow-up period, 12% of c. concisus patients were diagnosed with microscopic colitis, whereas no c. jejuni/c. coli patients were diagnosed with non-infective colitis. irritable bowel symptoms were common in both groups at follow-up. c. concisus infection seems to cause a milder course of acute gastroenteritis than c. jejuni/c. coli infection, but is associated with more prolonged diarrhoea.

TI  == high incidence of campylobacter concisus in gastroenteritis in north jutland, denmark: a population-based study.
AB  == the incidence of non-thermophilic campylobacter species was assessed in an unselected population-based study in a mixed urban and rural community in north jutland, denmark. in a 2-year study period, 11,314 faecal samples from 8302 patients with gastroenteritis were cultured with supplement of the filter method. we recovered a high incidence of campylobacter concisus (annual incidence 35/100,000 inhabitants), almost as high as the common campylobacter jejuni/coli.  in contrast, there was a very low incidence of other non-thermophilic campylobacter species, such as campylobacter upsaliensis. campylobacter concisus  was, unlike c. jejuni/coli, found more frequently among small children (<1 year)  and the elderly (>/= 65 years). around 10% of the patients with c. consisus had co-infections dominated by clostridium difficile and salmonella enterica, whereas co-infections occurred in about 5% of c. jejuni/coli patients. we observed a seasonal variation in c. jejuni/coli with a peak incidence in late summer months  and autumn, whereas there was an almost constant monthly prevalence of c. concisus. among patients participating in a questionnaire sub-study, there was a  higher degree of close contacts with animals, especially dogs, as well as a higher travel exposure among c. jejuni/coli patients compared with c. concisus patients. we did not culture any c. concisus in stool samples from a small cohort of healthy individuals. future studies have to focus on the clinical follow-up and the long-term risk of inflammatory bowel diseases in c. concisus-positive patients. we conclude that there is a high incidence of c. concisus in denmark.

TI  == ibd-what role do proteobacteria play?
AB  == the gastrointestinal microbiota has come to the fore in the search for the causes of ibd. this shift has largely been driven by the finding of genetic polymorphisms involved in gastrointestinal innate immunity (particularly polymorphisms in nod2 and genes involved in autophagy) and alterations in the composition of the microbiota that might result in inflammation (so-called dysbiosis). microbial diversity studies have continually demonstrated an expansion of the proteobacteria phylum in patients with ibd. individual proteobacteria, in particular (adherent-invasive) escherichia coli, campylobacter concisus and enterohepatic helicobacter, have all been associated with the pathogenesis of ibd. in this review, we comprehensively describe the various associations of proteobacteria and ibd. we also examine the importance of pattern recognition in the extracellular innate immune response of the host with particular reference to proteobacteria, and postulate that proteobacteria with adherent and invasive properties might exploit host defenses, drive proinflammatory change, alter the intestinal microbiota in favor of dysbiosis and ultimately lead to the development of ibd.

TI  == the clinical importance of emerging campylobacter species.
AB  == a growing number of campylobacter species other than c. jejuni and c. coli have been recognized as emerging human and animal pathogens. although c. jejuni continues to be the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans worldwide, advances in molecular biology and development of innovative culture methodologies have led to the detection and isolation of a range of under-recognized and nutritionally fastidious campylobacter spp., including c. concisus, c. upsaliensis and c. ureolyticus. these emerging campylobacter spp. have been associated with a range of gastrointestinal diseases, particularly gastroenteritis, ibd and periodontitis. in some instances, infection of the gastrointestinal tract by these bacteria can progress to life-threatening extragastrointestinal diseases. studies have shown that several emerging campylobacter spp. have the ability to attach to and invade human intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages, damage intestinal barrier integrity, secrete toxins and strategically evade host immune responses. members of the campylobacter genus naturally colonize a wide range of hosts (including pets, farm animals and wild animals) and are frequently found in contaminated food products, which indicates that these bacteria are at risk of zoonotic transmission to humans. this review presents the latest information on the role and clinical importance of emerging campylobacter spp. in gastrointestinal health and disease.

TI  == emerging thermotolerant campylobacter species in healthy ruminants and swine.
AB  == campylobacters other than campylobacter jejuni or c. coli were isolated in 35% of 343 farms recently analyzed in northern spain. this study was aimed at identifying at the species level the 120 isolates collected (21 ovine, 52 beef cattle, 44 dairy cattle, and 3 porcine) by species-specific polymerase chain reaction and 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis. thus, five species were identified: campylobacter hyointestinalis (90 isolates), campylobacter lanienae (12), campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus (10), campylobacter lari (1), and campylobacter sputorum (1). ambiguous results were obtained for six isolates. phylogenetic analyses of the 16s rrna gene sequence placed three of them (cattle  isolates) as an intermediate clade between c. hyointestinalis subsp. hyointestinalis and c. fetus, two ovine isolates formed a new clade clustering with campylobacter concisus despite sharing higher similarity with campylobacter  mucosalis, and one porcine isolate shared similarly high homology with c. lanienae and c. hyointestinalis subsp. lawsonii. c. hyointestinalis was the predominant species, particularly in cattle, but it was also isolated from sheep  and swine. c. lanienae was only found in sheep, c. fetus in cattle and sheep, and c. lari in a single dairy cattle farm. although previously reported, the isolation of c. lari from cattle is not common, and this is the first report of c. lanienae and c. hyointestinalis in sheep. this study demonstrated the wide distribution in livestock of several emerging zoonotic campylobacter species and  provided valuable information on their host animal reservoirs.

TI  == enteric campylobacteria and rna viruses associated with healthy and diarrheic humans in the chinook health region of southwestern alberta, canada.
AB  == the presence of campylobacter species and enteric rna viruses in stools from diarrheic (n = 442) and healthy (n = 58) humans living in southwestern alberta was examined (may to october 2005). a large number of diarrheic individuals who were culture negative for c. jejuni (n = 54) or c. coli (n = 19) were pcr positive for these taxa. overall detection rates for c. jejuni and c. coli in diarrheic stools were 29% and 5%, respectively. in contrast, 3% and 0% of stools  from healthy humans were positive for these taxa, respectively. infection with c. jejuni was endemic over the study period. however, there was no difference in infection rates between individuals living in urban or rural locations. stools from a large number of diarrheic (74%) and healthy (88%) individuals were positive for campylobacter dna. the prevalence rates of c. concisus, c. curvus, c. fetus, c. gracilis, c. helveticus, c. hominis, c. hyointestinalis, c. mucosalis, c. showae, c. sputorum, and c. upsaliensis dna were either not significantly different or were significantly lower in stools from diarrheic than from healthy individuals. no c. lanienae or c. lari dna was detected. stools from 4% and 0% of diarrheic and healthy humans, respectively, were positive for rotavirus, sapovirus, or norovirus (gi/gii). our results showed a high prevalence of diarrheic individuals living in southwestern alberta who were infected by c. jejuni and, to a lesser extent, by c. coli. however, other campylobacter species, norovirus, rotavirus, sapovirus, and bovine enteric calicivirus were either inconsequential pathogens during the study period or are not pathogens at all.

TI  == the internal transcribed spacer region, a new tool for use in species differentiation and delineation of systematic relationships within the campylobacter genus.
AB  == the campylobacter genus consists of a number of important human and animal pathogens. although the 16s rrna gene has been used extensively for detection and identification of campylobacter species, there is currently limited information on the 23s rrna gene and the internal transcribed spacer (its) region that lies between the 16s and 23s rrna genes. we examined the potential of the 23s rrna gene and the its region to be used in species differentiation and delineation of  systematic relationships for 30 taxa within the campylobacter genus. the its region produced the highest mean pairwise percentage difference (35.94%) compared to the 16s (5.34%) and 23s (7.29%) rrna genes. the discriminatory power for each  region was further validated using simpson's index of diversity (d value). the d  values were 0.968, 0.995, and 0.766 for the its region and the 23s and 16s rrna genes, respectively. a closer examination of the its region revealed that campylobacter concisus, campylobacter showae, and campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus harbored trna configurations not previously reported for other members of the campylobacter genus. we also observed the presence of strain-dependent intervening sequences in the 23s rrna genes. neighbor-joining trees using the its region revealed that campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli strains clustered in subgroups, which was not observed in trees derived from the 16s or 23s rrna gene. of the three regions examined, the its region is by far the most cost-effective region for the differentiation and delineation of systematic relationships within the campylobacter genus.

TI  == detection and quantification of 14 campylobacter species in pet dogs reveals an increase in species richness in feces of diarrheic animals.
AB  == background: the genus campylobacter includes many species, some of which are known human and animal pathogens. even though studies have repeatedly identified  domestic dogs as a risk factor for human campylobacteriosis, our understanding of campylobacter ecology in this reservoir is limited. work to date has focused primarily on a limited number of species using culture-based methods. to expand our understanding of campylobacter ecology in dogs, a collection of fecal samples from 70 healthy and 65 diarrheic pet dogs were examined for the presence and levels of 14 campylobacter species using quantitative pcr. results: it was found  that 58% of healthy dogs and 97% of diarrheic dogs shed detectable levels of campylobacter spp., with c. coli, c. concisus, c. fetus, c. gracilis, c. helveticus, c. jejuni, c. lari, c. mucosalis, c. showae, c. sputorum and c. upsaliensis levels significantly higher in the diarrheic population. levels of individual campylobacter species detected ranged from 103 to 108 organisms per gram of feces. in addition, many individual samples contained multiple species of campylobacter, with healthy dogs carrying from 0-7 detectable species while diarrheic dogs carried from 0-12 detectable species. conclusions: these findings  represent the largest number of campylobacter species specifically tested for in  animals and is the first report to determine quantifiable levels of campylobacter being shed from dogs. this study demonstrates that domestic dogs can carry a wide range of campylobacter species naturally and that there is a notable increase in  species richness detectable in the diarrheic population. with several of the detected campylobacter species known or emerging pathogens, these results are relevant to both ecological and public health discussions.

AB  == background: identification and characterization of intervening sequences (ivss) within 23s rrna genes from campylobacter organisms including atypical campylobacters were carried out using two pcr primer pairs, designed to generate  helix 25 and 45 regions. results: only c. sputorum biovar sputorum lmg7975 and fecalis lmg8531, lmg8534 and lmg6728 of a total of 204 campylobacter isolates (n  = 56 c. jejuni; n = 11 c. coli; n = 33 c. fetus; n = 43 c. upsaliensis; n = 30 c. hyointestinalis; n = 4 c. sputorum biovar sputorum; n = 5 c. sputorum biovar fecalis; n = 5 c. sputorum biovar paraureolyticus; n = 10 c. concisus; n = 7 c. curvus) were shown to carry ivss in helix 25 region. c. sputorum biovar fecalis lmg8531 and lmg8534, interestingly, carried two different kinds of the 23s rrna genes with and without the ivs, respectively. consequently, in a total of 265 isolates of 269, including 65 c. lari isolates examined previously, the absence of ivss was identified in the helix 25 region. in the helix 45 region, all the c. hyointestinalis, c. sputorum and c. concisus isolates were shown not to carry any ivss. however, the 30 of 56 c. jejuni isolates (54%), 5 of 11 c. coli (45%), 25 of 33 c. fetus (76%), 30 of 43 c. upsaliensis (70%) and 6 of 7 c. curvus (90%) were shown to carry ivss. in c. jejuni and c. upsaliensis isolates, two different kinds of the 23s rrna genes were also identified to occur with and without ivss in the helix 45 region, respectively. conclusions: secondary structure models were also constructed with all the ivss identified in the present study. in the purified rna fractions from the isolates which carried the 16s or 23s rrna genes  with the ivss, no 16s or 23s rrna was evident, respectively.

TI  == development of cpn60-based real-time quantitative pcr assays for the detection of 14 campylobacter species and application to screening of canine fecal samples.
AB  == campylobacter species are important organisms in both human and animal health. the identification of campylobacter currently requires the growth of organisms from complex samples and biochemical identification. in many cases, the condition of the sample being tested and/or the fastidious nature of many campylobacter species has limited the detection of campylobacters in a laboratory setting. to address this, we have designed a set of real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) assays  to detect and quantify 14 campylobacter species, c. coli, c. concisus, c. curvus, c. fetus, c. gracilis, c. helveticus, c. hyointestinalis, c. jejuni, c. lari, c.  mucosalis, c. rectus, c. showae, c. sputorum, and c. upsaliensis, directly from dna extracted from feces. by use of a region of the cpn60 (also known as hsp60 or groel) gene, which encodes the universally conserved 60-kda chaperonin, species-specific assays were designed and validated. these assays were then employed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter species in fecal samples from dogs. fecal samples were found to contain detectable and quantifiable levels of c. fetus, c. gracilis, c. helveticus, c. jejuni, c. showae, and c. upsaliensis, with the majority of samples containing multiple campylobacter species. this study represents the first report of c. fetus, c. gracilis, c. mucosalis, and c. showae detection in dogs and implicates dogs as a reservoir for these species. the qpcr assays described offer investigators a new tool to study  many campylobacter species in a culture-independent manner.

TI  == characterization of campylobacter concisus hemolysins.
AB  == campylobacter concisus is an opportunistic pathogen commonly found in the human oral cavity. it has also been isolated from clinical sources including gastroenteritis cases. both secreted and cell-associated hemolytic activities were detected in c. concisus strains isolated from children with gastroenteritis. the secreted hemolytic activity of c. concisus strains was labile and was detected in variable levels from fresh-culture filtrates only. in addition, another secreted hemolysin/cytotoxin with a molecular weight < 10 kda was detected in a single c. concisus strain (rch 12). a c. concisus genomic library,  constructed from strain rch 3 in escherichia coli xl1-blue, was screened for hemolytic clones. subcloning and sequence analysis of selected hemolytic clones identified orfs for genes that enhance hemolytic activity but do not appear to be related to any known hemolysin genes found in gram-negative bacteria. in a previous study, a stable cell-associated hemolysin was identified as an outer-membrane phospholipase a (ompla) encoded by the plda gene. in this study, we report cloning of the plda gene of the clinical strain c. concisus rch 3 and the complementation of phospholipase a activity in an e. coli plda mutant.

TI  == composite sequence proteomic analysis of protein biomarkers of campylobacter coli, c. lari and c. concisus for bacterial identification.
AB  == protein biomarkers observed in the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectra (maldi-tof-ms) of cell lysates of three strains of campylobacter coli, two strains of c. lari and one strain of c. concisus have been identified by 'bottom-up' proteomic techniques. the significant findings are as follows. first, the protein biomarkers identified were: phna-related protein,  4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (dmpi)-related protein, nifu-like protein, cytochrome c, dna-binding protein hu, 10 kda chaperonin, thioredoxin, as well as  several conserved hypothetical and ribosomal proteins. second, variations in the  biomarker ion m/z in maldi-tof-ms spectra across species and strains are the result of variations in the amino acid sequence of the protein due to non-synonymous mutations of the biomarker gene. third, the most common post-translational modifications (ptms) were the removal of the n-terminal methionine and n-terminal signal peptides. however, in the case of the nifu protein (an iron-sulfur cluster transport protein), post-translational cleavage occurred from the c-terminus. fourth, only the genomes of the c. coli strain rm2228 and c. lari strain rm2100 have been sequenced; thus, proteomic identification of the proteins of the other strains in this study relied upon sequence homology to the genomic sequence of these strains as well as the genomes of sequences of other campylobacter strains. in some cases, the determination of  the full amino acid sequence of a protein biomarker from a genomically non-sequenced strain was accomplished by combining non-overlapping partial sequences from proteomic identifications of genomically-sequenced strains that were of the same species (or of a different species) to that of the non-sequenced strain. the accuracy of this composite sequence was confirmed by both ms and ms/ms. it was necessary, in some cases, to perform de novo sequencing on 'gaps' in the composite sequence that were not homologous to any genomically-sequenced strain. in order to validate the composite sequence approach, composite sequences were further confirmed by subsequent dna sequencing of the biomarker gene. thus,  using the composite sequence approach, it was possible to determine the full amino acid sequence of an unknown protein from a genomically non-sequenced bacterial strain without the necessity of either sequencing the biomarker gene or performing full de novo ms/ms sequencing. the sequence obtained could then be used as a strain-specific biomarker for analysis by 'top-down' proteomics techniques.

TI  == prevalence of campylobacter species, helicobacter pylori and arcobacter species in stool samples from the venda region, limpopo, south africa: studies using molecular diagnostic methods.
AB  == objectives: this study determined the prevalence of campylobacter spp., helicobacter pylori and arcobacter spp. in stool samples from venda in relation to diarrhea, intestinal inflammation and hiv status using specific molecular methods. methods: stool samples were collected from hospital patients (255) and primary school children (67). genomic dna was extracted from the stools and molecular methods including pcr, pcr followed by restriction analysis and multiplex pcr were used to test for the different organisms. the lactoferrin content of the stools was determined using commercial kits from techlab (blacksburg, va, usa). results: the prevalence of the different organisms was 50.6% for h. pylori, 10.2% for c. jejuni, 6.2% for a. butzleri, 6.5% for c. coli, 3.1% for c. concisus, 2.8% for a. cryaerophilus and 1.9% for a. skirrowii. of all the organisms, only c. jejuni was significantly associated with diarrhea (84.8%)  (chi2=21.025, p<0.001) and elevated levels of lactoferrin (78.8%) (chi2=16.919, p<0.005) and was an important pathogen associated with diarrhea among hiv positive individuals (22.8%). conclusions: campylobacter infections are common causes of gastroenteritis in venda. non-c. jejuni/coli campylobacters such as c.  concisus as well as a. butzleri and h. pylori may be involved in gastrointestinal diseases in the region but further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of non-jejuni/coli campylobacters and arcobacters from belgium.
AB  == objectives: to determine the susceptibility of non-jejuni/coli campylobacters and arcobacters isolated from diarrhoeal stool specimens in belgium. methods: the mics were determined using etest for six antimicrobial agents including ampicillin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and tetracycline for the most frequently isolated non-jejuni/coli campylobacter and arcobacter strains in two university hospital laboratories between 1995 and 2005. results: in total, 85 campylobacter upsaliensis, 20 campylobacter concisus, 11 campylobacter fetus, 61 arcobacter butzleri and 10 arcobacter cryaerophilus isolates were tested. most c. upsaliensis strains were susceptible to ampicillin  (100%), gentamicin (100%), ciprofloxacin (94.1%) and tetracycline (100%), whereas 11.8 and 12.9% were resistant to nalidixic acid and erythromycin, respectively. for a. butzleri, 78.7% of isolates were susceptible to ampicillin and erythromycin. most a. butzleri isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin (96.7%), nalidixic acid (82.0%), gentamicin (100%) and tetracycline (100%). all c. concisus strains were fully susceptible to ampicillin and tetracycline, but 5% of them were resistant to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and erythromycin. nearly all  c. fetus and a. cryaerophilus strains were susceptible to erythromycin but the results should be interpreted with caution since only a small number of strains were tested. conclusions: fluoroquinolones should be considered in the treatment  of severe c. upsaliensis and a. butzleri infection. when clinically indicated, erythromycin remains the first choice for the treatment of intestinal campylobacteriosis caused by c. concisus and c. fetus.

TI  == campylobacter concisus: an emerging pathogen?
AB  == only about half the cases of intestinal infectious disease have a routinely detectable causative agent diagnosed. increasingly, evidence indicates that campylobacter species other than c. jejuni and c. coli are associated with such cases. however, evidence is less clear, from epidemiological studies, for the pathogenic nature of these unusual campylobacters. this is particularly true for  organisms like c. concisus and is compounded by poor methods for routine recovery and identification. moreover, the application of typing methods for c. concisus has indicated a heterogeneous population and there is preliminary evidence to suggest differences in the pathogenic potential of strain types. however, considerable further work is needed with more discriminatory genotyping methods,  before accurate assessment of the risk of c. concisus infection to human health can be determined.

TI  == genomic and proteomic identification of a dna-binding protein used in the "fingerprinting" of campylobacter species and strains by maldi-tof-ms protein biomarker analysis.
AB  == we have identified a prominent approximately 10-kda protein biomarker observed in the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectra (maldi-tof-ms) of cell lysates of five thermophilic species of campylobacter: jejuni, coli, lari, upsaliensis, and helveticus. the biomarker was unambiguously  identified by genomic and proteomic sequencing as a dna-binding protein hu. we report the amino acid sequence of hu as determined by sequencing the hup gene of  four species (12 strains): c. jejuni (2), c. coli (4), c. upsaliensis (4) and c.  lari(2). confirmation of the amino acid sequence was obtained by nanoflow high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of the tryptic peptides of the extracted/digested hu protein. protein identification was also confirmed by comparison of the molecular weight (mw) predicted from the hup gene  and the mw of hu as measured by high-resolution mass spectrometry. we found the hu protein to be particularly useful as a biomarker in that it strongly ionizes by maldi and its mw varies between species and among strains within a species. intra- and interspecies variation of the hu mw is due to changes in the amino acid sequence of the hu protein and not due to co- or posttranslational modifications. the strong ionization efficiency of hu by maldi is likely due, in  part, to four lysine residues clustered at the carboxyl end of the protein. we also report identification of the hu protein biomarker for a c. helveticus strain, whose hup gene was not sequenced, but whose hu amino acid sequence was partially conserved in c. upsaliensis strains. we have also tentatively assigned  a approximately 10.5-kda protein biomarker of a c. concisus strain as an hu protein.

TI  == characterization of a haemolytic phospholipase a(2) activity in clinical isolates of campylobacter concisus.
AB  == a membrane-bound, haemolytic phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)) activity was detected in clinical strains of campylobacter concisus isolated from children with gastroenteritis. the clinical strains were assigned into two molecular groups (genomospecies) based on pcr amplification of their 23s rdna. this calcium-dependent, heat-stable, haemolytic pla(2) activity was detected in strains from both genomospecies. a crude haemolysin extract (che) was initially prepared from cellular outer-membrane proteins of these isolates and was further  fractionated by ultrafiltration. the haemolytic activity of the extracted fraction (r30) was retained by ultrafiltration using a 30 kda molecular mass cut-off filter, and was designated haemolysin extract (he). both che and he had pla(2) activity and caused stable vacuolating and cytolytic effects on chinese hamster ovary cells in tissue culture. primers for the conserved region of plda gene (phospholipase a gene) from campylobacter coli amplified a gene region of 460 bp in all tested isolates, confirming the presence of a homologous pla gene sequence in c. concisus. the detection of haemolytic pla(2) activity in c. concisus indicates the presence of a potential virulence factor in this species and supports the hypothesis that c. concisus is a possible opportunistic pathogen.

TI  == evaluation of culture methods and a dna probe-based pcr assay for detection of campylobacter species in clinical specimens of feces.
AB  == campylobacter species are the leading agents of bacterial gastroenteritis in developed countries. in this study 320 specimens of feces from patients with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis were cultured for campylobacter species by direct plating on modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar and by enrichment in modified preston broth, with or without blood added, for 48 h at 37 degrees c prior to plating. a 16s/23s pcr/dna probe membrane-based colorimetric detection assay was evaluated on a subset of the feces (n = 127), including 18 culture-positive and 109 culture-negative specimens. dna was extracted directly from the fecal specimens by using the qiaamp dna stool minikit for the dna probe-based pcr assay (pcr/dna probe assay). a second pcr/dna probe assay based on the 16s rrna gene in campylobacter spp. was applied to all specimens that were culture negative, pcr/dna positive on initial analysis. campylobacter species were cultured in 20 of the 320 specimens. the 16s/23s pcr/dna probe assay detected campylobacter dna in 17 of 18 (94% sensitivity) culture-positive specimens and in 41 (38%) culture-negative specimens. the presence of campylobacter dna in 35 of 41 culture-negative specimens was confirmed by the 16s pcr/dna probe assay. dna sequence analysis of seven 16s/23s pcr products and five 16s pcr products amplified from a selection of these specimens confirmed the presence of campylobacter dna and more specifically campylobacter jejuni, c. concisus, c. curvus, and c. gracilis dna in these specimens. the molecular assays described in this study are rapid methods for the detection and identification of campylobacter species in fecal specimens. the finding of campylobacter spp. dna in a large number of specimens of feces from patients with no other identified cause of diarrhea may suggest that campylobacter spp. other than c. jejuni and c. coli may account for a proportion of cases of acute gastroenteritis in which no etiological agent is currently identified.

TI  == detection of campylobacter species: a comparison of culture and polymerase chain  reaction based methods.
AB  == aims: to investigate the optimal method for the detection of campylobacters from  stool samples by comparing selective culture with membrane filtration and the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: three hundred and forty three stool samples were investigated by each of the three methods mentioned above. selective culture was performed with charcoal cefoperazone desoxycholate agar plates. membrane filtration was performed using cellulose triacetate membranes with 0.45  micro m pores placed on blood agar plates. enteropathogenic campylobacters were detected using a pcr identification algorithm, consisting of screening pcrs and species identification using a pcr enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (pcr-elisa), both based on the 16s rrna gene. results: of the 343 samples tested, 23 were positive by one or more method. of these, 17 were positive by selective culture,  12 by membrane filtration, and 20 by the pcr identification algorithm. a total of 18 of 23 positives were identified as c jejuni and/or c coli by the pcr identification algorithm, compared with 14 identified to the genus level by selective culture, and 10 by membrane filtration. among the remaining five positive samples, one c hyointestinalis was detected only by the pcr identification algorithm; one c upsaliensis was detected only by the pcr identification algorithm; one campylobacter sp was detected by membrane filtration and selective culture and later identified as c concisus; one campylobacter sp was detected by membrane filtration alone and later identified as arcobacter sp; and one campylobacter sp detected only by selective culture was lost to study and therefore not speciated. there was no significant difference between detection by selective culture and the other two methods. however, detection by pcr was significantly better than by membrane filtration (0.05 > p > 0.02). conclusion: the pcr identification algorithm can detect and identify campylobacter spp to the species level and the result is obtained on the same day. however, pcr is expensive, labour intensive, and does not provide an isolate for further identification or typing. selective culture is as good as the pcr identification algorithm for the detection of the two most common species, c jejuni and c coli, and it is cheap and practical. however, it does miss the less  common species, results take 48 hours, and identification is only to the genus level. membrane filtration showed a low sensitivity compared with the other methods and is not appropriate for the diagnostic laboratory, although it was the only method to detect the arcobacter sp. the optimum method for the detection of  campylobacters from stool samples in the diagnostic laboratory remains selective  culture.

AB  == the importance of campylobacter species other than c. jejuni/coli in diarrhoeal disease is largely unknown. we wished to determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of c. concisus infection in patients with enteric disease in a tertiary hospital. stool specimens were routinely tested for the presence of campylobacter species, by use of the filter isolation method. the medical records of the c. concisus-positive patients were reviewed. of 224 campylobacter isolates obtained, 110 were identified as c. concisus. concomitant infection occurred in only 27% of cases. by means of protein profiling we assigned c. concisus into 2 groups. the predominant c. concisus group 2 was the only strain to infect immunocompetent patients and children: 71% of the infected patients were immunocompromised, the majority being adults (84%). c. concisus may be a frequent cause of diarrhoea in immunocompromised patients. two groups of c. concisus were  found and these groups possibly vary in their pathogenic potential.

AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of campylobacteria including campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni (c. jejuni) and campylobacter coli in human clinical samples and in samples from healthy individuals and to reevaluate the efficacies of conventional selective methods for isolation of campylobacter spp. two charcoal-based selective media, modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar (mccda) and cefoperazone-amphotericin-teicoplanin  (cat) agar, were compared with skirrow's blood-based medium and with a filter method (filter) applied to a yeast-enriched blood agar. a total of 1,376 specimens were tested on all four media, and the percentages of thermophilic campylobacter-positive specimens isolated on skirrow's medium, filters, cat agar, and mccda were 82, 83, 85, and 95%, respectively. when additional samples were processed with the three selective media, mccda recovered significantly more thermophilic campylobacter spp. than skirrow's medium (p = 0.0034). no significant difference between skirrow's medium and cat agar was observed in this study. another six taxa were identified, namely, campylobacter concisus, campylobacter curvus-like bacteria, arcobacter butzleri, arcobacter cryaerophilus, helicobacter cinaedi, and sutterella wadsworthensis. most of these strains were isolated after 5 to 6 days of incubation by use of the filter technique. this paper provides evidence for the existence of s. wadsworthensis in human feces from clinical cases of gastrointestinal disorders and in feces from a healthy individual. furthermore, c. concisus was isolated from a large number of  diarrheal cases, particularly those at the extremes of age, but was additionally  isolated from the feces of healthy people. further investigations to establish the role of c. concisus and s. wadsworthensis in enteric disease is needed. we conclude that a range of campylobacteria may cause infections in denmark.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == 16s rrna gene sequences of 'candidatus campylobacter hominis', a novel uncultivated species, are found in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy humans.
AB  == although some campylobacter species are agents of gastroenteritis and periodontal disease in humans, little is known of the variety of campylobacters in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy individuals. this paper provides evidence for the existence of a previously undescribed, uncultivated campylobacter species that may be a commensal in the healthy human gut. saliva and faeces from 20 healthy individuals were examined by pcr assays specific for nine species of campylobacter (c. sputorum, c. concisus, c. upsaliensis, c. helveticus, c. lari,  c. fetus, c. hyointestinalis, c. jejuni and c. coli) and for the genus as a whole. genus-specific amplicons were produced from 19 of 20 saliva samples and from 18 of 20 faecal samples. c. concisus species-specific amplicons were produced from 19 of 20 saliva samples and 3 of 20 faecal samples. the faecal samples were all pcr-negative for other campylobacter species. three unidentified 16s rrna campylobacter genus-specific amplicons of faecal origin were sequenced.  phylogenetic analysis showed that these sequences were 99% similar, and clustered within the genus as a novel group which was termed hs (hs = healthy subject). a pcr primer pair specific for the hs group was designed from the sequence data and used to reexamine the original samples. although it was not possible to culture the organism from faeces, specific pcr assay detected it in 10 of the 20 faecal samples, but not in any corresponding saliva samples. the authors propose that the source of the amplicons is a previously undescribed and so far uncultivated species, which they term 'candidatus campylobacter hominis'.

AB  == we analyzed 307 recent clinical isolates and reference strains of campylobacter spp., helicobacter spp., and arcobacter spp. for arylsulfatase and pyrazinamidase activities and susceptibility to polymyxin b. all isolates studied were identified by dna dot hybridization prior to testing. campylobacter concisus, c.  sputorum, and helicobacter fennelliae were positive for arylsulfatase. c. jejuni, c. coli, c. lari, c. upsaliensis, and c. concisus were positive for pyrazinamidase. only helicobacter spp. were resistant to polymyxin b. c. fetus subsp. fetus, c. hyointestinalis, c. mucosalis, and arcobacter spp. were negative in all three tests. the tests were simple to perform and read, and with the exception of c. sputorum biovars, all isolates within a species gave consistently positive or negative results in all the assays. these three phenotypic tests may  help refine current methods for phenotypic identification of campylobacter spp. and related organisms in a reference laboratory setting.

TI  == helicobacter acinonyx sp. nov., isolated from cheetahs with gastritis.
AB  == four strains of a novel helicobacter species were isolated from the stomachs of cheetahs (acinonyx jubilatus) with gastritis. these isolates were phenotypically  similar to helicobacter pylori. the isolates were gram-negative, spiral bacteria  which grew under microaerophilic conditions at 37 degrees c, but not at 25 or 42  degrees c, and produced urease, catalase, oxidase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. the isolates did not ferment glucose, mannitol, inositol, sorbitol, rhamnose, sucrose, melibiose, amygdalin, or arabinose; hydrolyze hippurate or indoxyl acetate; or reduce nitrate. they did not produce h2s from triple sugar iron agar, and they did not grow in the presence of 1.0% glycine or 1.5% nacl. they were resistant to nalidixic acid and sensitive to cephalothin and metronidazole. cells were typically 0.3 by 2.0 microns and possessed tufts of two to five sheathed, monopolar flagella. the g+c content of strain 90-119 was 30 mol%. cluster analysis of densitometry scans of polyacrylamide protein gels revealed more than 70% similarity of the cheetah isolates to h. pylori, less than 60% similarity to helicobacter felis, and less than 50% similarity to helicobacter mustelae. complete 16s rrna sequences were determined for two of the cheetah isolates. phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the cheetah sequences to those of 19 reference strains, including h. pylori, h. felis (two strains), h. mustelae, helicobacter muridarum, "flexispira  rappini," wolinella succinogenes, campylobacter coli, campylobacter concisus, campylobacter curvus, campylobacter fetus, campylobacter hyointestinalis, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter lari, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum subsp. bubulus, a campylobacter sp. (pig isolate), [bacteroides] gracilis, and [bacteroides] ureolyticus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == revision of campylobacter, helicobacter, and wolinella taxonomy: emendation of generic descriptions and proposal of arcobacter gen. nov.
AB  == hybridization experiments were carried out between dnas from more than 70 strains of campylobacter spp. and related taxa and either 3h-labeled 23s rrnas from reference strains belonging to campylobacter fetus, campylobacter concisus, campylobacter sputorum, campylobacter coli, and campylobacter nitrofigilis, an unnamed campylobacter sp. strain, and a wolinella succinogenes strain or 3h- or 14c-labeled 23s rrnas from 13 gram-negative reference strains. an immunotyping analysis of 130 antigens versus 34 antisera of campylobacters and related taxa was also performed. we found that all of the named campylobacters and related taxa belong to the same phylogenetic group, which we name rrna superfamily vi and which is far removed from the gram-negative bacteria allocated to the five rrna superfamilies sensu de ley. there is a high degree of heterogeneity within this rrna superfamily. organisms belonging to rrna superfamily vi should be reclassified in several genera. we propose that the emended genus campylobacter should be limited to campylobacter fetus, campylobacter hyointestinalis, campylobacter concisus, campylobacter mucosalis, campylobacter sputorum, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, campylobacter lari, and "campylobacter  upsaliensis." wolinella curva and wolinella recta are transferred to the genus campylobacter as campylobacter curvus comb. nov. and campylobacter rectus comb. nov., respectively. bacteroides gracilis and bacteroides ureolyticus are generically misnamed and are closely related to the genus campylobacter. campylobacter nitrofigilis, campylobacter cryaerophila, and an unnamed campylobacter sp. strain constitute a new genus, for which the name arcobacter is proposed; this genus contains two species, arcobacter nitrofigilis comb. nov. (type species) and arcobacter cryaerophilus comb. nov. wolinella succinogenes so  far is the only species of the genus wolinella. the genus helicobacter is also emended; campylobacter cinaedi and campylobacter fennelliae are included in this  genus as helicobacter cinaedi comb. nov. and helicobacter fennelliae comb. nov.,  respectively. the genus "flexispira," with "flexispira rappini" as the only species, is closely related to the genus helicobacter. the free-living, sulfur-reducing campylobacters do not belong to any of these genera; they probably constitute a distinct genus within rrna superfamily vi.

TI  == the genus campylobacter: a decade of progress.
AB  == in 1977, microbiologists and clinicians were awakened to the importance of the genus campylobacter when it was learned that one species, campylobacter jejuni, was a major cause of human enteritis. in the following decade substantial advances were made in diagnosis, isolation technology, identification, classification, serotyping, and epidemiology. the genus has undergone rapid expansion as advantage was taken of the deoxyribonucleic acid-deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization technique in defining new species. the 14 species now included in the genus, however, constitute a widely diverse group, and one species, c. pylori, which is associated with human gastroduodenitis, is under consideration for reassignment to another genus. the nomenclature of the subspecies of c. fetus has been resolved and the role of c. fetus subsp. fetus as an agent of human infections has been more clearly defined. the thermophilic campylobacteria that are etiological agents of human enteritis now include three species, c. jejuni, c. coli, and c. laridis. recently defined species that have also been implicated  as enteritis-causing agents include c. hyointestinalis, "c. upsaliensis," "c. cinaedi," and "c. fennelliae." the aerotolerant campylobacteria are now included  in the species c. cryaerophila, and the campylobacteria isolated from salt marshes are included in c. nitrofigilis. the taxonomy and nomenclature of c. sputorum have been revised. c. sputorum now consists of three biovars (biotypes). two of these, biovar sputorum and biovar bubulus, were previously considered to be separate subspecies and the third, biovar fecalis, was previously regarded as  a separate species and known as "c. fecalis." the former subspecies c. sputorum subsp. mucosalis has been elevated to the rank of species. c. mucosalis is metabolically closely related to c. consisus. human pathogens have not been identified among c. sputorum, c. mucosalis, or c. concisus. the goal of this article is to review developments during the last 10 years with emphasis on changes in taxonomy that are important from the perspective of the clinical microbiologist.
