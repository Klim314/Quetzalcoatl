comparative evaluation of the antibacterial effects of four dentine bonding systems: an in vitro study.
aim: the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate and the compare antibacterial efficacy of four dentin bonding system against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus acidophilus over a period of three months using agar disk diffusion test. methodology: all the three standard bacterial strains were inoculated into bhi broth and incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. a 100 mul of broth suspension containing aliquots of s. mutans, s. salivarius and l. acidophilus were spread onto m-h agar medium using sterile cotton swabs. the experimental groups were as follows: group a: test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against s. mutans mtcc 497, group b: test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against s. salivarius mtcc 1938, and group c: test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against l. acidophilus mtcc 447. for sample preparation, 20 mul bonding agent was dropped with micropipettes on paper disks, and blown dry for 10 seconds. then it was light-cured at 2 mm for 20 sec using a qth visible light curing unit. for first reading, the sample disks were placed over the freshly inoculated agar plates and then incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. the rest of the paper disks were stored in dark, submerged in distilled water at 37 degrees c. they were placed on freshly inoculated spread plates after specific time intervals- 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after ageing in pbs. after incubation, the diameters of zones of inhibition around the plates were measured. the experiment was performed twice in triplicate. the data was then statistically analysed using two way anova test and post hoc. results: results showed that xeno iii had the maximum antibacterial efficacy over a period of three months, followed by xp bond. this antibacterial activity was maximum against streptococcus mutans, followed by lactobacillus acidophilus and least against streptococcus salivarius. adper easy one and g bond had minimal effect against the test bacteria during the test period. conclusion: the antibacterial effect decreased over a period of three months for all the dentin bonding systems.
effects of sonic energy on monospecific biofilms of cariogenic microorganisms.
purpose: to evaluate the in vitro differential effect of sonic energy, delivered  by sonicare advance, on cariogenic and non-cariogenic bacteria biofilms. methods: a wild strain of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius and veillonella alcalescens was isolated from human dental plaque. for each of the four microorganisms a biofilm adherent to bovine enamel disks, coated with artificial saliva, was obtained. biofilms were divided into four groups and were exposed to acoustic energy delivered by sonicare for 0 (control group), 5, 15 and 30 seconds. the distance between the end of the bristles and the disk surface was set to 7 mm, to ensure that the biofilm removal was simply due to fluid forces and not to the contact with the bristle tips during the brushing cycle. a colorimetric technique (mtt assay), based on the reduction of a yellow tetrazolium salt to a purple formazan, was used to evaluate the reduction of the adherent biomass after the exposure to the sonic energy. results: anova results showed that sonic energy exposure significantly reduced the biomass of s. mutans and s. salivarius adherent to the disks, while l. acidophilus and v. alcalescens seemed to remain basically unaffected. in the two streptococcal groups, the increase of the exposure time led to different reduction trends; while s. salivarius exhibited a progressive decrease over time, s. mutans showed a rapid reduction of the adherent biomass after a 15-second exposure to sonicare.
in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic streptococci: partial purification and properties.
mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near ph 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 c in the ph range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 c in the acid range. n-bromosuccinimide caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mm, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against s. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. the lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. digestion of the cell walls of s. mutans bht by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.
