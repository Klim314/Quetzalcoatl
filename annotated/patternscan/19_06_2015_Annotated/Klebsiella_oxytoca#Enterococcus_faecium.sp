TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == [prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in peking union medical college hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in peking union medical college  hospital. method: the incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. results: there were 449  positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. samples separated from patients with  community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. most community-aquired infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples.  respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were gram-negative (66.9%). the most common gram-negative bacteria included escherichia coli (13.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common gram-positive  bacteria. gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). the detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumonia/klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. the resistance to acinetobacter baumannii was serious. multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant a. baumannii acountted for 74% of all a. baumannii infections. stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. also, 22 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. all patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. fourteen  of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. there were 61  samples proved to be bacteria colonization. nonfermenters such as acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. conclusions: the pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly gram-negative bacteria. the incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.

TI  == the activity of antimicrobial peptide s-thanatin is independent on multidrug-resistant spectrum of bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the activity of s-thanatin (an analog of antimicrobial peptide derived from thanatin) against different bacterial pathogens frequently which can cause therapeutic problems was tested. the result showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of s-thanatin against all isolates of the escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella ornithinolytica and klebsiella oxytoca were in the range of 4-16mug/ml, no matter which antibiotic the bacterial was resistant or susceptible, while almost all mics to gram-positive bacterial were >128mug/ml except enterococcus faecium. s-thanatin was more effective toward gram-negative strains, especially for enterobacter and klebsiella. the mics of s-thanatin were no significantly different in the same species regardless of antibiotic sensitive or -resistant isolates to single or multiple antibiotic (p>0.05). likewise, no notable difference could be observed between e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, k. ornithinolytica which were sensitive to s-thanatin (p>0.05). it was implied that the antimicrobial activity of s-thanatin was independent on multi-drug resistance spectrum of bacteria.

TI  == [antibiotic-resistance in italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project ar-iss].
AB  == the antibiotic resistance surveillance project ar-iss, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country.  the laboratories collect and transmit data to the istituto superiore di sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis/faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed escherichia coli. they also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study earss-italia and from other european countries. oxacillin resistance in s. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in europe (41,5%). no strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. in s. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several european countries. unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in e. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in europe. presumptive esbl production in gram-negative organisms can be  estimated at 20% in klebsiella and 1% in e. coli. ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in europe. in conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. although some activities of ar-iss  need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and  representative data about antibiotic resistance in italy that can be used for comparison at the european level.

TI  == [a case of probable bacterial translocation-associated sepsis in healthy adult].
AB  == we report a patient with bacterial translocation-associated sepsis who was healthy and did not have any related-background. the 57-year-old male had been well until 16 hours before admission, when nausea and vomiting gradually developed and increased in intensity. in the morning of may 22, 2002, he had shaking chills, temperature of 38.6 degrees c and watery diarrhea, and was admitted to kawasaki municipal hospital. on admission, temperature was 40.7 degrees c but otherwise physical examination revealed no particular abnormality.  laboratory data showed total white blood cells of 28,400/microliter, platelet count of 130,000/microliter, creatinine of 2.0 mg/dl and c-reactive protein of 7.5 mg/dl. 1 g of cefmetazole was administered every eight hours. in the early morning of may 23, he suddenly went into shock. at that time, laboratory findings revealed total white blood cells of 33,700/microliter, platelet count of 65,000/microliter, c-reactive protein of 24.9 mg/dl, creatinine of 5.6 mg/dl and  serum potassium concentration of 5.7 meq/l. gram positive cocci and gram negative rods were isolated from blood culture obtained on admission. cefmetazole was changed to 1.5 g/day of imipenem/cilastatin sodium and 600 mg/day of clindamycin. in addition, hemodialysis and endotoxin removal with an adsorbent column using polymyxin b were performed. bacteria detected in the blood on admission were identified as klebsiela oxytoca and enterococcus faecium. imipenem/cilastatin sodium and clindamycin were continued for 13 days. the patient recovered fully and was discharged on june 11. this case suggests that bacterial translocation-associated sepsis might occur even in a hitherto healthy adult.

TI  == comparison of fecal flora following administration of two antibiotic protocols for suspected maternofetal infection.
AB  == two protocols are used by french neonatologists for the treatment of suspected maternofetal infection (smfi). three groups of premature and term neonates were included to study the impact of antibiotics on fecal flora: 10 infants with smfi  treated with amoxicillin and netilmicin (group bi), 10 infants with smfi treated  with amoxicillin, cefotoxime and netilmicin (group tri) and 10 infants without antibiotic therapy as controls (group c). group bi samples were colonized with klebsiella oxytoca and escherichia coli resistant to amoxicillin and by eneterococcus faecium and coagulase-negative staphylococci. in group tri biodiversity of the intestinal flora was low, with rapid growth of staphyloccoci  and occurrence of candida spp. these modifications of the intestinal flora should encourage us to use antibiotic treatment as targeted as possible.

TI  == spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with hepatic cirrhosis: evaluation  of a treatment protocol at specialized units.
AB  == introduction: spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a common and severe complication in patients with cirrhosis and ascitis. its prognosis clearly depends on its precocious clinical recognition and efficacious therapy. aim: to optimize a treatment protocol, after auditing clinical efficacy and describe microorganisms implicated at our institution. material and methods: retrospective study of clinical files of patients with hepatic cirrhosis with positive culture  of ascitic fluid (af) and/or an af polymorphonuclear (pmn) count of more than 250/mm3, treated at our units between 1st january, 2000 and 31st december, 2001 (n = 38). patients showed a median age of 49 years (30-76), 63% of which were male. forty-eight percent were classified as belonging to child-pugh b class, and 52% to c. results: first, considering cases with pmn > 250/mm3 (n = 29), antibiotics were given to all patients (cefotaxime and ampiciline). fifty-two percent had hepatic encephalopathy, 42% had fever, 66% abdominal pain. in 42% a microorganism was isolated. although 24% of fatal cases (only two related to infection), we noted a 73% clinical and laboratorial response. five patients (72%) that died, showed renal failure by the time of death. second, in all cases  with positive culture of ascitic fluid (n = 21), 42% of which with pmn > 250/mm3  and 9 monobacterial nonneutrocytic bacterascites' cases, one only agent was found: e. coli in 36%, streptococci (37%), staphylococci (14%), and other (14%):  klebsiella oxytoca, n = 1; salmonella enteritidis, n = 1; enterococcus faecium, n = 1, acinectobacter anitratus, n = 1. only one of the agents, e. faecium (3%) showed in vitro sensitivity exclusively to ampiciline; all other were cefotaxime  sensitivite. conclusions: our protocol will be modified, to treat patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with cefotaxime, as monotherapy. albumin infusion will also be added to the protocol, as, we found renal failure to be an  important negative prognosis factor.

TI  == [utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study,  identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also  had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
