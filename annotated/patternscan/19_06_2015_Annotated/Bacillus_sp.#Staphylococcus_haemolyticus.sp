TI  == physical impaction injury effects on bacterial cells during spread plating influenced by cell characteristics of the organisms.
AB  == aims: to understand the factors that contribute to the variations in colony-forming units (cfu) in different bacteria during spread plating. methods and results: employing a mix culture of vegetative cells of ten organisms varying in cell characteristics (gram reaction, cell shape and cell size), spread plating to the extent of just drying the agar surface (50-60 s) was tested in comparison  with the alternate spotting-and-tilt-spreading (sats) approach where 100 mul inoculum was distributed by mere tilting of plate after spotting as 20-25 microdrops. the former imparted a significant reduction in cfu by 20% over the spreader-independent sats approach. extending the testing to single organisms, gram-negative proteobacteria with relatively larger cells (escherichia, enterobacter, agrobacterium, ralstonia, pantoea, pseudomonas and sphingomonas spp.) showed significant cfu reduction with spread plating except for slow-growing methylobacterium sp., while those with small rods (xenophilus sp.) and cocci (acinetobacter sp.) were less affected. among gram-positive nonspore formers, staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant cfu reduction while staphylococcus haemolyticus and actinobacteria (microbacterium, cellulosimicrobium and brachybacterium spp.) with small rods/cocci were unaffected. vegetative cells of bacillus pumilus and b. subtilis were generally unaffected while others with larger rods (b. thuringiensis, brevibacillus, lysinibacillus and paenibacillus spp.) were significantly affected. a simulated plating study coupled with live-dead bacterial staining endorsed the chances of cell disruption with spreader impaction in afflicted organisms. conclusions: significant reduction in cfu could occur during spread plating due to physical impaction injury to bacterial cells depending on the spreader usage and the variable effects on different organisms are determined by gram reaction, cell size and cell shape. the inoculum spreader could impart physical disruption of vegetative cells against a hard surface. significance and impact of study: possibility of cfu reduction in sensitive organisms and the skewed selection of hardier organisms during spread plating, and the recommendation of sats as an easier and safer alternative for cfu enumerations.

TI  == bacterial contamination of random-donor platelets in a university hospital in the midwestern region of brazil.
AB  == background: bacterial blood contamination was probably the first recognized transfusion-transmitted disease. although the transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis has been known for a long time, it remains an important health problem. at present it is the most frequently reported cause of infectious transfusion-related fatalities. the aims of the study were to determine the prevalence of microbiologic contamination in random-donor platelets (rdps) and to identify the isolated microorganism obtained from a brazilian university hemotherapy service. study design and methods: a total of 2000 rdps were analyzed from november 2004 to june 2005. the time of storage of the platelet (plt) concentrates studied ranged from the day of donation (day 0) to the fifth day of  storage (day 5). the rdp cultures were initially performed in pools with bottles  containing brain heart infusion (bhi) growth medium, and cultures were incubated  aerobically at 37 degrees c for up to 7 days and subcultured onto chocolate agar  at 37 degrees c for 48 hours under conditions of microaerophilia. in the cases of positivity of one pool, the culture was individually performed for all the samples of that pool. results: eight units (0.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.49) were found to be contaminated. isolated microorganisms were three acinetobacter lwoffii, one enterobacter intermedium, one serratia phymuthica, one staphylococcus haemolyticus, one staphylococcus hominis, and one bacillus sp. conclusion: plt concentrates were contaminated with bacteria in 0.4 percent of tested units, which represents a potential risk to patients and a public health problem. regarding the contaminant microorganisms, a predominance of gram-negative agents was observed (62.5%).
