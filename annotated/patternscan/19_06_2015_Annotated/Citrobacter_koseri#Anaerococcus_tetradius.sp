TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mic90 of mepm for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. mepm was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. mepm were active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (ipm) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (87.9%). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in proteus mirabilis. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which mic90 of  mepm was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in  conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful  carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == anaerobic cocci populating the deep tissues of chronic wounds impair cellular wound healing responses in vitro.
AB  == background: anaerobic cocci are estimated to be present in the deep tissues of over 50% of chronic skin wounds. while the part they play in the chronicity of these wounds is uninvestigated, anaerobic cocci have previously been shown to be  involved in other chronic inflammatory human conditions. methods: in this study the anaerobic microflora of the deep tissues of 18 patients with refractory chronic venous leg ulcers (mean age 80.3 years; mean duration > 24 months) was characterized using strict anaerobic culture conditions. the effect of the anaerobic organisms isolated from these tissues on extracellular matrix (ecm) proteolysis and cellular wound healing responses was studied using in vitro models. results: anaerobic organisms were present in the deep tissues of 14 of 18 wounds and were principally peptostreptococcus spp. the effects of three peptostreptococcus spp. isolated from these wounds (p. magnus, p. vaginalis and p. asaccharolyticus) on cellular wound healing responses were compared with those of two pathogenic organisms also isolated from these wounds (pseudomonas aeruginosa and citrobacter diversus). while the direct ecm proteolytic activity exhibited by the peptostreptococcus spp. was limited, they did significantly inhibit both fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation, but only at high concentrations. however, at lower concentrations peptostreptococcal supernatants  profoundly inhibited keratinocyte wound repopulation and endothelial tubule formation. the magnitude of these effects varied between strains and they were distinct from those demonstrated by pseudomonas aeruginosa and citrobacter diversus. conclusions: these studies confirm the importance of anaerobic organisms in chronic wounds and demonstrate an indirect, strain-specific mechanism by which these microorganisms may play a part in mediating the chronicity of these wounds.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.
