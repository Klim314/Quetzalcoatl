TI  == lactic acid microflora of the gut of snail .
AB  == the intestinal lactic acid microflora of the edible snail cornu aspersum was studied by culture-based methods and was phenotypically and molecularly characterized. the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates  was investigated. snails in different stages of development were collected from farms located in several regions of bulgaria. one hundred twenty-two isolates, belonging to the group of lab, were characterized morphologically and were divided into four groups. representative isolates from each morphological type were subjected to phenotypic characterization and molecular identification. the snail gut lactic acid microflora was composed by enterococcus (17 isolates), lactococcus (12 isolates), leuconostoc (7 isolates), lactobacillus (18 isolates)  and weissella (1 isolate). the species affiliation of lactococcus lactis (12), leuconostoc mesenteroides (4) and lactobacillus plantarum (2) was confirmed by species-specific primers. the lactobacillus isolates were identified by sequence  analysis of 16s rdna as lactobacillus brevis (12), l. plantarum (2), lactobacillus graminis (1) and lactobacillus curvatus (3). the species l. brevis, l. graminis and l. curvatus were found in snails in a phase of hibernation, whereas l. plantarum was identified both in active and hibernation phases. antibacterial activity (bacteriocine-like) was shown only by one strain of l. mesentereoides p4/8 against propionibacterium acnes. the present study showed that the lab are a component of the microbial communities in the snail digestive  system. this is the first report on lactobacillus strains detected in the gut of  c. aspersum.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == heart valve allograft decontamination with antibiotics: impact of the temperature of incubation on efficacy.
AB  == heart valve allografts are typically processed at 4 degrees c in north america, including the step of antibiotic decontamination. in our own experience with heart valve banking, we often observe persistent positive cultures following decontamination at wet ice temperature. we hypothesized that warmer temperatures  of incubation might increase the efficacy of the decontamination procedure. in a  first series of experiments, 12 different bacterial species were grown overnight, frozen in standardized aliquots and used directly to inoculate antibiotic cocktail aliquots at 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. the antibiotic cocktail contains vancomycin (50 mug/ml), gentamicin (80 mug/ml) and cefoxitin (240 mug/ml) in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium. inoculated aliquots were incubated at 4, 22 and 37 degrees c and cfus were determined at regular intervals up to 24  h post-inoculation. in a second set of experiments, 10 heart valves were spiked with 5000 cfu/ml and incubated with antibiotics at 4 and 37 degrees c for 24 h. the final rinse solutions of these heart valves were filtered and tested for bacterial growth. after 24 h of incubation, cfus of all 12 bacterial species were reduced by a factor of only one to two logs at 4 degrees c whereas log reductions of 3.7 and 5.0 or higher were obtained at 22 and 37 degrees c, respectively. most microorganisms, including staphylococcus epidermidis, lactococcus lactis lactis and propionibacterium acnes survived well the 24-h antibiotic treatment at 4 degrees c (< 1 log reduction). all 10 heart valves that were spiked with microorganisms had positive final rinse solutions after antibiotic soaking at 4 degrees c, whereas 8 out of 10 cultures were negative when antibiotic decontamination was done at 37 degrees c. these experiments show that a wet ice temperature greatly reduces the efficacy of the allograft decontamination process as microorganisms survived well to a 24-h 4 degrees c antibiotic treatment. this  could explain the high rate of positive post-processing cultures obtained with our routine tissue decontamination procedure. increasing the decontamination temperature from 4 to 37 degrees c may significantly reduce the incidence of post-disinfection bacterial contamination of heart valves.

TI  == heterologous expression of linoleic acid isomerase from propionibacterium acnes and anti-proliferative activity of recombinant trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == the linoleic acid isomerase enzyme from propionibacterium acnes responsible for bioconversion of linoleic acid to trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10, c12 cla) was cloned and overexpressed in lactococcus lactis and escherichia coli, resulting in between 30 and 50 % conversion rates of the substrate linoleic acid  to t10, c12 cla. the anti-proliferative activities of the fatty acids produced following isomerization of linoleic acid by l. lactis and e. coli were assessed using the human sw480 colon cancer cell line. fatty acids generated from both l.  lactis and e. coli contained a mixture of linoleic acid and t10, c12 cla at a ratio of approximately 1.35 : 1. following 5 days of incubation of sw480 cells with 5-20 microg ml(-1) (17.8-71.3 microm) of the t10, c12 cla, there was a significant (p<0.001) reduction in growth of the sw480 cancer cells compared with the linoleic acid control. cell viability after treatment with the highest concentration (20 microg ml(-1)) of the t10, c12 cla was reduced to 7.9 % (l. lactis cla) and 19.6 % (e. coli cla), compared with 95.4 % (control linoleic acid) and 31.7 % (pure t10, c12 cla). in conclusion, this is believed to represent the first report in which recombinant strains are capable of producing  cla with an anti-proliferative potential.
