TI  - Genetic transformation of Porphyromonas gingivalis by electroporation.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis was transformed by electroporation using the DNA of plasmid pE5-2, or its derivative, pYT7. Prior to transformation, pE5-2 was transferred from Escherichia coli to P. gingivalis strains by conjugation (mobilization with R751), and the plasmid DNA was purified from the P. gingivalis transconjugants. Transformation occurred when the recipient strain and the donor strain from which the plasmid DNA was purified were homologous. If they were heterologous, transformation did not take place or did so at a very low frequency. This suggested that a restriction-modification system is present in P. gingivalis strains. Plasmid pYT7 was derived by removing an 8.0 kb AvaI fragment from pE5-2 that was purified from P. gingivalis cells. It has several single-cutting restriction sites such as EcoRI, AvaI and ClaI usable for gene cloning, though it was not stable enough in P. gingivalis cells, probably because the rep gene was derived from a relatively distant species, Bacteroides eggerthii.
TI  - Use of targeted insertional mutagenesis to determine whether chondroitin lyase II is essential for chondroitin sulfate utilization by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
AB  - Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron produces two inducible chondroitin lyases (I and II) when it is grown on chondroitin sulfate. Both enzymes have very similar biochemical properties. To determine whether both enzymes are required for growth on chondroitin sulfate, we constructed a Bacteroides suicide vector, pE3-1, and used it to create an insertional mutation that interrupts the chondroitin lyase II gene of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. pE3-1 contains a 4.4-kilobase cryptic B. eggerthii plasmid (pB8-51), the Escherichia coli cloning vector pBR328, and the EcoRI D fragment from the conjugative B. fragilis plasmid pBF4. A 0.8-kilobase fragment from the center of the B. thetaiotaomicron chondroitin lyase II gene was inserted in pE3-1 to create pEG817. Although, pEG817 is stably maintained in E. coli and can be mobilized into B. thetaiotaomicron by the IncP plasmid R751, pEG817 is not maintained as a plasmid in Bacteroides spp. When pEG817 was mobilized into B. thetaiotaomicron, with selection for a drug marker on pEG817, transconjugants were obtained which had pEG817 inserted into the chondroitin lyase II gene. Western blot analysis was used to confirm that intact chondroitin lyase II is not produced in the mutant. The mutant was able to utilize chondroitin sulfate as a sole source of carbon, although no active chondroitin lyase II was produced. Thus chondroitin lyase I alone appears to be sufficient for growth on chondroitin sulfate. The mutant also had some minor changes in its outer membrane protein profile. However, there was no evidence that any of the major chondroitin sulfate-associated polypeptides in the outer membrane were affected by the insertion in the chondroitin lyase II gene.
