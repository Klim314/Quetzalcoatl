TI  == application of several molecular techniques to study numerically predominant bifidobacterium spp. and bacteroidales order strains in the feces of healthy children.
AB  == bifidobacteria and bacteroides-like bacteria are strictly anaerobic nonpathogenic members of human intestinal microflora. here we describe an analysis of the species and subspecies composition of these bacterial populations in healthy children using a combination of culture and molecular methods at two different time points. it was found that b. bifidum and b. longum are the most common dominant taxons in infants aged between 8 and 16 months. the majority of the infants carried several dominant bifidobacterium strains belonging to different species. examination of the dominant bifidoflora in some of these children after  a 5-year period showed major shifts in both species and strain composition, but the dominant strains remained unchanged in two children. the majority of dominant bacteroides-like isolates belonged to species b. vulgatus and b. uniformis, but members of genera alistipes and barnesiella were common too. in addition, a novel approach to species identification of bacteroidales order bacteria using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) is described.
