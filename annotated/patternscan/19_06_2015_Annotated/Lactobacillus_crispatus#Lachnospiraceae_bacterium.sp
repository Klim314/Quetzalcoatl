TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == influence of antimicrobial feed additives on broiler commensal posthatch gut microbiota development and performance.
AB  == the effects of avilamycin, zinc bacitracin, and flavophospholipol on broiler gut  microbial community colonization and bird performance in the first 17 days posthatch were investigated. significant differences in gut microbiota associated with gut section, dietary treatment, and age were identified by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp), although no performance-related differences between dietary treatments were detected. similar age-related shifts in the gut microbiota were identified regardless of diet but varied between the ilea and ceca. interbird variabilities in ileal bacterial communities were reduced (3 to 7 days posthatch) in chicks fed with feed containing antimicrobial agents. avilamycin and flavophospholipol had the most consistent effect on gut microbial communities. operational taxonomic units (otu) linked to changes in gut microbiota in birds on antimicrobial-supplemented diets  were characterized and identified. some otus could be identified to the species level; however, the majority could be only tentatively classified to the genus, family, order, or domain level. otus 140 to 146 (lachnospiraceae), otu 186/188 (lactobacillus johnsonii), otu 220 (lachnospiraceae), otus 284 to 288 (unclassified bacterial spp. or ruminococcaceae), otu 296/298 (unclassified bacterium or clostridiales), and otu 480/482 (oxalobacteraceae) were less prevalent in the guts of chicks fed antimicrobial-supplemented diets. otu 178/180 (lactobacillus crispatus), otu 152 (lactobacillus reuteri or unclassified clostridiales), otu 198/200 (subdoligranulum spp.), and otu 490/492 (unclassified bacterium or enterobacteriaceae) were less prevalent in the gut of chicks raised  on the antimicrobial-free diet. the identification of key bacterial species influenced by antimicrobial-supplemented feed immediately posthatch may assist in the formulation of diets that facilitate beneficial gut microbial colonization and, hence, the development of alternatives to current antimicrobial agents in feed for sustainable poultry production.

TI  == deep sequencing of the vaginal microbiota of women with hiv.
AB  == background: women living with hiv and co-infected with bacterial vaginosis (bv) are at higher risk for transmitting hiv to a partner or newborn. it is poorly understood which bacterial communities constitute bv or the normal vaginal microbiota among this population and how the microbiota associated with bv responds to antibiotic treatment. methods and findings: the vaginal microbiota of 132 hiv positive tanzanian women, including 39 who received metronidazole treatment for bv, were profiled using illumina to sequence the v6 region of the 16s rrna gene. of note, gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus iners were detected in each sample constituting core members of the vaginal microbiota. eight major clusters were detected with relatively uniform microbiota compositions. two clusters dominated by l. iners or l. crispatus were strongly associated with a normal microbiota. the l. crispatus dominated microbiota were associated with low ph, but when l. crispatus was not present, a large fraction of l. iners was required to predict a low ph. four clusters were strongly associated with bv, and were dominated by prevotella bivia, lachnospiraceae, or a mixture of different species. metronidazole treatment reduced the microbial diversity and perturbed the bv-associated microbiota, but rarely resulted in the  establishment of a lactobacilli-dominated microbiota. conclusions: illumina based microbial profiling enabled high though-put analyses of microbial samples at a high phylogenetic resolution. the vaginal microbiota among women living with hiv  in sub-saharan africa constitutes several profiles associated with a normal microbiota or bv. recurrence of bv frequently constitutes a different bv-associated profile than before antibiotic treatment.
