study of lactic acid bacteria community from raw milk of iranian one humped camel and evaluation of their probiotic properties.
background: camel milk is amongst valuable food sources in iran. on the other hand, due to the presence of probiotic bacteria and bacteriocin producers in camel milk, probiotic bacteria can be isolated and identified from this food product. objectives: the objectives of the present research were the isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria from camel milk and evaluation of their probiotic properties. materials and methods: a total of ten samples of camel milk were collected from the golestan province of iran under aseptic conditions. bacteria were isolated by culturing the samples on selective medium. isolates were identified by amplification of the 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer (its) region between the 16s and 23s rrna genes by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and were then screened and grouped by the amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) method. to evaluate probiotic properties, representative isolates of different ardra profiles were analyzed. the antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) against pediococcus pentosaceus, escherichia coli and bacillus cereus was examined by the agar diffusion assay. acid and bile tolerance of isolates were evaluated. results: a total of 64 isolates were analyzed based on biochemical tests and morphological characteristics. the most frequently isolated lab was enterococci. weissella, leuconostoc, lactobacilli and pediococci were less frequently found. based on restriction analysis of the its, the isolates were grouped into nine different ardra patterns that were identified by ribosomal dna sequencing as p. pentosaceus, enterococcus faecium strain y-2, e. faecium strain jz1-1, e. faecium strain e6, e. durans, e. lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus casei and weissella cibaria. the results showed that antimicrobial activity of the tested isolates was remarkable and p. pentosaceus showed the most antibacterial activity. in addition, e. durans, e. lactis, l. casei and p. pentosaceus were selected as probiotic bacteria. conclusions: this study revealed the presence of bacteriocin-producing bacteria and probiotic bacteria in camel milk from the golestan province of iran.
identification and antimicrobial activity detection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from corn stover silage.
a total of 59 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from corn stover silage. according to phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequences and reca gene polymerase chain reaction amplification, these lab isolates were identified as five species: lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus mundtii, weissella cibaria and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. those strains were also screened for antimicrobial activity using a dual-culture agar plate assay. based on excluding the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, two l. plantarum subsp. plantarum strains zzu 203 and 204, which strongly inhibited salmonella enterica atcc 43971(t), micrococcus luteus atcc 4698(t) and escherichia coli atcc 11775(t) were selected for further research on sensitivity of the antimicrobial substance to heat, ph and protease. cell-free culture supernatants of the two strains exhibited strong heat stability (60 min at 100 degrees c), but the antimicrobial activity was eliminated after treatment at 121 degrees c for 15 min. the antimicrobial substance remained active under acidic condition (ph 2.0 to 6.0), but became inactive under neutral and alkaline condition (ph 7.0 to 9.0). in addition, the antimicrobial activities of these two strains decreased remarkably after digestion by protease k. these results preliminarily suggest that the desirable antimicrobial activity of strains zzu 203 and 204 is the result of the production of a bacteriocin-like substance, and these two strains with antimicrobial activity could be used as silage additives to inhibit proliferation of unwanted microorganism during ensiling and preserve nutrients of silage. the nature of the antimicrobial substances is being investigated in our laboratory.
screening of lactic acid bacteria for their potential as microbial cell factories for bioconversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks.
background: the use of fossil carbon sources for fuels and petrochemicals has serious impacts on our environment and is unable to meet the demand in the future. a promising and sustainable alternative is to substitute fossil carbon sources with microbial cell factories converting lignocellulosic biomass into desirable value added products. however, such bioprocesses require availability of suitable and efficient microbial biocatalysts, capable of utilizing c5 sugars and tolerant to inhibitory compounds generated during pretreatment of biomass. in this study, the performance of a collection of lactic acid bacteria was evaluated regarding their properties with respect to the conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks. the strains were examined for their ability to utilize xylose and arabinose as well as their resistance towards common inhibitors from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass (furan derivatives, phenolic compounds, weak acids). results: among 296 tested lactobacillus and pediococcus strains, 3 l. pentosus, 1 p. acidilactici and 1 p. pentosaceus isolates were found to be both capable of utilizing xylose and arabinose and highly resistant to the key inhibitors from chemically pretreated lignocellulosic biomass. when tested in broth with commonly found combinations of inhibitors, the selected strains showed merely 4%, 1% and 37% drop in growth rates for sugarcane bagasse, wheat straw and soft wood representatives, respectively, as compared to escherichia coli mg1655 showing decreased growth rates by 36%, 21% and 90%, respectively, under the same conditions. conclusion: the study showed that some strains of lactobacilli and pediococci have the potential to be used as production platforms for value-added products from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass. selected lactobacilli and pediococci strains were able to tolerate the key inhibitors in higher concentrations compared to e.coli; in addition, as these isolates were also capable of fermenting xylose and arabinose, they constitute good candidates for efficient lignocellulosic feedstock bioconversions.
bacteriocin production by pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from marula (scerocarya birrea).
strain st44am, isolated from marula, was identified as pediococcus pentosaceus based on biochemical tests, sugar fermentation reactions (api 50chl), pcr with species-specific primers and 16s rdna sequencing. strain st44am produces a 6.5 kda class iia bacteriocin, active against lactic acid bacteria, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, listeria innocua, listeria ivanovii subsp. ivanovii and listeria monocytogenes. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, triton x-100, triton x-114, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea, nacl and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees c for 120 min or 121 degrees c for 20 min. the mode of activity against l. ivanovii susbp. ivanovii atcc19119 and enterococcus faecium hklhs is bactericidal, resulting in cell lyses and enzyme- and dna-leakage. no significant differences in cell growth and bacteriocin production were observed when strain st44am was cultured in mrs broth at 26 degrees c, 30 degrees c and 37 degrees c for 24 h and tested against the same target strain. l. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii atcc 19119 and e. faecium hklhs did, however, differ in sensitivity to bacteriocin st44am (3.3x10(6) au/ml and 2.6x10(4) au/ml, respectively). peptide st44am adsorbs at high levels (1600 au/ml) to producer cells. bacteriocin st44am may be a derivative of pediocin pa-1. this is the first report on the presence of p. pentosaceus in marula and a pediocin pa-1 derivative produced by this species. we are also the first to report on the synergetic effect ciprofloxacin has on a pediocin-like bacteriocin.
inhibition of escherichia coli o157:h7 in ripening dry fermented sausage by ground yellow mustard.
compounds generated by the enzymatic hydrolysis of glucosinolates naturally present in mustard powder are potently bactericidal against escherichia coli o157:h7. because e. coli o157:h7 can survive the dry fermented sausage manufacturing process, 2, 4, and 6% (wt/wt) nondeheated (hot) mustard powder or 6% (wt/wt) deheated (cold) mustard powder were added to dry sausage batter inoculated with e. coli o157:h7 at about 7 log cfu/g to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of the powders. reductions in e. coli o157:h7 populations, changes in ph and water activity (aw), effects on starter culture (pediococcus pentosaceus and staphylococcus carnosus) populations, and effects of mustard powder on sausage texture (shear) were monitored during ripening. nondeheated mustard powder at 2, 4, and 6% in dry sausage (0.90 aw) resulted in significant reductions in e. coli o157:h7 (p < 0.05) of 3.4, 4.4, and 6.9 log cfu/g, respectively, within 30 days of drying. during fermentation and drying, mustard powder did not affect p. pentosaceus and s. carnosus activity in any of the treatments. extension of drying to 36 and 48 days reduced e. coli o157:h7 by >5 log cfu/g in the 4 and 2% mustard powder treatments, respectively. the 6% deheated mustard powder treatment provided the most rapid reductions of e. coli o157:h7 (yielding <0.20 log cfu/g after 24 days) by an unknown mechanism and was the least detrimental (p < 0.05) to sausage texture.
elimination of escherichia coli o157:h7 from fermented dry sausages at an organoleptically acceptable level of microencapsulated allyl isothiocyanate.
four sausage batters (17.59% beef, 60.67% pork, and 17.59% pork fat) were inoculated with two commercial starter culture organisms (>7 log(10) cfu/g pediococcus pentosaceus and 6 log(10) cfu/g staphylococcus carnosus) and a five-strain cocktail of nonpathogenic variants of escherichia coli o157:h7 to yield 6 to 7 log(10) cfu/g. microencapsulated allyl isothiocyanate (ait) was added to three batters at 500, 750, or 1,000 ppm to determine its antimicrobial effects. for sensory analysis, separate batches with starter cultures and 0, 500, or 750 ppm microencapsulated ait were produced. sausages were fermented at < or =26 degrees c and 88% relative humidity (rh) for 72 h. subsequently sausages were dried at 75% rh and 13 degrees c for at least 25 days. the water activity (a(w)), ph, and levels of starter cultures, e. coli o157:h7, and total bacteria were monitored during fermentation and drying. all sausages showed changes in the initial ph from 5.57 to 4.89 and in a(w) from 0.96 to 0.89 by the end of fermentation and drying, respectively. starter culture numbers were reduced during sausage maturation, but there was no effect of ait on meat ph reduction. e. coli o157:h7 was reduced by 6.5 log(10) cfu/g in sausages containing 750 and 1,000 ppm ait after 21 and 16 days of processing, respectively. e. coli o157:h7 numbers were reduced by 4.75 log(10) cfu/g after 28 days of processing in treatments with 500 ppm ait, and the organism was not recovered from this treatment beyond 40 days. during sensory evaluation, sausages containing 500 ppm ait were considered acceptable although slightly spicy by panelists.
persistence of escherichia coli o157:h7 in barley silage: effect of a bacterial inoculant.
aims: the effect of a lactic acid producing bacterial (lab) inoculant on the elimination of escherichia coli o157:h7 from barley forage was assessed. methods and results: triplicate mini-silos were prepared for four treatments and six sampling times (1, 3, 7, 15, 30 and 42 d post-ensiling). the treatments were (i) 10(5) cfu g(-1) pediococcus pentosaceus and propionibacterium jenzenii (p2); (ii) 10(5) cfu g(-1) e. coli o157:h7 strain 3081 and 10(5) cfu g(-1) e. coli biotype 1 strains 719ie10, 719ie14 and 614me49 (ec); (iii) p2 + ec; and (iv) the control (sterile distilled water). triplicate mini-silos were opened at each sampling time for ph, volatile fatty acid (vfa) and lactate determinations and e. coli, e. coli o157:h7 and lab were enumerated. on d 3 and 7, numbers of e. coli o157:h7 in p2 + ec were significantly lower than in ec (p < 0;05). escherichia coli o157:h7 was not detected in p2 + ec and ec at 7 and 15 d post-ensiling, respectively. on d 15 through 42, e. coli biotype 1 was not detected in p2 + ec or ec. populations of lab were higher in p2 and p2 + ec than in the control and ec on d 3 and 7 (p < 0.05). after 3 d of ensiling, lactate levels were higher (p < 0.05) and ph was lower (p < 0.05) in p2 and p2 + ec as compared to the control and ec. bacteriocins of p2 were not found to be inhibitory to e. coli o157:h7 using the agar-spot procedure. escherichia coli o157:h7 inoculated into the control silage at a level of 10(3) cfu g(-1) and exposed to aerobic conditions at 22 degrees c was not detected after 1 d and remained undetectable for the 28 d exposure period. conclusions: silage inoculant p2 increased lactate levels and decreased ph more rapidly during ensiling, which appeared to hasten the elimination of e. coli o157:h7 from the silage. significance and impact of the study: results emphasize the importance of adequate ensiling since e. coli o157:h7 may be maintained and spread among cattle through feed.
analysis of the genetic determinant for production of the pediocin p of pediococcus pentosaceus pep1.
pediococcus pentosaceus pep1 is a vacuum-packaged turkish sausage isolate which produces a potentially novel bacteriocin of the pediocin (anti-listeria) family of peptides designated as pediocin p. curing experiments and plasmid profile analysis indicated that both bacteriocin immunity and production determinants were linked and encoded by 9.0 mda plasmid, phd1.0. attempts to transform purified plasmid phd1.0 into recipient escherichia coli jm109 cells by electroporation were successful but none of the e. coli jm109 cells were able to express and/or release pediocin p. however, p. pentosaceus pc, a plasmid-cured variant of p. pentosaceus pep1 was successfully transformed with phd1.0 by electroporation and bac-bacs p. pentosaceus pc cells restarted to express and/or release pediocin p again as indicated by the presence of zone of growth inhibition of l. plantarum ncdo 955 around colonies.
enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl. tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
effect of chitosan in meat preservation.
the effect of chitosan in meat preservation, including microbiological, chemical, sensory and color qualities, was examined. in liquid medium, chitosan (0.01%) inhibited the growth of some spoilage bacteria such as bacillus subtilis ifo 3025, escherichia coli rb, pseudomonas fragi ifo 3458 and staphylococcus aureus iam 1011. at higher concentrations (0.1 and 1.0%) it inhibited the growth of the meat starter cultures, lactobacillus plantarium iam 1216, pediococcus pentosaceus iam 12296 and micrococcus varians ifo 3765. in meat, during incubation at 30 degrees c for 48 h or storage at 4 degrees c for 10 days, 0.5-1.0% chitosan inhibited the growth of spoilage bacteria, reduced lipid oxidation and putrefaction, and resulted in better sensory attributes. chitosan also had a good effect on the development of the red color of meat during storage.
the occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees c) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the ph of the mix to 4.5-4.7. significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis. micrococcus varians and micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. less growth was exhibited by bacillus megaterium and yeasts. pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (p. pentosaceus and l. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. the growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. inoculated escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella sofia, and staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. lesser growth occurred for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with p. acidilactici.
