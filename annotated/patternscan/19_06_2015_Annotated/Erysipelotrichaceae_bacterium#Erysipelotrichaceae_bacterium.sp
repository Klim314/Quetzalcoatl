TI  == high-grain feeding causes strong shifts in ruminal epithelial bacterial community and expression of toll-like receptor genes in goats.
AB  == high-grain (hg) feeding used in intensive goat production can affect the physiology of the rumen wall, but the changes induced in the epimural bacterial community and host toll-like receptors (tlrs) are not well understood. in this study, 10 male goats were randomly allocated to two groups and fed either a hay diet (0% grain; n = 5) or an hg diet (65% grain; n = 5). the changes in the ruminal epithelial bacterial community and expression of tlrs during long-term (7 weeks) hg feeding were determined using pyrosequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. principal coordinate analysis and analysis of molecular variance (amova) results showed that hg feeding caused a strong shift in bacterial composition and structure. at the genus level, our data revealed that it increased the relative abundance of taxa butyrivibrio, unclassified clostridiales, mogibacterium, unclassified anaerolineaceae, and succiniclasticum, and decreased the proportion of unclassified ruminococcaceae, unclassified rikenellaceae, unclassified erysipelotrichaceae, howardella, and unclassified neisseriaceae. the hg-fed goats also exhibited upregulation of the relative mrna  expression of tlr2, tlr3, and tlr5 in the rumen epithelium (p < 0.05). correlation analysis revealed that the increase in tlr expression was associated  with changes in the relative abundance of ruminal epithelial bacteria. this study provides a first insight into the adaptive response of ruminal epithelial bacterial populations to hg feeding in goats and shows that these changes were associated with alterations in tlr expression. these findings provide new insight into understanding of host-microbial relationships in ruminants.

TI  == reshaping faecal gut microbiota composition by the intake of trans-resveratrol and quercetin in high-fat sucrose diet-fed rats.
AB  == diet-induced obesity is associated to an imbalance in the normal gut microbiota composition. resveratrol and quercetin, widely known for their health beneficial  properties, have low bioavailability, and when they reach the colon, they are targets of the gut microbial ecosystem. hence, the use of these molecules in obesity might be considered as a potential strategy to modulate intestinal bacterial composition. the purpose of this study was to determine whether trans-resveratrol and quercetin administration could counteract gut microbiota dysbiosis produced by high-fat sucrose diet (hfs) and, in turn, improve gut health. wistar rats were randomised into four groups fed an hfs diet supplemented or not with trans-resveratrol [15 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day], quercetin (30 mg/kg bw/day) or a combination of both polyphenols at those doses. administration of both polyphenols together prevented body weight gain and reduced serum insulin levels. moreover, individual supplementation of trans-resveratrol and quercetin effectively reduced serum insulin levels and insulin resistance. quercetin supplementation generated a great impact on gut microbiota composition at different taxonomic levels, attenuating firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratio and inhibiting the growth of bacterial species previously associated to diet-induced  obesity (erysipelotrichaceae, bacillus, eubacterium cylindroides). overall, the administration of quercetin was found to be effective in lessening hfs-diet-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis. in contrast, trans-resveratrol supplementation alone or in combination with quercetin scarcely modified the profile of gut bacteria but acted at the intestinal level, altering the mrna expression of tight-junction proteins and inflammation-associated genes.

TI  == effect of hypochlorous acid solution on the eradication and prevention of pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, serum biochemical variables, and cecum microbiota in rats.
AB  == in this study, hypochlorous acid solution, a weak acid, provided as drinking water to rats, was evaluated for its ability to eradicate and prevent pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, while monitoring its simultaneous effect on serum biochemical variables and microbiota in the rat cecum. the results suggest that the solution could not eliminate the bacteria in the experimentally infected rats; however, the administration of a 10-parts-per-million (ppm) hypochlorous acid solution as drinking water was effective in inhibiting horizontal spread of  p. aeruginosa infection among cage mates. additionally, exposure to hypochlorous  solution did not have any effect on serum biochemical variables of the rat including levels of total cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase (ast), alanine  aminotransferase (alt), alkaline phosphatase (alp), albumin, total bilirubin, lipase, amylase, urea nitrogen, total protein, calcium (ca), phosphorus (p), sodium (na), chlorine (cl), except for potassium (k) levels. the most frequently  isolated bacteria in the rat cecum included species belonging to bacteroidales, lactobacillus, clostridiales, erysipelotrichaceae, akkermansia, coriobacteriales, and firmicutes. the ratio of the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) peaks did not differ across rats administered with 5 and 10 ppm weak acid solution as compared to the control group for any of the bacteria,  except for erysipelotrichaceae and firmicutes, where the ratio of t-rflp peaks was higher in the 5 ppm group for erysipelotrichaceae and in the 10 ppm group for firmicutes than that in the control group (p<0.01). the results suggest that the  weak acid hypochlorous solution could not eradicate p. aeruginosa completely from rats. the solution was effective in preventing infection without affecting serum  biochemical variables; however, some of bacterial microbiota may have changed due to administration of the solution.

TI  == bacterial bile metabolising gene abundance in crohn's, ulcerative colitis and type 2 diabetes metagenomes.
AB  == we performed an analysis to determine the importance of bile acid modification genes in the gut microbiome of inflammatory bowel disease and type 2 diabetic patients. we used publicly available metagenomic datasets from the human microbiome project and the metahit consortium, and determined the abundance of bile salt hydrolase gene (bsh), 7 alpha-dehydroxylase gene (adh) and 7-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase gene (hsdh) in fecal bacteria in diseased populations of crohn's disease (cd), ulcerative colitis (uc) and type 2 diabetes  mellitus (t2dm). phylum level abundance analysis showed a significant reduction in firmicute-derived bsh in uc and t2dm patients but not in cd patients, relative to healthy controls. reduction of adh and hsdh genes was also seen in uc and t2dm patients, while an increase was observed in the cd population as compared to healthy controls. a further analysis of the bsh genes showed significant differences in the correlations of certain firmicutes families with disease or healthy populations. from this observation we proceeded to analyse bsh protein sequences and identified bsh proteins clusters representing the most abundant strains in our analysis of firmicute bsh genes. the abundance of the bsh genes corresponding to one of these protein clusters was significantly reduced in all disease states relative to healthy controls. this cluster includes bsh genes derived from lachospiraceae, clostridiaceae, erysipelotrichaceae and ruminococcaceae families. this metagenomic analysis provides evidence of the importance of bile acid modifying enzymes in health and disease. it further highlights the importance of identifying gene and protein clusters, as the same gene may be associated with health or disease, depending on the strains expressing the enzyme, and differences in the enzymes themselves.

TI  == catenisphaera adipataccumulans gen. nov., sp. nov., a member of the family erysipelotrichaceae isolated from an anaerobic digester.
AB  == an obligately anaerobic bacterium, designated strain gk12(t), was isolated from an anaerobic digester in fukagawa, hokkaido prefecture, japan. the cells of strain gk12(t) were non-motile, non-spore-forming cocci that commonly occurred in chains. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that strain gk12(t) was affiliated with the family erysipelotrichaceae in the phylum firmicutes and showed 91.8 % sequence similarity to the most closely related species, faecalicoccus acidiformans. the strain grew at 30-50 degrees c (optimally at 40 degrees c) and at ph 5.5-8.5 (optimally at ph 7.5). the main end product of glucose fermentation was lactate. yeast extract was required for growth. the strain contained c14 : 0, c14 : 0 1,1-dimethoxyalkane (dma), c16 : 0 dma and c18  : 0 dma as the major cellular fatty acids (>10 % of the total). the polar lipid profile was composed of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and an unidentified phospholipid. the whole-cell sugars were galactose, rhamnose and ribose. the cell-wall murein contained alanine, glutamic acid, lysine, serine and threonine, but not diaminopimelic acid. the g+c content of the genomic dna was 47.7 mol%. based on phenotypic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic properties, a novel genus and species, catenisphaera adipataccumulans gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate strain gk12(t) ( = nbrc 108915(t) = dsm 25799(t)).

TI  == specific microbiome changes in a mouse model of parenteral nutrition associated liver injury and intestinal inflammation.
AB  == background: parenteral nutrition (pn) has been a life-saving treatment in infants intolerant of enteral feedings. however, pn is associated with liver injury (pn associated liver injury: pnali) in a significant number of pn-dependent infants.  we have previously reported a novel pnali mouse model in which pn infusion combined with intestinal injury results in liver injury. in this model, lipopolysaccharide activation of toll-like receptor 4 signaling, soy oil-derived  plant sterols, and pro-inflammatory activation of kupffer cells (kcs) played key  roles. the objective of this study was to explore changes in the intestinal microbiome associated with pnali. methodology and principal findings: microbiome  analysis in the pnali mouse identified specific alterations within colonic microbiota associated with pnali and further association of these communities with the lipid composition of the pn solution. intestinal inflammation or soy oil-based pn infusion alone (in the absence of enteral feeds) caused shifts within the gut microbiota. however, the combination resulted in accumulation of a specific taxon, erysipelotrichaceae (23.8% vs. 1.7% in saline infused controls),  in pnali mice. moreover, pnali was markedly attenuated by enteral antibiotic treatment, which also was associated with significant reduction of erysipelotrichaceae (0.6%) and a gram-negative constituent, the s24-7 lineage of  bacteroidetes (53.5% in pnali vs. 0.8%). importantly, removal of soy oil based-lipid emulsion from the pn solution resulted in significant reduction of erysipelotrichaceae as well as attenuation of pnali. finally, addition of soy-derived plant sterol (stigmasterol) to fish oil-based pn restored erysipelotrichaceae abundance and pnali. conclusions: soy oil-derived plant sterols and the associated specific bacterial groups in the colonic microbiota are associated with pnali. products from these bacteria may directly trigger activation of kcs and promote pnali. furthermore, the results indicate that lipid modification of pn solutions may alter specific intestinal bacterial species associated with pnali, and thus suggest strategies for management of pnali.

TI  == evaluation of the impact of refrigeration on next generation sequencing-based assessment of the canine and feline fecal microbiota.
AB  == background: evaluation of factors that might impact microbiota assessment is important to avoid spurious results, particularly in field and multicenter studies where sample collection may occur distant from the laboratory. this study evaluated the impact of refrigeration on next generation sequence-based assessment of the canine and feline fecal microbiota. fecal samples were collected from seven dogs and ten cats, and analysed at baseline and after 3, 7,  10 and 14 days of storage at 4 degrees c. results: there were no differences in community membership or population structure between timepoints for either dogs or cats, nor were there any differences in richness, diversity and evenness. there were few differences in relative abundance of phyla or predominant genera,  with the only differences being significant increases in actinobacteria between days 0-14 (p = 0.0184) and 1-14 (p = 0.0182) for canine samples, and a decrease in erysipelotrichaceae incertae sedis between day 0 and day 7 (median 4.9 vs 2.2%, p = 0.046) in feline samples. conclusions: storage for at least 14 days at  4 degrees c has limited impact on culture-independent assessment of the canine and feline fecal microbiota, although changes in some individual groups may occur.

TI  == faecalicoccus acidiformans gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the chicken caecum, and reclassification of streptococcus pleomorphus (barnes et al. 1977), eubacterium biforme (eggerth 1935) and eubacterium cylindroides (cato et al. 1974) as faecalicoccus pleomorphus comb. nov., holdemanella biformis gen. nov., comb. nov. and faecalitalea cylindroides gen. nov., comb. nov., respectively, within the family erysipelotrichaceae.
AB  == strains lmg 27428(t) and lmg 27427 were isolated from the caecal content of a chicken and produced butyric, lactic and formic acids as major metabolic end products. the genomic dna g+c contents of strains lmg 27428(t) and lmg 27427 were 40.4 and 38.8 mol%. on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, both strains were most closely related to the generically misclassified streptococcus  pleomorphus atcc 29734(t). strain lmg 27428(t) could be distinguished from s. pleomorphus atcc 29734(t) based on production of more lactic acid and less formic acid in m2gsc medium, a higher dna g+c content and the absence of activities of acid phosphatase and leucine, arginine, leucyl glycine, pyroglutamic acid, glycine and histidine arylamidases, while strain lmg 27428 was biochemically indistinguishable from s. pleomorphus atcc 29734(t). the novel genus faecalicoccus gen. nov. within the family erysipelotrichaceae is proposed to accommodate strains lmg 27428(t) and lmg 27427. strain lmg 27428(t) ( =dsm 26963(t)) is the type strain of faecalicoccus acidiformans sp. nov., and strain lmg 27427 ( =dsm 26962) is a strain of faecalicoccus pleomorphus comb. nov. (type strain lmg 17756(t) =atcc 29734(t) =dsm 20574(t)). furthermore, the nearest phylogenetic neighbours of the genus faecalicoccus are the generically misclassified eubacterium cylindroides dsm 3983(t) (94.4% 16s rrna gene sequence  similarity to strain lmg 27428(t)) and eubacterium biforme dsm 3989(t) (92.7% 16s rrna gene sequence similarity to strain lmg 27428(t)). we present genotypic and phenotypic data that allow the differentiation of each of these taxa and propose  to reclassify these generically misnamed species of the genus eubacterium formally as faecalitalea cylindroides gen. nov., comb. nov. and holdemanella biformis gen. nov., comb. nov., respectively. the type strain of faecalitalea cylindroides is dsm 3983(t) =atcc 27803(t) =jcm 10261(t) and that of holdemanella biformis is dsm 3989(t) =atcc 27806(t) =ccug 28091(t).

TI  == analysis of the intestinal lumen microbiota in an animal model of colorectal cancer.
AB  == recent reports have suggested that multiple factors such as host genetics, environment and diet can promote the progression of healthy mucosa towards sporadic colorectal carcinoma. accumulating evidence has additionally associated  intestinal bacteria with disease initiation and progression. in order to examine  and analyze the composition of gut microbiota in the absence of confounding influences, we have established an animal model of 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh)-induced colon cancer. using this model, we have performed pyrosequencing of the v3 region of the 16s rrna genes in this study to determine the diversity and  breadth of the intestinal microbial species. our findings indicate that the microbial composition of the intestinal lumen differs significantly between control and tumor groups. the abundance of firmicutes was elevated whereas the abundance of bacteroidetes and spirochetes was reduced in the lumen of crc rats.  fusobacteria was not detected in any of the healthy rats and there was no significant difference in observed proteobacteria species when comparing the bacterial communities between our two groups. interestingly, the abundance of proteobacteria was higher in crc rats. at the genus level, bacteroides exhibited  a relatively higher abundance in crc rats compared to controls (14.92% vs. 9.22%, p<0.001). meanwhile, prevotella (55.22% vs. 26.19%), lactobacillus (3.71% vs. 2.32%) and treponema (3.04% vs. 2.43%), were found to be significantly more abundant in healthy rats than crc rats (p<0.001, respectively). we also demonstrate a significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria such as roseburia and eubacterium in the gut microbiota of crc rats. furthermore, a significant increase in desulfovibrio, erysipelotrichaceae and fusobacterium was  also observed in the tumor group. a decrease in probiotic species such as ruminococcus and lactobacillus was likewise observed in the tumor group. collectively, we can conclude that a significant difference in intestinal bacterial flora exists between healthy rats and crc rats.

TI  == an oleaginous bacterium that intrinsically accumulates long-chain free fatty acids in its cytoplasm.
AB  == medium- and long-chain fatty acids are present in organisms in esterified forms that serve as cell membrane constituents and storage compounds. a large number of organisms are known to accumulate lipophilic materials as a source of energy and  carbon. we found a bacterium, designated gk12, that intrinsically accumulates free fatty acids (ffas) as intracellular droplets without exhibiting cytotoxicity. gk12 is an obligatory anaerobic, mesophilic lactic acid bacterium that was isolated from a methanogenic reactor. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences showed that gk12 is affiliated with the family erysipelotrichaceae in the phylum firmicutes but is distantly related to type species in this family (less than 92% similarity in 16s rrna gene sequence). saturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths of 14, 16, 18, and 20 were produced from glucose under stress conditions, including higher-than-optimum temperatures and the presence of organic solvents that affect cell membrane integrity. ffas were produced at levels corresponding to up to 25% (wt/wt) of the dry cell mass. our data suggest that ffa accumulation is a result of an imbalance between excess membrane fatty acid biosynthesis due to homeoviscous adaptation and limited beta-oxidation activity due to anaerobic growth involving lactic acid fermentation. ffa droplets were not further utilized as an energy and carbon source, even under conditions of starvation. a naturally occurring bacterium that accumulates significant amounts of long-chain ffas with noncytotoxicity would provide useful strategies for microbial biodiesel production.

TI  == newly cultured bacteria with broad diversity isolated from eight-week continuous  culture enrichments of cow feces on complex polysaccharides.
AB  == one of the functions of the mammalian large intestinal microbiota is the fermentation of plant cell wall components. in ruminant animals, the majority of  their nutrients are obtained via pregastric fermentation; however, up to 20% can  be recovered from microbial fermentation in the large intestine. eight-week continuous culture enrichments of cattle feces with cellulose and xylan-pectin were used to isolate bacteria from this community. a total of 459 bacterial isolates were classified phylogenetically using 16s rrna gene sequencing. six phyla were represented: firmicutes (51.9%), bacteroidetes (30.9%), proteobacteria (11.1%), actinobacteria (3.5%), synergistetes (1.5%), and fusobacteria (1.1%). the majority of bacterial isolates had <98.5% identity to cultured bacteria with  sequences in the ribosomal database project and thus represent new species and/or genera. within the firmicutes isolates, most were classified in the families lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, erysipelotrichaceae, and clostridiaceae i. the  majority of the bacteroidetes were most closely related to bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. ovatus, and b. xylanisolvens and members of the porphyromonadaceae family. many of the firmicutes and bacteroidetes isolates were related to species demonstrated to possess enzymes which ferment plant cell wall  components; the others were hypothesized to cross-feed these bacteria. the microbial communities that arose in these enrichment cultures had broad bacterial diversity. with over 98% of the isolates not represented as previously cultured,  there are new opportunities to study the genomic and metabolic capacities of these members of the complex intestinal microbiota.

TI  == infection with the carcinogenic liver fluke opisthorchis viverrini modifies intestinal and biliary microbiome.
AB  == opisthorchis viverrini is a fish-borne trematode endemic in east asia. following  ingestion, the flukes locate to the biliary tre where chronic infection frequently leads to cholangiocarcinoma (cca). the mechanisms by which o. viverrini infection culminates in cca remain unknown. an unexplored aspect is its influence on the host microbiome. in the hamster, infection with this pathogen reliably leads to cca. genomic dnas of microbiota from colorectal contents and bile of hamsters and from whole o. viverrini were examined in this model of fluke-induced cca. microbial communities were characterized by high-throughput sequencing of variable regions 7-9 of prokaryotic 16s ribosomal dna. of approximately 1 million sequences, 536,009 with useable reads were assignable to  29,776 operational taxonomy units (otus) and, in turn, to 20 phyla and 273 genera of bacteria or archaea. microbial community analyses revealed that fluke infection perturbed the gastrointestinal tract microbiome, increasing lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, and lactobacillaceae, while decreasing porphyromonadaceae, erysipelotrichaceae, and eubacteriaceae (p</=0.05). more than 60 otus were detected in the biliary system, which confirmed bacteriobilia and a  noteworthy community of microbes associated with the parasites. the fluke-associated microorganisms included potential pathogens from the enterobacteriaceae and listeriaceae and others, including cyanobacteria and deinococci, usually found in external environments. given that opisthorchiasis is distinguished from other helminth infections by a robust inflammatory phenotype with conspicuously elevated il-6, and that inflammation of the biliary system leads to periductal fibrosis, which is a precursor of cca, the flukes and their microbiota may together drive this distinctive immune response.

TI  == culturomics identified 11 new bacterial species from a single anorexia nervosa stool sample.
AB  == the rebirth of bacterial culture has been highlighted successively by environmental microbiologists, the design of axenic culture for intracellular bacteria in clinical microbiology, and, more recently, by human gut microbiota studies. indeed, microbial culturomics (large scale of culture conditions with the identification of colonies by maldi-tof or 16s rrna) allowed to culture 32 new bacterial species from only four stool samples studied. we performed culturomics in comparison with pyrosequencing 16s rrna targeting the v6 region on an anorexia nervosa stool sample because this clinical condition has never been explored before by culture, while its composition has been observed to be atypical by metagenomics. we tested 88 culture conditions generating 12,700 different colonies identifying 133 bacterial species, with 19 bacterial species never isolated from the human gut before, including 11 new bacterial species for  which the genome has been sequenced. these 11 new bacterial species isolated from a single stool sample allow to extend more significantly the repertoire in comparison to the bacterial species validated by the rest of the world during the last 2 years. pyrosequencing indicated a dramatic discrepancy with the culturomics results, with only 23 otus assigned to the species level overlapping  (17 % of the culturomics results). most of the sequences assigned to bacteria detected only by pyrosequencing belonged to ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, and erysipelotrichaceae constituted by strictly anaerobic species, indicating the future route for culturomics. this study revealed new bacterial species participating significantly to the extension of the gut microbiota repertoire, which is the first step before being able to connect the bacterial composition with the geographic or clinical status.

TI  == gut microbiota composition modifies fecal metabolic profiles in mice.
AB  == the gut microbiome is known to be extensively involved in human health and disease. in order to reveal the metabolic relationship between host and microbiome, we monitored recovery of the gut microbiota composition and fecal profiles of mice after gentamicin and/or ceftriaxone treatments. this was performed by employing (1)h nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr)-based metabonomics and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) fingerprint of gut microbiota. the common features of fecal metabolites postantibiotic treatment include decreased levels of short chain fatty acids (scfas), amino acids and primary bile acids and increased oligosaccharides, d-pinitol, choline and secondary bile acids (deoxycholic acid). this suggests suppressed bacterial fermentation, protein degradation and enhanced gut microbial modification of bile acids. barnesiella, prevotella, and alistipes levels were shown to decrease as a result of the antibiotic treatment, whereas levels of bacteroides, enterococcus and erysipelotrichaceae incertae sedis, and mycoplasma increased after gentamicin and ceftriaxone treatment. in addition, there was a strong correlation between fecal  profiles and levels of bacteroides, barnesiella, alistipes and prevotella. the integration of metabonomics and gut microbiota profiling provides important information on the changes of gut microbiota and their impact on fecal profiles during the recovery after antibiotic treatment. the correlation between gut microbiota and fecal metabolites provides important information on the function of bacteria, which in turn could be important in optimizing therapeutic strategies, and developing potential microbiota-based disease preventions and therapeutic interventions.

TI  == the nonfermentable dietary fiber hydroxypropyl methylcellulose modulates intestinal microbiota.
AB  == diet influences host metabolism and intestinal microbiota; however, detailed understanding of this tripartite interaction is limited. to determine whether the nonfermentable fiber hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (hpmc) could alter the intestinal microbiota and whether such changes correlated with metabolic improvements, c57b/l6 mice were normalized to a high-fat diet (hfd), then either  maintained on hfd (control), or switched to hfd supplemented with 10% hpmc, or a  low-fat diet (lfd). compared to control treatment, both lfd and hpmc reduced weight gain (11.8 and 5.7 g, respectively), plasma cholesterol (23.1 and 19.6%),  and liver triglycerides (73.1 and 44.6%), and, as revealed by 454-pyrosequencing  of the microbial 16s rrna gene, decreased microbial alpha-diversity and differentially altered intestinal microbiota. both lfd and hpmc increased intestinal erysipelotrichaceae (7.3- and 12.4-fold) and decreased lachnospiraceae (2.0- and 2.7-fold), while only hpmc increased peptostreptococcaceae (3.4-fold) and decreased ruminococcaceae (2.7-fold). specific microorganisms were directly linked with weight change and metabolic parameters in hpmc and hfd mice, but not  in lfd mice, indicating that the intestinal microbiota may play differing roles during the two dietary modulations. this work indicates that hpmc is a potential  prebiotic fiber that influences intestinal microbiota and improves host metabolism.

TI  == diet-induced alterations of host cholesterol metabolism are likely to affect the  gut microbiota composition in hamsters.
AB  == the gastrointestinal microbiota affects the metabolism of the mammalian host and  has consequences for health. however, the complexity of gut microbial communities and host metabolic pathways make functional connections difficult to unravel, especially in terms of causation. in this study, we have characterized the fecal  microbiota of hamsters whose cholesterol metabolism was extensively modulated by  the dietary addition of plant sterol esters (pse). pse intake induced dramatic shifts in the fecal microbiota, reducing several bacterial taxa within the families coriobacteriaceae and erysipelotrichaceae. the abundance of these taxa displayed remarkably high correlations with host cholesterol metabolites. most importantly, the associations between several bacterial taxa with fecal and biliary cholesterol excretion showed an almost perfect fit to a sigmoidal nonlinear model of bacterial inhibition, suggesting that host cholesterol excretion can shape microbiota structure through the antibacterial action of cholesterol. in vitro experiments suggested a modest antibacterial effect of cholesterol, and especially of cholesteryl-linoleate, but not plant sterols when  included in model bile micelles. the findings obtained in this study are relevant to our understanding of gut microbiota-host lipid metabolism interactions, as they provide the first evidence for a role of cholesterol excreted with the bile  as a relevant host factor that modulates the gut microbiota. the findings further suggest that the connections between coriobacteriaceae and erysipelotrichaceae and host lipid metabolism, which have been observed in several studies, could be  caused by a metabolic phenotype of the host (cholesterol excretion) affecting the gut microbiota.

TI  == high-throughput sequence-based analysis of the intestinal microbiota of weanling  pigs fed genetically modified mon810 maize expressing bacillus thuringiensis cry1ab (bt maize) for 31 days.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate if feeding genetically modified (gm) mon810 maize expressing the bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal protein (bt  maize) had any effects on the porcine intestinal microbiota. eighteen pigs were weaned at ~28 days and, following a 6-day acclimatization period, were assigned to diets containing either gm (bt mon810) maize or non-gm isogenic parent line maize for 31 days (n = 9/treatment). effects on the porcine intestinal microbiota were assessed through culture-dependent and -independent approaches. fecal, cecal, and ileal counts of total anaerobes, enterobacteriaceae, and lactobacillus were not significantly different between pigs fed the isogenic or bt maize-based  diets. furthermore, high-throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed few differences in the compositions of the cecal microbiotas. the only differences were that pigs fed the bt maize diet had higher cecal abundance of enterococcaceae (0.06 versus 0%; p < 0.05), erysipelotrichaceae (1.28 versus 1.17%; p < 0.05), and bifidobacterium (0.04 versus 0%; p < 0.05) and lower abundance of blautia (0.23 versus 0.40%; p < 0.05) than pigs fed the isogenic maize diet. a lower enzyme-resistant starch content in the bt maize, which is most likely a result of normal variation and not due to the genetic modification, may account for some of the differences observed within the cecal microbiotas. these results indicate that bt maize is well tolerated by the porcine intestinal  microbiota and provide additional data for safety assessment of bt maize. furthermore, these data can potentially be extrapolated to humans, considering the suitability of pigs as a human model.

TI  == absence of intestinal microbiota does not protect mice from diet-induced obesity.
AB  == the gut microbiota has been implicated in host nutrient absorption and energy homeostasis. we studied the influence of different diets on body composition in germ-free (gf) and conventional (cv) mice. gf and cv male adult c3h mice were fed ad libitum a semi-synthetic low-fat diet (lfd; carbohydrate-protein-fat ratio: 41:42:17; 19.8 kj/g), a high-fat diet (hfd; 41:16:43; 21.4 kj/g) or a commercial  western diet (wd; 41:19:41; 21.5 kj/g). there was no difference in body weight gain between gf and cv mice on the lfd. on the hfd, gf mice gained more body weight and body fat than cv mice, and had lower energy expenditure. gf mice on the wd gained significantly less body fat than gf mice on the hfd. gf mice on both hfd and wd showed increased intestinal mrna expression of fasting-induced adipose factor/angiopoietin-like protein 4 (fiaf/angptl4), but they showed no major changes in circulating fiaf/angptl4 compared with cv mice. the faecal microbiota composition of the cv mice differed between diets: the proportion of firmicutes increased on both hfd and wd at the expense of the bacteroidetes. this increase in the firmicutes was mainly due to the proliferation of one family within this phylum: the erysipelotrichaceae. we conclude that the absence of gut  microbiota does not provide a general protection from diet-induced obesity, that  intestinal production of fiaf/angptl4 does not play a causal role in gut microbiota-mediated effects on fat storage and that diet composition affects gut  microbial composition to larger extent than previously thought.

AB  == based on 16s rrna gene sequence comparison, an isolate that was detected in sterile-filtered vegetable broth was classified as a novel member of the erysipelothrix line of descent of the firmicutes. strain mf-ep02t resembles members of the two species of erysipelothrix with validly published names, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and erysipelothrix tonsillarum, in morphology, fatty acid composition, lack of menaquinones in aerobically and anaerobically grown cultures, dna g+c content and peptidoglycan amino acid composition. distinct differences in physiological characteristics, however, support the allocation of  this isolate to a novel species of the genus erysipelothrix, for which the name erysipelothrix inopinata sp. nov. (type strain, mf-ep02t=dsm 15511t=cip 107935t)  is proposed. members of the erysipelothrix line of descent are included in the family erysipelotrichaceae fam. nov.
