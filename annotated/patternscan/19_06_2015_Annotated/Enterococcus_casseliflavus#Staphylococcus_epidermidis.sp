TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. in marine environments from the west coast of the usa.
AB  == aims: the aim of the study was to determine if vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. [vre] carrying vana and/or vanb genes were present in public marine beaches  and a fishing pier [2001-2003, 2008] from washington and california [2008]. methods: pcr assays for the vana and/or vanb genes with verification by dna-dna hybridization of the pcr products were used. positive isolates were speciated using the bd bbl crystal identification and/or by sequencing the 16s ribosomal region. results: eighteen (8%) of 227 isolates including enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum and a staphylococcus  epidermidis carrying vana and/or vanb genes, from four of six washington and one  of two california sites, were identified. selected vre and the s. epidermidis were able to transfer their van genes to an e. faecalis recipient at frequencies  ranging from 1.9 x 10(-6) to 6.7 x 10(-9). conclusions: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. was isolated from five of the seven sites suggesting that other north america public beaches could be the reservoirs for vre and should be assessed. significance & impact of the study: this is the first report of isolation and characterization of vre strains (and a vanb staphylococcus sp.) from north american environmental sources suggesting that public beaches may be a reservoir for possible transmission of vre to beach visitors.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == macrolide resistance genes in enterococcus spp.
AB  == seventy-eight isolates of different enterococcus species (e. faecalis, n = 27; e. faecium, n = 23; e. durans, n = 8; e. avium, n = 6; e. hirae, n = 9; e. gallinarum, n = 3; and e. casseliflavus, n = 2) with a variety of erythromycin resistance phenotypes were examined for the presence of macrolide resistance genes (erma, ermb, ermc, ermtr, mefa/e, and msra). positive pcr amplifications of ermb were obtained for 39 of 40 highly erythromycin-resistant enterococcus isolates (mics, >128 microg/ml) of different species; the remaining highly resistant e. faecium isolate was positive for pcr amplification of erma but was negative for pcr amplification of the ermb and ermc genes. for all enterococcal strains for which erythromycin mics were < or =32 microg/ml pcrs were negative for erm methylase genes. for all e. faecium isolates pcr amplified products of the expected size of 400 bp were obtained when msra primers were used, with the results being independent of the erythromycin resistance phenotype. all the other enterococcal species gave negative results by msra pcrs. sequencing of the msra pcr products from either erythromycin-susceptible, low-level-resistant, or highly resistant e. faecium strains showed that the amplicons did not correspond to the  msra gene described for staphylococcus epidermidis but corresponded to a new putative efflux determinant, which showed 62% identity with the msra gene at the  dna level and 72% similarity at the amino acid level. this new gene was named msrc.

TI  == semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from ly264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
