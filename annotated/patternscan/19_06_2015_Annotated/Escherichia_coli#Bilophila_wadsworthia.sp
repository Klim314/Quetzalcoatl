TI  == preparation and characterization of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against  lawsonia intracellularis.
AB  == proliferative enteropathy is an intestinal infectious disease caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium lawsonia intracellularis. immunohistochemistry staining has superior sensitivity over hematoxylin and eosin and silver staining  for detecting l. intracellularis in histological sections. a l. intracellularis-specific monoclonal antibody (mab) produced in the uk (ig4 mab) has been described in the literature. however, no monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies are commercially available. therefore, the objective of this study was to produce and characterize new polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against l. intracellularis that are suitable for diagnostic use. the new monoclonal (2001 mab) and polyclonal antibodies (1999 pab) were compared with the ig4 mab using western blot analysis of outer membrane proteins (omps) of 6 l. intracellularis isolates, bilophila wadsworthia and brachyspira hyodysenteriae and using immunohistochemistry of known positive and negative histologic samples and pure cultures of l. intracellularis, b. wadsworthia, b. hyodysenteriae, salmonella choleraesuis, s. typhimurium, and escherichia coli k88. immunogold staining using 2001 mab was performed to show the specificity of the antibody against an l. intracellularis surface protein. western blot analysis showed that the 2001 mab targeted an omp of 77 kd, which made it different from the ig4 mab that targeted  an 18-kd omp. the immunogold stain demonstrated the specificity of the 2001 mab to a surface protein of l. intracellularis. the polyclonal antibody (1999 pab) targeted 5 omps (77, 69, 54, 42, and 36 kd). both the 2001 mab and 1999 pab stained known positive, but not negative, histologic samples. both the 2001 mab and 1999 pab reacted with a pure culture of l. intracellularis but not with any other common enteric pathogens. these two new antibodies will be useful for immunodiagnosis of l. intracellularis.

TI  == genetic analysis of a rhodobacter capsulatus gene region involved in utilization  of taurine as a sulfur source.
AB  == rhodobacter capsulatus was shown to grow efficiently with taurine as sole source  of sulfur. we identified a gene region exhibiting similarity to the escherichia coli tauabc genes coding for a taurine-specific abc transporter. the r. capsulatus tauabc genes were flanked by two putative operons (orf459-484-590 and  cyse-srpi-nifs2) both reading in opposite direction relative to tauabc. orf459 shows strong similarity to taurine:pyruvate aminotransferase (tpa) from bilophila wadsworthia catalyzing the initial transamination during anaerobic taurine degradation, and orf590 exhibits clear similarity to sulfoacetaldehyde sulfo-lyase from desulfonispora thiosulfatigenes probably catalyzing the step following the taurine:pyruvate aminotransferase (tpa) reaction, whereas nifs2 might code for a putative cysteine desulfurase. expression of r. capsulatus tauabc and nifs2 was inhibited by sulfate, suggesting that tauabc and nifs2 might belong to the same regulon. in contrast, transcription of orf459 was not inhibited by sulfate but was induced by taurine. a tauab deletion mutant showed significantly reduced growth compared to the wild-type with taurine as sole sulfur source in the presence of serine as a nitrogen source, whereas normal growth was observed in the presence of taurine and ammonium. deletion of orf459-484-590 completely abolished growth with taurine/serine. single mutations  in any of the three genes resulted in the same phenotype, indicating that all three genes of this putative operon are essential for taurine sulfur utilization  in the presence of serine. a model for anaerobic taurine sulfur assimilation in r. capsulatus is discussed.

TI  == bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  == background: acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. however, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. objective: to determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. study design: tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. results: aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with  healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; p < 0.01). bacteria belonging to the bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were peptostreptococcus micros (66%), bilophila wadsworthia (63%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (44%), eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (41%). of the aerobes escherichia coli (88%) and streptococcus anginosus group (former streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. conclusions: the shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. the unusually high frequencies of b. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.

TI  == recovery of bilophila wadsworthiafrom clinical specimens in italy.
AB  == this report is the first survey in italy to evaluate the incidence of recovery of bilophila wadsworthia in clinical situations. the survey was carried out at the departments of microbiology in two northern italian hospitals over a one-year period. tests for b. wadsworthia were carried out on a range of specimens from different body sites, when etiology by anaerobes was suspected. out of a total of 350 samples examined, 67% were positive in bacteriological tests. mixed anaerobic infections were detected in 53 specimens, corresponding to 23% of all cases. strains of b. wadsworthia were isolated from 12 samples, equivalent to 5% and 22% of total and mixed/anaerobic infections, respectively. bilophila wadsworthia was  always isolated in mixed infections, mainly from the large intestine (67% of cases). the infectious process of b. wadsworthia was often complicated by abscess formation, regardless of body site. interestingly, a strain was isolated from one case of bacteremia. the microorganisms most frequently isolated with b. wadsworthia were escherichia coli for facultative species (38%), and bacteroides  fragilis, from anaerobic isolates (25%). production of beta-lactamases by b. wadsworthia isolates was found in ten strains (83%), which appeared to be penicillin g resistant at concentration equal to or greater than the break-point  (4 microg/ml). epidemiological and clinical data from this and previous studies point to the involvement of b. wadsworthia in mixed infections. to assess the specific contribution of the species to the disease, studies of pathogenetic factors are to be considered in parallel. nonetheless, production of beta-lactamases by most b. wadsworthia isolates could easily interfere with the therapeutical approach to infections involving the new species. the addition of a selective medium to culture specimens from the abdominal cavity should be considered in order to detect the presence of b. wadsworthia.

TI  == amplification of bacterial 16s ribosomal dna with polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the sequence of small-subunit rrna varies in an orderly manner across phylogenetic lines and contains segments that are conserved at the species, genus, or kingdom level. by directing oligonucleotide primers at sequences conserved throughout the eubacterial kingdom, we amplified bacterial 16s ribosomal dna sequences with the polymerase chain reaction. priming sites were located at the extreme 5' end, the extreme 3' end, and the center of 16s ribosomal dna. the isolates tested with these primers included members of the genera staphylococcus, coxiella, rickettsia, clostridium, neisseria, mycobacterium, bilophila, eubacterium, fusobacterium, and lactobacillus and the family enterobacteriaceae. initially, the yields from the reactions were erratic  because the primers were self-complementary at the 3' ends. revised primers that  were not self-complementary gave more reproducible results. with the latter primers, 0.4 pg of escherichia coli dna consistently gave a visible band after amplification. this method should be useful for increasing the amounts of bacterial 16s ribosomal dna sequences for the purposes of sequencing and probing. it should have a broad range of applications, including the detection and identification of known pathogens that are difficult to culture. this approach may make it possible to identify new, nonculturable bacterial pathogens.
