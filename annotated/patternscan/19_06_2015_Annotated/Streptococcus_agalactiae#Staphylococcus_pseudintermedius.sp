TI  == staphylococcus pseudintermedius for camp-test.
AB  == camp test reliably detects listeria monocytogenes (lm) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus, gbs); it is traditionally performed streaking  the tested isolate perpendicularly to staphylococcus aureus (sa), provided that reference sa strains (that produce beta-hemolysin) are used. in a zone of beta-hemolysin activity, in fact, gbs and lm form typical arrow-shaped hemolytic  areas. while sa production of the toxin is strain-dependent, however, that of staphylococcus pseudintermedius (sp), a pet-owner colonizer and an emerging human pathogen, is constitutive, then observed in all clinical isolates. therefore, sp  may indeed represent a valid alternative to perform the assay.
