TI  - Liquid based microbiological transport systems: conformity assessment of two commercial devices.
AB  - We compared two types of liquid-based microbiology devices for microorganism viability according to standardized quantitative elution method CLSI M40-A2. The eSwab(R) met CLSI acceptance criteria of viability maintenance for all microorganisms tested. The Sigma-Transwab(R) failed to meet CLSI acceptance criteria for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - The effect of blue light on periodontal biofilm growth in vitro.
AB  - We have previously shown that blue light eliminates the black-pigmented oral bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Prevotella melaninogenica. In the present study, the in vitro photosensitivity of the above black-pigmented microorganisms and four Fusobacteria species (Fusobacterium nucleatum ss. nucleatum, F. nucleatum ss. vincentii, F. nucleatum ss. polymorphum, Fusobacterium periodonticum) was investigated in pure cultures and human dental plaque suspensions. We also tested the hypothesis that phototargeting the above eight key periodontopathogens in plaque-derived biofilms in vitro would control growth within the dental biofilm environment. Cultures of the eight bacteria were exposed to blue light at 455 nm with power density of 80 mW/cm2 and energy fluence of 4.8 J/cm2. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of bacteria was performed to demonstrate the presence and amounts of porphyrin molecules within microorganisms. Suspensions of human dental plaque bacteria were also exposed once to blue light at 455 nm with power density of 50 mW/cm2 and energy fluence of 12 J/cm2. Microbial biofilms developed from the same plaque were exposed to 455 nm blue light at 50 mW/cm2 once daily for 4 min (12 J/cm2) over a period of 3 days (4 exposures) in order to investigate the cumulative action of phototherapy on the eight photosensitive pathogens as well as on biofilm growth. Bacterial growth was evaluated using the colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. The selective phototargeting of pathogens was studied using whole genomic probes in the checkerboard DNA-DNA format. In cultures, all eight species showed significant growth reduction (p < 0.05). HPLC demonstrated various porphyrin patterns and amounts of porphyrins in bacteria. Following phototherapy, the mean survival fractions were reduced by 28.5 and 48.2 % in plaque suspensions and biofilms, respectively, (p < 0.05). DNA probe analysis showed significant reduction in relative abundances of the eight bacteria as a group in plaque suspensions and biofilms. The cumulative blue light treatment suppressed biofilm growth in vitro. This may introduce a new avenue of prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.
TI  - Microbial profile of root canals of primary teeth with pulp necrosis and periradicular lesion.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the microbial content of root canals of human primary teeth with pulp necrosis and periradicular lesion. METHODS: Microbial samples were collected from 24 canals of children treated at a pediatric dentistry clinic. Microbiological identification was performed using checker-board DNA-DNA hybridization for 40 different bacteria. Data were analyzed per canal based on the mean count and frequency of each bacterial species. RESULTS: Detectable levels of bacterial species were observed for 35 probes (88%). The most frequent bacteria were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella nigrescens, and Prevotella intermedia. Facultative species were identified in 20 root canals (83%), anaerobic species were identified in 24 root canals (100%), and aerobic species in 18 root canals (75%). Black-pigmented bacilli were found in 23 samples (96%). The number of different bacterial species detected per canal ranged from five to 33. CONCLUSION: Endodontic infection in primary teeth with pulp necrosis and periradicular lesion is multimicrobial, including aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic micro-organisms.
TI  - Radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria at small or large radiographical lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. Routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. Lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). A risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. Overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). An increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at large abscess lesions was observed for Prevotella (P.) oralis, P. buccae, P. oris, P. intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus (Strep.) anginosus group. An increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for Strep. salivarius, Strep. parasanguis, Strep. anginosus group, Capnocytophaga spp., Neisseria (N.) sicca, Neisseria spp., Staphylococcus (Staph.) aureus, P. intermedia, P. buccae, Prevotella spp. and P. melaninogenica. CONCLUSIONS: The radiography-based score suggests that certain Prevotella spp., F. nucleatum and Strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, Neisseria spp., Capnocytophaga spp., Staph. aureus and Prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.
TI  - A chlorhexidine-loaded biodegradable cellulosic device for periodontal pockets treatment.
AB  - Absorbent points widely used in endodontic therapy were transformed into bioresorbable chlorhexidine delivery systems for the treatment of the periodontal pocket by preventing its recolonization by the subgingival microflora. These paper points (PPs) were first oxidized to promote their resorption, then grafted with beta-cyclodextrin (CD) or maltodextrin (MD) in order to achieve sustained delivery of chlorhexidine. We investigated the oxidation step parameters through the time of reaction and the nitric and phosphoric acid ratios in the oxidizing mixture, and then the dextrin grafting step parameters through the time and temperature of reaction. A first selection of the appropriate functionalization parameters was undertaken in relation to the degradation profile kinetics of the oxidized (PPO) and oxidized-grafted samples (PPO-CD and PPO-MD). Samples were then loaded with chlorhexidine digluconate (digCHX), a widely used antiseptic agent in periodontal therapy. The release kinetics of digCHX from PPO-CD and PPO-MD samples were compared to PP, PPO and to PerioChip((R)) (a commercial digCHX containing gelatine chip) in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The cytocompatibility of the oxidized-grafted PP was demonstrated by cell proliferation assays. Finally, the disc diffusion test from digCHX loaded PPO-MD samples immersed in human plasma was developed on pre-inoculated agar plates with four common periodontal pathogenic strains: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Aggregatibacter actinomycetem comitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. To conclude, the optimized oxidized-dextrin-grafted PPs responded to our initial specifications in terms of resorption and digCHX release rates and therefore could be adopted as a reliable complementary periodontal therapy.
TI  - Necrotizing periodontal diseases in HIV-infected Brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. METHOD AND MATERIALS: From a pool of 1,232 HIV-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. Subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. The presence and levels of 47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: All 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. Thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). Regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). The frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. Species detected in high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included Treponema denticola, Eikenella corrodens, Dialister pneumosintes, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus intermedius, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter rectus. In contrast, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium nodatum, and Helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. CONCLUSION: Necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in HIV-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular T denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as E faecalis and D pneumosintes. In addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and AIDS-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.
TI  - Experimental alveolitis in rats: microbiological, acute phase response and histometric characterization of delayed alveolar healing.
AB  - The pathogenesis of alveolitis is not well known and therefore experimental situations that mimic some features of this disease should be developed. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the evolution of the experimentally induced infection in rat sockets is characterized, which leads to clinical signs of suppurative alveolitis with remarkable wound healing disturbs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Non-infected (Group I) and experimentally infected sockets in Rattus novergicus (Group II) were histometrically evaluated regarding the kinetics of alveolar healing. In addition, the characterization of the present bacteria in inoculation material and the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were performed. The detected species were Capnocytophaga ochracea, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Streptococcus anginosus, Treponema socranskii and Streptococcus sanguis. RESULTS: All experimentally infected rats developed suppurative alveolitis, showing higher levels of CRP in comparison to those non-infected ones. Furthermore, infected rats presented a significant delayed wound healing as measured by the histometric analysis (higher persistent polymorphonuclear infiltrate and lower density of newly formed bone). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that rat sockets with experimentally induced infection produced higher levels of serum CRP, showing the potential of disseminated infection and a disturb in the alveolar repair process in an interesting experimental model for alveolitis studies.
TI  - Anaerobic Gram-Negative Bacilli
AB  - At present there are over two dozen genera of Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli. In most clinical infections, only the genera Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium need be considered. These genera are prevalent in the body as members of the normal flora (Fig.20-1), constituting one-third of the total anaerobic isolates from clinical specimens, and may become involved in infections throughout the body (Fig.20-2). Within the Bacteroides group, B fragilis is the most common pathogen, followed by B thetaiotaomicron and other members of the B fragilis group. Among the bile-sensitive Prevotella species, the ones most commonly encountered clinically are P melaninogenica, P oris, and P buccae. Porphyromonas species seem to be much less pathogenic except in dental infections. Fusobacterium nucleatum is the Fusobacterium species most often found as a pathogen, but F necrophorum occasionally produces serious disease. These genera contain numerous other species that rarely or never infect humans.
TI  - A 6-month study of the effects of 0.3% triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on dental implants.
AB  - AIM: Supportive therapy to maintain dental implants is increasingly important. This study examined the effect of a 0.3% triclosan/2% copolymer dentifrice on oral biofilms and gingival inflammation (GI) on dental implants and peri-implant tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty adults with a dental implant and contra-lateral tooth were enrolled in this 6 month, double-blind, two-treatment, parallel group study. Sixty subjects were randomly assigned to a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice test group and 60 subjects to a fluoride dentifrice control group and instructed to brush twice daily for 6 months. At baseline, 3, and 6 months, a calibrated dentist assessed dental plaque, GI and collected supragingival dental plaque for microbiological analysis. RESULTS: Subjects in the triclosan/copolymer group demonstrated significantly lower levels of dental plaque, gingivitis, and bleeding on probing at 3 and 6 months at both the implant and contra-lateral tooth compared with the fluoride group (p<0.05). There were significantly fewer Gram-negative anaerobes in the triclosan/copolymer group (p<0.05) including >90% reductions in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Solobacterium moorei, and Tannerella forsythia. CONCLUSIONS: Twice daily use of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice may enhance dental implant maintenance by reducing dental plaque and GI.
TI  - Methods for optimizing DNA extraction before quantifying oral bacterial numbers by real-time PCR.
AB  - Methods for the optimal extraction of genomic DNA for real-time PCR enumeration of oral bacteria using the muramidase, mutanolysin, were developed using a simple in vitro oral flora model comprised of the facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans, the gram-positive anaerobe, Parvimonas micra, and the gram-negative anaerobes, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Traditional, as well as more elaborate, methods of quantifying bacterial numbers, including colony counting and estimation of DNA content using 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole were compared in order to validate the real-time PCR approach. Evidence was obtained that P. gingivalis nuclease activity adversely affected the extraction of double-stranded DNA from this bacterium either alone or when it formed part of a consortium with the other bacteria. This nuclease activity could be overcome by treatment of the bacteria with either 20 mM diethyl pyrocarbonate or 70% ethanol at 4 degrees C overnight. A final purification of the DNA to remove any potential PCR inhibitors was added to the protocol in order to accurately quantify the amount of DNA by real-time PCR and hence the number of bacteria in a sample.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Tinidazole inhibitory and cidal activity against anaerobic periodontal pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tinidazole against anaerobic periodontal pathogens (25 Prevotella buccae, 18 Prevotella denticola, 10 Prevotella intermedia, 6 Prevotella melaninogenica, 5 Prevotella oralis, 10 Fusobacterium nucleatum and 8 Veillonella spp.) was determined by agar dilution. MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) were 8 microg/mL for Veillonella spp., 4 microg/mL for P. intermedia, 2 microg/mL for P. buccae, 1 microg/mL for Fusobacterium spp. and 0.5 microg/mL for other Prevotella spp. Cidal activity was studied by killing curves with tinidazole and amoxicillin (alone and in combination) at concentrations similar to those achieved in crevicular fluid (41.2 microg/mL tinidazole and 14.05 microg/mL amoxicillin) against an inoculum of ca. 10(7)colony-forming units/mL of four bacterial groups, each one composed of four different strains of the following periodontal isolates: Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Veillonella spp. (anaerobes) and one amoxicillin-susceptible Streptococcus spp. (facultative) in a proportion of 1:1:1:1. When only beta-lactamase-negative Prevotella or Fusobacterium strains were tested, significantly higher reductions were found with amoxicillin (>4 log reduction at 48 h) versus controls. The presence of beta-lactamase-positive Prevotella spp. or F. nucleatum strains rendered amoxicillin inactive (no reductions at 48 h), with no differences from controls. Amoxicillin+tinidazole produced >3 log reduction at 24h and >4 log reduction at 48 h regardless of the presence or not of beta-lactamase-positive strains. The presence in crevicular fluid of beta-lactamases produced by beta-lactamase-positive periodontal pathogens may have ecological and therapeutic consequences since it may protect beta-lactamase-negative periodontal pathogens from amoxicillin treatment. In vitro, tinidazole offered high antianaerobic activity against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative periodontal pathogens, avoiding amoxicillin inactivation.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - Periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type I: report of three cases within a family.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dentin dysplasia type I (DDI) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. It is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (PAL). In this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of DDI but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. METHODS: A 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of DDI. Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded. Subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: The mother presented 34.9% of sites with PD > or =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with CAL > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with BOP; both daughters presented no sites with PD or CAL >3 mm and <10% of sites with BOP. Microbiologic analysis detected Gemella morbillorum, Neisseria mucosa, and Staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. The daughters showed high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (Porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (Fusobacterium periodonticum and F. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (Streptococcus gordonii) and purple (Veillonella parvula) complexes. The mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (N. mucosa, Prevotella melaninogenica, Treponema denticola, and V. parvula). CONCLUSION: A combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid PAL and to provide oral health in patients with DDI.
TI  - [Anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli involved in the etiopathogeny of the abscesses of superficial fascial spaces of the face and neck].
AB  - The aim of this study was to isolate and identify at species level the strains of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) from pus samples collected in patients with abscesses of fascial spaces of the face and neck. Microscopy of Gram-stained smears and cultures were performed in each specimen. The strictly anaerobic GNB strains were identified using the conventional methods of diagnosis and the Rapid ID 32 A system. In addition, the other strains isolated in association with these bacteria were identified at least to genus level. The 28 anaerobic GNB isolates belonged to: Fusobacterium nucleatum and different species of Prevotella (4 species) and Bacteroides (3 species). CONCLUSIONS: The anaerobic GBN strains were recovered--either alone or in association with other migroorganisms--in more than half of all investigated samples and represented about 40% of all isolates. The most frequently isolated species were P> melaninogenica and B. ureolyticus.
TI  - PCR-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using PCR method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. The presence of selected pathogens (Actinomyces israelii, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus intermedius, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra, Tannerella forsythensis, Enterococcus faecium, Prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using PCR. RESULTS: T. denticola (P = .012, .02) and E. faecalis (P = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while P. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (P = .01, .015). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.
TI  - The lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, SLPI- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDH).
AB  - In the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. Also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (CDH) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (Bacteroides ureolyticus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners, Staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus agalactiae). The bacterial species found by either culture or CDH were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. Grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (BV) as based on Gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable counts of lactobacilli (L. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. In BV, particularly the high concentrations of Actinomyces urogenitalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Peptoniphilus harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). The total viable counts correlated with both cervical IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. A strong negative correlation was observed between L. iners and total viable counts, G. vaginalis, or cervical IL-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with SLPI. Analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by CDH showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by CDH compared to culture. By this method, A. vaginae correlated with G. vaginalis, and L. iners with S. aureus. With regard to cytokines, B. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal IL-1 alpha as well as with cervical IL-8, while F. nucleatum, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus, or S. aureus correlated with vaginal IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, all Gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by CDH, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal SLPI. The significance of the results is discussed. In summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. CDH appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. METHODS: Samples were collected from the root canals using #15 Hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization techniques. RESULTS: The mean number of species per sample was 22. Enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), Campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), Leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), Neisseria mucosa (87.5%), Prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), Eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), Streptococcus anginosus (75%), and Veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. The species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), E. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), E. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), N. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), V. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), C. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), Treponema socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), Micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), Prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). Most of these species were also found in high proportions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.
TI  - Role of anaerobes in acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - Pouch of Douglas aspirates were collected from 50 women with history and examination suggestive of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and 20 healthy women admitted for tubal ligation served as control. A total of 57 microorganisms were isolated from 37 patients out of 50 in study group. Of 37 positive cultures 21(56.7%) were monomicrobial and 16(43.2%) were polymicrobial. Most common symptom in study group was lower abdominal pain (90%), vaginal discharge (70%) and irregular bleeding (40%) and 30% patients had history of intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) implantation. The predominant aerobic isolates were Escherichia coli, Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CONS), Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae while common anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus spp. Our study shows that cefotaxime, cefuroxime and gentamicin may be used for gram negative aerobic bacilli; cloxacillin, cephaloridine and erythromycin for aerobic gram positive cocci and amikacin and ceftazidime for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus for optimum therapy of acute PID it is beneficial to keep in mind major conceptual changes and therapeutic realities that have influenced current understanding of acute PID and have affected the choice of therapy.
TI  - Odontogenic bacteria in periodontal disease and resistance patterns to common antibiotics used as treatment and prophylaxis in odontology in Spain.
AB  - Resistance in streptococci or Gram-negative bacteria is associated with antibiotic consumption. Scarce information exists on the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with periodontitis in countries with high antibiotic consumption, as this is an area in which microbiological testing is not performed in daily practice. The present study was undertaken to explore the susceptibility of bacterial isolates in periodontitis to antibiotics prescribed in odontology in Spain as treatment for local infections or prophylaxis for distant focal infections. Periodontal samples were prospectively collected in 48 patients classified by pocket depth of <4 mm and >or=4 mm. Species were identified by culture, selecting the five most frequent morphotypes per sample, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Susceptibility was determined by E-test. A total of 261 isolates were identified: 72.9% patients had Streptococcus oralis; 70.8% Streptococcus mitis; 60.4% Prevotella buccae; 39.6% Prevotella denticola; 37.5% Fusobacterium nucleatum; 35.4% Prevotella intermedia; 25% Capnocytophaga spp.; 23% Veillonella spp.; 22.9% Prevotella melaninogenica and Streptococcus sanguis; and <20% other species. Streptococcus viridans resistance rates were 0% for amoxicillin, approximately 10% for clindamycin, 9-22% for tetracycline, and for azithromycin ranged from 18.2% for S. sanguis to 47.7% for S. mitis. Prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, with amoxicillin resistance ranging from 17.1% in P. buccae to 26.3% in P. denticola. Metronidazole resistance was <6% in all Prevotella species, while clindamycin resistance ranged from 0 to 21.1%. beta-Lactamase production was positive in 54.1% Prevotella spp., 38.9% F. nucleatum, 30% Capnocytophaga spp., and 10% Veillonella spp. In this study, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the most active antibiotic against all species tested, followed by metronidazole in the case of anaerobes.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  - Propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in Turkey and from Brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of EEP on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. All strains were susceptible and MIC values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. Propolis from Kazan-Ankara showed most effective MIC values to the studied microorganisms. MBC values of Kazan-Ankara EEP samples were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. Death was observed within 4 h of incubation for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for Prevotella oralis and Prevotella melaninogenica and Porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for Veillonella parvula. It was shown that propolis samples were more effective against Gram positive anaerobic bacteria than Gram negative ones. The organic chemical compositions of EEPs were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The main compounds of EEPs were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. Because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.
TI  - An in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. The agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. In this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic Gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. The time-kill experiment was performed using Anaerobe Broth medium. The drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/L for linezolid, 2mg/L for clindamycin, and 8mg/L for metronidazole. Samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the Bioscience International Autospiral DW. Exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. Plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees C). The species tested included Bacteroides fragilis (2), B. distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron, Fusobacterium nucleatum, F. varium, Prevotella melaninogenica, Clostridium perfringens, Eubacterium lentum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). The activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. As expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. Metronidazole yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three strains. Linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. The profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.
TI  - The microbiological origin of fluorescence observed in plaque on dentures during  QLF analysis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the microbiological origin of plaque fluorescence observed during quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) analysis. Plaque was sampled from dentures, because of easy accessibility and the homogeneous background provided by the denture tooth during imaging, and the acknowledged comparability to occlusal plaque. Forty removable poly(methyl methacrylate) dentures were screened for the presence of fluorescent plaque deposits during QLF analysis. Dentures were photographed, QLF images were recorded and samples of fluorescent plaque were taken. Plaque samples were cultured on fastidious anaerobe agar, Wilkins Chalgren agar and Sabourauds dextrose agar. Plates were screened under QLF and fluorescent colonies were subcultured and identified. Areas of red, orange and green fluorescence were detected on the fitting and non-fitting surfaces of dentures. The red and orange fluorescing species were Prevotella melaninogenica, Actinomyces israelii and Candida albicans, which are generally acknowledged to be secondary colonisers, present in more mature plaque. Green fluorescence was observed in streptococcal species (early colonisers) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (important organism in plaque development). Non-fluorescent colonies were also cultured. Plaque which accumulates on susceptible surfaces tends to be associated with caries, but it may be its maturity, rather than the presence of cariogenic streptococci, that is more likely to provide a microbiological link between red fluorescence and caries.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of aqueous extracts of selected chewing sticks.
AB  - This aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity in extracts obtained from various Nigerian chewing sticks. Aqueous extracts from seventeen chewing sticks and the fruit of C. ferruginea, one fruit used in oral hygiene in Nigeria, were screened for antibacterial activity against type cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eleven of the test extracts showed activity against at least two of these referenced organisms. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of these eleven extracts against clinical isolates from orofacial infection were determined. All the extracts demonstrated activity against Staphylococcal and Streptococcal isolates. Over half of the extracts were active against Enterobacteriaceae and obligate anaerobic isolates, including Prevotella melaninogenica, Porphyromonas gigivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus prevotii. Extracts of the Vitellaria paradoxa root, Bridellia ferruginea stem and twigs, Garcinia cola stem, Terminalia glaucescens root, Morinda lucida root, and Cnestis ferruginea fruit showed appreciable activity against all classes of bacterial isolates. The extracts of these plants may serve as sources for chemotherapeutic agents for the management of orofacial infections.
TI  - Development and characterization of a simple perfused oral microcosm.
AB  - AIMS: To validate perfused, inline, filter-based fermentation systems (multiple Sorbarod devices, MSD) for their ability to maintain stable oral bacterial communities. MSD enable replicate (n=5) microcosm biofilms (BF) to be established and sampled, together with their perfusates (PA, cells in eluted medium). METHODS AND RESULTS: Fresh saliva from human volunteers was used to inoculate MSD, incubated in an anaerobic cabinet and perfused with artificial saliva at 7 ml h(-1). BF within Sorbarod filters and cells eluted in the PA were analysed at 24-h intervals by differential bacteriological culture and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CKB, 40 oral species). Dynamic stability was apparent after 2-3 days within both BF and PA as evidenced by culture, CKB data and pH measurements. BF harboured large numbers of anaerobic species and facultative anaerobes [ca 10-11 log10 colony-forming units (CFU)/filter] comprising considerable numbers of streptococci and Gram-negative species. PA contained ca 9-10 log(10) CFU ml(-1) suggesting an apparent mean growth rate of 0.1 h(-1) for the BF, as a whole corresponding to a mean generation time of 10 h. CKB analysis revealed considerable bacterial diversity within the respective MSD. Inter-individual variations in the relative species abundance of inocula was broadly reproduced in the MSD (BF and PA), although considerable variation was apparent between triplicate models established using saliva from one saliva donor or from three individual donors. The dominance of Gram-negative species, indicated by culture was supported by CKB analysis (major species, Prevotella melaninogenica and Fusobacterium nucleatum). CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained from the various analytical approaches showed a high degree of congruence. The MSD enables the maintenance of complex, stable salivary microcosms and represents a simple, reproducible tool for modelling individual oral bacterial ecosystems. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrates the utility of the MSD for studying the micro-ecology of the oral cavity.
TI  - Comparison of systemic flurithromycin therapy and clinical procedures in the treatment of periodontal diseases.
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate, in 20 periodontal patients, the microbial and clinical effects of flurithromycin therapy plus scaling and root planning (SRP) in comparison with SRP alone. Clinical assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing and pocket depth were made prior to SRP alone and SRP plus flurithromycin therapy (375 mg twice daily for 5 days) and after both treatments. Subgingival plaque samples (n. 180) were taken prior to and after both treatments and analyzed by conventional bacteriological procedures. Differences in pocket depth and prevalence of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapies using statistical analyses. A significant decrease (p<0.001) was seen for pocket depth post SRP alone and post SRP plus flurithromycin. After two treatments, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus and Prevotella melaninogenica were eradicated from all tested sites. If we compare the prevalence of the species isolated after SRP alone and after SRP plus flurithromycin statistically significant differences were detected for P. gingivalis and for Fusobacterium nucleatum (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). Flurithromycin can be considered a useful adjunct to mechanical periodontal treatment since it is more efficient in eliminating periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Clinical presentation and bacteriologic analysis of infected human bites in patients presenting to emergency departments.
AB  - Previous studies of infected human bites have been limited by small numbers of patients and suboptimal microbiologic methodology. We conducted a multicenter prospective study of 50 patients with infected human bites. Seventy percent of the patients and assailants were young adult men. Fifty-six percent of injuries were clenched-fist injuries and 44% were occlusional bites. Most injuries were to the hands. Fifty-four percent of patients were hospitalized. The median number of isolates per wound culture was 4 (3 aerobes and 1 anaerobe); aerobes and anaerobes were isolated from 54% of wounds, aerobes alone were isolated from 44%, and anaerobes alone were isolated from 2%. Isolates included Streptococcus anginosus (52%), Staphylococcus aureus (30%), Eikenella corrodens (30%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (32%), and Prevotella melaninogenica (22%). Candida species were found in 8%. Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Candida species were isolated more frequently from occlusional bites than from clenched-fist injuries. Many strains of Prevotella and S. aureus were beta-lactamase producers. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and moxifloxacin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against common isolates.
TI  - Distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". Saliva was taken by expectoration. Forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. Samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The percentage of total DNA probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. The significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the Quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. Cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. The proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and ANOVA. RESULTS: Microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects, with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. Proportions of Veillonella parvula and Prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. Cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. Cluster 1 comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while Cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. V. parvula, P. melaninogenica, Eikenella corrodens, Neisseria mucosa, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Fusobacterium periodonticum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii and Porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in Cluster 1 and S. mitis, S. oralis and S. noxia were significantly higher in Cluster 2. These findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. The microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the Actinomyces species. Species of different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus Streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. S. oralis, S. mitis and S. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. CONCLUSIONS: Proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. The microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. The microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.
TI  - [Early diagnosis of bacterial brain abscesses: interest of diffusion-weighted MRI].
AB  - Three cases of bacterial brain abscesses, in immunocompetent patients, are reported. In all these cases, the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MRI) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map has permitted an early diagnosis and a rapid treatment. This emergency MRI showed in the three cases a low signal on TI-weighted images, a high signal on T2-weighted and echo-planar images, and a decrease of ADC (0.36- 0.49 x 10(-3) mm2/s). So, this new MRI technique provides an available and rapid element in the brain abscess diagnosis which often remains a complex clinical and radiological diagnosis.
TI  - Bactericidal activities of methoxyfluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin  against aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens in serum.
AB  - Gatifloxacin (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and moxifloxacin (Bayer) are new methoxyfluoroquinolones with broad-spectrum activity against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens of the respiratory tract. In this investigation, we analyzed the bactericidal activity in serum over time of these antimicrobials against three aerobic (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four anaerobic (Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella melaninogenica) bacteria associated with respiratory tract infections. Serum samples were obtained from 11 healthy male subjects following a single 400-mg oral dose of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. These samples were collected prior to and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after the dose of each drug. Gatifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 12 h against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus micros (MIC = 0.25 micro g/ml), and F. nucleatum (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml) and 24 h against H. influenzae (MIC = 0.03 micro g/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), and Prevotella melaninogenica (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml). Moxifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 24 h against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), H. influenzae (MIC = 0.015 micro g/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 0.06 micro g/ml), F. nucleatum (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml), Prevotella melaninogenica (MIC =0.5 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), and Peptostreptococcus micros (MIC = 0.25 micro g/ml). The results from this pharmacodynamic study suggest that these fluoroquinolones would have prolonged killing activity against these organisms in vivo and may have clinical utility in the treatment of mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Faropenem, a new oral penem: antibacterial activity against selected anaerobic and fastidious periodontal isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of faropenem, an oral penem, was compared with those of penicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefoxitin, clindamycin, erythromycin and metronidazole against 106 isolates of anaerobic pathogens involved in systemic infections. The organisms tested comprised Porphyromonas gingivalis (29), Prevotella spp. (eight), Prevotella melaninogenica (seven), Prevotella intermedia (five), Actinomyces spp. (25), Fusobacterium nucleatum (14), Peptostreptococcus spp. (11), Bacteroides ureolyticus (five) and Bacteroides forsythus (two). The antimicrobial properties of faropenem were investigated by studying MICs, MBCs, time-kill kinetics and post-antibiotic effect (PAE). Faropenem was highly active against all the anaerobes tested (MIC(90) < or = 0.5 mg/L) and was bactericidal against both beta-lactamase-positive and -negative anaerobes, with a maximum bactericidal effect at 10 x MIC at between 12 and 24 h. In addition, faropenem had an in vitro PAE on all the tested isolates and this was not influenced by beta-lactamase production. Faropenem may be useful for treating infections caused by periodontal bacteria or oral flora.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from a glossal abscess in an adolescent.
AB  - Glossal abscess is infrequent in children. Anaerobic bacteria are rarely recovered from this infection and never have been reported in children or adolescents. A 15-year-old patient presented with a tongue abscess following trauma. Aspirate of the abscess yielded polymicrobial anaerobic flora: Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus micros. The patient recovered following incision and drainage and 14 days of antimicrobial therapy with clindamycin. This report illustrates the recovery of anaerobic bacteria from glossal abscess in an adolescent.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Evaluation of the Rapid ID 32A system for identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Rapid ID 32A system (bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) for the identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group. METHODS: Five hundred and twenty-eight identified clinical isolates of non-B. fragilis group anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli were tested in the Rapid ID 32A system, and identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The Rapid ID 32A system correctly identified 280 (60.9%) of the 460 isolates tested for which taxa were included in the database, without the need for additional testing. A further 97 (21.1%) isolates were correctly identified to species level following the performance of complementary tests recommended by the manufacturer. Fifty-nine (12.8%) isolates were identified at the genus level only, and 21 (4.6%) were misidentified at the species level. Three isolates of Prevotella were not identified by the system. Of the 68 isolates belonging to taxa not included in the database, no identification was obtained for 33 (48.5%), while 35 (51.5%) were misidentified. CONCLUSIONS: The Rapid ID 32A system provided a rapid and reliable method for the identification of non-B. fragilis group, anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli to the genus level, while the success of species-level identification varied with different taxa. There was poor discrimination between Fusobacterium nucleatum and F. necrophorum, between Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Porphyromonas endodontalis, and between Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella oralis. The need to perform conventional complementary tests on 149 (32.4%) of the 460 isolates compromised the usefulness of the system for rapid species identification.
TI  - [Anaerobic infection and its rapid detection in surgical patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate anaerobic infection and its rapid detection in surgical patients. METHODS: 372 specimens were collected from surgical patients for anaerobe detection. To find a rapid detectable method, 110 specimens were collected for comparative studies by using indirect immunofluorescent antibody technique (IFA), enzyme labeled antibody technique (ELAT) and general cultural method (CM). RESULTS: The isolation rate of anaerobes was rather high in pyothorax (88.9%), abdominal abscess (86.7%), appendicitis (83.9%) and cerebral abscess (all five cases were positive). In burn wounds, the rate was about 23.6% especially in deep burn wounds. Among 212 strains detected, the predominant anaerobes were as follows B. melaninogenicus (28.8%), B. fragilis (25%), F. nucleatum (7.5%), C. perfringens (7.5%), and peptostreptococcus (5.7%); most of them (87.8%) were non-sporing anaerobes. Mixed infection with aerobes accounted for 64%. The survey of rapid detection was conducted in B. fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, C. perfringens, F. nucleatum and peptostreptococcus. The detectable rate was higher in IFA (79.1%) and ELAT (80.9%) than in CM (37.3%). CONCLUSION: IFA and ELAT might be rapid, specific, sensitive, and simple for detecting anaerobes.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Differences in the composition of the subgingival microbiota of two periodontitis populations of different geographical origin. A comparison between Spain and The Netherlands.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the subgingival microbiota of two geographically distinct patient populations using identical clinical and bacteriological methods. Adult patients with a diagnosis of periodontitis were consecutively selected according to pre-defined clinical criteria. Microbiological samples were taken from the deepest four sites with bleeding. The samples were plated on blood agar plates, for the determination of the total anaerobic counts and identification of specific bacterial pathogens, and on TSBV and McConkey for isolation of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and enteric rods, respectively. Thirty-one patients in Spain and 30 patients in The Netherlands were selected. Both patient groups showed similar clinical characteristics, both in terms of age, gender and periodontal clinical variables. A. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more prevalent (23.3% vs. 3.2%) in the Dutch group, while Porphyromonas gingivalis was significantly more prevalent (64.5% vs. 36.7%) in the Spanish group. Bacteroides forsythus and most commensal periodontal pathogens showed similar prevalences, except Peptostreptococcus micros that was significantly more frequent in the Dutch group (96.7% vs. 74.2%). In summary, the subgingival microbiota from the Spanish group was characterised by a high prevalence of P. gingivalis and low of A. actinomycetemcomitans, while the flora from the Dutch group was characterised by a high prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. micros.
TI  - "Checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum IgG responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. METHODS: One hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). Smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject; 2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic DNA probes. Serum IgG antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. RESULTS: Cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. Corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. Heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). Higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Eubacterium nodatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella parvula, and Actinomyces naeslundii in controls. Cases displayed higher IgG levels against P. gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against F. nucleatum, T. denticola, E. nodatum, and Capnocytophaga ochracea. Positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. In cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species out of which only one was positive (V. parvula). Both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. A logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. Smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. CONCLUSION: A combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.
TI  - Features of severe periodontal disease in a teenager with Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chediak-Higashi syndrome (C-HS) is a rare congenital disease characterized by defective neutrophil function with abnormal lysosomal inclusions, neutropenia, and reduced chemotaxis. The complete syndrome includes oculocutaneous albinism with photophobia, neurologic features, recurrent infections, and enterocolitis. METHODS: A 14-year-old male C-HS patient was referred to us because of serious periodontal destruction with acute inflamed gingiva and ulcers. Clinical and biological investigations were performed, leading to the diagnosis of C-HS. RESULTS: Laboratory findings included neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. Peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. Bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. These granules and inclusions were characteristic of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. Bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque samples, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sp. Biopsies of periodontal tissues for light and electronic microscopic examinations revealed massive bacterial invasion of the epithelial tissue, epithelial cells, and connective tissue. Ultrastructural observations of periodontal polymorphonuclear leukocytes showed defective granulation, with abnormal granules not discharging their lysosomal content against engulfed bacteria. Viable dividing bacteria were found in the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: In this case, early-onset periodontitis seems to be the expression of C-HS granulocyte deficiency. Periodontal treatment of these patients is often unsuccessful. This case report illustrates the importance of the dentist in initiating clinical and biological investigations in such early aggressive periodontitis in young patients.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - Establishment of oral anaerobes during the first year of life.
AB  - Anaerobic species constitute a significant part of the bacterial community of the mouth. Although the time and species involved in the primary colonization of infants are of great importance by forming the basis for further colonization, the development of the oral anaerobic microflora with age is still inadequately understood. In the present study, time and succession of colonization of oral anaerobes were longitudinally examined in 44 healthy Caucasian infants at 2, 6, and 12 months of age. Unstimulated saliva samples were quantitatively cultured on non-selective Brucella blood agar and several selective media for the isolation of anaerobic micro-organisms. The most frequent anaerobic finding in two-month-old infants was Veillonella spp. The Prevotella melaninogenica group also represented early colonizing species, and the frequency increased remarkably during the first year of life, whereas the Prevotella intermedia group organisms seemed to be late colonizers. Fusobacterium nucleatum, non-pigmented Prevotella spp., and Porphyromonas catoniae were occasional findings in subjects at 2 months but frequent findings in those at one year of age. F. nucleatum was the most frequent strictly anaerobic species in one-year-old infants; other fusobacteria were also occasionally found. The frequency of facultative/micro-aerophilic corroding rods and Capnocytophaga spp. started to increase toward the end of the first year. Except for the common presence of facultative/micro-aerophilic Actinomyces spp., other anaerobic gram-positive species were only occasionally present in these infants. Once established, early-colonizing species tended to persist in the mouth. Our longitudinal study demonstrated the establishment of several anaerobic species with steadily increasing frequencies during the first year of life.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  - Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) CFU/spot. Comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (DU-6859a), penicillin G, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for Bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for Bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for Bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for Bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for Bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for Clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for Clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for Clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for Clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for Fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for Fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for Fusobacterium varium (13), 0.5 and 1; for Fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for Peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for Peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for Prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for Prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for Prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for Prevotella melaninogenica (11), 1 and 1. Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were equivalent against clostridia and P. asaccharolytica. Gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (DU 6859a) against peptostreptococci, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria. Sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.
TI  - Beta-lactamase production by oral anaerobic gram-negative species in infants in relation to previous antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - The frequency of beta-lactamase production in gram-negative bacteria has increased considerably during recent years. In this study, beta-lactamase production by oral anaerobic gram-negative rods isolated from saliva was longitudinally examined for 44 Caucasian infants at the ages of 2, 6, and 12 months in relation to their documented exposure to antibiotics. Isolates showing decreased susceptibility to penicillin G (1 microg/ml) were examined for beta-lactamase production by using a chromogenic cephalosporin disk test. beta-Lactamase-positive, gram-negative anaerobic species were found in 11, 55, and 89% of each age group, respectively. beta-Lactamase production was most frequent among organisms of the Prevotella melaninogenica group. At 12 months, 73% of the infants harbored beta-lactamase-producing members of the P. melaninogenica group, 55% had nonpigmented Prevotella species, 25% had Porphyromonas catoniae, 23% had Fusobacterium nucleatum, and 5% had Capnocytophaga species. Several beta-lactamase-producing species could be simultaneously found in the infants' mouths. The presence of beta-lactamase-producing species was significantly associated with the infants' exposure to antibiotics through antimicrobial treatments given to the infants and/or their mothers.
TI  - Relationship of the subgingival microbiota to a chairside test for aspartate aminotransferase in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between  the occurrence of certain specific periodontal pathogens and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF). METHODS: Thirty systemically healthy subjects with moderate to advanced periodontitis were selected. Within each subject, the AST contents of GCF from sites with probing depth between 5 mm and 7 mm were measured using a chairside colorimetric test. AST-positive site refers to one that had an AST level > or = 800 microIU. Subgingival plaque samples from one AST-positive and one negative site were collected for microbiological examination. One site with probing depth < or = 3 mm and no gingival inflammation was selected as a healthy control. Clinical parameters of the chosen sites, including the plaque index and gingival index scores, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were measured. Culture and immunofluorescence (IF) were used for detecting common periodontal pathogens, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga species, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between the AST test and certain specific pathogens. RESULTS: The GCF scores and total cultivable bacterial counts were higher in AST-positive sites than either AST-negative or healthy sites. The prevalence and proportions of specific periodontal pathogens such as C rectus, E. corrodens, F. nucleatum, Capnocytophaga species, P. intermedia, and P. gingivalis were significantly higher in positive than in negative sites. In analyzing the correlation of the proportion of 6 pathogens with the AST test by logistic regression, only P. gingivalis showed a significant positive correlation. The odds ratio of having a high proportion of P. gingivalis in the presence of a positive AST test was 1.21. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that at AST-positive sites, there is a higher prevalence and higher proportion of certain periodontal pathogens. Although only the correlation of P. gingivalis and AST values was statistically significant, the results imply that certain periodontal pathogens may be associated with elevation of AST levels in GCF.
TI  - Inflammatory cytokine production and specific antibody responses against possible causative bacteria in patients with multilesional periapical periodontitis.
AB  - We examined the induction of inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) by several species of possible causative bacteria in periapical periodontitis. Assays were done on human whole blood cultures from patients with differing numbers of periapical lesions; those having radiographically clear periapical lesions in 10 or more teeth (high lesion group), in one or two teeth (low lesion group), and healthy volunteers having no periapical lesions (no lesion group). Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845 induced interleukin-6 more strongly in subjects from the high lesion group than in the other groups. To ascertain the degree of sensitization by test bacteria, we examined the reactivities of antibodies in serum and saliva from the six subjects to different bacterial species. Porphylomonas gingivalis cells reacted strongly with sera from the high lesion group. Thus, Prevotella melaninogenica and Porphylomonas gingivalis may be involved in multilesional periapical periodontitis by inducing specific cytokines and/or humoral immune responses.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  - Microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). The study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. In each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (P1, P2, M1, M2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). These teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). A 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with an external sling suture. With oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (A. actinomycetemcomitans, A. viscosus, B. melaninogenicus, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, S. mutans, S. sanguis, Selenomonas sputigena, T. denticola, and T. vincentii) were present. Semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and Pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (P < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. These results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.
TI  - Microbial findings of deep peri-implant bone defects.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine inflammatory tissue in deep peri-implant bone pockets (> 5 mm) for anaerobic bacteria colonization. The peri-implant inflammatory tissue of bone defects from 12 edentulous patients with 18 unsuccessful implants (IMZ type) was removed after surgical opening of the defects. After grinding the tissue with glass beads in nutrient solution, an aliquot of the suspension was plated and incubated on appropriate culture media. The quantitative and qualitative distribution of bacteria as a function of the tissue dry weight was determined (cell count/mg dry weight). The mean total cell count was 67 x 10(3) cells/mg dry weight. The following bacteria dominated: species of the family Bacteroidaceae (Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Prevotella oralis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella denticola); Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; Fusobacterium nucleatum; Capnocytophaga spp; and Eikenella corrodens. Bacteroidaceae and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found particularly frequently. The increased colonization of these bacteria in deep peri-implant bone pockets is consistent with the currently held view of advanced periodontal lesions, whereby certain pathogens grow at a disproportionate rate in comparison with the total bacteria count under specific circumstances.
TI  - Plaque pH and microflora of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces.
AB  - Given the hypothesis that root caries is the result of acid formation by acidogenic micro-organisms, the present study was performed to relate sucrose-induced pH response of dental plaque on root surfaces to the microbial composition of the overlying plaque. Seventeen caries-active elderly Chinese with poor oral hygiene and with both sound and carious root surfaces were examined. Plaque pH was measured before and up to one hour after a controlled sucrose mouthrinse. Plaque samples for microbiologic analyses were collected from 2 sound and 2 or 3 carious pH-measurement sites in each subject. The prevalence of the following micro-organisms was assessed as % of total viable counts on Brucella agar: Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga spp., Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundi, Streptococcus spp., S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus spp., and Candida spp. There was no difference in plaque pH response on sound and carious root surfaces. The plaque pH response was more pronounced in the maxilla than in the mandible for both sound and carious sites. There was no difference in microbial composition of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces. The pH response to sucrose was the same regardless of the presence or absence of mutans streptococci. Our results thus do not readily support the traditional concept of caries formation.
TI  - Incidence of anaerobes in ventilator-associated pneumonia with use of a protected specimen brush.
AB  - The role of anaerobic bacteria in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been  little investigated. In this study we analyzed the incidence of anaerobes in patients with a first episode of bacteriologically documented VAP (> 10(3)CFU/ml), using protected specimen brushes (PSB). We particularly took care to preserve anaerobic conditions during transport and the microbiological procedure. Two groups were considered: group A with anaerobic bacteria recovered from PSB, with or without anaerobes, and group B with aerobic bacteria only. One hundred and thirty patients were included, 30 (23%) in group A, and 100 (77%) in group B. The main anaerobic strains isolated were Prevotella melaninogenica (36%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (17%), and Veillonella parvula (12%). Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients in group A were younger than those in group B (p < 0.05) and their simplified acute physiologic score was higher (p < 0.02). The percentage of patients receiving antibiotics before PSB did not differ significantly between group A (57%) and group B (35%). VAP with anaerobes occurred more often in patients orotracheally intubated than nasotracheally intubated (p < 0.02). Episodes of VAP involving anaerobic bacteria occurred more often in the first five days (early VAP) than after the fifth day (late VAP) (p < 0.05). The 3-mo mortality rate was similar in the two groups, but death occurred earlier in group B (p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that presence of altered level of consciousness (p = 0.0002), higher simplified acute physiologic score (p = 0.003), and admission to the medical ICU (p = 0.02) were the factors independently predisposing to the development of VAP with anaerobes.
TI  - Associations of endodontic symptoms and signs with particular combinations of specific bacteria.
AB  - Significant associations have been reported between (a) specific bacterial species isolated from root canals and (b) between individual bacterial species and endodontic symptoms and signs. The prime objective of this study was to determine whether particular combinations of specific bacteria are associated with individual endodontic symptoms and signs. Seventy root canals were investigated microbiologically taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes, which accounted for 64% of the total species isolated, including Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella oralis, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Eubacterium lentum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella buccae and Prevotella intermedia. Significant associations were found between individual clinical features and the following pairs of species: (a) pain (37 cases) and Peptostreptococcus spp./Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus spp./Prevotella melaninogenica, Pstr. micros/Prev. melaninogenica (all P < 0.01); (b) swelling (23 cases) and Pstr. micros/Prevotella spp. (P < 0.01); (c) 'Wet' canal (57 cases) and Prevotella spp./Eubacterium spp. (P < 0.01), Peptostreptococcus spp./Eubacterium spp. (P < 0.05). Thus data from this investigation suggests that statistically significant associations exist between individual endodontic symptoms and signs and particular combinations of specific bacteria.
TI  - Cell envelope and cell wall immunization of Macaca fascicularis: effect on the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis.
AB  - The nonhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. Animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, and Actinomyces viscosus. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM and IgA isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. P. gingivalis and P. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. The high P. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low P. gingivalis numbers being recovered. P. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable P. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella buccae, Bacteroides macacae and Prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp. and Eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. Campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of Fusobacterium spp. decreased. Plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. Pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the P. gingivalis- and P. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth. Attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the P. gingivalis- and P. intermedia-immunized groups, and the F. nucleatum + C. rectus + A. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. Radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. P. gingivalis- and P. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with F. nucleatum + C. rectus + A. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. Although immunization with P. gingivalis and P. intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted in greater bone loss than immunization with F. nucleatum + C. rectus + A. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  - This report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. Tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. Tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. Microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. After implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly elevated. Following fixture placement, P. intermedia replaced P. melaninogenica as the predominant Black Pigmented Anaerobic Bacilli (BPAB) in the mouth. After abutment connection stage, levels of P. intermedia, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatun, Haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. Three months after bridge installations, P. intermedia and A. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. At six months after bridge installation, levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months. Porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their levels correlated with gingival redness. P. intermedia, Porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. Correlation was detected between P. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum. Our studies show a transitional increase in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their levels.
TI  - Oligonucleotide probes to the 16S ribosomal RNA: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens.
AB  - Eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16S ribosomal RNA  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens. The 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. Alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated I Bi-2 to I Bi-6 (for P. intermedia) and 2Bi-2 (for P. nigrescens) with the 16S rRNA suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. A 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated Bi) reliably detected both species. Because of the high degree of concordance between the 16S rRNAs of both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. Thus probe I Bi-I recognised P. intermedia while I Bi-I detected both P. intermedia and P. nigrescens at low stringency. However, under conditions of high stringency only P. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2Bi-I. These probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with DNA from the closely related P. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as Prevotella melaninogenica, P. denticola, P. loescheii, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Py. endodontalis, Py. gingivalis, Py. levii, and Py. macacae.
TI  - Heat shock proteins in the human periodontal disease process.
AB  - The production of HSP by periodontopathic Gram-negative bacteria was examined by  SDS-PAGE, two dimensional gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies against HSPs. Strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Treponema socranskii species produced HSP which reacted with anti-Yersinia enterocolitica HSP 60 and/or mycobacterial 65-kDA HSP monoclonal antibodies. It found that gingival homogenate samples from patients with adult periodontitis reacted with anti-human HSP were also found in a serum sample from a periodontitis patient. The present study suggests that HSPs are implicated in human periodontal disease process.
TI  - The oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora in young children: longitudinal changes from edentulous to dentate mouth.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The composition of oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora was investigated in 21 young children (mean age 32 months) with primary dentition. The bacterial findings of samples were compared with those of the same children collected at their edentulous infant period (mean age 3 months). During the primary period, 2 samples were collected from each child: a sample with dental floss from gingival margin of 2 teeth and stimulated saliva pooled with a mucosal swab sample. Both samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically using nonselective and selective media. Prevotella melaninogenica, nonpigmented Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum group and Capnocytophaga spp. were found in all children at the older age, whereas they occurred in edentulous mouth in 76%, 62%, 67% and 19%, respectively. The occurrence of Prevotella loescheii increased from 14% to 90%, Prevotella intermedia from 10% to 67%, Leptotrichia spp. from 24 to 71%, Campylobacter (Wolinella) spp. from 5 to 43% and Eikenella corrodens from 5 to 57%. Only the occurrence of Bacteroides gracilis and Veillonella spp. remained at about the same level. Species not isolated from the edentulous mouth, such as Prevotella denticola, Fusobacterium spp. other than the F. nucleatum group and Selenomonas spp. were now detected in 71%, 71% and 43% of the children. The stability of the colonizing P. melaninogenica strain(s) in the oral cavity was determined by using ribotyping; 1-2 isolates per child from the edentulous infant period of 9 children and 3-15 isolates per child from their primary dentition period were analyzed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The most frequently isolated gram-negative anaerobes in saliva and subgingival samples taken from young women.
AB  - Stimulated saliva and a pooled subgingival sample from the first molars were collected from 30 Caucasian women (mean age 30 years) for the presence of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. The samples were inoculated on nonselective and selective media. The gram-negative anaerobic species occurring in the oral cavity of more than 50% of the subjects were selected for further analysis. Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella melaninogenica were not recovered from subgingival sites without a simultaneous recovery in saliva. When positive subgingivally, Leptotrichia spp., nonpigmented Prevotella spp., Prevotella intermedia, Capnocytophaga spp., Bacteroides gracilis and Prevotella loescheii were simultaneously detected from saliva in 76%, 72%, 64%, 64%, 61% and 55% of the subjects, respectively. Intraindividually, the proportions of F. nucleatum, nonpigmented Prevotella spp., Leptotrichia spp., B. gracilis and P. loescheii of the anaerobic flora were quite similar in the salivary and subgingival samples. Capnocytophaga spp. and P. intermedia were present in higher proportions in subgingival samples than in saliva, whereas P. melaningogenica was present in higher proportions in saliva. Our data indicate that many oral gram-negative anaerobes are frequently recovered from stimulated saliva. Furthermore, when subgingivally positive, most subjects harbored these anaerobes simultaneously in saliva.
TI  - Positive and negative associations between bacterial species in dental root canals.
AB  - Significant associations have been previously reported between certain pairs of bacterial species isolated from human dental root canals. The aim of this study was to examine microbiologically a more extensive series of cases, with particular reference to obligate anaerobes which accounted for 64% of total isolations. A total of 65 different species was isolated and individual root canals yielded a maximum of eleven bacterial species. Highly significant positive associations (p < 0.001) were found between Peptostreptococcus spp. and Prevotella spp., between Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. melaninogenica, between P. micros and Prevotella spp., P. micros and P. melaninogenica and between Prevotella spp. and Eubacterium spp., all with an ODDS ratio of > 9.0. In contrast, negative and highly significant associations (p < 0.01) were found only between the four species pairs: B. vulgatus/F. necrophorum, P. magnus/Bifidobacterium spp., B. gracilis/F. nucleatum and between B. gracilis/Fusobacterium spp.; all with an ODDS ratio of < 0.5. Some previously published associations were confirmed and some new associations were found, while some negative associations became apparent.
TI  - Bacteriologic findings in peritonsillar abscesses in young adults.
AB  - Aspirated pus samples from 124 patients with peritonsillar abscess were cultured  quantitatively for aerobes and anaerobes. A total of 98% of the samples yielded bacteria. Of the 550 isolates obtained (mean, 4.4 per patient), 143 were aerobes (representing 16 species or groups) and 407 were anaerobes (representing 40 species or groups). Aerobes were isolated from 86% of patients-alone in 20 cases and together with anaerobes in 87. The most common aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes (isolated from 45% of patients), Streptococcus milleri group organisms (27%), Haemophilus influenzae (11%), and viridans streptococci (11%). Anaerobes were isolated from 82% of the samples and as a sole finding from 15 abscesses. Fusobacterium necrophorum and Prevotella melaninogenica were both isolated from 38% of patients, Prevotella intermedia from 32%, Peptostreptococcus micros from 27%, Fusobacterium nucleatum from 26%, and Actinomyces odontolyticus from 23%. The rate of previous tonsillar/peritonsillar infections was lowest (25%) among patients infected with S. pyogenes and highest (52%) among those infected with F. necrophorum (P < .01). Recurrences and/or related tonsillectomies were more common among patients infected with F. necrophorum than among those infected with S. pyogenes (57% vs. 19%; P < .0001) or with S. milleri group organisms (43% vs. 19%; P < .05). beta-Lactamase was produced by only 38% of the 73 isolates of Prevotella species tested; however, 56% of the 36 patients studied harbored one or more such strains.
TI  - Human monocytes and gingival fibroblasts release tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-6 in response to particulate and soluble fractions of Prevotella melaninogenica and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - In this study we provide evidence that structural and soluble components of periodontopathogenic bacteria, such as Prevotella melaninogenica and Fusobacterium nucleatum, induce the release of cytokines in vitro known to cause in vivo necrotic inflammatory phenomena and bone resorption (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-6). Human monocytes and gingival fibroblasts were cultivated in vitro in the presence of both particulate and soluble bacterial fractions. A dose-dependent production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha by monocytes and gingival fibroblasts was observed in the presence of fractions of P. melaninogenica and F. nucleatum. Interleukin-1 alpha was produced in approximately the same quantities in the presence of soluble fractions of either P. melaninogenica or F. nucleatum, but in greater quantities in response to particulate fractions of P. melaninogenica. Monocytes released larger amounts of interleukin-1 alpha (about 3000 pg/ml) than gingival fibroblasts (about 1500 pg/ml). Interleukin-6 was released in greater quantities by monocytes in the presence of the pellet fraction of P. melaninogenica (about 5.5 ng/ml), but gingival fibroblasts released larger amounts of interleukin-6, especially in the presence of particulate and soluble components of F. nucleatum (about 12 ng/ml). The ability to induce the release of these cytokines notably increases the pathogenic potential of the bacteria involved in the damage of periodontal tissue.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of AXOL on periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial action of AXOL was tested against a panel of periodontopathic bacteria, which included Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii, Treponema sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The AXOL commercial solution (undiluted) was effective in inhibiting some of the bacteria but not all. The rational for the use of antimicrobials is discussed.
TI  - Relationship between oral gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in saliva of the mother and the colonization of her edentulous infant.
AB  - Various gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species can be detected in the oral flora of edentulous infants. However, knowledge of the initial infection source is still scarce. Thirty Caucasian mothers (mean age 30 years) and their edentulous infants (mean age 3 months) were examined for the possible similarity of the oral gram-negative anaerobic flora. Paraffin-stimulated saliva was collected from the mothers. A pooled swab sample from mucosal surfaces and unstimulated saliva were collected from the infants. The samples were inoculated on nonselective and selective media and cultured aerobically and anaerobically. All of the 30 mothers harbored Fusobacterium nucleatum and 29 mothers Prevotella melaninogenica in their saliva. The salivary levels of P. melaninogenica, F. nucleatum, nonpigmented Prevotella spp., Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella loescheii exceeded 10(4) CFU/ml in about half of the 30 mothers. At this maternal salivary level, the infants' colonization frequency of P. melaninogenica and F. nucleatum was doubled. A positive correlation between maternal salivary concentration and infant's colonization was found for P. melaninogenica. No positive association was found with nonpigmented Prevotella spp., P. intermedia and P. loescheii. It can be speculated that maternal saliva may act as a source of some gram-negative anaerobes in the oral microflora of edentulous infants as early as before tooth eruption.
TI  - Immunoglobulins in milk from cows immunized with oral strains of Actinomyces, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium.
AB  - Immunization of pregnant cows with bacteria leads to the presence of high concentrations of specific antibodies in colostrum and milk. A total of 14 cows was immunized with single strains of heat-killed oral bacteria or pools of strains of Actinomyces, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium. Two cows were treated with adjuvant alone. The mean percentages of IgG1, IgG2, IgM, and IgA in all of the milks were 83.8, 3.8, 9.3, and 3.1, respectively. ELISA and whole cell agglutination assays demonstrated high titers in the milks from the cows immunized with either individual strains or the bacterial pools. The highest titers determined by ELISA belonged to the IgG1 isotype and in several milks were 64-fold greater than titers in milk from cows treated with adjuvant alone. The concentrations of all antibodies and the titers determined by ELISA and whole cell agglutination assays markedly decreased from the first to the sixth milkings. The functional specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by agglutination tests against a wide range of bacteria including members of Actinomyces, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Streptococcus, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Capnocytophaga, and Wolinella. Minimal cross-reactions with bacteria in other genera were observed with all of the milks. High-titer milk preparations have been obtained from immunized cows, and the capacity of the bovine antibodies to agglutinate target bacteria indicates their potential usefulness in oral passive immunization studies.
TI  - Microbiology of healthy and diseased periodontal sites in poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetics.
AB  - A group of poorly-controlled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients  were examined in a cross-sectional design for total microbial levels, microbial incidence, and the percent levels of selected periodontal microorganisms. These organisms were selected on the basis of prior reports that associated them with either periodontal disease or health. One periodontally-healthy and one periodontally-diseased site were examined in each IDDM patient. Increased levels of the periodontal pathogens Prevotella intermedia, P. melaninogenica spp., Bacteroides gracilis, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Campylobacter rectus (formerly Wolinella recta) were found at the periodontal diseased sites. Increased prevalence of the organisms P. intermedia, P. melaninogenica spp., and C. rectus were found at the diseased sites. A significantly higher percentage of P. intermedia was found at the sites exhibiting deep pockets and attachment loss.
TI  - The early colonization of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in edentulous infants.
AB  - The occurrence of oral gram-negative anaerobes was examined in 30 edentulous infants (mean age 3 months, range 1-7 months). One pooled swab sample from mucosal surfaces (cheeks, palate, tongue) and one saliva sample was taken from each infant. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically using non-selective and selective media. Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica was the most frequently isolated anaerobe, found in 70% of the infants. The other common anaerobes were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella spp. and nonpigmented Prevotella (Bacteroides) spp., found in 60%, 57% and 57% of the infants, respectively. Of corroding bacilli, Bacteroides gracilis was detected in 23% of the infants, Wolinella spp. and microaerophilic Eikenella corrodens in one infant (3% each). Leptotrichia spp., microaerophilic Capnocytophaga spp., Prevotella (Bacteroides) loescheii and Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia were found in 17%, 13%, 13% and 7% of the infants, respectively. In addition to these 30 infants, 21 edentulous infants were investigated for the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans only. A. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any of the 51 edentulous infants. The number of different anaerobic bacterial species in the same mouth varied from 0 to 7. No anaerobic bacteria were detected in 3 of 30 children (10%). These data suggest that various anaerobic bacterial species readily colonize the edentulous mouth in infants.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Bacteroides and other genera of Gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  - A numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of Bacteroides, Polyphyromonas, Prevotella [not Prevotella (Labroue, 1976)] and Fusobacterium. Isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. Computation of similarity coefficients was followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. At the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) Bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum and F. varium; (3) B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. fragilis, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformus and B. vulgatus; (4) B. splanchnicus; (5) Porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) B. bivius (Prevotella bivia); (7) B. disiens (P. disiens); (8) B. intermedius (P. intermedia);and (9) B. melaninogenicus (P. melaninogenica). Single isolates of B. ruminicola (P. ruminicola), B. denticola (P. denticola) and B. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Humoral immune response to oral microorganisms in periodontitis.
AB  - Serum antibody titers from patients with periodontitis were compared with those from periodontally healthy subjects. With the micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM antibody titers to isolates of Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Bacteroides ochraceus, and Fusobacterium nucleation were determined. Antibody titers of the IgG and IgA classes to B. melaninogenicus, B. ochraceus, F. nucleatum, and S. sanguis were found to be significantly higher in the controls than in the patients. No correlations were found with serum IgM titers. These findings indicate that periodonitis may be associated with depressed antibacterial serum antibody titers of the IgG and IgA classes.
TI  - Neutrophil chemotaxis induced by anaerobic bacteria isolated from necrotic dental pulps.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria belonging to the species Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Eubacterium alactolyticum, isolated from necrotic dental pulps, were tested for their capacity to induce neutrophil leukocyte chemotaxis. Generation of chemotactic factors in serum by whole bacterial cells and chemotaxis induced by bacterial extracts were studied in vitro by the Boyden technique. Subcutaneously implanted wound chambers in guinea pigs were used for testing leukocyte migration in vivo. All bacterial strains had a similar high capacity to induce neutrophil chemotaxis. The heavy accumulation of polymorhponuclear neutrophil leukocytes associated with clinical and experimental infections by B. melaninogenicus or B. asaccharolyticus cannot be ascribed to any extreme ability of these organisms to generate chemotactic factors.
TI  - Anaerobic pulmonary infections.
AB  - The main cause of anaerobic pulmonary infections is aspiration of saliva, upper airway secretions or gastric content. Predisposing conditions include prominent dental disease, chronic upper respiratory tract infections and reduced consciousness. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci are the most frequently encountered organisms. The clinical presentations are lung abscess, lung gangrene and empyema, which all tend to take a slow and indolent course. Preferred localization are dependent lung segments, most often on the right side. For bacteriological examination in these infections, only transtracheal aspirate and aspirate from the lung or pleural space are considered adequate. In 26 cases of empyema treated in our hospital during the last 3 years, adequate specimens had been taken in 19. Fifteen had been adequately examined, and anaerobes were cultured in 6. Among 29 abscesses treated during the same period, adequate specimens had been taken in only 14, and 11 had been properly examined. Seven specimens grew anaerobes on culture. In prospective studies of transtracheal aspirate in 15 chronic bronchitics without emphysema, anaerobes were not demonstrated. In 11 patients with bronchiectasis, anaerobic bacteria were cultured in 3. Finally, no anaerobic bacteria could be demonstrated in the transtracheal aspirate from 76 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Anaerobic, pulmonary infections do not represent an intriguing medical problem in our region. However, knowledge of these infections is necessary to secure adequacy in collection of specimens and in their bacteriological examination.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  - The capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out CO2-filled tube (DGT), dry sterile aerobic tube (DAT), and a tube containing a modified Stuarts' transport medium (MST), was assessed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in MST and DAT, respectively. The viability of P. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to MSA and DAT, was not adversely affected by the CO2 environment in the DGT. The MST maintained relatively constant numbers of Streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. The DAT and the DGT were unable to maintain the viability of S. pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a DGT, DAT, or MST, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage period. Of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only B. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the DGT. Under these test conditions the DGT did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). However, the MST did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
