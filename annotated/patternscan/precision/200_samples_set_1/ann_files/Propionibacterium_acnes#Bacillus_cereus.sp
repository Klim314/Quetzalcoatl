TI  == synthesis and characterization of nanosilver with antibacterial properties using  pinus densiflora young cone extract.
AB  == this study describes an eco-friendly, rapid method for green synthesis of silver  nanoparticles (ag nps) from an aqueous solution of silver nitrate using pinus densiflora for. multicaulis uyeki young cone extract in a single-pot process. color changes, ultraviolet-visible spectra (444.5 nm), x-ray diffraction peaks (2theta=39.68, 46.92, 68.12, and 79.10), and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-ir) confirmed the presence of ag nps and phytochemicals. transmission electron microscopy showed that the nanoparticles were mostly oval in shape, with a few triangular-shaped particles. average particle size was 30-80 nm. phytochemicals present in the young pine cone extract were likely responsible for the reduction of ag(+) ions. the synthesized ag nps (40 mug) had a 7 mm larger zone of inhibition against the skin pathogen brevibacterium linens than commercial ag nps, propionibacterium acnes (14 mm), bacillus cereus (9 mm) and staphylococcus epidermidis (10mm).

TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from nunavik collections of the macroalgae fucus evanescens c. agardh (fucaceae).
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == detection of microbial contaminants in mammalian cell cultures using a new fluorescence-based staining method.
AB  == aims: microbial contamination of cell culture production processes is a current concern for biopharmaceutical industries. traditional testing methods require several days to detect contamination and may advantageously be replaced by a rapid detection method. we developed a new method combining membrane filtration to microcolonies fluorescence staining method (mfsm) and compared it to epifluorescence microscopy. methods and results: both methods were used to detect bacteria in cho cells cultures. the epifluorescence microscopy showed to be limited by filterability, media interference and nonrobustness issues, whereas mfsm enabled consistent detection of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis  and propionibacterium acnes after, respectively, 8, 9 and 48 h of incubation. thanks to the nondestructive feature of the mfsm, stained membranes could be reincubated on culture media to yield visible colonies used for identification. conclusions: the new method described in this study showed its ability to detect  microbial contaminants in cell culture samples with time-to-results from 2-5 times shorter than the traditional testing method. significance and impact of the study: the mfsm can be used as monitoring tool for cell cultures to significantly shorten detection times of microbial contamination, while preserving the ability  to identify the contaminants and their viability.

TI  == [clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in bactec9240 blood culture system].
AB  == background: continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (ttp). we evaluated the clinical relevance of ttp in the bactec9240 system (becton-dickinson, usa). methods: a total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. ttp was monitored from each of bactec plus aerobic/f (bd) or pediatric plus/f and lytic anaerobic/f bottles,  and the differential time-to-positivity (dtp) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. results: the average ttp of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. while the average ttp values for aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, acinetobacter baumannii, and streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for candida spp., anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium spp, bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3  hr, respectively. the negative predictive values of ttp over 24 hr to predict staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and s. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecalis showed shorter ttp in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. dtp of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp. conclusions: ttp can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. the shorter ttp in anaerobic vials of certain enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. dtp is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp.

TI  == sterilization of platelet concentrates at production scale by irradiation with short-wave ultraviolet light.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (pcs) is recognized  as a serious threat to transfusion safety. we developed a simple method for sterilization of pcs with short-wave ultraviolet light (uvc). the effects of treatment on the sterility of contaminated pcs and in vitro platelet (plt) variables were evaluated. study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were prepared from pools of five buffy coats. irradiation with uvc (wavelength, 254 nm) under vigorous agitation was from both sides of the irradiation bags. kinetics of the inactivation of bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus epidermidis were determined. pcs spiked with approximately 10 to 100 colony-forming units (cfus)/ml of 10 bacteria species (n = 12/species) were irradiated with uvc doses between 0.25 and 0.4 j/cm(2) and tested for sterility by a commercially available bacterial detection system (bact/alert, biomerieux) after storage at 22 degrees c for 3 or 6 days. the influence of a dose of 0.3 j/cm(2) on plt variables was investigated on days 1, 4, and 6 after irradiation.  results: at 0.3 j/cm(2) all bacteria species tested were inactivated by more than 4 log. at this dose the influence of uvc on in vitro plt variables was marginal;  the storage stability for up to 6 days after treatment was maintained. pcs spiked with approximately 10 to 100 cfus/ml were reproducibly sterilized in the dose range tested. in individual experiments with the spore former b. cereus, pcs were, however, unsterile after treatment. conclusion: irradiation at uvc doses not detrimental to in vitro plt variables sterilizes pcs contaminated with a wide range of different bacteria species.

TI  == role of bacterial and host factors in infectious endophthalmitis.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a frequent blinding complication of globe-penetrating injury and ocular surgery. the outcome of this intraocular infection depends both on the organism involved and management of the ensuing inflammation. the role of various toxins and bacterial factors in the pathogenesis of this infection is beginning to be delineated, but appears to be organism specific. because of the immune-privileged environment of the eye, principles important in the resolution  of infection at extraocular sites cannot be extrapolated to understanding the host-parasite dynamics in eye infection. moreover, some factors that suppress the intraocular immune environment appear to have unexpected roles in activating phagocytic cells of the innate immune system in response to the presence of bacteria. therefore, considerable additional information characterizing the precise role of bacterial and host factors in the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis will be required in order to develop new therapies to improve the outcome of this often blinding infection.

TI  == elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == optimal sampling time after preparation of platelet concentrates for detection of bacterial contamination by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objectives: a universal quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), based on bacterial 16s rdna, to detect bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (pcs), was developed previously and compared with automated culturing. in the present study, this real-time pcr method was evaluated to determine the optimal sampling time for screening of bacterial contamination in pcs. materials and methods: routinely prepared pcs were spiked with suspensions of escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and propionibacterium acnes to 1, 10 and 100 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml and stored at room temperature for 7 days. the presence of bacteria in these pcs was monitored by quantitative real-time pcr. as a reference method (additional control), bact/alert automated culturing was used. for pcr, 1-ml aliquots were drawn from all (spiked) pcs on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of storage. as a control, triplicate samples (10 ml) were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic bact/alert culture bottles immediately after spiking (day 0) and after  storage for 1, 2, 3, 6 or 7 days. results: with quantitative real-time pcr, all bacterial species tested were reproducibly detected on day 1 after spiking at original concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu/ml. bacteria were also detected on day  1 from pcs spiked with an initial concentration of 1 cfu/ml, except for e. coli,  which was detected in only one of the three samples and p. aeruginosa, for which  analysis was not performed on day 1. with the reference method, bacteria were detected in culture bottles (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 20.1 h, with the exception of p. acnes which was detected at a mean time of 102.3 and 49.3 h (for original spiking concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu/ml respectively). conclusions: pcr enables the rapid detection of low initial numbers of bacteria in pcs. for reliable detection, our results support that sampling of pcs for real-time pcr screening should not be carried out earlier than 1 day after preparation (48 h after blood collection). importantly, the real-time pcr approach has the potential to be used before the release of pcs from the blood centre or shortly before they are transfused in the hospital.

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == validation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  == background: bacterial detection of platelet (plt)-rich-plasma (prp)-derived plts  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. this study validated the bact/alert for use in testing pooled prp-derived plts with nine contaminating organisms. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two prp-derived plt pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 cfus/ml). four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 ml was plated onto blood agar. results: all organisms (excluding p. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respective). p. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively). with e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. this was most notable with s. viridans where  the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. conclusions: this study validates the use of the bact/alert system for the detection of bacteria in prp-derived plts in a pooled format. overall, the use of the bact/alert system allowed the detection of pooled prp-derived plts inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 cfus per ml in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding p. acnes).

TI  == antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts and flavonoids from eucalyptus maculata.
AB  == aims: we investigated the antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts to find effective antibacterial agents. methods and results: the antimicrobial activities of leaf extracts from 26 species of eucalyptus were measured. extracts of eucalyptus globulus, e. maculata and e. viminalis significantly inhibited the  growth of six gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, propionibacterium acnes), and of a fungus (trichophyton mentagrophytes), but they did not show strong antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida). 2',6'-dihydroxy-3'-methyl-4'-methoxy-dihydrochalcone, eucalyptin and 8-desmethyl-eucalyptin, isolated from e. maculata extracts, exhibited potent antimicrobial activities against seven micro-organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.0 to 31 mg l(-1). conclusions: the eucalyptus extracts and three compounds from e. maculata were found to be effective against  micro-organisms that cause food poisoning, acne and athlete's foot. significance  and impact of the study: this study shows potential uses of extracts from e. globulus, e. maculata and e. viminalis, and antimicrobial compounds isolated from e. maculata.

TI  == evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in plt components.
AB  == background: a microbial detection system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux [formerly organon teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in plts. the recovery of nine organisms seeded into plts with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. the use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis plt  units to 10 and 100 cfus per ml. replicate samples (4 ml) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. results: all organisms (with the exception of p. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 cfus/ml). in aggregate (with the exception of p. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). in all cases,  the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. p. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with  the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 cfus/ml), respectively. the narrower bottle  neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. conclusions: these data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.

TI  == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients  after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34  +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration  achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin  represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

AB  == purpose: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral  administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between september 2001 and february 2002 at the cullen eye institute, houston, texas. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients  after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/ml, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/ml, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/ml, respectively. mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has mic90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis,  and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  == background: an automated bacterial culture system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. the recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella  oxytoca, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens,  streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu per ml. samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. results:  all organisms, except p. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 cfu/ml) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 cfu/ml) hours. p. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 cfu/ml) or 66.0 (100 cfu/ml) hours. the 10-fold increase in inoculum  was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. the aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours)  between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p <  0.001), respectively. conclusion: no difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. the new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == [staphylococcal sepsis associated with platelet transfusion: report of a new case and review of the literature].
AB  == bacterial contamination of blood components is an infrequent although potentially fatal event. bacterial contamination rate of platelet concentrates (pc) varies between 1/900 to 1/2,000 random donor units. however the risk of symptomatic bacteriemias is lower (between 1/2,000 to 1/12,000 random donor units). the organisms most commonly implicated in contaminated pc are gram-positive bacteria  such as coagulase negative staphylococci, bacillus cereus or propionibacterium acnes, although gram-negative organisms are also found that generally are associated to a higher mortality. here, a fatal case of sepsis due to staphylococcus carnosus associated to transfusion of a contaminated random donor  platelet unit is reported.

TI  == periodic acid-schiff-positive organisms in primary cutaneous bacillus cereus infection. case report and an investigation of the periodic acid-schiff staining  properties of bacteria.
AB  == primary cutaneous bacillus cereus infection frequently presents as a single necrotic bulla on the extremity of an immunocompromised patient. in lesional biopsy specimens and smears, the large gram-positive rods of b cereus may be mistaken for clostridium species. this is a potentially serious error, as bacillus species are resistant to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. we studied a case in which large periodic acid-schiff-staining organisms were seen in the biopsy specimen from a necrotic bulla on the finger of a neutropenic  patient with diffuse large cell lymphoma. the tissue biopsy specimen subsequently yielded a pure culture of b cereus. staining with periodic acid-schiff was then performed on a series of bacterial species in human tissue and from smears of culture colonies. the following bacterial species were found to be consistently periodic acid-schiff positive after diastase digestion: b cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, propionibacterium acnes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and micrococcus luteus.
