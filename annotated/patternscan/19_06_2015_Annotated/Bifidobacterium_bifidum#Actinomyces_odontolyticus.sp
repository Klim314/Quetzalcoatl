TI  == partial 16s rrna primary structure of five actinomyces species: phylogenetic implications and development of an actinomyces israelii-specific oligonucleotide  probe.
AB  == the intra- and intergeneric relationships of the genus actinomyces were determined by comparing long 16s rrna sequences, generated by reverse transcriptase. all species formed a phylogenetically coherent cluster in which actinomyces bovis, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. odontolyticus and a. israelii constituted genetically well defined species. a. israelii dsm 43322 (serotype 2)  was not closely related to three other strains of this species (serotype 1) and,  as judged from phylogenetic distances, could be accommodated within a. naeslundii, or represent a new species. in contrast to previous findings, members of the genus actinomyces appear to be related to bifidobacterium bifidum. sequence information was used to develop an oligonucleotide probe for the a. israelii serotype 1 strains, which did not react with the serotype 2 strain or with rrna from strains of eight actinomyces species.

TI  == lipoquinones of some spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomycetes.
AB  == the respiratory quinones of 73 strains of gram-positive bacteria including spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomyctes were examined. menaquinones with seven isoprenoid units (mk-7) were the main quinone type found  in representatives of the genus bacillus and in sporolactobacillus inulinus. however, a strain of b. thuringiensis produced mk-8 in addition to mk-7, and strains of b. lentus and b. pantothenticus appeared to produce mk-9 and mk-8, respectively, with no mk-7. in the clostridia and lactic-acid bacteria, no quinones were found, except in pediococcus cerevisiae nctc 8066 and lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus atcc 7469, which contained menaquinones, and streptococcus faecalis nctc 775 and him 478-1, which contained demethylmenaquinones, in relatively low concentrations. menaquinones were also found in the actinomycetes  (except actinomyces odontolyticus and bifidobacterium bifidum which did not produce any quinones) and in protaminobacter alboflavus atcc 8458, the so-called  actinobacillus actinoides atcc 15900 and noguchia granulosis nctc 10559.
