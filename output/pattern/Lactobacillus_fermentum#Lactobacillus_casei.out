host-mediated antiviral activity of lactobacillus casei against cytomegalovirus infection in mice.
the protective effect of heat-killed lactobacillus casei (lc) against murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) infection was examined. icr mice treated once with lc 1 day or 2 days before challenge survived lethal infection, but untreated or lactobacillus fermentum (lf)-treated mice did not. the protective effect was evidenced by an increase in plaque-forming units (pfu) per 50% lethal dose (ld50) and a decrease in titers of infectious viruses replicated in the target organs. this was further confirmed by severity of histopathological damage to the target organs, especially the liver. lc neither inactivated mcmv nor inhibited its replication in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mef). the spleen cells from lc-treated mice inhibited its replication in mef on co-cultivation. augmentation by lc of splenic natural killer (nk) cell activity correlated with survival of mice from otherwise lethal mcmv infection. cytotoxic activity of peritoneal cells and level of serum interferon (ifn) were elevated after mcmv infection, but they were not associated with survival of mice nor with treatment of lc. the protective effect of lc was not clear in nk-deficient beige mutant (bgj/bgj) mice, when compared with that in their littermate (bgj/+) mice. poor protection of bgj/bgj mice by lc treatment correlated with failure to induce nk cell activity by lc treatment in the mutant mice. thus, it is likely that lc protects mice from mcmv infection by augmentation of nk cell activity.
