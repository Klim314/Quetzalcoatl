TI  == antibacterial activity of ovary extract from sea urchin diadema setosum.
AB  == objective: sea urchin gonad is considered as a highly prized delicacy in several  countries. it is also rich in valuable bioactive compounds including polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) and beta-carotene. this study was undertaken  to examine the antimicrobial properties of the ovary extract from sea urchin diadema setosum against selected gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. materials and methods: the ovary extract was obtained using two different solvents such as methanol and chloroform. the obtained extract was used to examine its potential antimicrobial properties against the following 11 bacterial species using the disc diffusion method: gram-negative bacteria (salmonella typhi, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, acinetobacter sp, citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumonia) and gram-positive bacteria (bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus). the activity was measured in terms of zone of inhibition (mm). results: the methanol extract exhibited a higher zone of inhibition against all the bacteria taken for examination. whereas, the ovary extract obtained by chloroform did not show any antimicrobial activity against s. typhi, s. epidermidis, c. freundii and k. pneumonia. the results indicated that the ovary extract obtained by methanol extracts are capable of inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbes taken for analysis. moreover, the result indicates  the presence of antimicrobial agents in sea urchin ovary. conclusions: the study  suggests that the ovary extract of d. setosum may be a potential source of antimicrobial agent for pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == resistance and inactivation kinetics of bacterial strains isolated from the non-chlorinated and chlorinated effluents of a wwtp.
AB  == the microbiological quality of water from a wastewater treatment plant that uses  sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant was assessed. mesophilic aerobic bacteria were not removed efficiently. this fact allowed for the isolation of several bacterial strains from the effluents. molecular identification indicated that the strains were related to aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli (three strains), enterobacter cloacae, kluyvera cryocrescens (three strains), kluyvera intermedia, citrobacter freundii (two strains), bacillus sp. and enterobacter sp. the first five strains, which were isolated from the non-chlorinated effluent, were used to test resistance to chlorine disinfection using three sets of variables: disinfectant concentration (8, 20 and 30 mg.l(-1)), contact time (0, 15 and 30 min) and water temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees c). the results demonstrated that the strains have independent responses to experimental conditions and that the most efficient treatment was an 8 mg.l(-1) dose of disinfectant at a temperature of 20 degrees c for 30 min. the other eight strains, which were isolated from the chlorinated effluent, were used to analyze inactivation kinetics using the disinfectant at a dose of 15 mg.l(-1) with various retention times (0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min). the results indicated that during the inactivation process, there was no relationship between removal percentage and retention time and that the strains have no common response to the treatments.

TI  == [analysis of microorganism species diversity in plant intercropping models in a wetland system constructed for treatment of municipal sewage].
AB  == the selective culture method and pcr-dgge technology were applied to analyze the  number and the biodiversity of microorganism species in cells with plant intercropping models and without plants in different seasons in a wetland system  constructed for treatment of municipal sewage. the results showed that the numbers of microorganisms were considerably larger in the cells with plant intercropping models than those without plants, while the number of microorganisms was apparently larger in summer than that in winter in all treatments. along the three-sequenced treatment cells with plant intercropping models a "low-high-low" changing trend in the numbers of microorganisms in summer. the upgma cluster analysis showed that the treatments in the same season  were clustered in the same branch except for a few samples in winter and the biodiversity index was consistently higher in summer than that in winter. five different sequences (df1-df5) were obtained through blast analysis and retrieval. the closest known origin groups were located as escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., proteus sp., klebsiella oxytoca, and burkholderia sp. respectively. the blastx comparison test showed that df1 closely related to the activities of the mycobacterium bacillus and the bacillus amyloliquefaciens, df2 functioned as a conservative potential atp binding protein, df3 related to the activities of the  bacillus cereus spore, df4 was involved in catabolism metabolism of microorganism and df5 played an important role in decomposition of organic matters.

TI  == nitrous oxide production in soil isolates of nitrate-ammonifying bacteria.
AB  == here we provide the first demonstration of the potential for n2 o production by soil-isolated nitrate-ammonifying bacteria under different c and n availabilities, building on characterizations informed from model strains. the potential for soil-isolated bacillus sp. and citrobacter sp. to reduce no3 (-) ,  and produce nh4 (+) , no2 (-) and n2 o was examined in batch and continuous (chemostat) cultures under different c-to-no3 (-) ratios, no3 (-) -limiting (5 mm) and no3 (-) -sufficient (22 mm) conditions. c-to-no3 (-) ratio had a major influence on the products of nitrate ammonification, with no2 (-) , rather than nh4 (+) , being the major product at low c-to-no3 (-) ratios in batch cultures. n2 o production was maximum and accompanied by high no2 (-) production under c-limitation/no3 -sufficiency conditions in chemostat cultures. in media with lower c-to-no3 -n ratios (5- and 10-to-1) up to 2.7% or 5.0% of no3 (-) was reduced to n2 o by bacillus sp. and citrobacter sp., respectively, but these reduction efficiencies were only 0.1% or 0.7% at higher c-to-no3 (-) ratios (25-  and 50-to-1). as the highest n2 o production did not occur under the same c-to-no3 (-) conditions as highest nh4 (+) production we suggest that a re-evaluation may be necessary of the environmental conditions under which nitrate ammonification contributes to n2 o emission from soil.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteria from the gut of bombyx mori that degrade cellulose, xylan, pectin and starch and their impact on digestion.
AB  == bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) have been domesticated and widely used for silk production. it feeds on mulberry leaves. mulberry leaves are mainly composed of pectin, xylan, cellulose and starch. some of the digestive enzymes that degrade these carbohydrates might be produced by gut bacteria. eleven isolates were obtained from the digestive tract of b. mori, including the gram positive bacillus circulans and gram negative proteus vulgaris, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, serratia liquefaciens, enterobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, p. aeruginosa, aeromonas sp., and erwinia sp.. three of these isolates, p. vulgaris, k. pneumoniae, c. freundii, were cellulolytic and xylanolytic, p. fluorescens and erwinia sp., were pectinolytic and k. pneumoniae degraded starch. aeromonas sp. was able to utilize the cmcellulose and xylan. s. liquefaciens was able to utilize three polysaccharides including cmcellulose, xylan and pectin. b. circulans was able to utilize all four polysaccharides with different efficacy. the gut of b. mori has  an alkaline ph and all of the isolated bacterial strains were found to grow and degrade polysaccharides at alkaline ph. the number of cellulolytic bacteria increases with each instar.

TI  == production of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles in water extracts of the fungus  amylomyces rouxii strain ksu-09.
AB  == a fungal strain, ksu-09, isolated from the roots of date palm (phoenix dactylifera), was identified as amylomyces rouxii based on sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (its) region of its rrna genes. mycelia-free water extracts obtained from mycelium suspended in water for 72h facilitated the  production of stable, predominantly monodispersed and spherical silver nanoparticles (agnps) in the size range of 5-27nm upon addition of 1mm silver nitrate, as determined by the xrd, afm and tem. the agnps exhibited antimicrobial activity against shigella dysenteriae type i, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter  sp., escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans and fusarium oxysporum. thus, the strain ksu-09 could be used for simple, non-hazardous and efficient synthesis of antimicrobial agnps.

TI  == a survey of veterinary hospitals in nigeria for the presence of some bacterial organisms of nosocomial and zoonotic potential.
AB  == this study was undertaken to determine the type and estimate the prevalence of bacterial organisms on contact surfaces of five close-to-patient facilities in three veterinary health care settings within the sokoto metropolis of north-western nigeria. a total of 30 samples (10 from each setting) were collected and analysed using culture, microscopy and biochemical testing. bacterial species isolated from samples in this study included the following: bacillus sp. (27.3%), staphylococcus aureus (15.9%), listeria sp. (13.6%), streptococcus sp. (11.4%), salmonella sp. (6.8%), escherichia coli (4.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (4.5%), citrobacter sp. (2.3%), klebsiella sp. (2.3%), lactobacillus sp. (2.3%), micrococcus sp. (2.3%), pasteurella sp. (2.3%), proteus sp. (2.3%), and yersinia sp. (2.3%). a higher percentage (64.3%) of the total bacterial isolates were zoonotic in nature and hence of public health significance. some pathogens have the potential of nosocomial spread. in this study, we seek to establish the first evidence of bacterial presence in the major veterinary health care settings in the sokoto region of north-western nigeria. of particular interest is the hypothesis, which has not previously been formally tested, that nosocomial infections are especially likely to be implicated in both animals and occupational diseases in nigeria. it was suggested that some of these isolates were associated with the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections and  hence draws attention to the need to rigorously employ standard veterinary precautions as part of the hospital's infection control programme in an attempt to protect both patients and staff from infections.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community sfc-2 used for fermentation of air-dried crop straws].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community sfc-2 in fermented crop straw. methods: total 13 isolates were obtained from spontaneous fermented rice straw by plating, paper diffusion and denaturing  gradient gel electrophoresis. all these strains were used to determine the antibacterial activity of sfc-2. results: (1) phylogenetic analysis of the 13 strains based on 16s rdna gene sequence data indicated that 9 strains belong to enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacterfreundii, klebsiella terrigena and citrobacter sp., which were all common pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. (2) indicating bacteria selected from the pathogens were used to detect antibacterial activity of sfc-2 cell-free  culture supernatant. the results showed that: sfc-2 community had stronger antibacterial activity than isolated strains from sfc-2 community or man-made communities against indicating bacteria. (3) antibacterial activities of seven different cell-free culture supernatants, which were extracted at intervals from  the culture of sfc-2 community during 14-48 hours, were no obvious difference, but the content of organic acids were obvious differences during 14-48 hours; the antibacterial substances were stable after heating and sensitive partly to protease k.

TI  == a rapid and efficient method for cloning genes of type ii restriction-modification systems by use of a killer plasmid.
AB  == we present a method for cloning restriction-modification (r-m) systems that is based on the use of a lethal plasmid (pkiller). the plasmid carries a functional  gene for a restriction endonuclease having the same dna specificity as the r-m system of interest. the first step is the standard preparation of a representative, plasmid-borne genomic library. then this library is transformed with the killer plasmid. the only surviving bacteria are those which carry the gene specifying a protective dna methyltransferase. conceptually, this in vivo selection approach resembles earlier methods in which a plasmid library was selected in vitro by digestion with a suitable restriction endonuclease, but it is much more efficient than those methods. the new method was successfully used to clone two r-m systems, bstz1ii from bacillus stearothermophilus 14p and csp231i from citrobacter sp. strain rfl231, both isospecific to the prototype hindiii r-m system.

TI  == treatment of dairy wastewater using a selected bacterial isolate, alcaligenes sp. mmrr7.
AB  == physicochemical and biologic analysis of dairy wastewater showed that the effluent had a high organic load (chemical oxygen demand [cod]: 5095 mg/l), an acidic ph (6.4), and a high probability of coliforms (most probable number [mpn]  >1100). the various bacterial strains isolated and purified were identified as sporolactobacillus sp., citrobacter sp., pseudomonas sp., alcaligenes sp., bacillus sp., staphylococcus sp., and proteus sp., as per the bergey's manual of  systematic bacteriology. among the five selected bacterial strains, the strain designated as mmrr7 and identified as alcaligenes sp. was found to give a maximum reduction in cod (62%) in 5 d of incubation. chemical coagulation using alum at a concentration of 0.5 g/100 ml was found to be effective in the primary treatment  of the effluent. studies on free-cell treatment of the coagulated effluent with the selected bacterial strain alcaligenes sp. mmrr7 gave a maximum cod reduction  of 91% in 120 h. this study clearly indicates the possibility of using alcaligenes sp. mmrr7 for the effective treatment of dairy wastewater.

TI  == reduction of cr(vi) and bioaccumulation of chromium by gram positive and gram negative microorganisms not previously exposed to cr-stress.
AB  == resistance to cr(vi) is usually associated with its cellular exclusion, precluding enrichment techniques for the isolation of organisms accumulating cr(vi) via bioreduction to insoluble cr(iii). a technique was developed to screen for potential cr(vi) reduction in approx. 2000 isolates from a coastal environment, based on the non-specific reduction of selenite and tellurite to se0 and te0, and reduction of tetrazolium blue to insoluble blue formazan. the most promising strains were further screened in liquid culture, giving three, which were identified by 16s rrna sequence analysis as bacillus pumilus, exiguobacterium aurantiacum and pseudomonas synxantha, all of which reduced 100 microm cr(vi) anaerobically, without growth. the respective removal of cr(vi) was 90% and 80% by b. pumilus and e. aurantiacum after 48 h and 80% and by p. synxantha after 192 h. with the gram positive strains cr(vi) promoted loss of flagella and, in the case of b. pumilus, lysis of some cells, but cr was deposited as an exocellular precipitate which was identified as containing cr and p using energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis (edax). this prompted the testing of citrobacter sp. n14 (subsequently re-assigned by 16s rrna sequence analysis and biochemical studies as a strain of serratia) which bioprecipitates metal cation phosphates via enzymatically-liberated phosphate. this strain reduced cr(vi) at a rate comparable to that of p. synxantha but cr(iii) was not bioprecipitated where la(iii) was removed as lapo4, even though a similar amount  of phosphate was produced in the presence of cr(iii). since b. pumilus removed most of the cr(vi), with the formation of cell-bound crpo4 implicated, this suggests that this strain could have future bioprocess potential.

AB  == a growing number of extended spectrum shv-type beta-lactamases capable of hydrolyzing third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime have been reported. these new enzymes differ by a few amino acids from shv-1, an  enzyme incapable of hydrolyzing these drugs. two of these substitutions, gly-238-->ser and glu-240-->lys, are in a key beta-strand of the catalytic site of class a beta-lactamases. to understand the structural basis of these new activities, we first subcloned the dna region coding for shv-1 and shv-2 and did  site-directed mutagenesis to create two mutant shv-1 proteins containing ser and  glu or gly and lys and two mutant shv-2 proteins containing gly and glu or ser and lys in positions 238 and 240, respectively. phenotypic analysis (antibiograms and minimum inhibitory concentrations) and activity spectra of mutant enzymes showed that ser-238 is critical for cefotaxime hydrolysis whereas both ser-238 and lys-240 are needed for strong ceftazidime hydrolysis. a three-dimensional model for shv beta-lactamase complexes was constructed using the crystallographic structure of the homologous bacillus licheniformis beta-lactamase, the complex of cefotaxime with the streptomyces sp. r61 d-alanyl-d-alanine peptidase, and the complex of aztreonam with the citrobacter freundii beta-lactamase. the modeling of shv beta-lactamase complexes showed that factors which are most likely to correlate with binding and kinetic data are the size of the relatively buried amino acid at position 238 and the electrostatic charge of the exposed group at position 240.

TI  == isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (ovis canadensis nelsoni and o. c. mexicana) in arizona.
AB  == nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. a total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. one hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included bacillus sp. (36%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), s. aureus (4%), corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included neisseria sp. (18%), citrobacter sp. (3%), enterobacter sp. (2%), escherichia coli (2%), proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (nfb) (73%). of the nfb isolates, pseudomonas sp. (25%), acinetobacter sp. (18%), moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.

TI  == microbial activity of trench leachates from shallow-land, low-level radioactive waste disposal sites.
AB  == trench leachate samples collected anoxically from shallow-land, low-level radioactive waste disposal sites were analyzed for total aerobic and anaerobic populations, sulfate reducers, denitrifiers, and methanogens. among the several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated, only bacillus sp., pseudomonas sp., citrobacter sp., and clostridium sp. were identified. mixed bacterial cultures isolated from the trench leachates were able to grow anaerobically in trench leachates, which indicates that the radionuclides and organic chemicals present were not toxic to these bacteria. changes in concentrations of several of the organic constituents of the waste leachate samples were observed due to anaerobic microbial activity. growth of a mixed culture of trench-water bacteria in media containing a mixture of radionuclides, 60co, 85sr, and 134,137cs, was not affected at total activity concentrations of 2.6 x 10(2) and 2.7 x 10(3) pci/ml.

TI  == biological values of the infant, juvenile, and adult agouti (dasyprocta sp) with  emphasis on microbial flora.
AB  == normal values for intestinal flora were determined on four adult, two juvenile, and four infant agoutis (dasyprocta sp) maintained at our institution. serologic, hematologic, biochemical, and histologic observations were also made on these same agoutis, and serologic, microbiologic, and endoparasitic tests were made on  serum and fecal samples from agoutis maintained at other institutions. streptococci, lactobacilli and nonenteropathogenic escherichia coli were isolated from cecal contents of all age groups. gaffkya tetragena and bacillus sp were recovered from infant agoutis, proteus mirabilis from juvenile agoutis, and proteus mirabilis and micrococcus sp from adult agoutis. infant agoutis showed marginal antibody titers to reovirus type 3 and toolan's h-1 viruses, and theiler's gdvii antibodies were detected in juvenile agoutis, but no antibody titers to murine viruses were found in the adult agoutis maintained at our institution. hematologic, biochemical, and histologic data for these agoutis were comparable to those of other hystricomorph rodents. serologic tests of the agoutis maintained at other institutions disclosed antibodies for gdvii virus in  all of 17 animals tested, while marginal titers were found for sendai virus in four and for reovirus type 3 in eight of the 17 animals. only low incidences of pathogenic bacteria (salmonella, pseudomonas, and citrobacter) were isolated from the agoutis maintained elsewhere. the endoparasites found in these agoutis were ascaris, toxascaris, strongyloides, trichuris, and trichomonas.
