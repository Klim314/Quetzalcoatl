TI  == a derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a highly selective against propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == a chemical derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a, designated nai003, was found to possess a substantially reduced antibacterial spectrum in comparison to the parent compound, being active against just a few gram-positive bacteria. in particular, nai003 retained low mics against all tested isolates of propionibacterium acnes and, to a lesser extent, against enterococcus faecalis. furthermore, nai003 showed a time- and dose-dependent killing of both a clindamycin-resistant and a clindamycin-sensitive p. acnes isolate. gel-shift experiments indicated that, like the parent compound, nai003 retained the ability to bind to elongation factors (ef) tu derived from escherichia coli, e. faecalis  or p. acnes, albeit with reduced efficiency. in contrast, ef-tu's derived from the nai003-insenstitive staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes did not bind this compound. these results were confirmed by in vitro studies using a hybrid translation system, which indicated that nai003 can inhibit most efficiently protein synthesis driven by the p. acnes ef-tu. p. acnes mutants resistant to nai003 were isolated by direct plating. with one exception, all analyzed strains carried mutation in the tuf gene, encoding ef-tu. because of its selective effect on p. acnes in comparison to resident skin flora, nai003 represents a promising candidate for the topical treatment of acne, which has already completed a phase 1 clinical study.

TI  == fusidic acid in skin infections and infected atopic eczema.
AB  == skin infections represent an important public health issue and cost-driver. additionally, chronic skin lesions are sometimes colonized by gram-negative species. topical therapies are a key component in the management of mild-to-moderate skin infections. in such cases, topical antibiotics may be preferable to systemic treatment, since they maximize the effective doses at the  site of infection while minimizing the systemic side effects of the drugs. however, the prevalence of resistant strains is steadily increasing and cases of  sensitization are not uncommon. as a consequence, the ideal topical antibiotic should be selective (thus, minimizing cross-resistance), have weak sensitization  potential, penetrate the skin efficiently, reach adequate local doses at the site of infection, and finally be available in different formulations matching patients' preferences and needs. fusidic acid (fa) is a selective antibiotic available in several topical formulations. pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have shown that, contrary to other topical antibiotics such as gentamicin or mupirocin, fa reaches high antimicrobial concentration at deep skin layers after topical application either on intact or damaged epidermis. several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that fa, in its various topical formulations, is very effective in treating skin infections, given its high bactericidal activity against s. aureus (including strains resistant to penicillin, methicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin), s. epidermidis, streptococcus  pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, corinebatteria, clostridia. additionally, fa presents a low risk of resistance even in methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, a common pathogen implied in the etiology of skin infections and infected atopic eczema. such feature makes fa particularly useful in the management of these medical conditions. finally, possibly due to its large steric effect, fa has proved a very low risk of contact sensitization. overall, data on  fa efficacy, safety, sensitization potential, resistance profile and spectrum selectivity make it a first-choice option in the treatment of primary and secondary skin infection.

TI  == antioxidant and antibacterial activities of vegetables and fruits commonly consumed in thailand.
AB  == the vegetables and fruits commonly consumed in thailand have been suggested as rich sources of beneficial phytochemicals. in this study, vegetables and fruits native to the northeast region of thailand were evaluated for antioxidant and antibacterial activities. for vegetables, the extracts of limnophila aromatica (lamk.) merr. (extracted by 80% ethanol) and sauropus androgynus (linn.) merr. (extracted by distilled water) were found to have significant levels of antioxidant activities measured by dpph scavenging (ic5o at 4.92+/-0.01 and 4.71+/-0.01 mg ml-1, respectively) and frap antioxidant assays (74.38+/-0.25 and  74.00+/-0.04 mmol feso4 g-' of dry weight of vegetable, respectively) and also total phenolic compounds (10.96+/-0.02 and 10.34+/-0.01 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of  dry weight of vegetable). for fruits, the extracts derived from terminalia chebula retz. when using distilled water and 80% ethanol as solvents were shown to have significantly high levels of dpph scavenging (ic50 at 3.73+/-0.01 and 3.81+/-0.01 mg ml-1, respectively), frap antioxidant activities (80.85+/-0.10 and 65.93+/-0.11 mmol feso4 g-1of dry weight of fruit, respectively) and total phenolic compounds (13.10+/-0.06 and 10.66+/-0.02 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of dry weight of fruit, respectively). the antibacterial assays showed that moringa oleifera lam., limnophila aromatica (lamk.) merr., terminalia chebula retz. and phyllanthus emblica linn. that were extracted using 80% ethanol as solvent were found to have antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, straphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes and propionibacterium acnes.  the results in this study may be useful for future application of edible plants that are native to thailand to be used as cosmetic or therapqutic products.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from nunavik collections of the macroalgae fucus evanescens c. agardh (fucaceae).
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == the development of antimicrobial resistance due to the antibiotic treatment of acne vulgaris: a review.
AB  == objective: to review recent studies on the use of antibiotics in acne vulgaris which provide insight into the development of antimicrobial resistance. data sources: sources for this article were identified by searching the english literature by medline for the period 1960 to march 2009. study selection: the following relevant terms were used: acne, acne vulgaris, acne and antibiotic therapy, acne and antimicrobial resistance, acne and resistance mechanisms, acne  and systemic infections, acne and antibiotic resistance and coagulase-negative staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), acne and antibiotic resistance and upper respiratory infection. data synthesis: both correct and incorrect use of antibiotics for acne vulgaris can promote antimicrobial resistance. the development of this resistance is promoted by several factors, including antibiotic monotherapy, long-term administration of antibiotics, indiscriminate use outside their strict indications, dosing below the recommended levels, and the administration of antibiotics without concurrent benzoyl peroxide and/or topical retinoids. conclusion: long-term use of antibiotics in the treatment of acne vulgaris can lead to antimicrobial resistance with serious and intractable problems not limited to propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes), the skin and acne vulgaris themselves, but also to other bacterial species, with systemic consequences. these findings suggest that antibiotics should be prescribed in combination with benzoyl peroxide and/or topical retinoids and be limited to a maximum of several months.

TI  == biofilms in skin infections: propionibacterium acnes and acne vulgaris.
AB  == it is generally accepted that many human infections are biofilm-related and that  sessile (biofilm-grown) cells are highly resistant against antimicrobial agents.  propionibacterium acnes plays a role in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris, a common disorder of the pilosebaceous follicles and it has been suggested that p.  acnes cells residing within the follicles grow as a biofilm. although p. acnes biofilms have not been observed directly in the pilosebaceous unit, the observation that p. acnes readily forms biofilm in vitro as well as on various medical devices in vivo, combined with the high resistance of sessile p. acnes cells and the increased production of particular virulence factors and qourum sensing molecules in sessile cells point in this direction. in addition, in vitro and in vivo biofilm formation has also been demonstrated for other microorganisms involved in skin diseases (including staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes).

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients  after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34  +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration  achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin  represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on dermatophyte fungi, candida and bacterial skin pathogens.
AB  == aims: nitric oxide is generated from sweat nitrite in the acidic environment of the skin surface and is thought to contribute to protection against infection. this study examined the sensitivity of trichophyton mentagrophytes, t. rubrum, candida albicans, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and propionibacterium acnes to acidified nitrite. methods and results: organisms were cultured in varying concentrations of nitrite and ph for different lengths of time, before being transferred to recovery medium. with the exception of strep. pyogenes, addition of nitrite increased the antimicrobial activity of acid solutions against all organisms tested. the rank order of sensitivity was: c. albicans < t. rubrum < t. mentagrophytes < staph. aureus < p. acnes, with p. acnes being most sensitive. conclusion: this work has shown that acidified nitrite is microbiocidal to common cutaneous pathogens. the concentrations of nitrite required to kill pathogenic fungi and bacteria in in vitro assays were higher than the concentrations of nitrite measured in sweat. however, additional  co-factors in vivo and in sweat may potentiate the effect of acidified nitrite. significance and impact of the study: pharmacological preparations of acidified nitrite are novel antimicrobial agents. these data suggest skin organisms which may be sensitive to this treatment.

TI  == killing of cutaneous microbial species by photodynamic therapy.
AB  == background: photodynamic therapy (pdt) utilizes photosensitizers and light. whereas pdt use in cancer treatment has been widely accepted, antimicrobial pdt (apdt) is still in its early stages of development. objectives: to study microbial killing in vitro using apdt. methods: we used a combination of methylene blue and visible light, and a range of microbial species representative of those encountered on the skin in health and disease. using standard light intensity conditions (slide projector, 25 cm distance from target, 42 mw cm(-2))  and methylene blue dye at 100 microg ml(-1), kill rates and subsequent d-values were determined against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium minutissimum, propionibacterium acnes and candida albicans. results: d-values for these species were 72, 66, 48, 120, 30 and 660 s, respectively. the effects of light intensity on the killing of s. epidermidis showed the kill rate to be proportional to the light intensity. a high rate of cell kill was also obtained using natural sunlight. conclusions: overall, these results indicate that apdt of the skin may represent a useful alternative to conventional antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == biological response modifiers (brm) as antigens. iii. t cell lines specific for brm kill tumor cells in a brm-specific manner.
AB  == in order to investigate tumoricidal effector cells in therapy by biological response modifiers (brm) such as propionibacterium acnes, bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg), streptococcus pyogenes and a protein-bound polysaccharide  (psk), we established t cell lines specific for each brm from balb/c mice immunized with the corresponding brm. these t cell lines proliferated and produced interleukin-2 (il-2) and/or il-4, but only in the presence of the relevant brm and balb/c spleen cells as the antigen and antigen-presenting cells  respectively. cross-functional experiments indicated that each brm acts as a nominal antigen, but not as a non-specific immunostimulator. in addition, the t cell lines killed ia-positive syngeneic b lymphoma cells, but only in the presence of the relevant brm. these experiments excluded the possibility of cytotoxic effects by each brm. the t cell lines and clones also killed ia-negative bystander target cells, but only in the presence of both a relevant antigen and antigen-presenting cells. the t cell clones specific for s. pyogenes  or p. acnes tested were thy1+, l3t4+ and lyt2-. these results indicate that some  brm exert tumoricidal activity by inducing t cells that recognize them as an antigen and kill tumor cells in an antigen-specific manner. the t cells killed tumor targets in either a tumor-necrosis-factor(tnf)-dependent or a tnf-independent manner. the mediator of the latter pathway remains to be elucidated.

TI  == molecular and structural requirements of a lipoteichoic acid from enterococcus hirae atcc 9790 for cytokine-inducing, antitumor, and antigenic activities.
AB  == comparison was made between the immunobiological and antigenic properties of two  lipoteichoic acid (lta) fractions (lta-1 and -2) from enterococcus hirae atcc 9790, their glycolipid portions, and synthetic compounds partially mimicking the  above bacterial products. the more lipophilic lta-2 fraction was capable of inducing serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 in muramyldipeptide-primed mice and serum gamma interferon in those primed with propionibacterium acnes. the lta-2 fraction also induced tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and thymocyte-activating factor (essentially interleukin-1) in murine peritoneal macrophage cultures. consecutive intravenous injections of muramyldipeptide and the lta-2 fraction in meth a fibrosarcoma-bearing balb/c mice caused hemorrhagic necrosis and marked regression leading to complete regression of the tumor with no accompanying weakening or lethal effects. the lta-2 fraction was at least 10,000-fold less pyrogenic in rabbits than a reference endotoxic lipopolysaccharide. the more hydrophilic lta-1 fraction, on the other hand, showed at most marginal activity in the in vivo and in vitro assays. natural glycolipids (ngl-1 and -2) which were prepared from a chloroform-methanol extract of streptococcus pyogenes and e. hirae cells, and comparable in structure to the lipid moieties of the lta-1 and -2 fractions, respectively, were practically inactive in all of the assays. none of the test synthetic compounds was immunobiologically active, although synthetic partial counterparts of the structure of lta proposed by w. fischer (handb. lipid res. 6:123-234, 1990) reacted with murine monoclonal antibody ts-2, which was raised against ok-432, a penicillin-killed s. pyogenes preparation, and capable of neutralizing the cytokine-inducing activities of the lta-2 fraction.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; d-sphingosine; d,l-sphinganine; 4-d-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; n,n-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microm]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microm]). the sphingosines were similarly active against streptococcus pyogenes, micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, brevibacterium epidermidis, and candida albicans, moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against escherichia coli and serratia marcescens. both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees c and at ph 6.5. antimicrobial activity, which was ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous  antimicrobial barrier.

TI  == a zymographic assay for detection of hyaluronidase activity on polyacrylamide gels and its application to enzymatic activity found in bacteria.
AB  == a zymographic assay for the determination of hyaluronidase activity in cell-free  extracts on native polyacrylamide gels has been developed. in this assay an agarose replica of the polyacrylamide gel which contains hyaluronic acid and bovine serum albumin (bsa) was used. after an incubation at 37 degrees c to allow transfer and development of enzymatic activity, the hyaluronic acid and bsa were  precipitated in the agarose gel with 2 m acetic acid. areas of enzymatic activity appeared as clear zones in the agarose replica. the assay was sensitive and was used to demonstrate hyaluronidase activity in cell-free extracts from a number of bacterial and mammalian species.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 against 229 aerobic and 330 anaerobic clinical isolates was determined using the agar dilution technique. for comparison, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and metronidazole (only anaerobic bacteria) were tested. bay v 3522 was found to have high activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic cocci, propionibacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens and fusobacteria. when tested against a higher inoculum or using the  broth dilution technique, the activity of bay v 3522 showed little dependence on  inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to inhibitory activity in most bacterial groups. bay v 3522 may be useful in the treatment of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections. clinical studies are thus warranted.

TI  == contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet laser acts as a sterilizing scalpel.
AB  == as a cold knife cuts through contaminated or infected wounds, bacteria are dragged along with the blade of the knife through the entire wound. herein, the effect of incisions made with a cold knife is compared with that of incisions made by a contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet (nd:yag) laser. agar plates were inoculated with multiple strains of exogenous, endogenous, hospital-acquired and multiple antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. while the cold knife dragged bacteria to sterile areas, incisions made with the contact laser were always sterile. in addition to not dragging bacteria, the tip of the contact laser sterilized itself and provided a bacteria-free zone on either side of the cut, depending on the power density applied. it appears that the contact nd:yag laser acts as a sterilizing wand while providing much needed tactile feedback, precision and hemostasis during surgical treatment with the laser.

TI  == comparison of the nasal bacterial floras in two groups of healthy subjects and in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == the nasal bacterial flora was studied in 183 healthy men entering military service (entry group), 103 healthy recruits in service (service group), and 185 recruits with acute maxillary sinusitis. the 267 nasal and ipsilateral sinus aspirate findings in the same patients with acute maxillary sinusitis were compared pairwise. in the entry group presumed sinus pathogens were only rarely isolated from the nasal cavities: haemophilus influenzae in 4%, streptococcus pneumoniae in 1%, branhamella catarrhalis in 3%, and streptococcus pyogenes in 0%. the corresponding isolation frequencies in the service group were 19, 13, 3,  and less than 1%, respectively, and those in the group with acute maxillary sinusitis were 61, 25, 7, and 6%, respectively. suppression of the major components of the normal nasal flora, corynebacterium sp., coagulase-negative staphylococci, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus aureus, was seen in the group with acute maxillary sinusitis and also occasionally in the service group. when a sinus aspirate culture yielded a presumed sinus pathogen, the same  pathogen was found in the nasal samples in 91% of the cases. the predictive value of a pathogen-positive nasal finding was highest (93.8%) for s. pyogenes, followed by 77.7% for h. influenzae and 68.7% for s. pneumoniae, and lowest (20%) for b. catarrhalis.

TI  == bacteriological findings of acute maxillary sinusitis in young adults.
AB  == bacteriological findings in 339 sinus secretions obtained by puncture were investigated in 238 young adult patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. aerobic  and anaerobic cultures were performed immediately. a total of 76% of the secretions were positive. the most common pathogens isolated were haemophilus influenzae (50%), streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), streptococcus pyogenes (5%), and branhamella catarrhalis (2%). coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus were isolated in 8 and 1% of the specimens, respectively. the staphylococci were almost invariably present in low numbers and, therefore, probably represented nasal contamination. other aerobic species were found only occasionally. anaerobes were isolated in 5% of the secretions. in one-half of these, a low concentration of propionibacterium acnes was the sole anaerobe that  was found, and it was usually mixed with a facultative organism (suggestive of contamination with nasal flora). only 2% of the sinuses were considered to have true anaerobic infections (high concentrations of several species typical of anaerobic infection), indicating that anaerobes are not a significant cause of acute maxillary sinusitis in a young adult population. the high recovery of h. influenzae in this study indicates that aminopenicillins may be more appropriate  choice than conventional penicillin in the antimicrobial therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis (only 2 of 168 h. influenzae strains produced beta-lactamase).

TI  == antitumour effects of streptococcal lipoteichoic acids on meth a fibrosarcoma.
AB  == the antitumour effects of lipoteichoic acids (lta) extracted from streptococcus pyogenes were studied in comparison with other streptococcal cellular components. lta suppressed the tumour growth of both solid- and ascites-type meth a fibrosarcoma as did the whole cells of s. pyogenes (ok-432). no other cellular components, such as cell wall peptidoglycan, group-specific c-carbohydrate or type-specific m protein, suppressed the growth of meth a. lta, but not the other  cellular components, induced tumour necrosis factor (tnf) in propionibacterium acnes-primed mice. lta had no direct killing effects on meth a cells. these results indicate that lta may be an important antitumour component of ok-432 and  that one of the antitumour mechanisms by this streptococcal preparation is the induction of tnf.

TI  == changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  == concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. in particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence  and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. likewise structural components  such as fimbriae in escherichia coli, m protein in streptococcus pyogenes, protein a in staphylococcus aureus and capsule in bacteroides fragilis and haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. these products, through their importance as  impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. by their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid  killing of the pathogen. the immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.

TI  == [etiology of erysipelas].
AB  == bacterial cultures were taken from 31 patients by scarification from the dermal compartment of recent erysipelas foci. pathogenic organisms were isolated from the dermis while cultures from the skin surface remained sterile in 5 patients; streptococcus pyogenes was cultured in 2 of these patients and staphylococcus aureus in the other 3 patients. our findings indicate that staphylococcal erysipelas does exist and we suppose that staphylococcus aureus is able to induce erysipelas, above all in the presence of dysfunction of lymph vessels. when treatment with penicillin g is not successful, erysipelas caused by staphylococci has to be considered. in these cases treatment has to be changed to penicillinase-resistant penicillin.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo evaluation of a-56268 (te-031), a new macrolide.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of a-56268 (te-031), the 6-o-methyl derivative of erythromycin, was compared with those of erythromycin and other reference drugs. a-56268 had the same spectrum of antibacterial activity as erythromycin. a-56268 was generally 1 log2 dilution more potent or equal to erythromycin against all organisms except haemophilus influenzae and propionibacterium acnes, for which a-56268 was 1 log2 dilution and 3 log2 dilutions, respectively, less potent. the mbc of a-56268 and erythromycin was not significantly different from the mic against streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and h. influenzae but was more than 2 log2 dilutions higher than the mics for some staphylococcus aureus strains. human serum at a concentration of 50% did not change the in vitro potency of a-56268 or erythromycin. a-56268 was similar to erythromycin in being  more active at ph 8.0 than at the physiologic ph of 7.3. the activity of a-56268  was synergistic with sulfamethoxazole against 4 of 12 strains of h. influenzae. in mouse protection tests, when administered orally a-56268 was more potent than  erythromycin against h. influenzae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, and s. aureus. after subcutaneous administration the potencies of a-56268 and erythromycin were  not statistically different from each other. a-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against legionella infection in guinea pigs. the concentration of a-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. in a-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than  that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. in mice, the peak levels in serum of a-56268 and erythromycin were similar after subcutaneous administration and seven times higher for a-56268 after oral administration. the  serum half-life of a-56268 was approximately twice that of erythromycin after administration by both routes.

TI  == bactericidal activity of wet cerumen.
AB  == the viable populations of seven species of bacteria were reduced 17% to 99% by treatment with a 3% suspension of human cerumen of the soft or "wet" type. species tested for susceptibility to cerumen were staphylococcus aureus, staphlylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium spp, escherichia coli, and serratia marcescens. the reduction depended upon the species of bacterium and the age of the culture. pathogenic species appeared to be more susceptible than others, while cultures in logarithmic growth were more susceptible than stationary phase cultures to the bactericidal activity of wet cerumen. there appeared to be little difference in the bactericidal activity between the two lots of cerumen used. the bactericidal  activity of wet cerumen was found to be quite similar to that of dry cerumen as reported earlier in the literature.

TI  == teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  == teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and gram-positive anaerobes (propionibacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens and cl. difficile). ninety per cent of the staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for str.  faecalis. in mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. it was very effective in curing experimental mouse  septicemias caused by gram-positive bacteria (ed50 values less than 1 mg/kg).

TI  == biphasic protection against bacterial infection in mice induced by vaccination of propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == a single intraperitoneal injection of the phenol-treated cells of propionibacterium acnes into mice showed nonspecific resistance against subsequent lethal doses of an intraperitoneal challenge of klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. the protection showed a biphasic pattern. the maximum protection, designated as the early phase protection, was seen in mice injected with p. acnes vaccine 1 to 2 days before the challenge, whereas the late phase protection was seen in mice vaccinated 16 to 22 days before the challenge. the activity of the reticuloendothelial system in mice after vaccination also showed a biphasic pattern with the peak on days 4  and 12. the delayed activation of the reticuloendothelial system lasted up to 3 weeks and coincided with the period of the late phase protection. the early phase resistance was markedly impaired by the treatment with hydrocortisone and carrageenan, but not by the treatment with anti-thymocyte serum, actinomycin d, or cyclophosphamide. the number of peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vaccinated mice increased on days 1 to 2. the number of macrophages also increased at 2 to 21 days after vaccination and reached its maximum on day 14. total activities of acid phosphatase, nitro blue tetrazolium reduction, and the phagocytic activities of peritoneal exudate cells were also enhanced on and after day 1 after the injection of p. acnes vaccine.

AB  == immunotherapeutic response to concanavalin a (con a)-bound l1210 murine leukemic  vaccine and immunopotentiators was examined in histocompatible animals bearing a  small burden l1210 leukemic cells. when combined with con a-bound vaccine, a streptococcal immunopotentiator, ok-432 (nsc b116209), prepared from streptococcus pyogenes, was potent in antitumor therapy and resulted in a number  of cured animals. administration of either con-a-bound vaccine or ok-432 alone did not produce any beneficial effect on leukemic animals. the enhanced therapeutic response was dependent on the effectiveness of the dose and timing of the administration of ok-432 when given after vaccination. combined modality of con a-bound l1210 vaccine and ok-432 was not effective in animals bearing p388 murine leukemic cells, which indicates specificity of therapeutic response. in enhancing the therapeutic potency of con a-bound leukemia vaccine, pyran copolymer (nsc 46015) was as effective as ok-432, whereas bacillus calmette-guerin and corynebacterium parvum were far less effective. when combined with ok-432, therapeutic response to con a-bound l1210 vaccine was much greater than response to glutaraldehyde-, mitomycin c-, or vibrio cholerae neuraminidase-treated l1210 vaccine.

TI  == quantitation of skin bacteria: lethality of the wash solution used to remove bacteria.
AB  == a widely used technique for the quantitative removal of bacteria from the skin uses a detergent, triton x-100 (p, t-octylphenoxynonaethoxyethanol), to remove and suspend the bacteria. we determined the half-life for the survival of five common skin bacteria suspended in the solution. the shortest-lived was streptococcus pyogenes with a half-life of 0.9 hours. all of the others (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, and  klebsiella pneumoniae) had half-lives of 1.5 hours or longer. k. pneumoniae, the  only gram-negative species tested, had a half-life of more than 30 hours. thus, a one hour delay in plating and incubation of samples suspended in this detergent solution inhibits quantitation of most species tested.
