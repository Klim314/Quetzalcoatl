TI  == bactericidal efficacy of elevated ph on fish pathogenic and environmental bacteria.
AB  == ship ballast water is a recognized medium for transfer and introductions of nonindigenous species. there is a need for new ballast water treatment methods that effectively and safely eliminate or greatly minimize movements of these species. the present study employed laboratory methods to evaluate the bactericidal efficacy of increased ph (ph 10.0-12.0) for exposure durations of up to 72 h to kill a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria including fish pathogens (aeromonas spp., yersinia ruckeri, edwardsiella ictaluri, serratia liquefaciens, carnobacterium sp.), other common aquatic-inhabitant bacteria (serratia marcescens, pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus sp., bacillus sp.)  and indicators listed in international maritime organization d2 standards; namely, vibrio cholera (an environmental isolate from fish), escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. volumes of 5 n naoh were added to tryptic soy broth to obtain desired ph adjustments. viable cells were determined after 0, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. initial (0 h) cell numbers ranged from 3.40 x 10(4) cfu/ml for bacillus sp. to 2.44 x 10(7) cfu/ml for e. faecalis. the effective endpoints of ph and treatment duration necessary to realize 100% bactericidal effect varied; however, all bacteria tested were killed within 72 h at ph 12.0 or lower. the lowest parameters examined, 4 h at ph 10.0, were bactericidal to v. cholera, e. ictaluri, three of four isolates of e. coli, and (three of four) aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. bactericidal effect was attained at ph 10.0 within 12 h for the other a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, and within 24 h for  p. fluorescens, and the remaining e. coli.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria from farmed seabass dicentrarchus labrax.
AB  == the use of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the prevention or reduction of fish diseases is receiving increasing attention. in the present study, 47 lab strains  were isolated from farmed seabass ( dicentrarchus labrax ) and were phenotypically and phylogenetically analysed by 16s rdna and randomly amplified polymorphic dna - polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr). their antimicrobial effect was tested in vitro against a wide variety of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. most of the strains isolated were enterococci belonging to the following species: enterococcus faecium (59%), enterococcus faecalis (21%), enterococcus sanguinicola (4 strains), enterococcus mundtii (1 strain), enterococcus pseudoavium (1 strain), and lactococcus lactis (1 strain). an aerococcus viridans strain was also isolated. the survey of their antimicrobial susceptibility showed that all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and exhibited resistance to between 4 and 10 other antibiotics relevant for therapy in human and animal medicine. different patterns of resistance were noted for skin and intestines isolates. more than 69% (32 strains) of the isolates inhibited the growth of the majority of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria tested,  including listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas salmonicida, vibrio anguillarum, and carnobacterium sp. to our knowledge, this is the first report of bioactive enterococcal species isolated from seabass that could potentially inhibit the undesirable bacteria found in food systems.

TI  == defensin of the zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
AB  == a 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (est) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha) foot cdna library developed in our laboratory. the d. polymorpha defensin (dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. the mature dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin a domain. homologue searching against genbank database suggested that this dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin a. the recombinant dpd was in vitro expressed through an escherichia coli expression system. the antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant dpd were found against the growth of morganella sp., plesiomonas shigelloides, edwardsiella tarda, e. coli and staphylococcus aureus aureus (atcc12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (mic) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microm, respectively. however, with less than 50 microm no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four gram-negative bacteria (aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, motile aeromonas, flavobacterium sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other gram-positive bacteria (bacillus megaterium atcc14581, carnobacterium maltaromaticum atcc27865, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and micrococcus leteus atcc4698), and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the rna fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) of dpd in the zebra  mussel suggested that the dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. by using the quantitative pcr, the expression level of dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. by comparing the amount of dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qpcr, we found that the higher expression levels of dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. findings of this study suggest that the expression of the dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.
