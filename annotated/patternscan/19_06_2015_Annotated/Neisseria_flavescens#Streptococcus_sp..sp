TI  == evidence of an increased pathogenic footprint in the lingual microbiome of untreated hiv infected patients.
AB  == background: opportunistic oral infections can be found in over 80% of hiv + patients, often causing debilitating lesions that also contribute to deterioration in nutritional health. although appreciation for the role that the  microbiota is likely to play in the initiation and/or enhancement of oral infections has grown considerably in recent years, little is known about the impact of hiv infection on host-microbe interactions within the oral cavity. in the current study, we characterize modulations in the bacterial composition of the lingual microbiome in patients with treated and untreated hiv infection. bacterial species profiles were elucidated by microarray assay and compared between untreated hiv infected patients, hiv infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, and healthy hiv negative controls. the relationship between clinical parameters (viral burden and cd4+ t cell depletion) and the loss or gain of bacterial species was evaluated in each hiv patient group. results: in untreated hiv infection, elevated viremia was associated with significantly higher proportions of potentially pathogenic veillonella, prevotella, megasphaera, and campylobacter species in the lingual microbiome than observed in healthy controls. the upsurge in the prevalence of potential pathogens was juxtaposed by diminished representation of commensal streptococcus and veillonella species. colonization of neisseria flavescens was lower in the lingual microbiome of hiv infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy than in uninfected controls. conclusions: our findings provide novel insights into the potential impact of hiv infection and antiretroviral therapy on the community structure of the oral microbiome, and implicate potential mechanisms that may increase the capacity of non-commensal species to gain a stronger foothold.

TI  == mosaic-like structure of penicillin-binding protein 2 gene (pena) in clinical isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae with reduced susceptibility to cefixime.
AB  == neisseria gonorrhoeae strains with reduced susceptibility to cefixime (mics, 0.25 to 0.5 micro g/ml) were isolated from male urethritis patients in tokyo, japan, in 2000 and 2001. the resistance to cephems including cefixime and penicillin was transferred to a susceptible recipient, n. gonorrhoeae atcc 19424, by transformation of the penicillin-binding protein 2 gene (pena) that had been amplified by pcr from a strain with reduced susceptibility to cefixime (mic, 0.5  micro g/ml). the sequences of pena in the strains with reduced susceptibilities to cefixime were different from those of other susceptible isolates and did not correspond to the reported n. gonorrhoeae pena gene sequences. some regions in the transpeptidase-encoding domain in this pena gene were similar to those in the pena genes of neisseria perflava (n. sicca), neisseria cinerea, neisseria flavescens, and neisseria meningitidis. these results showed that a mosaic-like structure in the pena gene conferred reductions in the levels of susceptibility of n. gonorrhoeae to cephems and penicillin in a manner similar to that found for n. meningitidis and streptococcus pneumoniae.
