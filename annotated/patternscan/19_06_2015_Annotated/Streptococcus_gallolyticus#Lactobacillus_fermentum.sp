TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and in situ amylase expression during traditional fermentation of cereal foods.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria play an important role in traditional fermented foods consumed in different countries. study of their taxonomic structure and diversity is necessary for starter culture selection, improved safety and nutritional enhancement. to achieve these objectives, microbial genomic typing methods were used to study genetic differences of autochthonous bacteria and their distribution in two traditional african fermented cereal foods. a total of 85 predominant bacterial species were isolated from ogi and kunu-zaki obtained from  northern and southern geographical region of nigeria. they were identified using  combination of 16s rrna gene sequencing, multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) based on rpoa, phes and atpa genes as well as m13-pcr gel fingerprints. the results showed that lactobacillus fermentum was the most frequently isolated species in ogi (71.4%) and kunu-zaki (84.5%). other species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) identified were lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. non lactic acid bacteria isolated from these foods were species belonging to the bacillus and staphylococcus. non-metric multidimensional scaling (nmds) analysis of the m13-pcr fingerprints for lab strains showed clonal diversity among strains of the same species. in vitro and in situ expression of amylase gene during fermentation by amylolytic l. plantarum ulag11 was detected, indicating the potential usefulness of such species for development of starter cultures and for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented west african cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  == in this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. in particular, pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16s rrna gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. dna sequencing of the highly variable v3 region of the 16s rrna genes obtained from pcr-dgge fingerprints identified species related to weissella confusa, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus amylolyticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bacillus spp. and lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. a more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16s rrna gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the streptococcaceae family. interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. for example, l. plantarum, l. pantheris and l. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while w. confusa, streptococcus lutetiensis and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were  found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == lactobacillus agilis is an important component of the pigeon crop flora.
AB  == aims: to examine the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab: enterococci, streptococci and lactobacilli) in the pigeon crop. methods and results: the crops of 10 pigeons were sampled and inoculated on agar plates for isolation of streptococci, enterococci and lactobacilli. the isolates were identified using tdna-pcr. lactobacillus agilis, a species described in 1981 from municipal sewage, was the dominant component in eight of these pigeon crop sacs. a lactobacillus species related to l. fermentum and l. mucosae but probably not belonging to one of these species was isolated from five birds. three pigeons carried enterococcus cecorum. minor species found were e. columbae, e. faecalis,  e. hirae, l. johnsonii, l. salivarius, and streptococcus gallolyticus. a description is given of the phenotypic characteristics of the l. agilis pigeon strains. conclusions, significance and impact of the study: l. agilis is found to be the main component of the lab flora in the pigeon crop.
