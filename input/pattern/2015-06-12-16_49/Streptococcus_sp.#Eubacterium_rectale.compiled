TI  - Phytase modulates ileal microbiota and enhances growth performance of the broiler chickens.
AB  - Phytase is well studied and explored, however, little is known about its effects  on the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract. In total, 400 one-day-old female Ross 308 chicks were randomly distributed to four experimental groups. The dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 complete factorial design, with the factors being adequate (PC) or insufficient calcium (Ca) and digestible phosphor (dP)(NC) and with or without 5000 phytase units (FTU)/kg of Escherichia coli 6-phytase. The gastrointestinal tract pH values, ileal microbial communities and short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the digesta were determined. The reduction in Ca and dP concentration significantly affected pH in the crop and caeca, and addition of phytase to the NC resulted in a pH increase in the ileum. The reduction in Ca and dP concentration significantly lowered, while phytase supplementation increased ileal total bacterial counts. Additionally, the deficient diet reduced butyrate- but increased lactate-producing bacteria. The addition of phytase increased Lactobacillus sp./Enterococcus sp. whereas in case of Clostridium leptum subgroup, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale cluster, Bifidobacterium sp. and Streptococcus/Lactococcus counts, a significant Ca and dP level x phytase interaction was found. However, the recorded interactions indicated that the effects of phytase and Ca and dP levels were not consistent. Furthermore, the reduction of Ca and dP level lowered Clostridium perfringens and Enterobacteriaceae counts. The analysis of fermentation products showed that reducing the Ca and dP content in the diet reduced total SCFA, DL-lactate, and acetic acid in the ileum whereas phytase increased concentrations of these acids in the NC group. This suggests that P is a factor which limits fermentation in the ileum. It may be concluded that phytase plays a role in modulating the gut microbiota of chicken, however, this is clearly linked with the levels of P and Ca in a diet.
TI  - Long-term monitoring of the human intestinal microbiota from the 2nd week to 13 years of age.
AB  - Microbial contact begins prior to birth and continues rapidly thereafter. Few long term follow-up studies have been reported and we therefore characterized the development of intestinal microbiota of ten subjects from the 2nd week of life to 13 years of age. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis combined with several bacterial group-specific primer sets demonstrated the colonization steps of defined bacterial groups in the microbiota. Bifidobacterium species were seen throughout the test period in all subjects. Bacteroides fragilis group and Blautia coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group species were not detected in several subjects during the first 6 months of life but were commonly seen after 12 months of life. Streptococcus group appeared during early life but was not seen in several subjects at the age of 13 years. Although a few species were linked with the increasing age, major bacterial species in the groups did not change dramatically. Rather considerable changes were found in the relative abundances of each bacterial species. Clustering analysis of total bacterial flora indicated that the microbiota changed considerably between 6 months and 12 months of life, and, at the age of 12 months, the intestinal microbiota was already converted toward a profile characteristic of an adult microbiota. Probiotic supplementation in the beginning of life did not have major impacts on later microbiota development.
TI  - Association of symptoms with gastrointestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the correlations between self-reported symptoms of irritable  bowel syndrome (IBS) and the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota composition. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from a total of 44 subjects diagnosed with IBS. Their symptoms were monitored with a validated inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire adjusted for IBS patients. Thirteen quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were applied to evaluate the GI microbiota composition. Eubacteria and GI bacterial genera (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Veillonella), groups (Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium rectale, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans) and distinct bacterial phylotypes [closest 16S rDNA sequence resemblance to species Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Clostridium cocleatum, Collinsella aerofaciens (C. aerofaciens), Coprococcus eutactus (C. eutactus), Ruminococcus torques and Streptococcus bovis] with a suspected association with IBS were quantified. Correlations between quantities or presence/absence data of selected bacterial groups or phylotypes and various IBS-related symptoms were investigated. RESULTS: Associations were observed between subjects' self-reported symptoms and the presence or quantities of certain GI bacteria. A Ruminococcus torques (R. torques)-like (94% similarity in 16S rRNA gene sequence) phylotype was associated with severity of bowel symptoms. Furthermore, among IBS subjects with R. torques 94% detected, the amounts of C. cocleatum 88%, C. aerofaciens-like and C. eutactus 97% phylotypes were significantly reduced. Interesting observations were also made concerning the effect of a subject's weight on GI microbiota with regard to C. aerofaciens-like phylotype, Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. CONCLUSION: Bacteria seemingly affecting the symptom scores are unlikely to be the underlying cause or cure of IBS, but they may serve as biomarkers of the condition.
TI  - An rRNA-based analysis for evaluating the effect of heat stress on the rumen microbial composition of Holstein heifers.
AB  - We performed a set of heifer feeding trials to investigate the effect of heat and humidity stresses on the rumen bacterial molecular diversity of Holstein heifers (Tajima K, Nonaka I, Higuchi K, Takusari N, Kurihara M, Takenaka A, et al. Anaerobe 2007;13:57-64). To further characterize the response of the microbial community to the physiological changes caused by the stresses, we evaluated changes in the ruminal bacterial community composition in the same trials by applying an RNA-based method (sequence-specific small-subunit (SSU) rRNA cleavage method), which was optimized for a comprehensive description of the predominant bacterial groups inhabiting the rumen. Four Holstein heifers were kept at three temperatures (20 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 33 degrees C) in a climatic chamber for two weeks each, and rumen fluid samples were obtained on the last day of each temperature experiment. For quantitative detection, we applied a set of 15 oligonucleotide probes, including those targeting taxa comprised of uncultured rumen bacteria (URB) belonging to phylum Firmicutes, to the RNAs extracted from the fluid samples. The relative populations of the Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group, and the genus Streptococcus increased, and that of the genus Fibrobacter decreased in response to increasing temperature both in the first (nine months old, 80% relative humidity) and second (15 months old, 60% relative humidity) experiments. In addition, the population of a defined URB group was higher at 33 degrees C than at 20 degrees C in the second trial, whereas one of the other URB groups showed a decreasing trend with the temperature rise. These results indicate that the exposure to heat affects the population levels of specific bacterial groups in the ruminal microbial community.
TI  - Effects of yogurt and bifidobacteria supplementation on the colonic microbiota in lactose-intolerant subjects.
AB  - AIMS: Colonic metabolism of lactose may play a role in lactose intolerance. We investigated whether a 2-week supplementation of Bifidobacterium longum (in capsules) and a yogurt enriched with Bifidobacterium animalis could modify the composition and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota in 11 Chinese lactose-intolerant subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: The numbers of total cells, total bacteria and the Eubacterium rectale/Clostridium coccoides group in faeces as measured with fluorescent in situ hybridization and the faecal beta-galactosidase activity increased significantly during supplementation. The number of Bifidobacterium showed a tendency to increase during and after supplementation. With PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, in subjects in which B. animalis and B. longum were not detected before supplementation, both strains were present in faeces during supplementation, but disappeared after supplementation. The degree of lactose digestion in the small intestine and the oro-caecal transit time were not different before and after supplementation, whereas symptom scores after lactose challenge decreased after supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that supplementation modifies the amount and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota and alleviates symptoms in lactose-intolerant subjects. The changes in the colonic microbiota might be among the factors modified by the supplementation which lead to the alleviation of lactose intolerance. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides evidence for the possibility of managing lactose intolerance with dietary lactose (yogurt) and probiotics via modulating the colonic microbiota.
TI  - Composition of microbiota in content and mucus from cecae of broiler chickens as  measured by fluorescent in situ hybridization with group-specific, 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  - Six group-specific 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes were used to investigate the composition of the microbiota of cecal content and mucus from broiler chickens. Together, the probes hybridized to as many as 94.7% of the bacteria detectable with the universal probe Bact338 in the content of the cecum of 2-d-old chicks. Fewer bacteria gave signals with these probes as the birds aged, and coverage was as low as 76% for the bacteria in cecal content of a 6-wk-old chicken. In the cecal content of 2-d-old chicks, approximately 56, 34, and 3% of the bacteria detectable with the universal probe reacted with the probes Enter1432 (enterics), Lacto722 (Lactobacillus/Streptococcus/Enterococcus), and Bif164 (bifidobacteria), respectively. Probes Clept1240 (Clostridium leptum subgroup), Erec482 (Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale), and Bacto1080 (Bacteroides groups) did not produce signals. In cecal content from 1-wk-old chicks, all six probes gave signals, and in samples from 6-wk-old birds approximately 3, 9, 6, 32, 22, and 8% of the bacteria detectable with the universal probe hybridized with the probes Enter1432, Lacto722, Bif164, Clept1240, Erec482, and Bacto1080, respectively. At this age, the six probes detected the phylogenetic groups in similar proportions in the microbiota of cecal content and cecal mucus. The exception was the enterics probe because more bacteria from the mucus fraction than from cecal content gave signals with this probe (13.4 vs. 4.4%, P<0.001).
TI  - Design and evaluation of group-specific oligonucleotide probes for quantitative analysis of intestinal ecosystems: their application to assessment of equine colonic microflora.
AB  - Nine oligonucleotide probes complementary to conserved regions of small subunit rRNA from phylogenetically defined clusters of intestinal anaerobic bacteria were designed and evaluated for use in quantitative analysis of intestinal microflora. Optimum wash temperatures (T(w)) were determined according to the temperature of dissociation (T(d)) of each probe and target group specificity was demonstrated by comparing hybridisation to target and non-target rRNA immobilised on nylon membranes. Three probes are targeted to phylogenetic clusters of Clostridiaceae, clusters III, IV and IX, with three probes designed to target previously undefined clusters within the low %G+C Gram-positive phyla. The remaining three probes encompass the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides assemblage, the Bacillus-Lactobacillus-Streptococcus group and the Spirochaetaceae. Application of these probes, alongside available probes targeted to other intestinal bacterial groups, against rRNA extracted from equine colonic samples has provided the first quantitative data on the predominant bacterial populations inhabiting the equine large intestine. Results show the Spirochaetaceae, the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides assemblage, the Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides group, and 'Unknown cluster C' of the Clostridiaceae to be the largest populations in the equine gut, each comprising 10-30% of the total microflora in each horse sampled. Other detected notable populations were the Bacillus-Lactobacillus-Streptococcus group, Fibrobacter and 'Unknown cluster B', each comprising 1-10% of the total flora. Average coverage using the suite of probes described here exceeded 75% of the total microbial community.
TI  - Variations of bacterial populations in human feces measured by fluorescent in situ hybridization with group-specific 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  - Six 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes were designed, validated, and used to quantify predominant groups of anaerobic bacteria in human fecal samples. A set of two probes was specific for species of the Bacteroides fragilis group and the species Bacteroides distasonis. Two others were designed to detect species of the Clostridium histolyticum and the Clostridium lituseburense groups. Another probe was designed for the genera Streptococcus and Lactococcus, and the final probe was designed for the species of the Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group. The temperature of dissociation of each of the probes was determined. The specificities of the probes for a collection of target and reference organisms were tested by dot blot hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The new probes were used in initial FISH experiments to enumerate human fecal bacteria. The combination of the two Bacteroides-specific probes detected a mean of 5.4 x 10(10) cells per g (dry weight) of feces; the Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group-specific probe detected a mean of 7.2 x 10(10) cells per g (dry weight) of feces. The Clostridium histolyticum, Clostridium lituseburense, and Streptococcus-Lactococcus group-specific probes detected only numbers of cells ranging from 1 x 10(7) to 7 x 10(8) per g (dry weight) of feces. Three of the newly designed probes and three additional probes were used in further FISH experiments to study the fecal flora composition of nine volunteers over a period of 8 months. The combination of probes was able to detect at least two-thirds of the fecal flora. The normal biological variations within the fecal populations of the volunteers were determined and indicated that these variations should be considered when evaluating the effects of agents modulating the flora.
TI  - Analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  - A 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. The blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. The decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. The dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was Bifidobacterium sp., Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium lonqum, Lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation Bacteroides vulgatus, Veillonella parvula, Peptococcus magnus Bifidobacterium longum. In contrast, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides distasonis, B. ovatus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. Among microorganisms isolated from the patient, Morganella morganii, Candida sp., Eubacterium aerofacience and Eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; Streptococcus mitior, Staphylococcus intermedius, Micrococcus kristinae, Selenomonas ruminantum, Bacteroides ureolyticus and Lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. These results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of some intestinal bacteria on liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice.
AB  - Liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice was markedly promoted by association with a bacterial combination of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Clostridium paraputrificum. This study demonstrated that this promoting effect was suppressed by addition of certain intestinal bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Eubacterium rectale.
