TI  == food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  == the term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following  recent consumption of a particular food or drink. millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. the food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus, arcobacter, clostridium perfringens, cl. botulinum and bacillus cereus and helminths viz., taenia. they also include protozoa viz., trichinella, sarcocystis, toxoplasma gondii and cryptosporidium parvum. the zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. the viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. this along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. elisa, latex agglutination test, lateral flow assays, immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. polymerase chain reaction (pcr), multiplex pcr, immuno-pcr, realtime pcr, random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr, dna microarrays and probes are widely used. along with these lamp assays, capillary electrophoresis-single strand confirmation polymorphism (ce-sscp); flow cytometry, fish, biosensors, direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. with the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to haccp principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. all these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.

TI  == inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the  inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.

TI  == evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  == objectives: to prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. methods: an evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). the scoring procedure  was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. the zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. results: the following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli. a second group of "significant importance" included toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus, cryptosporidium parvum, mycobacterium bovis, echinococcus granulosus, streptococcus spp., echinococcus multilocularis, yersinia enterocolitica, mycobacterium avium, fasciola hepatica, giardia intestinalis, and rotavirus. conclusions: this methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. applications: these results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. they also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.

TI  == flagellar glycosylation in clostridium botulinum.
AB  == flagellins from clostridium botulinum were shown to be post-translationally modified with novel glycan moieties by top-down ms analysis of purified flagellin protein from strains of various toxin serotypes. detailed analyses of flagellin from two strains of c. botulinum demonstrated that the protein is modified by a novel glycan moiety of mass 417 da in o-linkage. bioinformatic analysis of available c. botulinum genomes identified a flagellar glycosylation island containing homologs of genes recently identified in campylobacter coli that have  been shown to be responsible for the biosynthesis of legionaminic acid derivatives. structural characterization of the carbohydrate moiety was completed utilizing both ms and nmr spectroscopy, and it was shown to be a novel legionaminic acid derivative, 7-acetamido-5-(n-methyl-glutam-4-yl)-amino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-d-glycero-alpha-d-g alacto-nonulosonic acid, (alphaleg5glunme7ac). electron transfer dissociation ms  with and without collision-activated dissociation was utilized to map seven sites of o-linked glycosylation, eliminating the need for chemical derivatization of tryptic peptides prior to analysis. marker ions for novel glycans, as well as a unique c-terminal flagellin peptide marker ion, were identified in a top-down analysis of the intact protein. these ions have the potential for use in for rapid detection and discrimination of c. botulinum cells, indicating botulinum neurotoxin contamination. this is the first report of glycosylation of gram-positive flagellar proteins by the 'sialic acid-like' nonulosonate sugar, legionaminic acid.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == enteric illness in ontario, canada, from 1997 to 2001.
AB  == enteric illness is a common problem worldwide. in ontario (population of 11.4 million, 2001 census of canada), laboratory-confirmed cases of "reportable" enteric diseases are reported to local health units. public health staff members  investigate these illnesses and subsequently report details to the ministry of health and long-term care through an electronic reporting system. from 1997 to 2001, 44,451 sporadic cases of illness attributable to eight enteric pathogens (campylobacter, salmonella, verotoxin-producing escherichia coli, yersinia, shigella, hepatitis a, listeria, and clostridium botulinum) were reported. this number was less than the 56,690 cases reported from 1992 to 1996. campylobacter accounted for the highest annual average incidence rate at 42.3 cases per 100,000 persons, with salmonella following at 22.6, verotoxin-producing e. coli at 3.7, yersinia at 3.0, shigella at 2.7, hepatitis a at 2.3, and listeria at 0.3. the 4  months from june to september accounted for almost half (46.5%) of all cases. for 74.0% of the outbreaks associated with these eight enteric pathogens, foodborne contamination was identified as the mode of transmission. poultry and other meat  items accounted for 68.4% of the food items when food was identified as the vehicle. admittedly, the "foods" and "modes of transmission" identified may have  been subject to investigator bias based on previous knowledge. the most common risk setting, which was reported in approximately half of the cases, was private  homes; travel-associated illness and restaurants were the second and third most frequently reported risk settings at 24.6 and 14.1%, respectively. findings from  this study suggest that public health efforts should be directed toward safe food handling in the home during the summer months.

TI  == bacteriological safety issues in red meat and ready-to-eat meat products, as well as control measures.
AB  == the importance of eschericha coli o157, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium dt104 as meat-borne pathogens is well established. pathogenic bacteria such as aeromonas spp., arcobacter spp., psychrotrophic bacillus cereus, campylobacter spp., clostridium botulinum and non-invasive listeria monocytogenes can be regarded as rookies, but not yet firmly associated with today's production of red meat and meat products. the development of pcr and other dna-based techniques will shed new light on so called emerging pathogens. important safety  issues in meat production, such as insufficient cleaning and disinfection (including the stable/lairage, processing environment), carcass decontamination and chilling, and cross contamination are discussed. furthermore, probability modelling of survival and growth is identified as an important way to achieve a better understanding of how to deal with the complexity of further processing, including heat treatment and storage.

TI  == foodborne diseases in kenya.
AB  == objectives: to determine the occurrence of foodborne disease outbreaks in kenya and the efforts employed to combat them. design: cross-sectional survey. setting: forty two districts in kenya between 1970 and 1993. study subjects: foodborne disease outbreak episodes due to staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens,  clostridium botulinum, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, listera monocytogenes, chemicals, aflatoxin, plant and animal poisons. outcome measures: number and aetiological causes of foodborne disease outbreaks reported in the study period. results: thirty seven food poisoning outbreaks were reported to the ministry of health from various parts of the country in the study period 1970 to 1993, and only 13 of these involving a total of 926 people were confirmed to be due to particular aetiological agents. foods that were involved included milk and milk products, meat and meat products, maize flour, bread, scones and other wheat products, vegetables and lemon pie pudding. a high number of food poisoning cases were treated as outpatients in various health facilities. conclusion: under-reporting, inadequate investigation  of outbreaks and inadequate diagnostic facilities suggest that foodborne disease  outbreaks are more than is recorded by the ministry of health.

TI  == produce handling and processing practices.
AB  == in the past decade, outbreaks of human illness associated with the consumption of raw vegetables and fruits (or unpasteurized products produced from them) have increased in the united states. changes in agronomic, harvesting, distribution, processing, and consumption patterns and practices have undoubtedly contributed to this increase. pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes, clostridium botulinum, and bacillus cereus are naturally present in some soil, and their presence on fresh produce is not rare. salmonella, escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae, parasites, and viruses are more likely to  contaminate fresh produce through vehicles such as raw or improperly composted manure, irrigation water containing untreated sewage, or contaminated wash water. contact with mammals, reptiles, fowl, insects, and unpasteurized products of animal origin offers another avenue through which pathogens can access produce. surfaces, including human hands, which come in contact with whole or cut produce  represent potential points of contamination throughout the total system of growing, harvesting, packing, processing, shipping, and preparing produce for consumption. treatment of produce with chlorinated water reduces populations of pathogenic and other microorganisms on fresh produce but cannot eliminate them. reduction of risk for human illness associated with raw produce can be better achieved through controlling points of potential contamination in the field; during harvesting; during processing or distribution; or in retail markets, food-service facilities, or the home.

TI  == probes and polymerase chain reaction for detection of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  == dna-hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) are techniques commonly used to detect pathogenic bacteria. in this paper, the use of these techniques for detection of salmonella, e. coli, v. cholerae, non-o1 vibrio, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and c. botulinum is reviewed with emphasis on application in food microbiology. in food control, dna-techniques have most often been used in a 'culture confirmation' fashion, i.e. bacteria are  enriched and sometimes even purified by traditional culture procedures and thereafter identified by the use of dna-based methods. the most desirable approach is, however, to detect organisms directly in the food, but major problems remain to be solved before this can be routinely performed.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  == egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of clostridium botulinum. we also found that the food spoilage thermophile clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme  and confirmed that the spoilage organisms bacillus stearothermophilus and clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. the results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by c. botulinum and l. monocytogenes.
