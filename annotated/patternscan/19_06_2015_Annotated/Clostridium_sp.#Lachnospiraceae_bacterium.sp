TI  == murimonas intestini gen. nov., sp. nov., an acetate-producing bacterium of the family lachnospiraceae isolated from the mouse gut.
AB  == three strains of an anaerobic, gram-stain-positive coccobacillus were isolated from the intestines of mice. these strains shared 100 % similarity in their 16s rrna gene sequences, but were distantly related to any described members of the family lachnospiraceae (<94 %). the most closely related species with names that  have standing in nomenclature were robinsoniella peoriensis, ruminococcus gnavus, blautia producta and clostridium xylanolyticum. phylogenetic relationships based  on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis were confirmed by partial sequencing of hsp60  genes. the use of an in-house database search pipeline revealed that the new isolates are most prevalent in bovine gut samples when compared with human and mouse samples for ruminococcus gnavus and b. producta. all three isolated strains shared similar cellular fatty acid patterns dominated by c16 : 0 methyl ester. differences in the proportions of c12 : 0 methyl ester, c14 : 0 methyl ester and  c18 : 1 cis-11 dimethyl acetal were observed when compared with phylogenetically  neighbouring species. the major short-chain fatty acid produced by strain srb-530-5-h(t) was acetic acid. this strain tested positive for utilization of d-fructose, d-galacturonic acid, d-malic acid, l-alanyl l-threonine and l-glutamic acid but was negative for utilization of amygdalin, arbutin, alpha-d-glucose, 3-methyl d-glucose and salicin, in contrast to the type strain of the closest related species robinsoniella peoriensis. the isolates were not able to use mannitol for growth. based on genotypic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, we propose to create the new genus and species murimonas intestini gen. nov., sp. nov. to accommodate the three strains srb-530-5-h(t) ( = dsm 26524(t) = ccug 63391(t)) (the type strain of murimonas intestini), srb-509-4-s-h ( = dsm 27577 = ccug 64595) and srb-524-4-s-h ( = dsm 27578 = ccug 64594).

TI  == mobilitalea sibirica gen. nov., sp. nov., a halotolerant polysaccharide-degrading bacterium.
AB  == a novel strictly anaerobic, halotolerant, organotrophic bacterium, strain p3m-3(t), was isolated from a microbial mat formed under the flow of hot water emerging from a 2775 m-deep well in tomsk region (western siberia, russia). cells of strain p3m-3(t) were straight and curved rods, 0.2-0.4 microm in width and 1.5-20 microm in length. strain p3m-3(t) grew optimally at 37 degrees c, ph 7.0-7.5 and in a nacl concentration of 15 g l(-1). under optimum growth conditions, the doubling time was 1 h. the isolate was able to ferment a variety  of mono-, di- and polysaccharides, including microcrystalline cellulose. acetate, ethanol, h2 and co2 were the main products of glucose fermentation. the dna g+c content was 33.4 mol%. 16s rrna gene-based phylogenetic analysis showed that strain p3m-3(t) was a member of family lachnospiraceae, whose representatives are also found in clostridium cluster xiva. 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with clostridium jejuense hy-35-12(t), the closest relative, was 93.9%. a novel genus  and species, mobilitalea sibirica gen. nov., sp. nov., are proposed based on phylogenetic analysis and physiological properties of the novel isolate. the type strain of the type species is p3m-3(t) ( = dsm 26468(t) = vkm b-2804(t)).

TI  == fusicatenibacter saccharivorans gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == three gram-stain-positive, obligately anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, spindle-shaped bacterial strains (ht03-11(t), ko-38 and tt-111), isolated from human faeces were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that the strains were highly related  to each other genetically (displaying >99 % sequence similarity) and represented  a previously unknown subline within the blautia coccoides rrna group of organisms (cluster xiva). the closest phylogenetic neighbours of strain ht03-11(t) were clostridium bolteae wal 16351(t) (93.7 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity) and clostridium saccharolyticum wm1(t) (93.7 % similarity). all isolates produced lactic acid, formic acid, acetic acid and succinic acid as fermentation end products from glucose. their chemotaxonomic properties included lysine as the cell wall diamino acid and c16 : 0, c18 : 1omega7c dma and c16 : 0 dma as the major fatty acids. the g+c contents of the genomic dna were 46.9-47.2 mol% (hplc). several phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics could be readily used to differentiate the isolates from phylogenetically related clostridia. therefore, strains ht03-11(t), ko-38 and tt-111 represent a novel species in a new genus of the family lachnospiraceae, for which the name fusicatenibacter saccharivorans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain of the type species is ht03-11(t) ( = yit 12554(t) = jcm 18507(t) = dsm 26062(t)).

TI  == acetatifactor muris gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel bacterium isolated from the intestine of an obese mouse.
AB  == we used selective agar media for culturing bacteria from the caecum of mice fed a high calorie diet. in addition to the isolation of enterobacteriaceae growing on  a medium containing cholesterol and bile salts, we focused on the characterization of strain ct-m2(t), which, based on 16s rdna analysis, did not appear to correspond to any currently described organisms. the isolate belongs to the clostridium cluster xiv and is most closely related to members of the lachnospiraceae, including the genera anaerostipes, blautia, butyrivibrio, clostridium, coprococcus, eubacterium, robinsoniella, roseburia, ruminococcus and syntrophococcus (</=90 % similarity). strain ct-m2(t) is a non-motile gram-positive rod that does not form spores and has a g + c content of dna of 48.5 %. cells grow under strictly anoxic conditions (100 % n(2)) and produce acetate and butyrate after growth in reduced wca broth. in contrast to related species, the new bacterium does not metabolize glucose and is positive for phenylalanine arylamidase, and its major cellular fatty acid is c(1)(4):(0). based on phylogenetic and phenotypic studies, the isolate merits recognition as a member of a novel genus and species, for which the name acetatifactor muris is proposed. the type strain is ct-m2(t) (= dsm 23669(t) = atcc baa-2170(t)).
