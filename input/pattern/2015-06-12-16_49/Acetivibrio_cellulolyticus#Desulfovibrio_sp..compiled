TI  - Conversion of Cellulose to Methane and Carbon Dioxide by Triculture of Acetivibrio cellulolyticus, Desulfovibrio sp., and Methanosarcina barkeri.
AB  - The fermentation of cellulose by monocultures of Acetivibrio cellulolyticus and cocultures of A. cellulolyticus-Methanosarcina barkeri, A. cellulolyticus-Desulfovibrio sp., and A. cellulolyticus-M. barkeri-Desulfovibrio sp. was studied. The monoculture produced ethanol, acetate, H(2), and CO(2). More acetate and less ethanol was formed by the cocultures than by the monoculture. Acetate was utilized by M. barkeri in coculture with A. cellulolyticus after a lag period, whereas ethanol was metabolized by the sulfate reducer only under conditions of low H(2) partial pressure, i.e., when cocultured with A. celluloyticus-M. barkeri or when grown together with the methanogen. Only the three-component culture carried out the rapid conversion of cellulose to CO(2) and methane. Furthermore, this culture hydrolyzed the most cellulose-85% of that initially present. This amount was increased to 90% by increasing the population of M. barkeri in the triculture. Methane production was also increased, and a quicker fermentation rate was achieved.
