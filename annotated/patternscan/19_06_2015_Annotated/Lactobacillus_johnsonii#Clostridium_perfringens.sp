TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == application of lactobacillus johnsonii expressing phage endolysin for control of  clostridium perfringens.
AB  == clostridium perfringens is frequently found in food and the environment and produces potent toxins that have a negative impact on both human and animal health and particularly on the poultry industry. lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785,  isolated from the chicken gastrointestinal tract, has been demonstrated to exclude cl. perfringens in poultry. we have investigated the interaction of wild-type lact. johnsonii fi9785 or an engineered strain expressing a cell wall-hydrolysing endolysin with cl. perfringens in vitro, using a batch culture designed to simulate human gastrointestinal tract conditions. co-culture experiments indicated that acid production by lact. johnsonii is important in pathogen control. the co-culture of the endolysin-secreting lact. johnsonii with  cl. perfringens showed that the engineered strain had the potential to control the pathogen, but the ability to reduce cl. perfringens numbers was not consistent. results obtained indicate that survival of high numbers of lact. johnsonii will be essential for effective pathogen control. significance and impact of the study: the bacterium lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 reduces numbers of the pathogen clostridium perfringens in vitro. biocontrol was improved by engineering the strain to produce and export a cell wall-hydrolysing endolysin, but good survival of the producer strain is essential. the production of bacteriophage endolysins by commensal bacteria has the potential to improve competitive exclusion of pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == structure and biosynthesis of two exopolysaccharides produced by lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785.
AB  == exopolysaccharides were isolated and purified from lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785, which has previously been shown to act as a competitive exclusion agent to control clostridium perfringens in poultry. structural analysis by nmr spectroscopy revealed that l. johnsonii fi9785 can produce two types of exopolysaccharide: eps-1 is a branched dextran with the unusual feature that every backbone residue is substituted with a 2-linked glucose unit, and eps-2 was shown to have a repeating unit with the following structure: -6)-alpha-glcp-(1-3)-beta-glcp-(1-5)-beta-galf-(1-6)-alpha-glcp-(1-4)-beta-galp-( 1-4)-beta-glcp-(1-. sites on both polysaccharides were partially occupied by substituent groups: 1-phosphoglycerol and o-acetyl groups in eps-1 and a single o-acetyl group in eps-2. analysis of a deletion mutant (deltaepse) lacking the putative priming glycosyltransferase gene located within a predicted eps gene cluster revealed that the mutant could produce eps-1 but not eps-2, indicating that epse is essential for the biosynthesis of eps-2. atomic force microscopy confirmed the localization of galactose residues on the exterior of wild type cells and their absence in the deltaepse mutant. eps2 was found to adopt a random coil structural conformation. deletion of the entire 14-kb eps cluster resulted in an acapsular mutant phenotype that was not able to produce either eps-2 or eps-1. alterations in the cell surface properties of the eps-specific mutants were demonstrated by differences in binding of an anti-wild type l. johnsonii antibody. these findings provide insights into the biosynthesis and structures of novel exopolysaccharides produced by l. johnsonii fi9785, which are likely to play an important role in biofilm formation, protection against harsh environment of the gut, and colonization of the host.

TI  == expression and delivery of an endolysin to combat clostridium perfringens.
AB  == clostridium perfringens is a cause for increasing concern due to its responsibility for severe infections both in humans and animals, especially poultry. to find new control strategies to treat c. perfringens infection, we investigated the activity and delivery of a bacteriophage endolysin. we identified a new endolysin, designated cp25l, which shows similarity to an n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase domain and is distinct from other c. perfringens endolysins whose activity has been demonstrated in vitro. the cp25l gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the gene product demonstrated lytic activity against all 25 c. perfringens strains tested. the probiotic strain lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 was engineered to deliver the endolysin to the gastrointestinal tract. the integration of the nisrk two-component regulatory system from the lactococcus lactis nisin a biosynthesis  operon into the chromosome of l. johnsonii allowed constitutive expression of the endolysin under the control of the nisa promoter (p nisa ), while the use of a signal peptide (slpmod) led to successful secretion of the active endolysin to the surrounding media. the high specificity and activity of the endolysin suggest that it may be developed as an effective tool to enhance the control of c. perfringens by l. johnsonii in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == the effect of a bacillus-based direct-fed microbial supplemented to sows on the gastrointestinal microbiota of their neonatal piglets.
AB  == direct-fed microbials (dfm) supplemented in sow diets may confer health benefits  to the host and their piglets by reducing pathogens in the sow and environment. in this study we evaluated the effect of a bacillus-based dfm on the gastrointestinal microbiota of neonatal piglets. a total of 208 sows were divided into 2 treatments: a control diet and the control diet supplemented with a bacillus subtilis-based dfm (3.75 x 10(5) cfu/g feed). twenty-one piglets sampled from each sow treatment group were euthanized on d 3 of lactation followed by an  additional 15 piglets per treatment on d 10 of lactation. litters from dfm-supplemented sows had greater (p = 0.02) weaning weights and a tendency (p =  0.09) for improvement in litter adg. sows supplemented with the dfm weaned more pigs (p = 0.06) than control sows which was reflected in numerically lower but not statistically different (p = 0.12) decrease in piglet mortality in dfm litters. terminal rflp was used to characterize gastrointestinal (gi) microbial populations in the ileum and colon of the piglets. terminal restriction fragments (t-rf) were compared between control and dfm treatments. there was a greater incidence and quantity of t-rf b423 and h330 (binary p = 0.01, 0.08; quantitative p = 0.01, 0.05, respectively), putatively identified as lactobacillus gasseri/johnsonii, in the ileum of pigs nursing sows supplemented with dfm at d 3. terminal restriction fragment peaks b423 and h330 were also greater (binary p  = 0.01, 0.08; quantitative p = 0.01, 0.01, respectively) in the colon of pigs nursing sows supplemented with dfm at d 3. peaks m495 and b394, putatively identified as e. coli, were greater (binary p = 0.01, 0.04; quantitative p = 0.01, 0.01, respectively) in the colon of the control pigs at d 3. at d 10, both  the presence and quantity of lactobacillus species were greater (p < 0.05) in the colon of pigs with the dfm treatment. additionally, there was a tendency for t-rf b227 and h257 (binary p = 0.07, 0.07, respectively), putatively identified as clostridium perfringens, to be present in the ileum of the control pigs at d 10 compared with treated pigs. results of this study reveal that the developing gastrointestinal microbiota of a neonatal piglet can be affected by dfm supplementation to the sow.

TI  == comparison of alternatives to in-feed antimicrobials for the prevention of clinical necrotic enteritis.
AB  == aims: the capacity for lactobacillus johnsonii and an organic acid (oa) blend to  prevent clostridium perfringens-induced clinical necrotic enteritis (ne) in chickens was studied. methods and results: cobb 500 birds were allocated into six groups (n = 25 birds/pen, eight pens/treatment); unchallenged, challenged, antimicrobial (zinc bacitracin (znb)/monensin), oa, probiotic lact. johnsonii and probiotic sham (phosphate-buffered saline). all birds were challenged with eimeria spp. and cl. perfringens except for unchallenged controls. birds fed antimicrobials were protected from ne development as indicated by maintenance of  body weight, low mortality and clostridium levels, and decreased intestinal macroscopic lesion scores compared to challenged controls (p < 0.05). lactobacillus johnsonii-fed birds had reduced lesion scores, whilst oa-fed birds  had decreased cl. perfringens levels. both lact. johnsonii and oa-fed birds had improved feed efficiency between days 0 and 28 compared to challenged controls; however, mortality and body weights were not improved by either treatment. microbial profiling indicated that the challenge procedure significantly altered  the jejunal microbiota. the microbiota of antimicrobial-fed birds was significantly different from all other groups. conclusions: whilst lact. johnsonii and oa altered specific intestinal parameters, significant protection against ne was not observed. significance and impact of the study: lactobacillus  johnsonii and oa did not prevent ne; however, some improvements were evident. other related treatments, or combinations of these two treatments, may provide greater protection.

TI  == in vivo characterization of lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 for use as a defined competitive exclusion agent against bacterial pathogens in poultry.
AB  == aims: to test the efficacy of lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 in reducing the colonization and shedding of salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis, escherichia coli o78:k80 and clostridium perfringens in poultry. methods and results: specific pathogen-free chicks (1 day old) were dosed with a single oral  inoculum of 1x10(9) cfu. lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 and 24 h later were challenged in separate experiments with s. enteritidis (s1400, nalr) and e. coli  o78:k80 (ec34195, nalr). there were no significant effects against s. enteritidis whereas colonization of the small intestine by e. coli o78:k80 was reduced significantly. both s. enteritidis and e. coli colonized the caeca and colon to levels equivalent to control birds and there was no reduction in shedding as assessed by a semi-quantitative cloacal swabbing technique. specific pathogen-free chicks (20 day old) were dosed with a single oral inoculum of 1x10(9) cfu l. johnsonii fi9785 and 24 h later were challenged with c. perfringens. a single oral dose of l. johnsonii fi9785 was sufficient to suppress all aspects of colonization and persistence of c. perfringens. conclusions: lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 may be given to poultry for use as a competitive exclusion agent to control c. perfringens. significance and impact of the study:  lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 may be a valuable tool to control the endemic disease of necrotic enteritis, thereby reducing economic losses associated with reduced use of antimicrobials in the poultry industry.

TI  == characterisation and selection of probiotic lactobacilli for a preliminary minipig feeding trial and their effect on serum cholesterol levels, faeces ph and faeces moisture content.
AB  == three out of 297 lactobacillus strains isolated from pig faeces were selected for a feeding trial on account of their high bile-salt hydrolase (bsh) activity, bile-salt resistance, low ph tolerance and the production of antimicrobial substances. two strains were identified as lactobacillus johnsonii and one as lactobacillus reuteri by dna-dna hybridisation. l. johnsoniii bfe 1061 produced a bacteriocin active against a range of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and nonrelated bacteria including clostridium perfringens. six minipigs were maintained on a high-fat, high-cholesterol ('western style') diet for 17 weeks after which the diet was supplemented with the 'probiotic mixture' containing the above mentioned three lactobacillus strains at 2 x 10(12) cfu per pig per day for five weeks. the mixture was given as a resuspended lyophilisate. during a two week follow-up period the minipigs received only the 'western-style' diet without probiotic supplementation. a lowering effect on serum cholesterol levels was indicated after three weeks probiotic feeding, concomitant with an increase in the moisture content of the faeces and lactobacillus cell numbers. triglycerides, ph and number of lactic acid bacteria in faeces were not significantly influenced by probiotic supplementation.
