TI  == management of human and animal bite wound infection: an overview.
AB  == animal and human bite wounds can lead to serious infections. the organisms recovered generally originate from the biter's oral cavity and the victim's skin  flora. anaerobes were isolated from more than two thirds of human and animal bite infections. streptococcus pyogenes is often recovered in human bites, pasteurella multocida in animal bites, eikenella corrodens in animal and human, capnocytophaga spp, neisseria weaveri, weeksella zoohelcum, neisseria canis, staphylococcus intermedius, nonoxidizer-1, and eugonic oxidizer-2 in dog, flavobacterium group in pig, and actinobacillus spp in horse and sheep bites. vibrio spp, plesiomonas shigelloides, aeromonas hydrophila, and pseudomonas spp can cause infections in bites associated with marine settings. in addition to local wound infection, complications include lymphangitis, local abscess, septic  arthritis, tenosynovitis, and osteomyelitis. uncommon complications include endocarditis, meningitis, brain abscess, and sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation especially in immunocompromised individuals. wound management includes administering local care and using proper antimicrobial therapy when needed.

TI  == causative microorganisms in surgically treated pediatric hand infections.
AB  == purpose: the causative organisms in many pediatric musculoskeletal infections are distinct from their adult counterparts. we investigated the organisms found in surgically treated hand infections in the pediatric population. methods: we reviewed the hospital charts and computer records of all patients who had surgical intervention for infections of the forearm, wrist, and hand from 1996 through 2002 at the children's hospital of boston. results: thirty-eight surgical procedures were performed on 31 children for 32 different upper-extremity infections. one patient was treated for 2 separate infections. in the 32 primary  procedures 7 cultures grew mixed aerobic/anaerobic organisms, 19 grew aerobic organisms only, 6 grew no organisms, and 2 patients had no cultures. one culture  from a secondary surgery was positive for candida parapsilosis. staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 15 of the primary cases and was the primary organism in 12. five of 7 mixed infections were associated with paronychia; 2 of the paronychial infections were complicated by flexor tenosynovitis. chronic nail biting caused 2 infections and 1 was associated with thumb sucking. conclusions:  in the adult population s aureus is the primary organism cultured in 50% to 80% of cases and anaerobic or mixed infection may occur in upward of 29% of patients. in this series s aureus was the primary organism in only 37%. group a streptococcus pyogenes was present in 20% of cases. the percentage of children with a mixed aerobic/anaerobic infection was similar to that found in adults; however, the presumed route of introduction was digital sucking/biting. based on  the number of anaerobic/mixed infections without predisposing factors we recommend a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen including anaerobic coverage as the initial antibiotic in the setting of pediatric hand infections.

TI  == acute disseminated encephalomyelitis following pleural empyema owing to boerhaave's syndrome.
AB  == acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is reported in a 14-year-old male patient associated with a pleural empyema caused by an esophageal perforation. during the hospital course, the patient experienced an episode of cardiac arrest, raising the question of hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury, but the magnetic resonance imaging (mri) findings and clinical course were most consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. after a course of methylprednisolone, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and bilateral chest tube placement, the patient recovered with only mild residual deficits, along with resolution of his mri findings.

TI  == [clinical significance of the streptococcus milleri group in peritonsillar abscesses].
AB  == few researchers have microbiologically studied peritonsillar abscesses in detail, and their results have been conflicting. although streptococcus pyogenes (group a beta-streptococcus) is commonly considered an important pathogen in this infection, recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of many other streptococci mainly consisting of alpha-streptococci. few studies have identified these streptococci at the species level, however. we studied details of bacteriology in 31 cases of peritonsillar abscess treated between 1991 and 2000.  the streptococcus milleri group was most frequently isolated (25.8%), followed by eikenella corrodens (9.7%), staphylococcus aureus (6.5%), and s. pyogenes (3.2%). the s. milleri group, consisting of 3 species of streptococcus constellatus, s. intermedius, and s. anginosus, forms part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract. these species have become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease but little attention has been paid to their role in peritonsillar abscesses. to adequately culture the s. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic condition is required, and then the differentiation of the 3 species requires the biochemical reactivity tests. since hemolytic patterns of the s. milleri group vary, we studied the population of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hemolytic strains among 36 strains of this group. we found 32 (88.8%) to be alpha-hemolytic. although not all alpha-hemolytic strains belong to the s. milleri group, a considerable number of this group could be missed among alpha-streptococci isolated from the peritonsillar abscess. as antibiotics began  being used widely, normal flora such as the s. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in peritonsillar abscesses due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.

TI  == [various new pathogens in pneumonia].
AB  == the table summarizes the many newly recognized agents causing lower respiratory tract infections: gram + cocci, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococci; gram-rods, acinetobacter, aeromonas hydrophila, eikenella corrodens; mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to multiple drugs, intracellular organisms and viruses. some details are given in four chapters: pneumococci resistant to penicillin g which must be detected and impose new therapeutic strategies; chlamydia pneumoniae with its difficulties for the diagnosis and the absence of standardized therapeutic trials; streptococcus pyogenes with a recrudescence of severe and invasive infections, tss and virulence factors; the pulmonary hantavirus syndrome with 105 patients recognized (mortality 52%) in the usa and canada, the homeland of the deermouse (peromiscus maniculatus).

TI  == cross-reactivity between human sialyl lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  == the expression of sialy-lewis(x) (sle(x); neu5ac alpha 2-3 gal beta 1-4) (fuc alpha 1-3) glcnac-r) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sle(x) monoclonal antibody snh-3 (mab snh-3; igm class). mab snh-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus pyogenes, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas gingivalis. the negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sle(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. we propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sle(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events  leading to infective endocarditis.

TI  == management of maxillofacial infections: a review of 50 cases.
AB  == maxillofacial infections often place the oral and maxillofacial surgeon in situations where timely decisions have to be made. these decisions can be life-saving. this study reviews 50 infections treated over a 3-year period. the results reveal rapid resolution of the infections by adhering to fundamental principles in their management: recognition of airway compromise, surgical intervention, and the administration of the appropriate antibiotic. a protocol for the management of maxillofacial infections is described.
