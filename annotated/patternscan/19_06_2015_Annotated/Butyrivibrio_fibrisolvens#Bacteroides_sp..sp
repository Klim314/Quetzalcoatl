TI  == detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  == a fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with f. succinogenes. consortium-bacterial members were determined by dgge and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16s rdna. an artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 f. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. after consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with f. succinogenes. dgge exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the f. succinogenes group. sequencing suggested that butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, clostridium sp., f. succinogenes group 2, prevotella  ruminicola and unclassified bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium  and that treponema bryantii, b. fibrisolvens, acinetobacter sp, and wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. however, in the group 3 consortium, f. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic ruminococcus albus and f. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. this study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.

TI  == a new type of glutamine synthetase in cyanobacteria: the protein encoded by the glnn gene supports nitrogen assimilation in synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803.
AB  == a new glutamine synthetase gene, glnn, which encodes a polypeptide of 724 amino acid residues (m(r), 79,416), has been identified in the unicellular cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803; this is the second gene that encodes a glutamine synthetase (gs) in this cyanobacterium. the functionality of  this gene was evidenced by its ability to complement an escherichia coli glna mutant and to support synechocystis growth in a strain whose glna gene was inactivated by insertional mutagenesis. in this mutant (strain sjcr3), as well as in the wild-type strain, the second gs activity was subject to regulation by the  nitrogen source, being strongly enhanced in nitrogen-free medium. transcriptional fusion of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene with the 5'-upstream region of glnn suggested that synthesis of the second synechocystis gs is regulated at the transcriptional level. furthermore, the level of glnn mrna, a transcript of about 2,300 bases, was found to be strongly increased in nitrogen-free medium. the glnn product is similar to the gs subunits of bacteroides fragilis and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, two obligate anaerobic bacteria whose gss are markedly different from other prokaryotic and eukaryotic gss. however, significant similarity is evident in the five regions which are homologous in all of the gss so far described. the new gs gene was also found in  other cyanobacteria but not in n2-fixing filamentous species.

TI  == alpha-ketoglutarate metabolism by cytochrome-containing anaerobes.
AB  == during growth in the presence of tracer amounts of exogenously supplied alpha-keto[1-14c]glutarate (akg) or alpha-keto [5-14c]glutarate, cytochrome-containing bacteroides fragilis strain 2044 and bacteroides vulgatus strain 8482 incorporated extremely small amounts of radioactivity into cell macromolecules and protoheme. under identical conditions, bacteroides "l" strain  7cm and bacteroides buccae strain j1 incorporated substantial label from [5-14c]akg, but not [1-14c]akg, into cellular macromolecules and protoheme. bacteroides succinogenes strain s85 incorporated radioactivity from both [1-14c]akg and [5-14c]akg into cell macromolecules, but only label from [5-14c]akg appeared in protoheme. selenomonas ruminantium strain hd1 and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strain d1, both of which are devoid of cytochromes, incorporated substantial label from both [1-14c]akg and [5-14c]akg into cell macromolecules, but failed to incorporate label from either position into protoheme. bacteroides ruminicola sp. brevis strain ga33 incorporated label from  both [1-14c]akg and [5-14c]akg into both cell macromolecules and protoheme. a substantial portion of the heme synthesized by this organism may be formed by the "plant" pathway involving the intact use of the akg carbon skeleton. major differences exist in the manner and extent of akg utilization among cytochrome-containing anaerobes and between these organisms and bacteria devoid of cytochromes obtained from similar environments.

TI  == fermentation of isolated pectin and pectin from intact forages by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
AB  == studies on the rate and extent of galacturonic acid and isolated pectin digestion were carried out with nine strains of rumen bacteria (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h10b and d16f, bacteroides ruminicola 23 and d31d, lachnospira multiparus d15d, peptostreptococcus sp. d43e, b. succinogenes a3c, ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b, and r. albus 7). only three strains, 23, d16f, and d31d, utilized galacturonic acid as a sole energy source, whereas all strains except a3c and h10b degraded (solubilized) and utilized purified pectin. nutrient composition of the basal medium and separate sterilization of the substrate affected the rate and extent of fermentation for both substrates. pectin degradation and utilization were measured with two maturity stages each of intact bromegrass and alfalfa. for bromegrass i, all strains tested (b34b, 23, d16f, d31d, d15d, and d43e) degraded  a considerable amount of pectin and, with the exception of b34b, utilized most of what was degraded. similar, but lower, results were obtained with bromegrass ii,  except for the two strains of b. ruminicola, 23 and d31d, which were unable to degrade and utilize pectin from this forage. all strains were able to degrade and utilize pectin from both maturity stages of alfalfa; however, values were considerably lower for strains 23 and d31d. synergism studies, in which a limited utilizing strain, b34b, was combined with the limited degrading strain, d31d, resulted in a slight increase in degradation and a very marked increase in utilization of the pectin in all four forages. similar results were obtained on both alfalfa substrates with a combination of strains b34b and d16f; however, no  increases were observed with this combination on bromegrass.

TI  == oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at po(2) levels greater than 0.5%. species that were found to be strict anaerobes were treponema macrodentium, treponema denticola, treponema oralis n. sp., clostridium haemolyticum, selenomonas ruminatium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and lachnospira multiparus. moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. the moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. species considered as moderate anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, fusobacteria nucleatum, clostridium novyi type a, and peptostreptococcus elsdenii. the recognition of at  least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
