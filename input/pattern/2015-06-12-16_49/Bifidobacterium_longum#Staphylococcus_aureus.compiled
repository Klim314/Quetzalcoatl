TI  - Intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: A systematic review.
AB  - Evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. Although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. Therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. Twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. In the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of Firmicutes; a higher count of Bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, and Lactobacillus. In the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of Bacteroides; a lower count of Akkermansia muciniphila, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Clostridium; a higher prevalence of B. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of B. catenulatum and Staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.
TI  - Cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions; hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. Combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. We investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected enteric pathogens. METHODS: Probiotic cultures were inoculated into MRS broth adjusted to pH 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees C. Survivors of pH 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees C. Cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh MRS broth and incubated at 55 degrees C for 2 h. The cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. The adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. The combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: Acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. Viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium longum LMG 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. However, for B. longum Bb46 and B. bifidum LMG 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. A cocktail containing L. plantarum + B. longum Bb46 + B. longum LMG 13197 best inhibited S. aureus while E. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing L. acidophilus La14 150B + B. longum Bb46 + B. bifidum LMG 11041. A cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. CONCLUSION: Multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial efficacies of the combination of bovine lactoferrin or  its hydrolysate with probiotic secretion in curbing the growth of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The occurrence of multidrug-resistant or meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become an important issue in clinics. This study evaluated a combinatorial treatment approach by using the well-documented antibacterial protein apo-bovine lactoferrin (apo-bLf) or its hydrolysate and specific probiotic supernatants for controlling MRSA infection. Clinical MRSA strains were isolated from different patient specimens. Apo-bLf-hydrolysate possessed stronger anti-MRSA activity than complete bLf in that it inhibited the growth of most MRSA strains tested in vitro. Otherwise, the supernatants produced by Lactobacillus fermentum (ATCC 11739), Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (ATCC 15707) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BCRC 17394) inhibited the growth of various MRSA strains. Further, L. fermentum or B. animalis subsp. lactis supernatant plus apo-bLf or bLf-hydrolysate led to partially synergistic to synergistic growth-inhibitory activity against MRSA strains. However, L. fermentum and not B. animalis subsp. lactis or B. longum subsp. longum was observed to resist the antibacterial activity of both apo-Lf and bLf-hydrolysate. Therefore, it is suggested that L. fermentum could be the best candidate to be used with apo-bLf or bLf-hydrolysate as a live supplement against MRSA infections.
TI  - Probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing conditioned pathogens in ascites.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the benefits of probiotics treatment in septic rats. METHODS: The septic rats were induced by cecal ligation and puncture. The animals of control, septic model and probiotics treated groups were treated with vehicle and mixed probiotics, respectively. The mixture of probiotics included Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. We observed the survival of septic rats using different amounts of mixed probiotics. We also detected the bacterial population in ascites and blood of experimental sepsis using cultivation and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The severity of mucosal inflammation in colonic tissues was determined. RESULTS: Probiotics treatment improved survival of the rats significantly and this effect was dose dependent. The survival rate was 30% for vehicle-treated septic model group. However, 1 and 1/4 doses of probiotics treatment increased survival rate significantly compared with septic model group (80% and 55% vs 30%, P < 0.05). The total viable counts of bacteria in ascites decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (5.20 +/- 0.57 vs 9.81 +/- 0.67, P < 0.05). The total positive rate of hemoculture decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (33.3% vs 100.0%, P < 0.05). The population of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in ascites of probiotics treated group were decreased significantly compared with that of septic model group (3.93 +/- 0.73 vs 8.80 +/- 0.83, P < 0.05; 2.80 +/- 1.04 vs 5.39 +/- 1.21, P < 0.05). With probiotics treatment, there was a decrease in the scores of inflammatory cell infiltration into the intestinal mucosa in septic animals (1.50 +/- 0.25 vs 2.88 +/- 0.14, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus may be primary pathogens in septic rats. Probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing these conditioned pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLf), but the results are inconsistent. Moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-bLf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield bLf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-bLf. However, whether bLf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. Therefore, various probiotic strains in Taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate in vitro. Thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741, Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707, and Bifidobacterium lactis BCRC 17394 were inhibited by both apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate. The growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, including L. rhamnosus ATCC 7469, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 23272, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 11739, Lactobacillus coryniformis ATCC 25602, L. acidophilus BCRC 14065, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521, and Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8081. However, apo-bLf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the supernatants produced by L. fermentum, B. lactis, and B. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. Importantly, a combination of apo-bLf or bLf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. In conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-bLf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antibacterial activities and anti-inflammatory effects of  Bifidobacterium spp. addressing acne vulgaris.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effect of Bifidobacterium spp. In the first part of the study, the antibacterial activities of live and sonicated cells, from a total of 23 Bifidobacterium species, on the growth of 5 different strain of Staphylococcus aureus. Six strains, of sonicated Bifidobacterium, exhibited antibacterial activity against staphylococci samples, and seven Bifidobacterium strains exhibited antibacterial activity on the growth of S. aureus S.P.-N2. In the second part of the study, we tested the antimicrobial activity, of Bifidobacterium against Propionibacterium acne KCTC3320, using the co-culture method. The loss of P. acnes viability, caused by B. adolescentis SPM0308 and B. longum SPM1207, was 84% and 75%, respectively (*p < 0.05). In the third part of the study, the anti-inflammatory activity of B. adolescentis SPM0308 and B. longum SPM1207 were assessed; nitric oxide (NO), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), production were tested using the murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line. Treatment of RAW 264.7 cells, with Bifidobacterium, decreased production of NO and TNF-alpha rather than LPS (100 ng/mL) treatment. The results suggest that B. adolescentis SPM0308 could be used as an effective control for P. acnes KCTC3320, and S. aureus, and reduce the risk of acne vulgaris development. We suggest that B. adolescentis SPM0308 may be a useful probiotic microorganism, for prevention of acne vulgaris, without adverse effects.
TI  - Effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. Eight probiotic strains, Bifidobacterium longum B6, Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH, Lactobacillus brevis KACC 10553, Lactobacillus casei KACC 12413, Lactobacillus paracasei ATCC 25598, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Leuconostoc mesenteroides KACC 12312, and Pediococcus acidilactici KACC 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. The ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. The antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. L. acidophilus, L. brevis, and P. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. P. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mM to the detection limits, respectively. The antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. The study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.
TI  - Antagonistic Action of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria in Relation to Staphylococcus aureus and Their Influence on the Immune Response in Cases of Intravaginal Staphylococcosis in Mice.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280, Lact. acidophilus IMV B-7279, Bifidobacterium longum VK1, and B. bifidum VK2 strains or their various compositions in relation to Staphylococcus aureus in vitro and on models of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice was determined. It was found that under the influence of these strains and their various compositions, the in vitro growth of Staph. aureus was inhibited, and the number of colonies of Staph. aureus plated from the vagina of infected mice was significantly reduced. The antibacterial activity of these strains separately and in compositions correlated with their ability to improve the performance of the immune response. These strains were the most effective in the following compositions: Lact. casei IMV B-7280-B. longum VK1-B. bifidum VK2. Strains of Lact. casei IMV B-7280, Lact. acidophilus IMV B-7279, B. bifidum VK2, and B. longum VK1 are prospective components of future probiotic drugs efficient in treating staphylococcosis and for immunity correction.
TI  - Effects of probiotic fermentation on the enhancement of biological and pharmacological activities of Codonopsis lanceolata extracted by high pressure treatment.
AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the enhancement of antioxidant, antimicrobial, enzymatic, cytotoxic, and cognitive activities of Codonopsis lanceolata extracted by high pressure treatment followed by probiotic fermentation. Dried C. lanceolata samples were subjected to 400 MPa for 20 min and then fermented with Bifidobacterium longum B6 (HPE-BLF) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (HPE-LRF) at 37 degrees C for 7 days. Compared to conventional extraction (CE-NF, 6.69 mg GAE/g), the phenol amounts of HPE-BLF and HPE-LRF were significantly increased to more than 8 mg GAE/g, while the lowest flavonoid contents were observed for HPE-BLF (0.44 mg RE/mL) and HPE-LRF (0.45 mg RE/mL) (p<0.05). Cinnamic acid was the most abundant phenolic acid in the fermented C. lanceolata. The highest DPPH scavenging activities were observed for HPE-BLF and HPE-LRF, with minimum EC(50) values of 1.26 and 1.18 mg/mL, respectively. The HPE-BLF and HPE-LRF samples exhibited the most noticeable antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Shigella boydii (MICs<15 mg/mL). The fermented C. lanceolata samples effectively inhibited alpha-glucosidase and tyrosinase activities and potentially improved a scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice. The application of a fermentation process can effectively improve the biological and pharmacological activities of high-pressure-extracted C. lanceolata by increasing the extraction efficacy and inducing probiotic conversion. The results suggest that the combined treatment of HPE and a fermentation process could be used as alternative extraction method over CE.
TI  - Enhancement of antimicrobial and antimutagenic activities of Korean barberry (Berberis koreana Palib.) by the combined process of high-pressure extraction with probiotic fermentation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the combined effects of high pressure extraction (HPE) and probiotic fermentation on the antimicrobial and antimutagenic activities, Berberis koreana was subjected to 500 MPa for 30 min and then fermented with Bifidobacterium longum B6 (HPE-BLF) and Lactobacillus paracasei (HPE-LPF) at 37 degrees C for 6 days. RESULTS: The phenol content was significantly increased to 228 mg GAE g(-1) by the HPE compared to the conventional extraction (CE, 188 mg GAE g(-1)). The HPE-BLF and HPE-LPF showed the highest antimicrobial activity (MIC < 4 mg mL(-1)) against beta-lactam antibiotic sensitive and resistant Staphylococcus aureus. No significant mutagenic effect was observed for CE, HPE, HPE-BLF, and HPE-LPF extracts. The highest antimutagenic activities against frame-shift mutant Salmonella typhimurium were observed at the HPE-LPF (82%), followed by the HPE-BLF (77%). CONCLUSION: The combined HPE and fermentation process could be used as an alternative extraction method for improving the extraction efficacy of medicinal plants. The results will provide pharmaceutically useful information and potential direction for finding new drug sources from medicinal plants.
TI  - Combined effects of probiotic fermentation and high-pressure extraction on the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antimutagenic activities of deodeok (Codonopsis lanceolata).
AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the combined effects of probiotic fermentation and high-pressure extraction (HPE) on the functional properties of Codonopsis lanceolata. The ground C. lanceolata samples were anaerobically fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH, Bifidobacterium longum B6, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, or Lactobacillus paracasei at 37 degrees C for 10 days and subjected to 500 MPa at 50 degrees C for 30 min. The extraction yields of C. lanceolata samples were noticeably increased to 29-32% by HPE. The B. longum-fermented C. lanceolata samples extracted by high pressure (BLF-HPE) exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity (MIC < 14 mg/mL) against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella boydii, and Salmonella typhimurium. The nonfermented C. lanceolata samples extracted with high pressure (NF-HPE) had the highest total phenolic content (13.3 mg of GAE/g). The lowest effective concentrations (EC(50) and EC(0.5)) were 4.55 and 1.76 mg/mL, respectively, for NF-HPE extracts, indicating its highest antioxidant activity. The BLF-HPE and L. rhamnosus-fermented C. lanceolata samples extracted by high pressure (LRF-HPE) exhibited the highest antimutagenic activities in S. typhimurium TA 100, which were 82 and 83% inhibition, respectively. The use of probiotic fermentation and HPE can produce more biologically active compounds in C. lanceolata than the conventional solvent extraction method. The results provide pharmaceutically useful information for improving biological properties and an approach to drug discovery.
TI  - Production of bioactive human alpha-defensin 5 in Pichia pastoris.
AB  - Human alpha-defensin 5 (HD5), a small cationic peptide, is expressed in Paneth cell granules of small intestinal crypts. HD5 exhibits high antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of pathogenic agents, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. In this study, the constitutive expression of HD5 antimicrobial peptide was achieved using the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris). HD5 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using human lung cell cDNA as template. The 96-bp DNA fragment encoding mature HD5 peptide (amino acid 63-94) was subcloned into the yeast expression vector and transfected into P. pastoris X-33 expression host by electroporation. The recombinant HD5 (rHD5) was detected in the supernatant of transfected yeast by western blot analysis. The recombinant HD5 crude extract from transfected P. pastoris showed antimicrobial activities against Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and pathogenic E. coli. However, rHD5 did not inhibit the growth of lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, or B. longum. These results indicated that the rHD5 expressed in P. pastoris selectively inhibited the growth of specific bacteria.
TI  - Assessment of cell surface properties and adhesion potential of selected probiotic strains.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the physicochemical cell surface and adhesive properties of selected probiotic strains for human use. METHODS AND RESULTS: Probiotic strains, Bifidobacterium longum B6, Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus casei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Pediococcus acidilactici were tested for the physicochemical properties of cell surfaces and the adhesion abilities against foodborne pathogens. Bif. longum B6 (53.6%) and Lact. rhamnosus GG (46.5%) showed the highest hydrophobicity, while the least affinity to xylene was observed in Ped. acidilactici (10.4%). Bifidobacterium longum B6 showed the strongest coaggregation phenotype with Listeria monocytogenes (53.0%), Shigella boydii (42.0%) and Staphylococcus aureus (45.9%). Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG had the strong binding ability to Caco-2 cells and effectively inhibited the adhesion of L. monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, Sh. boydii and Staph. aureus to Caco-2 cells. The hydrophobicity was highly correlated with coaggregative abilities and competitive inhibition, suggesting a good relationship between in vitro adhesion and in vivo colonization. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that Bif. longum B6 and Lact. rhamnosus GG can be candidate probiotics available for human consumption. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Because the use of probiotic strains has been more concerned with their beneficial effects in the GI tract, it is essential to examine the potential of probiotic strains based on the physicochemical properties in terms of bacterial-binding and adhesion capabilities.
TI  - [Influence of bifidobacteria on antilysozyme activity of microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms].
AB  - AIM: To assess influence of bifidobacteria's exometabolites on expression of antilysozyme activity of microflora and its ability to biofilm formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six strains of bifidobacteria belonging to B. longum, B. bifidum, and B. adolescentis as well as 42 strains of opportunistic microorganisms belonging to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Rhodotorula rubra isolated by conventional methods during assessment of intestinal microbiocenosis in humans. In order to study the influence of bifidoflora's exometabolites on associative flora, obtained filtrates were mixed with nutrient broth in 1:10 ratio with subsequent introduction of pure culture of opportunistic microorganism. Nutritional broth was used instead of filtrates of bifidobacteria for obtaining the control samples. Formation of biofilms was determined on the ability of strains of microorganisms to adhere on the surface of 96-well polystyrene plate, whereas the antilysozyme activity was studied by photometric method. RESULTS: Performed studies revealed multidirectional but mostly inhibiting effect of bifidobacteria's metabolites on antilysozyme activity of opportunistic microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms. Changes of these characteristics was observed both in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as in yeast fungi and depended from species of bifidobacteria and associative opportunistic microflora. CONCLUSION: Obtained data open perspective for search of control on infectious process on the basis of modification of persistence characteristics of associative pathogens and their ability to form biofilms in host's biotope.
TI  - [The primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
AB  - 10 Bifidobacterium strains and 10 Lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. L. acidophilus strain 5/4, L. acidophilus strain 18/4, B. adolescentis strain UX, B. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. The restriction analysis of the chromosomal DNA of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
TI  - [The vaginal Bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
AB  - The composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. The study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. breve, B. adolescentis 2 and B. longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. Nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains B. adolescentis 2 F1, B. bifidum G1, B. breve P2 and B. longum Z4 inhibited Klebsiella ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. Three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while B. bifidum G1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to B. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. In addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. Thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.
TI  - [The antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
AB  - The antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (B. adolescentis 2 F1, B. longum Z4, B. breve R2 and B. bifidum G1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. Still of all the bifidobacteria under study had different levels of activity. B. adolescentis strain 2 F1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. In contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with B. breve R2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to E. coli. The data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.
TI  - Production of a mixture of antimicrobial organic acids from lactose by co-culture of Bifidobacterium longum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of standard solutions of three organic acids (lactic, acetic, and propionic acids) were compared using Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas sp. and Staphylococcus aureus as test microorganisms. At the same concentrations of the undissociated form, the antimicrobial activities of acetic and propionic acids were higher than that of lactic acid, irrespective of test microorganisms. In a single cultivation of Bifidobacterium longum, a mixture of lactic (17 g/l) and acetic (20 g/l) acids was produced from 50 g/l lactose and its antimicrobial activities against M. luteus, Pseudomonas sp., and S. aureus correspond to that of 32, 19, and 25 g/l of acetic acid, respectively. To increase the total antimicrobial activity, a co-culture of B. longum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii, in which lactic acid produced once from lactose by B. longum was converted to acetic and propionic acids by P. freudenreichii, was done using TPY medium containing commercially available peptones as a nitrogen source. By the sequential conversion of lactose using the two microorganisms, the culture supernatant containing a mixture of acetic (27 g/l) and propionic (13 g/l) acids without lactic acid was produced. The antimicrobial activities of the mixture against M. luteus, Pseudomonas sp., and S. aureus were 35, 30, and 26 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid, respectively, higher than that obtained in the cultivation of B. longum alone. When the medium containing an enzymatic hydrolyzate of whey proteins with a protease was used in the co-culture of B. longum and P. freudenreichii, the culture supernatant containing the mixture of organic acids was also obtained in the same manner as the co-culture using TPY medium and the activities were 43, 29, and 29 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid for M. luteus, Pseudomonas sp. and S. aureus, respectively.
TI  - Growth-inhibitory effects of Galla Rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibitory activity of Galla Rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active components of Galla Rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (MG) and gallic acid (GA) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. In the test using 10 mg disc-1, MG and GA produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Cl. paraputrificum, Eubacterium limosum, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards Bifidobacterium adolescentis or B. longum whereas the growth of B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. animalis, B. thermophilum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. plantarum and Streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. However, GA did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 5 mg disc-1, MG significantly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens and Cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 1 mg disc-1, MG greatly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens alone. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of Galla Rhois.
TI  - [The effect of phospholipids on the adhesive properties of bacteria].
AB  - The present work shows that choline-containing phospholipids (lysophosphatidylcholine and lyso-1-alkyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine) inhibit the adhesion of some strains: Bacterium bifidum 1, B. adolescentis MC-42, B. longum B. 379M, Staphylococcus aureus P 209 and Klebsiella pneumoniae 52. Phosphatidylcholine produces no effect on the adhesiveness of these strains, while platelet activation factor stimulates adhesiveness only in strain S. aureus 209. The stimulating or inhibiting action of phospholipids on the adhesive process of microorganisms depends on the species of bacteria and on the concentration of reagents.
TI  - [The range of antigenic specificity of Bifidobacterium peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic relationships of Bifidobacterium bifidum 1 peptidoglycans with different strains of this species (LVA-3, 791, GO-4), bifidobacteria of other species (B. adolescentis GO-13, B. breve 79-38, B. lactentis 79-41, B. longum GO-3) and bacteria of remote taxonomic groups (Streptococcus faecalis 6-3. Staphylococcus aureus COM 885, S. epidermidis COM 2124. Lactobacillus plantarum 1, Escherichia coli M-17) were studied on the basis of a highly sensitive test system permitting the registration of normal human antibodies to peptidoglycans. The level of cross reactions with staphylococci and streptococci correspond to intraspecific and antigenic affinity to L. plantarum and E. coli was considerably less pronounced. Copying a number of epitopes of bifidobacteria, S. aureus peptidoglycan seems to possess additional antigenic determinants which participate in the formation of immunological responsiveness in man.
