TI  == the amide of galacturonic acid with lysine as an immunodominant component of the  lipopolysaccharide core region from proteus penneri 42 strain.
AB  == most proteus lipopolysaccharides (lpss) contain uronic acids or their amides with different amino acids, which together with other negatively charged components account for the acidic character of such lps molecules. previous studies have shown the significance of an amide of galacturonic acid with lysine [d-gala(l-lys)] for serological specificity of o-antigens from few p. mirabilis strains. in this work, the immunodominant role of galalys was indicated for the p. penneri 42 lps core region. the studies also showed the serological identity of core oligosaccharides from p. penneri 42 (o71), p. mirabilis 51/57 (o28) and r14/s1959 strains.

TI  == isolation, identification & characterization of proteus penneri--a missed rare pathogen.
AB  == background & objectives: indole negative proteus species are invariably incorrectly identified as p. mirabilis, missing isolates of proteus penneri. p. penneri is an invasive pathogen capable of causing major infectious diseases still seldom reported in individual cases. we report here the isolation, differentiation, characterization and typing of p. penneri from patients with different clinical infections. methods: urine, pus and body fluids collected from patients in intensive care units, wards and out patients departments of a tertiary health care institute from north india were cultured. a total of 61 indole negative proteus isolates were subjected to extended biochemical tests to  differentiate and identify p. penneri from p. mirabilis including failure to produce ornithine decarboxylase (by 0% strains of p. penneri and 100% strains of  p. mirabilis) besides p. penneri being uniformly salicin negative, non-utilizer of citrate but ferments sucrose and maltose. antibiograms and dienes phenomenon were performed to characterize and type p. penneri isolates besides screening for beta-lactamase production. results: eight isolates of p. penneri were identified; four from urine, three from abdominal drain-fluid and one from diabetic foot ulcer. p. penneri was isolated as the sole pathogen in all patients having underlying disease; post-operatively. swarming was not seen in the first strain on primary isolation and was poor in strain-4. all eight isolates were biochemically homologous but multi-drug resistant (mdr) with resistance to 6-8 drugs (up to 12). beta-lactamase production was seen in three of five isolates while dienes phenomenon found four distinct types and discriminated strains differing in resistance even with a single drug. interpretation & conclusions: a  few additional biochemical tests identified p. penneri isolates; it infected patients with underlying disease and strains were mdr and heterogenous.

TI  == 16s-23s rdna internal transcribed spacer regions in four proteus species.
AB  == proteus is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacterium. in this study, 813 proteus 16s-23s rdna internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences were determined  from 46 proteus strains, including 388 its from 22 p. mirabilis strains, 211 its  from 12 p. vulgaris strains, 169 its from 10 p. penneri strains, and 45 its from  2 p. myxofaciens strains. the proteus strains carry mainly two types of its, its(glu) (containing trna(glu (uuc)) gene) and its(ile+ala) (containing trna(ile  (gau)) and trna(ala (ugc)) gene), and are in the forms of 28 variants with 25 genomic origins. the its sequences are a mosaic-like structure consisting of three conservative regions and two variable regions. the nucleotide identity of its subtypes in strains of the same species ranges from 96.2% to 100%. the divergence of proteus its divergence was most likely due to intraspecies recombinations or horizontal transfers of sequence blocks. the phylogenetic relationship deduced from the second variable region of its sequences of the three facultative human pathogenic species p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris and p. penneri is similar with that based on 16s rdna sequences, but has higher resolution to differentiate closely related p. vulgaris and p. penneri. this study is the first comprehensive study of its in four proteus species and laid solid foundation for the development of high-throughput technology for quick and  accurate identification of the important foodborne and nosocomial pathogens.

TI  == structure and serological properties of the o-antigen of two clinical proteus mirabilis strains classified into a new proteus o77 serogroup.
AB  == two proteus mirabilis strains, 3 b-m and 3 b-k, were isolated from urine and faeces of a hospitalized patient from lodz, poland. it was suggested that one strain originated from the other, and the presence of the bacilli in the patient's urinary tract was most probably a consequence of autoinfection. the o-polysaccharide was obtained by mild acid degradation of the lipopolysaccharide  of p. mirabilis 3 b-m and studied by sugar analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, including two-dimensional rotating frame overhause effect spectroscopy (roesy) and 1h,13c heteronuclear single quantum coherence (hsqc) experiments. the following structure of the linear trisaccharide-repeating unit of the o-polysaccharide was established:-->2)-beta-d-glcp-(1-->3)-alpha-l-6dtalp2ac-(1-->3)-beta-d-glcpnac-(1 -->where 6dtal2ac stands for 2-o-acetyl-6-deoxy-l-talose. it resembles the structure of the o-polysaccharide of proteus penneri o66, which includes additional lateral residues of 2,3-diacetamido-2,3,6-trideoxy-l-mannose. the lipopolysaccharides from two p. mirabilis strains studied were serologically identical to each other but not to that from any of the existing 76 proteus o-serogroups. therefore, the strains were classified into a new o77 serogroup specially created in the genus proteus. serological studies using western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with intact and adsorbed o-antisera showed  that the p. mirabilis o77 antigen is related to proteus vulgaris o2 and p. penneri o68 antigens, and a putative disaccharide epitope responsible for the cross-reactivity was revealed.

TI  == application of two different kinds of sera against the proteus penneri lipopolysaccharide core region in search of epitopes determining cross-reactions  with antibodies.
AB  == introduction: proteus penneri lipopolysaccharide (lps) core regions are characterized by a greater structural variability than that observed in other enterobacteriaceae. this fact and the small amount of published data concerning the serological activity of this part of p. penneri lps prompted an examination of which fragment might determine cross-reactions with antibodies. to date, such  epitopes have been found in the lps core regions of p. mirabilis and p. vulgaris  strains. materials and methods: proteus sp. lpss were tested with unabsorbed rabbit antisera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot, and once again by elisa or passive immunohemolysis after the absorption of these antisera with selected lpss. results: the serological studies of p. penneri 8 lps demonstrated  antibodies in the tested antisera recognizing a common epitope located in the core regions of six of the lpss, i.e. p. penneri 8, 34, 133, 7, 14, and 15. additionally, another type of antibody directed against some fragment of p. penneri 13 and the core regions of other lpss investigated was observed in one antiserum. conclusions: a distal, trisaccharide fragment of the p. penneri 8 lps  core region is suggested to determine the cross-reactions of the tested antisera  with the six p. penneri lpss.

TI  == serological and structural characterization of the o-antigens of the unclassified proteus mirabilis strains tg 83, tg 319, and ccug 10700 (oa).
AB  == introduction: lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin, lps) is an important potential virulence factor of proteus rods. the serological specificity of the bacteria is  defined by the structure of the o-polysaccharide chain (o-antigen) of the lps. until now, 76 o-serogroups have been differentiated among proteus strains. materials and methods: lpss were isolated from proteus mirabilis tg 83, tg 319, and ccug 10700 (oa) strains by phenol/water extraction. antisera were raised by immunization of rabbits with heat-killed bacteria. serological investigations were performed using enzyme immunosorbent assay, passive immunohemolysis, inhibition of both assays, absorption of antisera, and western blot. results: the cross-reactive epitope shared by these strains and p. penner o72a,o72b is located on the o-polysaccharide and is most likely associated with an alpha-d-glcp-(1-->6)-beta-d-galpnac disaccharide fragment. the serological data indicated the occurrence of two core types in the lpss studied, one characteristic for p. mirabilis tg 319 and ccug 10700 (oa) and the other for p. mirabilis tg 83 and o57. conclusions: the serological and structural data showed  that p. mirabilis tg 83, tg 319, ccug 10700 (oa), and o57 have the same o-antigen structure and could be qualified to the proteus o57 serogroup.

TI  == serological classification and epitope specificity of proteus vulgaris tg 251 from proteus serogroup o65.
AB  == introduction: proteus rods are currently subdivided into five named species, i.e. proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, p. penneri, p. hauseri, and p. myxofaciens, and three unnamed proteus genomospecies 4 to 6. based on the serospecificity of the lipopolysaccharide (lps; o-antigen), strains of p. mirabilis and p. vulgaris were divided into 49 o-serogroups and 11 additional o-serogroups were proposed later.  about 15 further o-serogroups have been proposed for the third medically important species, p. penneri. here the serological classification of p. vulgaris strain tg 251, which does not belong to these serogroups, is reported. serological investigations also allowed characterization of the epitope specificity of its lps. materials and methods: purified lpss from five proteus strains were used as antigens in enzyme immunosorbent assay (eia), sds/page, and  western blot and alkali-treated lpss in the passive immunohemolysis (pih) test, inhibition of pih and eia, and absorption of the rabbit polyclonal o-antisera with the respective lps. results: the serological studies of p. vulgaris tg 251 lps indicated the identity of its o-polysaccharide with that of p. penneri o65. the antibody specificities of p. vulgaris tg 251 and p. penneri o65 o-antisera, were described. conclusions: p. vulgaris tg 251 was classified to the proteus o65 serogroup. two disaccharide-associated epitopes present in p. vulgaris tg 251 and p. penneri o65 lpss are suggested to be responsible for cross-reactions with three heterologous proteus strains.

TI  == [comparison of different methods in order to identify proteus spp].
AB  == comparison of different methods in order to identify proteus spp. the objectives  were: (a) to identify proteus strains to species level, following farmer's and o'hara's conventional biochemical reactions; b) to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of both the api 20e method and a schema of reduced reactions (tsi and mio agar: motility, indole and ornithine) comparing them with conventional methodology, and c) to evaluate the utility of sds-page (total proteins) in order to identify proteus strains to species level. two hundred and five proteus spp. clinical isolates, were collected between january 1998 and september 2004, from inpatients and outpatients at hospital de clinicas. strains were identified by means of conventional methodology, the api 20e method, and a schema of reduced reactions. sds-page (total proteins) was used in 48 out of the 205 strains. the api 20e method identified 79 out of 87 (90.8%) strains of p. mirabilis, 103 out of 103 p. vulgaris complex, and 15 out of 15 p. penneri. eight strains of p. mirabilis were identified as proteus spp., the acid production from maltose being necessary to identify them to species level. the schema of reduced reactions identified 205 out of 205 (100%) strains, that is, this schema of reduced reactions identified all the strains to species level without any additional tests, in marked contrast to the api 20e method. the sds-page (total proteins) identified the three species of the genus, even if the strains of p. mirabilis showed different biochemical reactions.

TI  == [proteus penneri].
AB  == proteus penneri, formerly p. vulgaris biogroup 1, was recognized as a new species in 1982. this species is associated with clinical processes similar to those involving p. mirabilis and p. vulgaris and expresses similar pathogenic determinants. in clinical samples, p. penneri is mainly isolated from urine (50%), wound and soft tissue exudates (25%), and blood cultures (15%), mostly of  nosocomial origin. although p. penneri is easy to identify, it can be misidentified as p. vulgaris by automatic systems that do not include the indol test result in the identification process. this species has a characteristic susceptibility profile, essentially due to the production of the chromosomal inducible beta-lactamase huga, which presents a high homology (86%) with cuma from p. vulgaris. huga is inhibited by clavulanic acid and determines resistance  to aminopenicillins and first- and second-generation cephalosporins, including cefuroxime, but does not affect cephamycins or carbapenems, and is inhibited by clavulanic acid. huga is derepressed due to mutational processes in gene regulators, affecting the activity of cefotaxime and, to a much lesser extent, that of ceftazidime and aztreonam. this phenotype resembles the production of an  extended spectrum beta-lactamase. like other proteus species, p. penneri is resistant to tetracyclines and should be considered resistant to nitrofurantoin.

TI  == structures and serology of the o-antigens of proteus strains classified into serogroup o17 and former serogroup o35.
AB  == introduction: bacteria of the genus proteus are facultative pathogens which commonly cause urinary tract infections. based on the serological specificity of  the o-chain polysaccharide of the lipopolysaccharide (o-polysaccharide, o-antigen), strains of p. mirabilis and p. vulgaris have been classified into 60  serogroups. studies on the chemical structure and serological specificity of the  o-antigens aim at the elucidation of the molecular basis and improvement of the serological classification of these bacteria. materials and methods: the o-polysaccharide was prepared by acetic acid degradation of the lipopolysaccharide isolated from dried bacterial mass of each strain by hot phenol/water extraction. (1)h- and (13)c-nmr spectroscopy was used for structural studies. serological studies were performed with rabbit o-antisera using enzyme immunosorbent assay, passive hemolysis test, and the inhibition of reactions in these assays as well doc-page and western blot. results: four proteus strains belonging to serogroups o17 and o35 were found to possess similar o-polysaccharide structures, in particular having the same carbohydrate backbone  built up of tetrasaccharide repeating units. however, they differ in the presence or absence of additional substituents, such as phosphoethanolamine in p. mirabilis o17 and glucose in p. penneri o17, as well as in the pattern and degree of o-acetylation of various monosaccharide residues. serological studies also showed close relationships between the o-antigens studied. conclusions: based on  these data it is proposed to reclassify strain p. mirabilis prk 61/57, formerly representing the o35 serogroup, into the serogroup o17 in the kauffman-perch classification system of proteus.

TI  == characterization and serological classification of o-specific polysaccharide of proteus mirabilistg 276-90 from proteus serogroup o34.
AB  == introduction: gram-negative bacteria of the genus proteus from the family enterobacteriaceae are currently divided into the five species p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, p. penneri, p. hauseri, and p. myxofaciens and three unnamed proteus genomospecies 4, 5, and 6. they are important facultative human and animal pathogens which, under favorable conditions, cause mainly intestinal and urinary  tract infections, sometimes leading to serious complications such as acute or chronic pyelonephritis and the formation of bladder and kidney stones. in this study we report on the serological properties of the lipopolysaccharide (lps) of  p. mirabilis tg 276-90, whose o-polysaccharide chemical structure was described earlier. materials and methods: lps and alkali-treated lps of a few serologically related proteus strains and o-antisera against p. mirabilis tg 276-90 and ccug 4669 (o34) were used. serological characterization of p. mirabilis tg 276-90 o-specific polysaccharide was done using enzyme immunosorbent assay, passive immunohemolysis test (pih), inhibition of these tests, sds/page and western blot  techniques, absorption of rabbit polyclonal o-antisera, and repeated pih test. results: structural and serological investigations showed that the o-polysaccharides of p. mirabilis tg 276-90 and p. vulgaris o34 are identical and that their lpss differ only in epitopes in the core part. therefore these two strains could be classified into the same proteus o34 serogroup. conclusions: the serological data showed that the beta-d-galpnac-(1--> 4)-alpha-d-galpnac disaccharide is an important epitope of the p. mirabilis tg 276-90 and p. vulgaris o34 lpss, shared by the p. mirabilis o16 and p. vulgaris tg 251 lpss. it is responsible for cross-reactions with p. mirabilis tg 276-90 and p. vulgaris o34 o-antisera.

AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate betalactam resistance within  the genus proteus and characterize the betalactamases responsible for this resistance. methods: we analyzed 99 strains (87, p. mirabilis; 10 p. vulgaris, and 2, p. penneri) isolated from patients at one university hospital. antibiotic  susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls recommendations. presence  of extended spectrum betalactamases (esbl) was inferred by both double disk diffusion tests and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of third and fourth generation cephalosporins alone and in the presence of clavulanic acid. isoelectric points (pi) of the enzymes were estimated by isoelectrofocusing and the presence of the encoding genes was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: a broad spectrum betalactamase could be detected in those isolates (28%) resistant to penicillin and first generation cephalosporins while  ctx-m-2 enzyme could be detected in p. mirabilis isolates resistant to third and  fourth generation cephalosporins (18%). one of the p. vulgaris displayed reduced  susceptibility to cefotaxime due to an enzyme of pi 7.4, while resistance to cefotaxime in one p. penneri was related to an enzyme of pi 6.8. both enzymes were active on cefotaxime (1,000 mg/l) in the iodometric assay. conclusion: the broad extended spectrum betalactamase within genus proteus was tem-1, while ctx-m-2 was the esbl responsible for the third and fourth generation cephalosporins in p. mirabilis. in p. vulgaris and p. penneri this resistance was associated with the hyperproduction of the chromosomal encoded betalactamase.

TI  == structure of the o-polysaccharide of proteus mirabilis o19 and reclassification of certain proteus strains that were formerly classified in serogroup o19.
AB  == introduction: bacteria of the genus proteus are a common cause of urinary tract infections. the o-polysaccharide chain of their lps (o-antigen) defines the serological specificity of these bacteria. based on the immunospecificity of the  o-antigens, two species, p. mirabilis and p. vulgaris, were classified into 49 o-serogroups, and more o-serogroups for strains of these species and p. penneri have been subsequently proposed. material and methods: the lipopolysaccharide of  p.mirabilis ccug 19011 from serogroup o19 was degraded under mildly acidic and mildly alkaline conditions. polysaccharides thus obtained were studied by chemical methods, including o -deacetylation, sugar and methylation analyses, and 1h- and 13c-nmr spectroscopy. antisera were obtained by immunization of new zealand white rabbits with heat-killed bacteria. in serological studies, enzyme immunosorbent assay, passive hemolysis test, and inhibition of passive hemolysis  were used. results: the following structure of the o-polysaccharide repeating unit was established:-->3)- beta-d-glcrhonac-(1-->3)- alpha-d-galrhonac4,6(r-pyr)-(1-->4)- a-d-galrhoa-(1-->3) alpha-l-rhap2ac-(1-->where r-pyr is (r)-1-carboxyethylidene (an acetal-linked pyruvic acid). this structure is significantly different from the o-polysaccharide structures of p. vulgaris, p.hauseri and p. penneri strains from the same proteus serogroup o19. conclusions: based on immunochemical studies of the lipopolysaccharides, it is suggested 1) to keep p. vulgaris ccug 4654 and p.  penneri 31 in serogroup o19 as two subgroups, 2) to reclassify p. mirabilis ccug  19011 into a new proteus serogroup, o51, and 3) to classify serologically related strains, including p. vulgaris atcc 49990, p. hauseri> 1732-80 and 1086-80, p. penneri 15, and some other p. penneri strains, in yet another proteus serogroup,  o52.

AB  == the o-polysaccharide was obtained by mild acid degradation of the lipopolysaccharide of proteus mirabilis tg 332 strain. the following structure of the o-polysaccharide was determined by chemical methods along with nmr spectroscopy, including 2d cosy, tocsy, roesy and 1h, 13c hmqc experiments: [see  equation in text]. the o-polysaccharide studied has a unique structure among proteus o-antigens. accordingly, p. mirabilis tg 332 is serologically separate, and we propose to classify this strain into a new proteus serogroup, o50. the nature of minor epitopes that provide a cross-reactivity of p. mirabilis tg 332 o-antiserum with the lps of p. mirabilis o30 and proteus penneri 34 (o60) is discussed.

TI  == bacteraemia due to tribe proteeae: a review of 132 cases during a decade (1991-2000).
AB  == to characterize the clinical features of bacteraemia due to tribe proteeae, 132 cases among 130 patients from 1991 to 2000 were analysed. the organisms included  the proteus species in 63 cases (p. mirabilis in 41, p. penneri in 2 and p. vulgaris in 20), the providencia species in 8 (p. rettgeri in 3 and p. stuartii 5) and morganella morganii in 61. morganella bacteraemia occurred more frequently in the hospital (70.5%). biliary and hepatic diseases were predominant in cases with morganella bacteraemia while cardiovascular, urological and neurological diseases were more common in cases with proteus bacteraemia. biliary drainage catheters had more frequently been placed in cases with morganella bacteraemia (39.3%, p < 0.001), and urinary catheters more frequently in cases with proteus bacteraemia (17.5%). biliary infection was most common in cases with morganella bacteraemia (49.2%), while urinary tract infection (uti) was most common in cases with proteus bacteraemia (47.6%). mortality directly related to bacteraemia due to tribe proteeae was 20.8% (22.6, 50.0 and 15.0% for proteus, providencia and morganella bacteraemia, respectively). in conclusion, morganella bacteraemia was  most frequently associated with biliary infection, while proteus bacteraemia was  most frequently with uti. providencia bacteraemia was relatively uncommon and it  can be associated with infections other than uti.

TI  == natural antibiotic susceptibility of proteus spp., with special reference to p. mirabilis and p. penneri strains.
AB  == the natural susceptibility of 102 proteus mirabilis and 35 proteus penneri strains to 71 antibiotics was examined. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics)  were determined by applying a microdilution procedure in isosensitest broth (for  all strains) and cation-adjusted mueller hinton broth (for some strains). p. mirabilis and p. penneri were naturally resistant to penicillin g, oxacillin, all tested macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramins, glycopeptides, rifampicin and fusidic acid. both species were uniformly, naturally sensitive to all tested aminoglycosides, acylureidopenicillins, some cephalosporins, carbapenems, aztreonam, quinolones, sulfamethoxazole and co-trimoxazole. species-specific differences in natural susceptibility affecting clinical assessment criteria were seen with tetracyclines, several beta-lactams, chloramphenicol and nitrufurantoin. p. mirabilis was naturally resistant to all tested tetracyclines, and was naturally sensitive to all beta-lactams, except penicillin g and oxacillin. strains of p. penneri were naturally sensitive or of intermediate susceptibility to tetracyclines, and naturally resistant to amoxicillin (but sensitive or of intermediate susceptibility to aminopenicillins in the presence of beta-lactamase inhibitors) and some cephalosporins (i.e. cefaclor, cefazoline, loracarbef, cefuroxime, cefotiam, and cefdinir). p. penneri was less susceptible  than p. mirabilis to chloramphenicol; p. mirabilis was less susceptible than p. penneri to nitrofurantoin. major medium-dependent influences on the mics were seen with fosfomycin. the present study describes a database concerning the natural antibiotic susceptibility of p. mirabilis and p. penneri strains to a range of antibiotics, which can be applied to validate forthcoming antibiotic susceptibility tests of these bacteria. it was shown that ten of fifteen amoxicillin-sensitive p. mirabilis strains produced beta-lactamases at a low level, supporting the thesis of the presence of a naturally-occurring beta-lactamase in this species. natural susceptibility patterns are compared with those of a recent study, dealing with natural susceptibilities of species of the  p. vulgaris complex.

TI  == proteus virulence: involvement of the pore forming alpha-hemolysin (a short review).
AB  == the genus proteus belongs to the tribe of proteae in the family of enterobacteriaceae, and consists of five species: p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, p. morganii, p. penneri and p. myxofaciens. they are distinguished from the rest of  enterobacteriaceae by their ability to deaminate phenylalanine and tryptophane. they hydrolyze urea and gelatin and fail to ferment lactose, mannose, dulcitol and malonate; and do not form lysine and arginine decarboxylase or beta-galactosidase [1]. colonies produce distinct "burned chocolate" odor and frequently show the characteristics of swarming motility on solid media. p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris and p. morganii are widely recognized human pathogens. they have been isolated from urinary tract infections, wounds, ear, and nosocomial bacteremic infections, often in immuncompromised patients [2-6]. p. myxofaciens has no clinical interest to this time. p. penneri as species nova was nominated by the recommendation of hickman and co-workers [7]. formerly it was recognized as p. vulgaris biogroup 1 or indole negative p. vulgaris [8, 9]. although it has been less commonly isolated from clinical samples than the other  three human pathogenic proteus species, it has nevertheless been connected with infections of the urinary tract, wounds and has been isolated from the feces of both healthy and diarrheic individuals [10-12]. potential virulence factors responsible for virulence of proteae are: iga protease, urease, type3 fimbriae associated with mr/k haemagglutinins of at least two antigenic types, endotoxin,  swarming motility and hlya and/or hpma type hemolysins [for review see ref. 13].  in the followings we give a survey of accumulated concepts about the position and characteristics of hlya type alpha-hemolysins both in general and with emphasis on virulence functions in the tribe of proteae.

TI  == molecular characterization of the genera proteus, morganella, and providencia by  ribotyping.
AB  == the so-called proteus-providencia group is constituted at present by three genera and 10 species. several of the recognized species are common opportunistic pathogens for humans and animals. different methods based on the study of phenotypic characters have been used in the past with variable levels of efficiency for typing some species for epidemiological purposes. we have determined the rrna gene restriction patterns (ribotypes) for the type strains of the 10 different species of the genera proteus, morganella, and providencia. visual inspection of ecorv- and hincii-digested dna from the type strains showed  remarkably different patterns for both enzymes, but ecorv provided better differentiation. both endonucleases were retained to study a large number of wild and collection strains belonging to the different species. clinical isolates of proteus mirabilis, proteus penneri, morganella morganii, and providencia heimbachae showed patterns identical or very similar to those of the respective type strains, so that groups of related patterns (ribogroups) were found to correspond to the diverse species. on the contrary, distinct ribogroups were detected within providencia alcalifaciens (two ribogroups with both enzymes), providencia rettgeri (four ribogroups with ecorv and five with hincii), providencia stuartii (two ribogroups with ecorv), providencia rustigianii (two ribogroups with hincii), and proteus vulgaris (two ribogroups with both enzymes). the pattern shown by the ancient p. vulgaris type strain nctc 4175 differed considerably from both p. vulgaris ribogroups as well as from the newly proposed  type strain atcc 29905 and from any other strain in this study, thus confirming its atypical nature. minor differences were frequently observed among patterns of strains belonging to the same ribogroup. these differences were assumed to define ribotypes within each ribogroup. no correlation was observed between ribogroups or ribotypes and biogroups of p. vulgaris, p. alcalifaciens, p. stuartii, and p.  rettgeri. since, not only different species showed different rrna gene restriction patterns, but also different ribogroups and ribotypes have been found in the majority of the species, ribotyping would be a sensitive method for molecular characterization of clinical isolates belonging to the genera proteus,  morganella, and providencia.

TI  == investigation of the types and characteristics of the proteolytic enzymes formed  by diverse strains of proteus species.
AB  == many diverse clinical isolates of proteus mirabilis (48 strains), p. penneri (25), p. vulgaris biogroup 2 (48) and p. vulgaris biogroup 3 (21) from man were examined for their ability to produce proteolytic enzymes and the nature and characteristics of the proteases were studied. all the p. penneri isolates, most  (94-90%) of the p. mirabilis and p. vulgaris biogroup 2 isolates, but only 71% of the p. vulgaris biogroup 3 isolates, secreted proteolytic enzymes. these were detected most readily at ph 8 with gelatin as substrate. a strong correlation was found between the ability of a strain to form swarming growth and its ability to  secrete proteases. non-swarming isolates invariably appeared to be non-proteolytic. however, some isolates, particularly of p. vulgaris biogroup 3,  were non-proteolytic even when they formed swarming growth. analysis of the secreted enzymes of the different proteus spp. on polyacrylamide-gelatin gels under various constraints of ph and other factors showed that they were all edta-sensitive metalloproteinases. analysis of the kinetics of production of the  proteases revealed the formation of an additional protease of undefined type and  function that was cell-associated and formed before the others were secreted. the secreted protease was subsequently modified to two isoforms whose mass (53-46 kda) varied with the proteus spp. and the strain. there was no evidence that the  secreted proteases of strains of proteus spp. were of types other than metalloproteinases.

TI  == potential virulence factors of proteus bacilli.
AB  == the object of this review is the genus proteus, which contains bacteria considered now to belong to the opportunistic pathogens. widely distributed in nature (in soil, water, and sewage), proteus species play a significant ecological role. when present in the niches of higher macroorganisms, these species are able to evoke pathological events in different regions of the human body. the invaders (proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and p. penneri) have numerous factors including fimbriae, flagella, outer membrane proteins, lipopolysaccharide, capsule antigen, urease, immunoglobulin a proteases, hemolysins, amino acid deaminases, and, finally, the most characteristic attribute of proteus, swarming growth, enabling them to colonize and survive in higher organisms. all these features and factors are described and commented on in detail. the questions important for future investigation of these facultatively pathogenic microorganisms are also discussed.

TI  == the simultaneous production of both hly- and hpm-like hemolysins is characteristic of the proteus penneri species.
AB  == clinical isolates of proteus penneri were tested for the presence of genes encoding hemolytic activity. strains possessing dna sequences similar to the hlycabd genes in escherichia coli were found. each secreted a 110 kda protein which reacted with a specific anti-hlya antiserum. southern blotting analysis revealed that the hindiii restriction fragment pattern for the hlycabd genes of these strains was conserved. similarly, the chromosomal location of these genes is relatively conserved based on the pattern of noti digested dna fragments separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. one strain carried an additional copy of the hlycabd determinant which was mapped on a second noti genomic fragment. all strains contained also chromosomally encoded sequences related to the hpmba genes originally cloned from proteus mirabilis. all strains produced a  166 kda exoprotein detected in immunoblots with a specific antiserum raised against hpma hemolysin. the hpmba genes were located on other noti fragments than hlycabd genes. in contrast to the other proteae, the simultaneous production of both hemolysins seems to be a common characteristics of proteus penneri isolates.

AB  == the prevalence of aac(2')-ia, a gene coding for gentamicin 2'-n-acetyltransferase in providencia stuartii, among species of the proteeae was investigated to determine if it is a common resistance factor and whether the correlation observed in p. stuartii between its expression and the levels of peptidoglycan o-acetylation represents a general feature of bacteria producing this form of modified peptidoglycan. an evaluation of the mics of gentamicin for each of the species of the proteeae did not reveal any apparent relationship between resistance and the degree of o-acetylation of peptidoglycan. the entire aac(2')-ia gene was used as a probe in southern hybridization experiments against genomic dna from each species of the proteeae. a sequence with strong homology to aac(2')-ia was present only in proteus penneri while weak hybridization was also  observed to the restriction digested dna from providencia rettgeri. other bacteria that o-acetylate peptidoglycan were also screened with this probe and a  homologous dna sequence was only found in neisseria subflava. these data suggest  that aac(2')-ia may contribute to the o-acetylation of peptidoglycan in p. stuartii, but a more specific enzyme must also be produced for this function.

AB  == the ability of the rapid one system (innovative diagnostic systems, inc., norcross, ga.) to identify 364 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and 15 oxidase-negative, gram-negative, nonfermentative rods was evaluated. kits were inoculated with no. 2 mcfarland standard suspensions, and reactions were interpreted after 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c. overall, the method correctly identified (to the species level or to the genus level for salmonellas  and non-shigella sonnei shigella species) 363 strains (95.8%) without additional  tests. for four strains (1.0%), additional tests were required to delineate the correct identification from a range of two or more possibilities; these included  one serratia liquefaciens (serratia marcescens or serratia liquefaciens), one serratia rubidaea (serratia rubidaea or serratia odorifera), one salmonella typhi (leminorella richardii or salmonella sp.) and one yersinia enterocolitica (yersinia frederiksenii, yersinia intermedia, or yersinia enterocolitica). twelve strains (3.2%) were misidentified or yielded codes with no identification; these  comprised one citrobacter amalonaticus (no identification), three enterobacter hormaechei (not in the rapid one database; two enterobacter amnigenus, one enterobacter sp.), one serratia liquefaciens (enterobacter cloacae), one serratia rubidaea (no identification), four serratia fonticola (not in rapid one database; two enterobacter aerogenes, one serratia marcescens, one not identified), one proteus mirabilis (proteus penneri), and one proteus vulgaris (providencia rustigianii). if the seven strains not included in the database had been excluded, correct identification rates would have risen to 97.6% without additional tests and 98.7% with additional tests, with misidentification rates dropping to 1.3%. the rapid one system is easy to set up and the results are easy to read, and the system provides an accurate, nonautomated commercially available method for the same-day identification of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.

TI  == [immunochemical studies of o-specific polysaccharide from proteus penneri 14 lipopolysaccharide].
AB  == o-specific polysaccharide was obtained on mild acid degradation of proteus penneri strain 14 lipopolysaccharide and found to contain equimolar of d-galactose, d-ribose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose, n-(d-galacturonoyl)-l-alanine and 3-(nacety-l-alanyl)-amido-3,6-dideoxy-d-glucose. on the basis of non-destructive  nmr analysis it was concluded that repeat unit of the 0-specific polysaccharide of p. penneri 14 has the following structure: -2-beta-d- quip3nalaac-(1-->4)-alfa-d-galpaala-(1-->2)-beta-d- ribf-(1-->4)-beta-d-galp-(1-->3)-beta-d--glcpnac-(1--> this structure was confirmed by structural elucidation of trisaccharide and disaccharide fragments prepared on mild acid hydrolysis of the polysaccharide. immunodominant role of the partial structures of the pentasaccharide repeating unit in manifesting serological specificity of p. penneri 14 was discussed. very weak cross-reactions of p. penneri anti-serum were observed with e. coli 0114 and shigella boydii 08 lps's, which showed some structural similarities. no cross-reaction with p. mirabilis 027 lps was detected.

TI  == [characterization of hemolytic activity of proteus penneri].
AB  == bacteria belonging to the genus proteus synthesise two kinds of hemolysins hpma and hlya which represent "rtx proteins". in previous papers we described the production of an extracellular hlya hemolysin by some p. penneri strains. now we  are reporting on the synthesis by p. penneri, typical for p. mirabilis hpma hemolysin. there were identified two p. penneri strains 5 and 37 in which both hpma and hlya regions are present. in two other strains p. penneri 13 and 44 only hlya region was found, whereas in strain p. penneri 42 operon hpma was identified. the production of hpma hemolysin was revealed in the cases of p. penneri 5, 42 and p. mirabilis 03 and 1959. the dynamics of hlya hemolysin synthesis by p. penneri 44 was also investigated and its highest activity was observed during logarithmic phase of growth of bacterial culture. hlya hemolysin  was isolated from culture filtrate by precipitation with polyethylene glycol 4000. the invasiveness of hpma+ and/or hlya+ p. penneri strains was also checked  by use of mouse l929 fibroblasts. both kinds of strains were able to penetrate tested cells. the invasion of l929 fibroblasts by strains producing hlya hemolysin is accompanied by cytotoxic effect.

TI  == [studies of epitope specificity of polyclonal antibodies against proteus mirabilis r mutants].
AB  == the chemical structure of the following p. mirabilis r mutants lipopolysaccharide (lps) were already established: r110/1959 (ra), r4/028 (rc) and r45/1959 (re). in this report we focus on p. mirabilis r5/o28, r13/1959 and r14/1959 and r14/1959.  the last one corresponds to salmonella transient forms, and synthesis truncated core oligosaccharide lacking terminal dd-hep and nevertheless substituted by t polysaccharide whose structure occurred to be similar to p. penneri 42 o-repeating unit. the knowledge of chemical structure of p. mirabilis r mutants lipopolysaccharides led us to the study of the epitope specificity of rabbit polyclonal r specific antisera. the results show strong structural and serological relatedness of lps from p. mirabilis r110 and r13. antibodies against p. mirabilis r4 recognize in homologous lps an epitope sharing oligosaccharide glc-hep. the serological studies revealed also close similarities of lps from p.  mirabilis r14 and p. mirabilis s1959, o28 as well as p. penneri 42. these data indicate that polyclonal antibodies against p. mirabilis r14 are directed against four epitopes: two in t-polysaccharide (d-glc-(beta 1,4)-d-glc and terminal gala  residue) and two in core oligosaccharide (d-glc-(alfa 1,6)-d-glc and terminal glcnac residue) of lipopolysaccharide molecule.

TI  == proteinases of proteus spp.: purification, properties, and detection in urine of  infected patients.
AB  == the proteinases secreted by pathogenic strains of proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris  biotype 2, p. vulgaris biotype 3, and p. penneri were purified with almost 100% recovery by affinity chromatography on phenyl-sepharose followed by anion-exchange chromatography. the proteinase purified from the urinary tract pathogen p. mirabilis, which we had previously shown to degrade immunoglobulins a and g, appeared as a composite of a single band and a double band (53 and 50 kda, respectively) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the other proteus proteinases had similar patterns but slightly different mobilities. in each case all proteinase activity in culture supernatants was demonstrated by  gelatin-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be associated with only the triple-band complex; all three bands were proteolytically active. the p. mirabilis proteinase was resistant to inhibitors of both serine and thiol proteinases but strongly inhibited by metal chelators, although it was not affected by phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of the thermolysin group of bacterial metalloproteinases. active proteinase was detected in urine samples from p. mirabilis-infected patients; this is consistent with our detection of immunoglobulin a fragments of a size suggestive of p. mirabilis proteinase activity.

TI  == proteus penneri isolated from the pus of a patient with epidural abscess.
AB  == p. mirabilis and p. vulgaris are the two wellknown species in the genus proteus.  p. myxofaciens and p. penneri are recent additions to the genus. we isolated p. penneri from the pus of a patient with suppurative otitis media and an epidural abscess. the characteristics of the organism, including morphology, staining, physiology and biochemistry, were studied. clinical microbiological laboratories  should suspect p. penneri in the case of as proteus strain that is negative for indole, salicin and esculin, but otherwise resembles p. vulgaris. proteus penneri, formerly known as proteus vulgaris indole-negative or as proteus vulgaris biogroup 1, was named by hickman et al in 1932. little information about human infection by this organism is available. in 1982, hickman and co-workers studied 20 strain of p. penneri which were isolated from clinical specimens (urine, stool, etc.) in the usa. however, its clinical significance, until recently, was unknown. we isolated a strain of p. penneri from the pus of a patient with suppurative otitis media and an epidural abscess on june 10 and 15,  1989. this paper concerns the problems encountered in identifying this organism and its clinical significance.

TI  == a survey of iga protease production among clinical isolates of proteeae.
AB  == a collection of 100 strains of proteeae, in which all species within the tribe were represented, was examined for iga protease production. the strains were isolated from various clinical specimens from sick and healthy persons in several countries. iga protease-producing strains were not found amongst species of providencia and morganella but were common in proteus spp. all the strains of p.  mirabilis and p. penneri and many of the strains of p. vulgaris examined produced an edta-sensitive protease that cleaved the iga heavy chain outside the hinge region. the proteus enzyme was different in this respect from the edta-sensitive, hinge-cutting proteases of other bacteria. the ability to produce iga protease was unrelated to the o antigenicity, biotype or bacteriocin type of the strain. iga protease production may be an important virulence mechanism for proteus strains.

TI  == production and properties of haemolysins from clinical isolates of the proteeae.
AB  == a collection of 198 clinical isolates of strains belonging to the tribe proteeae  was examined for haemolytic activity on blood agar and in brain heart infusion broth. the strains were of diverse bacteriocin and o-antigenic types and from a wide variety of sources. they included representatives of all species of morganella, proteus and providencia. approximately half of the m. morgani strains were haemolytic on blood agar. this activity was not associated with any particular bacteriocin type. the haemolysin was also produced during exponential  growth in broth and was thermolabile and calcium dependent. all p. mirabilis strains and some p. vulgaris strains were non-haemolytic on blood agar. however,  most strains of the proteus spp., irrespective of their bacteriocin and antigenic type, produced, over a short period during exponential growth in broth, a heat-stable, cell-associated calcium-independent haemolysin. a smaller proportion of p. vulgaris and p. penneri strains produced, in addition, a thermolabile, calcium-dependent haemolysin which was associated with the formation of large haemolytic zones on blood agar. the relationship of these haemolysins to escherichia coli haemolysin and their possible role in virulence is discussed. haemolysin production was not found in any of the 74 strains of four species of providencia.

TI  == [sensitivity to beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics of clinical proteus strains as dependent upon on their species classification and the source of their isolation].
AB  == sensitivity of 130 proteus clinical strains was studied. among beta-lactam antibiotics cefotaxime showed marked advantages with respect to various proteus species. all the isolates of proteus mirabilis were sensitive to cefuroxime. cefamezin and cephapirin were inferior by their activity to cefotaxime and cefuroxime. they were characterized by close antibacterial activity and almost complete cross resistance. ampicillin and carbenicillin proved to be the least efficient among the tested beta-lactam antibiotics. isolates of proteus vulgaris  and proteus penneri were more resistant to the penicillins and cephalosporins than the cultures of proteus mirabilis. sensitivity of separate proteus species to gentamicin, tobramycin, sisomicin and amikacin was close. no cross resistance  to the aminoglycosides was detected. studies on the effect of different doses of  the antibiotics revealed pronounced heterogeneity of proteus by the feature of sensitivity to the tested antibiotics. the level of the heterogeneity was not the same for separate antibiotics. cultures of proteus mirabilis resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefamezin and cephapirin were more frequent in patients with urogenital infections as compared to patients with intestinal infections and suppurative-inflammatory processes of other localization.

TI  == hemolytic activity and invasiveness in strains of proteus penneri.
AB  == twenty strains of proteus penneri obtained from the centers for disease control,  atlanta, ga., were tested for their ability to hemolyze sheep and human erythrocytes, a property that is thought to be connected with the invasiveness and virulence of proteus species. in the logarithmic phase of growth, p. penneri  cultures are hemolytic for such erythrocytes. this ability is comparable to the hemolysis exhibited by nearly 100% of p. vulgaris and p. mirabilis strains, which is due to the production of a cell-bound hemolytic factor; is demonstrated only in broth cultures; and seems to facilitate the penetration of p. penneri and other proteus species into the cells without cytotoxic effects. in contrast, a filterable alpha-hemolysin, which is produced transiently by a very few strains of p. mirabilis, was present in 4 of 20 p. penneri strains. this property, which  is expressed at a high level over a long period, suggests a chromosomal origin. the penetration of an alpha-hemolytic p. penneri strain into vero cells was accompanied by a drastic cytotoxic effect.

AB  == a total of 2,693 fecal specimens, with 1,422 from healthy persons and 1,271 from  patients suffering from enteric diseases, was investigated to isolate species of  the morganella-proteus-providencia group and to evaluate the role of these bacteria in intestinal disorders. most strains were isolated from two media, i.e., blood agar and tryptophan agar. two of the species were more frequently found in diarrheal cases than in healthy controls. these species were morganella  morganii and proteus mirabilis. two new species of enterobacteriaceae, i.e., proteus penneri and providencia rustigianii, were found in 33 and 5 people, respectively. however, these two species were not found more frequently in the diarrheal cases.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of quinolone carboxylic acids against proteeae.
AB  == the in-vitro susceptibilities of 198 isolates of precisely identified proteeae species to six quinolone antimicrobials were determined. significant differences  in susceptibility patterns among various proteeae to the quinolones examined were demonstrated. although providencia stuartii was found to be the most resistant to quinolones including the very active agent ciprofloxacin, fully speciated prov. rettgeri were also markedly resistant as well. in contrast prov. alcalifaciens was extremely sensitive to these agents. some strains of proteus penneri were more resistant to the three newer compounds (ciprofloxacin, enoxacin and norfloxacin) than strains of pr. vulgaris suggesting that recognition of this species may be important in surveys of the in-vitro activity of antibiotics. pr.  mirabilis and morganella morganii were very sensitive to the newer agents. the patterns of resistance seen in the three newer agents were reflected in the older agents acrosoxacin and cinoxacin. accurate speciation of proteeae in surveys of susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents is important if misleading results are not to be reported.
