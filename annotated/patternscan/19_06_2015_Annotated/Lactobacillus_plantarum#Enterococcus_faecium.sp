TI  == characterization, identification and application of lactic acid bacteria isolated from forage paddy rice silage.
AB  == there has been growing interest to develop forage rice as a new feed resource for livestock. this study was to characterize the natural population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and select potentially excellent strains for paddy rice silage preparation in china. one hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated and screened from paddy rice silage prepared using a small-scale fermentation system, and ninety-nine of these isolates were considered to be lab based on their gram-positive and catalase-negative morphology and the production of most of their metabolic products as lactic acid. these isolates were divided into eight groups (a-h) on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. the group a to h strains were identified as lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum (species ratio: 8.1%), l. casei (5.1%), leuconostoc (ln.) pseudomesenteroides (11.1%), pediococcus (p.) pentosaceus (24.2%), enterococcus (e.) mundtii (12.1%), lactococcus (lc.) garvieae (15.2%), e. faecium (9.1%) and lc. lactis subsp. lactis (15.2%) based on sequence analyses of their 16s rrna and reca genes. p. pentosaceus was the most abundant member of the lab population in  the paddy rice silage. a selected strain, namely l. casei r 465, was found to be  able to grow under low ph conditions and to improve the silage quality with low ph and a relatively high content of lactic acid. this study demonstrated that forage paddy rice silage contains abundant lab species and its silage can be well preserved by inoculation with lab, and that strain r 465 can be a potentially excellent inoculant for paddy rice silage.

TI  == pyrosequencing vs. culture-dependent approaches to analyze lactic acid bacteria associated to chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented beverage from northwestern argentina.
AB  == the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) associated with chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage from northwestern argentina, was analyzed using culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. samples corresponding to 10 production steps were obtained from two local producers at maimara (chicha m) and tumbaya (chicha t). whereas by culture-dependent approach  a few number of species (lactobacillus plantarum and weissella viridescens in chicha m, and enterococcus faecium and leuconostoc mesenteroides in chicha t) were identified, a higher quantitative distribution of taxa was found in both beverages by pyrosequencing. the relative abundance of otus was higher in chicha  m than in chicha t; six lab genera were common for chicha m and t: enterococcus,  lactococcus, streptococcus, weissella, leuconostoc and lactobacillus while pediococcus only was detected in chicha m. among the 46 identified lab species, those of lactobacillus were dominant in both chicha samples, exhibiting the highest diversity, whereas enterococcus and leuconostoc were recorded as the second dominant genera in chicha t and m, respectively. identification at species level showed the predominance of lb. plantarum, lactobacillus rossiae, leuconostoc lactis and w. viridescens in chicha m while enterococcus hirae, e. faecium, lc. mesenteroides and weissella confusa predominated in chicha t samples. in parallel, when presumptive lab isolates (chicha m: 146; chicha t: 246) recovered from the same samples were identified by isr-pcr and rapd-pcr profiles, species-specific pcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing, most of them were assigned to the leuconostoc genus (lc. mesenteroides and lc. lactis) in chicha m, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus being also present. in contrast, chicha t exhibited the presence of enterococcus and leuconostoc, e. faecium being the most representative species. massive sequencing approach was applied for the first time to study the diversity and evolution of microbial communities during chicha manufacture. although differences in the lab species profile between the two geographically different chicha productions were observed by culturing, a larger number for predominant lab species as well as other minorities were revealed by pyrosequencing. the fine molecular inventory achieved by pyrosequencing provided more precise information on lab population composition than culture-dependent analysis processes.

TI  == effect of microbial inoculants on the quality and aerobic stability of bermudagrass round-bale haylage.
AB  == the objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of using 4 commercially available microbial inoculants to improve the fermentation and aerobic stability  of bermudagrass haylage. we hypothesized that the microbial inoculants would increase the fermentation and aerobic stability of the haylages. bermudagrass (4-wk regrowth) was harvested and treated with (1) deionized water (control); (2) buchneri 500 (b500; lallemand animal nutrition, milwaukee, wi) containing 1x10(5) of pediococcus pentosaceus and 4x10(5) of lactobacillus buchneri 40788; (3) biotal plus ii (bpii; lallemand animal nutrition) containing 1.2x10(5) of p. pentosaceus and propionibacteria freudenreichii; (4) silage inoculant ii (si; agriking inc., fulton, il) containing 1x10(5) of lactobacillus plantarum and p. pentosaceus; and (5) silo king (sk; agriking inc.), containing 1x10(5) of l. plantarum, enterococcus faecium, and p. pentosaceus, respectively. forty round bales (8 per treatment; 441+/-26kg; 1.2x1.2 m diameter) were made and each was wrapped with 7 layers of plastic. twenty bales were stored for 112 d and the remaining 20 were stored for 30 d and sampled by coring after intermediary storage periods of 0, 3, 7, and 30 d. the ph of control and inoculated haylages sampled on d 3 did not differ. however, b500 and bpii had lower ph (5.77+/-0.04 vs. 6.16+/-0.04; 5.06+/-0.13 vs. 5.52+/-0.13) than other treatments by d 7 and 30, respectively. at final bale opening on d 112, all treatments had lower ph than the control haylage (4.77+/-0.07 vs. 5.37+/-0.07). the b500, bpii, and si haylages had greater lactic acid and lactic-to-acetic acid ratios than sk and control haylages. no differences were detected in neutral detergent fiber digestibility, dry matter losses, dry matter, lactic and acetic acid concentrations, and yeast and coliform counts. the sk haylage had lower clostridia counts compared with the control (1.19+/-0.23 vs. 1.99+/-0.23 cfu/g).  treatments b500, bpii, si, and sk tended to reduce mold counts and they improved  aerobic stability by 236, 197, 188, and 95%, respectively, compared with the control (276+/-22 vs. 99+/-22h).

TI  == construction of a novel inducible expression vector for lactococcus lactis m4 and lactobacillus plantarum pa21.
AB  == a vector that drives the expression of the reporter gusa gene in both lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis was constructed in this study. this vector contained a newly characterized heat shock promoter (phsp), amplified from an enterococcus faecium plasmid, par6. functionality and characterization of this promoter was initially performed by cloning phsp into pnz8008, a commercial  lactococcal plasmid used for screening of putative promoters which utilizes gusa  as a reporter. it was observed that phsp was induced under heat, salinity and alkaline stresses or a combination of all three stresses. the newly characterized phsp promoter was then used to construct a novel lactobacillus vector, par1801 and its ability to express the gusa under stress-induced conditions was reproducible in both lb. plantarum pa21 and l. lactis m4 hosts.

TI  == effects of a bacteria-based probiotic on ruminal ph, volatile fatty acids and bacterial flora of holstein calves.
AB  == twelve ruminally cannulated holstein calves (age, 12 +/- 3 weeks) were used to identify the effect of a probiotic comprised of lactobacillus plantarum, enterococcus faecium and clostridium butyricum on ruminal components. the calves  were adapted to a diet containing a 50% high-concentrate (standard diet) for 1 week, and then, the probiotic was given once daily for 5 days (day 1-5) at 1.5 or 3.0 g/100 kg body weight to groups of four calves each. four additional calves fed the standard diet without probiotic served as the corresponding control. ruminal ph was measured continuously throughout the 15-day experimental period. ruminal fluid was collected via a fistula at a defined time predose and on days 7 and 14 to assess volatile fatty acid (vfa), lactic acid and ammonia-nitrogen concentrations, as well as the bacterial community. the probiotic at either dose  improved the reduced 24-hr mean ruminal ph in calves. the circadian patterns of the 1 hr mean ruminal ph were identical between the probiotic doses. in both probiotic groups, ruminal lactic acid concentrations remained significantly lower than that of the control. probiotic did not affect ruminal vfa concentrations. l. plantarum and c. butyricum were not detected in the rumen of calves given the high-dose probiotic, whereas enterococcus spp. remained unchanged. these results  suggest that calves given a probiotic had stable ruminal ph levels (6.6-6.8), presumably due to the effects of the probiotic on stabilizing rumen-predominant bacteria, which consume greater lactate in the rumen.

TI  == plantaricin ld1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of lactobacillus plantarum ld1.
AB  == plantaricin ld1, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum ld1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees c for 20 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a ph range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of  organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. the crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase k showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. the molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kda, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. it inhibited not only related strains but also other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b-4562, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis nrrl b-1821, enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354, enterobacter cloacae nrrl b-14298, micrococcus  luteus, staphylococcus aureus, urogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and vibrio sp. these properties of plantaricin ld1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.

TI  == in vitro study of beneficial properties and safety of lactic acid bacteria isolated from portuguese fermented meat products.
AB  == many lactic acid bacteria produce bacteriocins with a rather broad spectrum of inhibition, which could offer potential applications in food preservation. bacteriocin production by starter cultures may bring advantage to these strains in competitive interactions with pathogenic bacteria from the food matrix. the objective of this study was to determine the safety of beneficial strains (lactobacillus plantarum st202ch and st216ch, enterococcus faecium st211ch, and lactobacillus sakei st22ch, st153ch and st154ch) previously isolated from fermented meat products and characterised as bacteriocin producers. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values of 28.97, 27.86 and 28.56% were  recorded for l. sakei st22ch, st153ch and st154ch, respectively, 16.95 and 14.58% for l. plantarum st202ch and st216ch, respectively, and 12.77% for e. faecium st211ch. various degrees of co-aggregation between 28.85 and 44.76% for listeria  monocytogenes 211 and 409, and between 23.60 to 34.96% for e. faecium atcc 19443  were observed. according to the results of the diffusion method, the studied strains demonstrated susceptibility to penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulonic acid, imipenem, linezolid, and tetracycline. in addition,  the susceptibility of the six strains to various non-antibiotic commercial drugs  was examined. production of beta-galactosidase by l. sakei st22ch, st153ch and st154ch, l. plantarum st202ch and st216ch, and e. faecium st211ch was confirmed by employing sterile filter paper discs impregnated with o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranose. a statistically significant (p<0.001) inhibition of mycobacterium tuberculosis growth by bacteriocins produced by l. plantarum st202ch (38.3%) and st216ch (48.6%), l. sakei st153ch (16.2%) and st154ch (16.1%), and e. faecium st211ch (21.7%) was observed. as determined by the polymerase chain reaction, the tested strains showed a low virulence gene profile.

TI  == immune-stimulatory effects of a bacteria-based probiotic on peripheral leukocyte  subpopulations and cytokine mrna expression levels in scouring holstein calves.
AB  == subpopulations of peripheral leukocytes and cytokine mrna expression levels were  evaluated in scouring and healthy holstein calves (age 10 +/- 5 days; n=42) treated with a probiotic consisting of lactobacillus plantarum, enterococcus faecium and clostridium butyricum. the calves were assigned to the scouring or healthy group and then subdivided into pathogen-positive treated (n=8), pathogen-positive control (n=8), pathogen-negative treated (n=6), pathogen-negative control (n=6), healthy treated (n=6) and healthy control (n=8)  groups. a single dose of the probiotic (3.0 g/100 kg body weight) was given to each calf in the treatment groups for 5 days. blood samples were collected on the first day of scour occurrence (day 0) and on day 7. in the scouring calves, smaller peripheral leukocyte subpopulations and cytokine mrna expression levels were noted on day 0. the numbers of cd3(+) t cells; cd4(+), cd8(+) and wc1(+) gammadelta t cell subsets; and cd14(+), cd21(+) and cd282(+) (tlr2) cells were significantly increased in the scouring and healthy treated calves on day 7. furthermore, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma mrna expression was elevated in the peripheral leukocytes of the scouring and healthy  treated calves on day 7. the scouring calves given the probiotic recovered on day 7. a significantly smaller number of peripheral leukocytes and lower cytokine mrna expression level might be induced by scouring in calves. repeated probiotic  administration might stimulate cellular immunity and encourage recovery from scouring in pre-weaning holstein calves.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == effects of a bacteria-based probiotic on subpopulations of peripheral leukocytes  and their cytokine mrna expression in calves.
AB  == eight holstein calves (10 +/- 3 weeks) were used to examine the interaction between a bacteria-based probiotic agent (probiotic) and the function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs). the probiotic, consisting of lactobacillus plantarum, enterococcus faecium and clostridium butyricum, was administered orally at 3.0 g/100 kg body weight to calves once daily for 5 consecutive days. calves given the vehicle alone with no probiotic served as the  control. in the treatment group, increases in numbers of cd282(+) (tlr2) monocytes, cd3(+) t cells and cd4(+), cd8(+) and wc1(+) gammadelta t cell subsets were noted on day 7 post-placement compared to predose day and the control group. expression of interleukin (il)-6, interferon-gamma (inf-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) was elevated in peripheral leukocytes on days 7 and 14.  these results suggest that peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy calves may be stimulated via the gastrointestinal microbiota, which was increased by the oral probiotic treatment, with overall stability of the rumen bacterial flora. the 5-day repeated administration of a bacteria-based probiotic may enhance cellular  immune function in weaned calves.

TI  == ability of lactic acid bacteria isolated from mink to remove cholesterol: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == this study evaluated the cholesterol-lowering property of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from mink. two strains, enterococcus faecium mdf1104 and lactobacillus plantarum mdl1118, were shown to remove cholesterol from broths of  natural hen egg yolk and skimmed milk. the cholesterol in hen egg yolk was reduced by 58.15% and 38% by l. plantarum and e. faecium, respectively. when the  bacteria were used in combination, 48.95% (p < 0.01) of cholesterol was removed from skimmed milk. experimental mice remained healthy when fed different doses of the lab, and the total serum cholesterol concentration was the lowest (0.90 mmol/l) (p < 0.01) when a combination of l. plantarum and e. faecium was used. based on our results, we suggest that l. plantarum mdl1118, e. faecium mdf1104, or a combination of the 2 strains could be considered as promising cholesterol-lowering probiotics.

TI  == effects of 8 chemical and bacterial additives on the quality of corn silage.
AB  == this project aimed to evaluate the effects 8 additives on the fermentation, dry matter (dm) losses, nutritive value, and aerobic stability of corn silage. corn forage harvested at 31% dm was chopped (10mm) and treated with (1) deionized water (control); (2) buchneri 500 (buc; 1x10(5) cfu/g of pediococcus pentosaceus  12455 and 4x10(5) cfu/g of lactobacillus buchneri 40788; lallemand animal nutrition, milwaukee, wi); (3) sodium benzoate (ben; 0.1% of fresh forage); (4) silage savor acid mixture (sav: 0.1% of fresh forage; kemin industries inc., des  moines, ia); (5) 1x10(6) cfu/g of acetobacter pasteurianus-atcc 9323; (6) 1x10(6) cfu/g of gluconobacter oxydans-atcc 621; (7) ecosyl 200t (1x10(5) cfu/g of lactobacillus plantarum mtd/1; ecosyl products inc., byron, il); (8) silo-king ws (1.5x10(5) cfu/g of l. plantarum, p. pentosaceus and enterococcus faecium; agri-king, fulton, il); and (9) biomax 5 (bio; 1x10(5) cfu/g of l. plantarum pa-28 and k-270; chr. hansen animal health and nutrition, milwaukee, wi). treated forage was ensiled in quadruplicate in mini silos at a density of 172 kg of dm/m(3) for 3 and 120 d. after 3 d of ensiling, the ph of all silages was below 4 but ethanol concentrations were least in ben silage (2.03 vs. 3.24% dm) and lactic acid was greatest in sav silage (2.97 vs. 2.51% dm). among 120-d silages,  additives did not affect dm recovery (mean=89.8% +/- 2.27) or in vitro dm digestibility (mean=71.5% +/- 0.63). the sav silage had greater ammonia-n (0.85 g/kg of dm) and butyric acid (0.22 vs. 0.0% dm) than other treatments. in contrast, ben and silo-king silages had the least ammonia-n concentration and had no butyric acid. the ben and a. pasteurianus silages had the lowest ph (3.69) and ben silage had the least ethanol (1.04% dm) and ammonia nitrogen (0.64 g/kg dm) concentrations, suggesting that fermentation was more extensive and protein degradation was less in ben silages. the buc and bio silages had greater acetic acid concentrations than control silages (3.19 and 3.19 vs. 2.78% dm), but yeast  counts did not differ. aerobic stability was increased by 64% by buc (44.30 h) and by 35% by ben (36.49 h), but other silages had similar values (27.0+/-1.13 h).

TI  == aerobic deterioration stimulates outgrowth of spore-forming paenibacillus in corn silage stored under oxygen-barrier or polyethylene films.
AB  == the occurrence of bacillus and paenibacillus spores in silage is of great concern to dairy producers because their spores can survive pasteurization and some strains are capable of subsequently germinating and growing under refrigerated conditions in pasteurized milk. the objectives of this study were to verify the role of aerobic deterioration of corn silage on the proliferation of paenibacillus spores and to evaluate the efficacy of oxygen-barrier films used to cover silage during fermentation and storage to mitigate these undesirable bacterial outbreaks. the trial was carried out on whole-crop maize (zea mays l.)  inoculated with a mixture of lactobacillus buchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, and enterococcus faecium. a standard polyethylene film and a polyethylene-polyamide film with an enhanced oxygen barrier were used to produce the silage bags for this experiment. the silos were stored indoors at ambient temperature (18 to 22 degrees c) and opened after 110 d. the silage was sampled after 0, 2, 5, 7, 9, and 14 d of aerobic exposure to quantify the growth of endospore-forming bacteria during the exposure of silages to air. paenibacillus macerans (gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic bacteria) was able to develop during the aerobic exposure of corn silage. this species was present in the herbage at harvesting, together with clostridial spores, and survived ensiling fermentation; it constituted more  than 60% of the anaerobic spore formers at silage opening. during silage spoilage, the spore concentration of p. macerans increased to values greater than 7.0 log10 cfu/g of silage. the use of different plastic films to seal silages affected the growth of p. macerans and the number of spores during aerobic exposure of silages. these results indicate that the number of paenibacillus spores could greatly increase in silage after exposure to air, and that oxygen-barrier films could help to reduce the potential for silage contamination  of this important group of milk spoilage microorganisms by delaying the onset of  aerobic deterioration.

TI  == taxonomic and molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in nunu, a ghanaian fermented milk product.
AB  == produced from raw unpasteurized milk, nunu is a spontaneously fermented yoghurt-like product made in ghana and other parts of west africa. despite the importance of nunu in the diet of many africans, there is currently only limited  information available on the microorganisms associated with nunu processing. with the aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of the process and as a first step towards developing starter cultures with desired technological properties for nunu production, a microbiological characterization of nunu processing in three different towns in the upper east region of ghana, namely bolgatanga, paga and navrongo, was carried out. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts associated with  nunu processing were isolated and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including morphological and carbohydrate fermentation tests, (gtg)5-based rep-pcr, multiplex pcr, and 16s and 26s rrna gene sequencing. the lab counts during nunu processing increased from 4.5 +/- 0.4 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 8.7 +/- 1.8 log cfu/ml at 24 h of fermentation while yeasts counts increased from 2.8 +/- 1.2 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 5.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/ml by the end of fermentation. lactobacillus fermentum was the dominant lab throughout the fermentations with lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides playing  prominent roles during the first 6-8 h of fermentation as well. less frequently isolated lab included lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus italicus, weissella confusa and a putatively novel lactococcus spp.  the yeasts involved were identified as candida parapsilosis, candida rugosa, candida tropicalis, galactomyces geotrichum, pichia kudriavzevii and saccharomyces cerevisiae with p. kudriavzevii and s. cerevisiae being the dominant yeast species.

TI  == influence of autochthonous adjunct cultures on ripening parameters of argentinean goat's milk cheeses.
AB  == background: argentinean semi-hard goat's cheeses manufactured with and without the addition of autochthonous adjunct cultures of lactobacillus plantarum etc17,  lactobacillus rhamnosus etc14 and enterococcus faecium etc3 were analysed to evaluate the effect of these strains on ripening parameters. results: gross composition was similar among cheeses. microbiological analysis indicated that lactic acid bacteria added to cheeses reached high levels. none of the strains assayed affected the primary proteolysis. overall, e. faecium had a clearer effect on the peptide and lipolysis profiles of cheeses. analysis of the volatile fraction of cheeses indicated that the levels of several compounds involved in the overall flavour of goat's cheeses were affected by the presence of e. faecium. this could explain the differences detected in the global perception of  cheeses made with this strain compared with control cheeses. conclusion: the present work represents a first contribution to knowledge of the ripening process of argentinean goat's cheeses made with the addition of autochthonous adjunct cultures. the results suggest that e. faecium etc3 showed a significant effect during ripening, which was reflected both in the profiles of proteolysis, lipolysis and volatile compounds and in the global sensory perception of cheeses.

TI  == effects of dietary supplementation of citrus by-products fermented with a probiotic microbe on growth performance, innate immunity and disease resistance against edwardsiella tarda in juvenile olive flounder, paralichthys olivaceus (temminck & schlegel).
AB  == two consecutive studies were conducted to evaluate the dietary supplementation of citrus by-products (cb) fermented with probiotic bacteria on growth performance,  feed utilization, innate immune responses and disease resistance of juvenile olive flounder. in experiment i, five diets were formulated to contain 0% (control) or 3% four different cb fermented with bacillus subtilis (bs), enterococcus faecium (ef), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr) and l. plantarum (lp) (designated as con, cbf-bs, cbf-ef, cbf-lr and cbf-lp, respectively). during 10 weeks of a feeding trial, growth performance and feed efficiency were not significantly different among all the fish groups. however, fish fed cbf containing diets had significantly higher survivals than the con group. disease resistance of fish against edwardsiella tarda was increased by the fermentation of cb. in experiment ii, we chose the bs as a promising probiotic and formulated  five diets to contain 0%, 2%, 4%, 6% and 8% cbf-bs. growth performance was not significantly affected by the cbf-bs supplementation during 6 weeks of a feeding  trial. innate immunity of fish was significantly enhanced by cbf-bs supplementation. myeloperoxidase and lysozyme activities were increased in a dose-dependent manner by dietary cbf-bs inclusions. in a consecutive challenge test against e. tarda, an increased disease resistance was found by cbf-bs supplementation. these studies indicate that the fermentation process of cb with  probiotic has beneficial effects on innate immunity and thereby increases disease resistance of olive flounder against e. tarda. bacillus subtilis can be used as a promising probiotic microbe for by-product fermentation in fish feeds.

TI  == evaluation of probiotic strains for development of fermented alisma canaliculatum and their effects on broiler chickens.
AB  == the present study was conducted to select appropriate microbial strains for the development of fermented alisma canaliculatum a. br. et bouche (fac) feed additive and to examine their effects on broilers. in experiment 1, 16 strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, enterococcus faecium, bacillus subtilis, bacillus coagulans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae from the korean collection for type cultures (kctc) were evaluated. the strains were tested for their acid, bile, and heat tolerance levels. among them, l. acidophilus kctc 3111, e. faecium kctc 2022, b. subtilis kctc 3239, and s. cerevisiae kctc 7928 were selected to produce fac. for experiment 2, 140 ross broiler chicks were allocated to four 5-wk-long dietary groups: nc (basal diet),  pc (basal diet with 0.005% oxytetracycline), ac (basal diet with 0.5% a. canaliculatum rhizome powder), and fac (basal diet with 0.5% fac). final bw and total bw gain were increased (p < 0.05) upon the addition of fac, whereas feed conversion ratio improved (p < 0.05) in the supplemented groups compared with the nc group. crude protein content increased and crude fat decreased (p < 0.05) in the breast meat of the fac group compared with the ac and pc groups, respectively. proventriculus and kidney relative weights of the fac group differed (p < 0.05) from the ac group but not from the pc group. lower (p < 0.05) thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value of thigh meat was observed in the fac group compared with the other groups. the fac diet increased (p < 0.05) alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid in meat. alteration of these fatty acids led to increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid /saturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, and decreased n-6/n-3 ratio in breast or thigh meat (p < 0.05). it is concluded that fac confers high tolerance  to acid, bile and heat; and beneficially affects growth, meat composition, oxidative stability, and fatty acid composition. the fac may be a functional feed additive in broilers.

TI  == detection of mobile genetic elements in pediocin pa-1 like producing lactic acid  bacteria.
AB  == to evaluate the presence of mobile genetic elements (mges) in intergeneric and interspecific pediocin producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) the flanking regions  of the pediocin pa-1/ach (pediocin pa-1) operon was characterized. in enterococcus faecium acr4 and lactobacillus plantarum acr2 a variation in the amplicon size in the downstream region of the operon was identified, suggesting a deletion in this region. beyond that, in pediocin pa-1 encoding plasmids mges such as islpl1 and mobilization regions were detected by southern hybridization analysis. phylogenetic analyses of the e. faecium acr4 islpl1 gene sequence suggested the gene transfer from lactobacilli in the environment. the tyrosine recombinase detected in pediocin plasmids of pediococcus acidilactici h and k7 indicate a possible transfer of the entire operon among lab. since these elements are known to be associated with transfer of genes linked to the bacteriocin production, antibiotic resistance, and sugar utilization, we suggest similar mechanism for natural spread of pediocin pa-1 operon among different bacterial species.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == newly isolated lactic acid bacteria with probiotic features for potential application in food industry.
AB  == five newly isolated lactic acid bacteria were identified as weissella cibaria, enterococcus faecium, and three different strains of lactobacillus plantarum by 16s rrna sequencing. essential probiotic requirements of these isolates such as tolerance to phenol, low ph, high sodium chloride, and bile salt concentration were checked. efficiency in adherence to mucin and hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell were also evaluated by in vitro studies. antimicrobial activities  against some pathogens were tried, and the sensitivity of these strains against 25 different antibiotics was also checked. further studies revealed weissella and enterococcus as substantial producers of folic acid. folate is involved as a cofactor in many metabolic reactions, and it has to be an essential component in  the human diet. the folate level in the fermented samples was determined by microbiological assay using lactobacillus casei ncim 2364 as indicator strain. the three strains of l. plantarum showed significant inhibitory activity against  various fungi that commonly contaminate food stuffs indicating their potential as a biopreservative of food material.

TI  == duodenal and faecal microbiota of celiac children: molecular, phenotype and metabolome characterization.
AB  == background: epidemiology of celiac disease (cd) is increasing. cd mainly presents in early childhood with small intestinal villous atrophy and signs of malabsorption. compared to healthy individuals, cd patients seemed to be characterized by higher numbers of gram-negative bacteria and lower numbers gram-positive bacteria. results: this study aimed at investigating the microbiota and metabolome of 19 celiac disease children under gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease, t-cd) and 15 non-celiac children (hc). pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analyses by universal and group-specific primers were  carried out in duodenal biopsies and faecal samples. based on the number of pcr-dgge bands, the diversity of eubacteria was the higher in duodenal biopsies of t-cd than hc children. bifidobacteria were only found in faecal samples. with  a few exceptions, pcr-dgge profiles of faecal samples for lactobacillus and bifidobacteria differed between t-cd and hc. as shown by culture-dependent methods, the levels of lactobacillus, enterococcus and bifidobacteria were confirmed to be significantly higher (p = 0.028; p = 0.019; and p = 0.023, respectively) in fecal samples of hc than in t-cd children. on the contrary, cell counts (cfu/ml) of presumptive bacteroides, staphylococcus, salmonella, shighella and klebsiella were significantly higher (p = 0.014) in t-cd compared to hc children. enterococcus faecium and lactobacillus plantarum were the species most  diffusely identified. this latter species was also found in all duodenal biopsies of t-cd and hc children. other bacterial species were identified only in t-cd or  hc faecal samples. as shown by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr analysis, the percentage of strains identified as lactobacilli significantly (p = 0.011) differed between t-cd (ca. 26.5%) and hc (ca. 34.6%) groups. the metabolome of t-cd and hc children was studied using faecal and urine samples which were analyzed by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction and  1h-nuclear magnetic resonance. as shown by canonical discriminant analysis of principal coordinates, the levels of volatile organic compounds and free amino acids in faecal and/or urine samples were markedly affected by cd. conclusion: as shown by the parallel microbiology and metabolome approach, the gluten-free diet  lasting at least two years did not completely restore the microbiota and, consequently, the metabolome of cd children. some molecules (e.g., ethyl-acetate  and octyl-acetate, some short chain fatty acids and free amino acids, and glutamine) seems to be metabolic signatures of cd.

TI  == microbial dynamics during aerobic exposure of corn silage stored under oxygen barrier or polyethylene films.
AB  == the aims of this study were to compare the effects of sealing forage corn with a  new oxygen barrier film with those obtained by using a conventional polyethylene  film. this comparison was made during both ensilage and subsequent exposure of silage to air and included chemical, microbiological, and molecular (dna and rna) assessments. the forage was inoculated with a mixture of lactobacillus buchneri,  lactobacillus plantarum, and enterococcus faecium and ensiled in polyethylene (pe) and oxygen barrier (ob) plastic bags. the oxygen permeability of the pe and  ob films was 1,480 and 70 cm(3) m(-)(2) per 24 h at 23 degrees c, respectively. the silages were sampled after 110 days of ensilage and after 2, 5, 7, 9, and 14  days of air exposure and analyzed for fermentation characteristics, conventional  microbial enumeration, and bacterial and fungal community fingerprinting via pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and reverse transcription (rt)-pcr-dgge. the yeast counts in the pe and ob silages were 3.12 and 1.17 log(1)(0) cfu g(-)(1), respectively, with corresponding aerobic stabilities of 65 and 152 h. acetobacter pasteurianus was present at both the dna and rna levels in the pe silage samples after 2 days of air exposure, whereas it was found only after 7 days in the ob silages. rt-pcr-dgge revealed the activity of aspergillus  fumigatus in the pe samples from the day 7 of air exposure, whereas it appeared only after 14 days in the ob silages. it has been shown that the use of an oxygen barrier film can ensure a longer shelf life of silage after aerobic exposure.

TI  == isolation and partial characterization of halotolerant lactic acid bacteria from  two mexican cheeses.
AB  == isolated strains of halotolerant or halophilic lactic acid bacteria (halab) from  cotija and doble crema cheeses were identified and partially characterized by phenotypic and genotypic methods, and their technological abilities were studied  in order to test their potential use as dairy starter components. humidity, a(w), ph, and salt concentration of cheeses were determined. genotypic diversity was evaluated by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction. molecular identification and phylogenetic reconstructions based on 16s rrna gene  sequences were performed. additional technological abilities such as salt tolerance, acidifying, and proteolytic and lipolytic activities were also investigated. the differences among strains reflected the biodiversity of halab in both types of cheeses. lactobacillus acidipiscis, tetragenococcus halophilus,  weissella thailandensis, and lactobacillus pentosus from cotija cheese, and l. acidipiscis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus farciminis, and lactobacillus rhamnosus from doble crema cheese were identified based on 16s rrna. quantitative and qualitative assessments showed strains of t.  halophilus and l. plantarum to be proteolytic, along with e. faecium, l. farciminis, and l. pentosus to a lesser extent. lipolytic activity could be demonstrated in strains of e. faecium, l. pentosus, l. plantarum, and t. halophilus. strains belonging to the species l. pentosus, l. plantarum, and e. faecium were able to acidify the milk media. this study evidences the presence of halab that may play a role in the ripening of cheeses.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. while the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping  the intestinal microbiota is limited. in this study, lab were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in syria. a total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with  random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by comparative 16s rdna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analyses. thirty six different species of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, weissella and pediococcus were identified. rapd and maldi-tof-ms patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. whereas some species were unique for one  source, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. interestingly, identical rapd genotypes of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and p. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. diversity of rapd types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical  transfer of intestinal lab from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.

TI  == ftir-based polyphasic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional greek graviera cheese.
AB  == this study used a combination of phenotypic, physical (fourier transformed infra-red [ftir] spectroscopy) and molecular (rflp and sscp analysis of 16s rrna  genes) methods to identify the lactic acid bacteria (lab) flora present in traditional greek graviera cheese after five weeks of ripening. a total of 300 isolates collected from high dilution plates of tsaye (incubated at 30 degrees c), m-17 (22 degrees c) and m-17 (42 degrees c) agar media were clustered by ftir and then representative strains of each cluster were cross-identified blindly by  all methods. based on their ftir spectra, 282 isolates were lab grouped in 28 clusters. the lab species identified and their prevalence in the cheese samples were: lactobacillus casei/paracasei (68.8%), lactobacillus plantarum (19.5%), streptococcus thermophilus (8.9%), enterococcus faecium (2.1%), and lactococcus lactis (0.7%). also, staphylococcus equorum (11 isolates), corynebacterium sp. (5 isolates) and brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from tsaye. comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the lab species identified. the present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid ftir screening of 10-fold more  isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant lab species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.

TI  == [inhibition of herpes simplex virus type 1 reproduction by probiotic bacteria in  vitro].
AB  == light and immunofluorescence microscopies were used to study the cytopathic effect of herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) grown on the vero cell cultures in  the absence or presence of supernatants of enterococcus faecium l3, lactobacillus plantarum 8a-p3, and escherichia coil m17. the effect of the probiotic strains was evaluated estimating the proportion of changed cells and the infective dose of the virus. the supernatants of the cultures of lactobacillus sp. and enterococcus sp., unlike those of e. coil, have antiviral activity. inhibited viral replication was more evident when the supernatants were added until the cultured hsv-1 cells were infective. an enterococcal supernatant and its obtained peptide extract showed the maximum antiviral activity. this strain may be associated with the production of bacteriocins and bacteriocin-like substances.

TI  == isolation and characterization of lactic acid bacteria from jiang-sun (fermented  bamboo shoots), a traditional fermented food in taiwan.
AB  == background: in this study, lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated, characterized and identified from jiang-sun (fermented bamboo shoots; a traditional fermented food in taiwan). samples were collected at seven time intervals from a fixed fermenting bucket during the fermentation process of jiang-sun and its initial ingredients, dochi (fermented soybeans) and bamboo shoots. results: a total of 57 lab cultures were isolated; 42 cultures were isolated from jiang-sun samples and 15 cultures were isolated from dochi and bamboo shoots. these isolates were characterized phenotypically and then divided  into three groups (a-c) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and  sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna. alteration of microbial populations during the fermentation process was observed. while various lab were found in the dochi and  bamboo shoots, it was mostly replaced by lactobacillus plantarum after 1 day of fermentation. furthermore, the antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined, and one enterococcus faecium strain showed inhibitory activity against all the indicator strains. conclusion: results suggest that l. plantarum  is the main lab present during the fermentation of jiang-sun. to our knowledge, this is the first report describing the distribution and varieties of lab that exist in the jiang-sun fermentation process.

TI  == bacterial species associated with traditional starter cultures used for fermented bamboo shoot production in manipur state of india.
AB  == soidon is a non-salted acidic fermented food prepared from the succulent bamboo shoot tip of schizostachyum capitatum munro by using a traditional liquid starter called "soidon mahi" in manipur state of india. in this study, 163 bacterial isolates associated with this starter samples were identified and their population distribution was investigated by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), 16s rdna sequencing and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis. this acidic starter (ph 4.5+/-0.15) was dominated by a characteristic association of bacillus and lactic acid bacteria (lab) together. the population distribution of dominant species were bacillus subtilis 29.3%, bacillus cereus 35.7%, bacillus pumilus 2.6%, lactobacillus brevis 9.6%, lactobacillus plantarum 5.1%, carnobacterium sp. 11.9%, enterococcus faecium 1.2% and pseudomonas fluorescens 4.6%. alarming population load (10(6)-10(7)cfu/ml) of b. cereus in 87% of starter samples studied should raise concern regarding biosafety of soidon consumption. pcr amplification of 16s-23s rdna intergenic transcribed spacer (its) region and its-rflp profiles revealed a high diversity with eight subgroups in b. subtilis, five subgroups in b. cereus and three subgroups in l. brevis isolates. the most abundant b. subtilis subgroup ib.1 distributed in most of the samples showed very less clonal variability during rapd analysis. the molecular methods used in this study identified the dominant strains of bacillus and lab distributed in most of the starter samples. these dominant strains of b. subtilis, l. brevis and l. plantarum would allow for developing a defined starter culture for the production of quality soidon.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the fecal samples of healthy humans and patients with dyspepsia, and determination of their ph, bile, and antibiotic tolerance properties.
AB  == the research of novel probiotic strains is important in order to satisfy the increasing request of the market and to obtain functional products in which the probiotic cultures are more active and have better probiotic characteristics than those already on the market. in this study, the probiotic potential of lactobacillus and enterococcus strains isolated from human feces was investigated. one hundred seven strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated from the fecal samples of 19 adult volunteers with stomach problems and the fecal samples of 12 healthy adult volunteers. the strains were identified by 16s rrna analysis and examined for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 3.5) and bile salts (0.3% bile salt). the antibiotic susceptibility of the strains was also determined. the counts of lactic acid bacteria in the fecal samples ranged from 1.7 x 10(7) to 3.1 x 10(10) cfu/g. the species present in those samples were found to be lactobacillusplantarum, l. fermentum, enterococcus faecium and e. durans. results indicated that l. plantarum (aa1-2, aa17-73, ac18-88, ak4-11, and ak7-28), l. fermentum (ab5-18, bb16-75, and ak4-180), e. faecium (ab20-98 and bk11-50) and e. durans (ak4-14 and bk9-40) showed good ph and bile tolerance. these strains are potentially good candidates for use as health-promoting bacteria.

TI  == microbial stability and safety of traditional greek graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  == the microflora of four batches of traditional greek graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. the cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known lab bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by pcr. all batches were safe according to the european union regulatory criteria for listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. the cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant lab from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. sixteen e. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. in accordance, enterocin b gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin p gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin a, b, p, 31, l50a, and l50b genes. plantaricin a gene  was also amplified from all cheeses. mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional graviera cheese products, with lab bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.

TI  == influence of microfiltration and adjunct culture on quality of domiati cheese.
AB  == the effects of microfiltration and pasteurization processes on proteolysis, lipolysis, and flavor development in domiati cheese during 2 mo of pickling were  studied. cultures of starter lactic acid bacteria isolated from egyptian dairy products were evaluated in experimental domiati cheese for flavor development capabilities. in the first trial, raw skim milk was microfiltered and then the protein:fat ratio was standardized using pasteurized cream. pasteurized milk with same protein:fat ratio was also used in the second trial. the chemical composition of cheeses seemed to be affected by milk treatment-microfiltration or pasteurization-rather than by the culture types. the moisture content was higher  and the ph was lower in pasteurized milk cheeses than in microfiltered milk cheeses at d 1 of manufacture. chemical composition of experimental cheeses was within the legal limits for domiati cheese in egypt. proteolysis and lipolysis during cheese pickling were lower in microfiltered milk cheeses compared with pasteurized milk cheeses. highly significant variations in free amino acids, free fatty acids, and sensory evaluation were found among the cultures used in domiati cheesemaking. the cheese made using adjunct culture containing lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis, lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and enterococcus faecium received high scores in  flavor acceptability. cheeses made from microfiltered milk received a higher score in body and texture compared with cheeses made from pasteurized milk.

TI  == coculture with specific bacteria enhances survival of lactobacillus plantarum nc8, an autoinducer-regulated bacteriocin producer, in olive fermentations.
AB  == bacteriocin production in lactobacillus plantarum nc8 is activated by coculture with specific bacteriocin production-inducing bacterial strains. the system is further regulated by a three-component regulatory system involving a specific autoinducer peptide (plnc8if). we have used l. plantarum nc8 as a starter culture in spanish-style green olive fermentations and examined the influence of coculturing in its survival. we found that l. plantarum nc8 greatly enhanced its  growth and survival in the olive fermentations when co-inoculated with two specific bacteriocin-production inducing strains, i.e. enterococcus faecium 6t1a-20 and pediococcus pentosaceus fbb63, when compared to singly-inoculated fermentations. in addition, a constitutive bacteriocin-producer nc8-derivative strain was used as a control in the olive fermentations and showed also better viability than the parental nc8 strain. our results suggest the involvement of bacteriocin production in the viability enhancement found in both cases. we postulate that the presence of specific bacteria is recognized by l. plantarum nc8 as an environmental stimulus to switch a specific adaptive response on, most  probably involving bacteriocin production. the design of novel bacteriocin-producing starter cultures for food fermentations should consider their constitutive versus regulated character.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria efficiently protect human and animal intestinal epithelial and immune cells from enteric virus infection.
AB  == this study aimed to examine the potential antiviral activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) using animal and human intestinal and macrophage cell line models  of non tumor origin. to this end, lab strains selected on the basis of previous in vitro trials were co-incubated with cell line monolayers, which were subsequently challenged with rotavirus (rv) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev). in order to elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the antiviral activity, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ros) release as well as the attachment ability of lab on the cell lines was investigated. various strains were found to exhibit moderate to complete monolayer protection against viral rv or tgev disruption. highest protection effects were recorded with the known probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus casei shirota against both rv and tgev, while notable antiviral activity was also attributed to enterococcus faecium pck38, lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc179, lactobacillus pentosus pca227 and lactobacillus plantarum pca236 and pcs22, depending on the cell line and virus combination used. a variable increase (of up to 50%) on the release of no(-) and h(2)o(2) (ros) was obtained when lab strains were co-incubated with the cell lines, but the results were found to be lab strain and cell line specific, apart from a small number of strains which were able to induce strong ros release in more than one cell line. in contrast, the ability of the examined lab strains to attach to the cell line monolayers was lab strain but not cell line specific. highest attachment ability was observed with l. plantarum aca-dc 146, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans aca-dc 4037 and e. faecium pcd71. clear  indications on the nature of the antiviral effect were evident only in the case of the l. casei shirota against tgev and with l. plantarum pca236 against both rv and tgev. in the rest of the cases, each interaction was lab-cell line-virus specific, barring general conclusions. however, it is probable that more than one mechanism is involved in the antiviral effect described here. further investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mode of action and to develop a cell line model as a system for selection of probiotic strains suited for farm animal applications.

TI  == changes in the microbial composition of raw milk induced by thermization treatments applied prior to traditional greek hard cheese processing.
AB  == the microbiological quality, safety, and composition of mixtures of ewe's and goat's milk (90:10) used for cheesemaking were evaluated before and after thermization at 60 and 67 degrees c for 30 s. such mild thermal treatments are commonly applied to reduce natural contaminants of raw milk before processing for traditional hard greek cheeses. raw milk samples had an average total bacterial count of 7.3 log cfu/ml; most of these bacteria were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and pseudomonads. the lab flora of raw milk was dominated by enterococci (40.8%), followed by lactococci (20.4%), leuconostocs (18.4%), and mesophilic lactobacilli (10.2%). enterococcus faecalis (30.1%) and enterococcus faecium (13.7%) were the  most common lab isolates, followed by enterococcus durans, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and leuconostoc lactis. thermization at 60 degrees c for 30 s was effective for reducing raw milk contamination by enterobacteria (5.1 log cfu/ml), coagulase-positive staphylococci (3.3 log cfu/ml), and listeria (present in 25-ml samples) to safe levels, but it also reduced mesophilic lactococci, leuconostocs, lactobacilli, and selected enterococci (72.0%) in thermized milk. thermization at 67 degrees c for 30 s had  a major inactivation effect on all bacterial groups. two nisin-producing l. lactis subsp. lactis strains (m78 and m104) were isolated from raw milk, but neither nisin-producing nor other bacteriocin-producing lab strains were isolated from thermized milk. thus, thermization treatments control harmful bacteria but also may have a negative impact on milk quality by reducing desirable lab and the biodiversity of raw milk bacteria overall, inactivating potentially protective lab strains and enhancing the ability of potentially pathogenic enterococci to grow in fresh cheese curds.

TI  == characterization of the beneficial properties of lactobacilli isolated from bullfrog (rana catesbeiana) hatchery.
AB  == the present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a r. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. the bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium, and enterobacteriaceae (enterobacter spp., escherichia coli) while pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. the lactobacillus plantarum and l. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. while l. plantarum crl 1606 also inhibited  red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. however, by using a mrs medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. the surface properties of lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate abo human erythrocytes, while  the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. this  paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.

TI  == influence of lyophilization, fluidized bed drying, addition of protectants, and storage on the viability of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: the present study focuses on the impact of two different drying technologies and the influence of protectants on process survival and storage stability of the two lactic acid bacterial strains enterococcus faecium and lactobacillus plantarum. methods and results: after incubation with the protectants glucose, sucrose, trehalose, and maltodextrin the concentrated bacterial suspensions were subjected to fluidized bed drying and lyophilization and subsequently stored at 4, 22, and 35 degrees c for half a year. lactobacillus plantarum turned out to be more sensitive to both drying methods than ent. faecium. without the addition of a protectant cells of both strains suffered higher losses during fluidized bed drying. elevated storage temperatures correlate with a higher decline of viable bacterial cells. conclusions: although  survival rates varied between the strains, the nonreducing disaccharides revealed overall best protection for both investigated lactic acid bacteria during processing and storage. the addition of protective carbohydrates can prevent the  decline in viability during fluidized bed drying. significance and impact of the  study: the influence of protectants proved to be species specific and therefore needs to be determined on a case-to-case basis. survival rates, duration, and energy consumption appear to be the crucial parameters to evaluate the economy of production processes for industrial starter cultures.

TI  == characterization and antimicrobial spectrum of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional bulgarian dairy products.
AB  == aims: to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) with high wide  spectrum antibacterial activity and to characterize their inhibitory peptides. method and results: seven lab strains [lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus (pc5),  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (bb18), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis  (bcm5, bk15), enterococcus faecium (mh3), lactobacillus plantarum (br12), lactobacillus casei ssp. casei (bcz2)], isolated from authentic bulgarian dairy products were capable of producing bacteriocins, inhibiting the widest range of pathogenic bacteria. the bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degrees c  for 15 min, stable at ph 2-10, sensitive to protease, insensitive to alpha-amylase and lipase. two of bacteriocins produced by lact. bulgaricus bb18 (bulgaricin bb18) and e. faecium mh3 (enterocin mh3) were purified and the molecular masses were determined. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of bulgaricin bb18 did not show strong homology to other known bacteriocins. conclusions: lactobacillus bulgaricus bb18 and e. faecium mh3 produce two novel bacteriocins highly similar to the pediocin-like nonlantibiotics. significance and impact of the study: the two bacteriocins are potential antimicrobial agents  and, in conjunction with their producers, may have use in applications to contribute a positive effect on the balance of intestinal microflora. furthermore, bulgaricin bb18 strongly inhibits helicobacter pylori.

TI  == microfluidic technology applied to cell-wall protein analysis of olive related lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a fully automated electrophoretic method for separating cell-wall proteins was applied to 102 isolates from olive phylloplane and brine previously phenotypically identified as lactobacillus plantarum (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (60), leuconostoc spp. (12) and enterococcus faecium (19). the high sensitivity of this technique allowed to discriminate isolates and to distinguish closely related strains within the same species. l. plantarum was characterized by proteins at 70.4 and 163.9 kda, while 3 proteins (20.4, 52.9, 68. kda) were typical for e. faecium. no characteristic proteins were found for leuconostoc isolates except for that at 31.8 kda mainly related to the ecological origin since only isolates from brine showed this protein. however, leuc. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and leuconostoc spp. were differentiated by additional proteins. sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene of  selected strains was in agreement with the phenotypic identification and allowed  to identify all leuconostoc spp. isolates as leuc. mesenteroides. cell-wall protein fingerprinting performed by microfluidic technology completed the phenotypic characterization of olive-related lactic acid bacteria allowing their  strain typing.

TI  == many fructosamine 3-kinase homologues in bacteria are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases potentially involved in protein deglycation.
AB  == the purpose of this work was to identify the function of bacterial homologues of  fructosamine 3-kinase (fn3k), a mammalian enzyme responsible for the removal of fructosamines from proteins. fn3k homologues were identified in approximately 200 (i.e. approximately 27%) of the sequenced bacterial genomes. in 11 of these genomes, from phylogenetically distant bacteria, the fn3k homologue was immediately preceded by a low-molecular-weight protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (lmw-ptp) homologue, which is therefore probably functionally related to the fn3k homologue. five bacterial fn3k homologues (from escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, staphylococcus aureus and thermus thermophilus) were overexpressed in e. coli, purified and their kinetic properties investigated. four were ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases acting best on free lysine and cadaverine derivatives, but not on ribulosamines bound to the alpha amino group of amino acids. they also phosphorylated protein-bound ribulosamines or erythrulosamines, but not protein-bound fructosamines, therefore having properties similar to those of mammalian fn3k-related protein. the e. coli fn3k homologue (ynia) was inactive on all tested substrates. the lmw-ptp of t. thermophilus, which forms an operon with an fn3k homologue, and an lmw-ptp of s.  aureus (ptpa) were overexpressed in e. coli, purified and shown to dephosphorylate not only protein tyrosine phosphates, but protein ribulosamine 5-phosphates as well as free ribuloselysine 5-phosphate and erythruloselysine 4-phosphate. these lmw-ptps were devoid of ribulosamine 3-phosphatase activity. it is concluded that most bacterial fn3k homologues are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases. they may serve, in conjunction with a phosphatase, to deglycate products of glycation formed from ribose 5-phosphate or erythrose 4-phosphate.

TI  == [study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  == a comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. at physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms.  lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) cfu/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) cfu/1 g in the intestine content. the spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. quantity of e. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) cfu/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) cfu/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) cfu/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--l. plantarum and l. fermentum. all the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists  of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. the degree of  adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. the highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62)  and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. the screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. the strain of lactobacillus plantarum 200d proved to be the most active one. a complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization  of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. the biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.

TI  == [study of some properties of strain lactobacillus plantarum g3/3(13) antagonistic factor].
AB  == the screening of strains which expressed antagonistic activity, that is not connected with lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide synthesis was conducted among 72 cultures of lactic acid bacteria. the strain l. plantarum g3/3(13) which inhibited growth of 11 test-cultures including lactobacillus plantarum, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium was selected. the antibacterial factor was of protein nature, did not retain the activity after boiling and was active at ph 2.0-8.0, whereas at ph 9.0 its activity fell significantly. the obtained results  allow to assume that the formed agent can be bacteriocin-like substance and the strain l. plantarum g3/3(13) may be useful for food industry or probiotic construction.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == microbiological study of lactic acid fermentation of caper berries by molecular and culture-dependent methods.
AB  == fermentation of capers (the fruits of capparis sp.) was studied by molecular and  culture-independent methods. a lactic acid fermentation occurred following immersion of caper berries in water, resulting in fast acidification and development of the organoleptic properties typical of this fermented food. a collection of 133 isolates obtained at different times of fermentation was reduced to 75 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis. isolates were identified by pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates), lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 isolate), lactobacillus pentosus (5 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates), lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates), pediococcus pentosaceus (14 isolates), pediococcus acidilactici (1  isolate), and enterococcus faecium (2 isolates). cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among lactobacilli (with four major  groups and five subgroups), while pediococci clustered in two closely related groups. a culture-independent analysis of fermentation samples by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) also indicated that l. plantarum is the predominant species in this fermentation, in agreement with culture-dependent results. the distribution of l. brevis and l. fermentum in samples was also determined by ttge, but identification of pediococcus at the species level was not possible. ttge also allowed a more precise estimation of the distribution of  e. faecium, and the detection of enterococcus casseliflavus (which was not revealed by the culture-dependent analysis). results from this study indicate that complementary data from molecular and culture-dependent analysis provide a more accurate determination of the microbial community dynamics during caper fermentation.

TI  == phenotypic identification and technological properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditionally processed fish products of the eastern himalayas.
AB  == sukako maacha, gnuchi, sidra and sukuti are traditional smoked and sun-dried fish products of the eastern himalayan regions of nepal and india. a total of 40 samples of sukako maacha (14), gnuchi (6), sidra (10) and sukuti (10) were collected and were analysed for microbial load. population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) as well as aerobic mesophilic counts ranged from 4.7-8.3 to 5.1-8.5 log cfu g(-1), respectively. a total of 189 strains of lab were isolated  from sukako maacha, gnuchi, sidra and sukuti samples, out of which 171 strains were cocci and 15 strains, were heterofermentative lactobacilli. lab were identified on the basis of phenotypic characters including api system as lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactococcus plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella confusa. lab strains produced a wide spectrum of enzymes. some strains of lab showed antagonistic properties against pathogenic strains. none of the strains produced biogenic amines in the method applied. this paper is the first report on the microbial composition, mostly lactic acid bacteria, of traditionally processed fish products of eastern  himalayas.

TI  == monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) during shochu fermentation was monitored by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and by bacteriological culturing. no lab were detected from fermented mashes by pcr-dgge using a universal bacterial pcr primer set. however, pcr-dgge using a new primer  specific for the 16s rdna of lactococcus, streptococcus, tetragenococcus, enterococcus, and vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16s rdna of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella revealed that enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus nagelii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. it was also found that the lab community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. therefore, we confirmed that pcr-dgge using all three primers specific for groups of lab together was well suited to the study of the lab diversity in shochu mashes. the results of dgge profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. in conclusion, lab are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.

TI  == use of real time pcr to determine population profiles of individual species of lactic acid bacteria in alfalfa silage and stored corn stover.
AB  == real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to quantify seven species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in alfalfa silage prepared in the presence or absence of four commercial inoculants and in uninoculated corn stover harvested and stored under a variety of field conditions. species-specific pcr primers were designed based on reca gene sequences. commercial inoculants improved the quality of alfalfa silage, but species corresponding to those in the inoculants displayed variations in persistence over the next 96 h. lactobacillus brevis was the most abundant lab (12 to 32% of total sample dna) in all of the alfalfa silages by 96  h. modest populations (up to 10%) of lactobacillus plantarum were also observed in inoculated silages. pediococcus pentosaceus populations increased over time but did not exceed 2% of the total. small populations (0.1 to 1%) of lactobacillus buchneri and lactococcus lactis were observed in all silages, while lactobacillus pentosus and enterococcus faecium were near or below detection limits. corn stover generally displayed higher populations of l. plantarum and l. brevis and lower populations of other lab species. the data illustrate the utility of rt-pcr for quantifying individual species of lab in conserved forages  prepared under a wide variety of conditions.

AB  == bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after  16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in  growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density  over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at  the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == antigenotoxicity of probiotics and prebiotics on faecal water-induced dna damage  in human colon adenocarcinoma cells.
AB  == six strains of lactic acid producing bacteria (lab) were incubated (1 x 10(8)cfu/ml) with genotoxic faecal water from a human subject. ht29 human adenocarcinoma cells were then challenged with the resultant samples and dna damage measured using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. the lab  strains investigated were bifidobacterium sp. 420, bifidobacterium bb12, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus and enterococcus faecium. dna damage was significantly decreased by all bacteria used with the exception of strep. thermophilus. bif. bb12 and lact. plantarum showed the greatest protective effect against dna damage. incubation of faecal water with different concentrations of bif. bb12 and lact. plantarum revealed that the  decrease in genotoxicity was related to cell density. non-viable (heat treated) probiotic cells had no effect on faecal water genotoxicity. in a second study, ht29 cells were cultured in the presence of supernatants of incubations of probiotics with various carbohydrates including known prebiotics; the ht29 cells  were then exposed to faecal water. overall, incubations involving lact. plantarum with the fructooligosaccharide (fos)-based prebiotics inulin, raftiline, raftilose and actilight were the most effective in increasing the cellular resistance to faecal water genotoxicity, whereas fermentations with elixor (a galactooligosaccharide) and fibersol (a maltodextrin) were less effective. substantial reductions in faecal water-induced dna damage were also seen with supernatants from incubation of prebiotics with bif. bb12. the supernatant of fermentations involving ent. faecium and bif. sp. 420 generally had less potent effects on genotoxicity although some reductions with raftiline and elixor fermentations were apparent.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from aoc salers cheese.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == indigenous raw milk microbiota influences the bacterial development in traditional cheese from an alpine natural park.
AB  == nostrano di primiero is a 6-month ripened cheese produced from raw milk collected in the paneveggio-pale di san martino natural park area in the italian dolomites. in summer, this cheese is made using milk collected from two different areas, passo rolle and vanoi, in the paneveggio natural park. during the experiment, the milk from the two areas was separately processed, and cheeses were made in the same cheese factory using the same technological process. the microbiota of raw milk and cheeses of the two areas was isolated and the dominant population was monitored by rapd analysis and identified by 16s rrna sequence. the milk of the passo rolle area was mainly composed of mesophilic strains, thermophilic streptococcus thermophilus, and low amounts of enterococci were also found; the milk of the vanoi area was dominated by mesophilic microbiota mostly lactococcus  lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis and lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei.  the plating of the natural starter culture revealed the presence of a relevant community of thermophilic cocci and lower amounts of enterococci. the dynamic population analysis showed the importance of the natural starter culture in the first 2 days of cheese ripening in both cheeses. moreover, the large biodiversity observed in the raw milks was also detected in the cheeses during ripening. the vanoi cheese was dominated by enterococcus faecium and streptococcus macedonicus  in the first two days and mesophilic 21 lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei became the most represented population after 15 days of ripening. in the first few days, the rolle cheese was characterized by being mainly composed of thermophilic s. macedonicus and s. thermophilus and secondarily by mesophilic cocci. during ripening, the microbiota composition changed, and at 15 days, mesophilic lactobacilli were the dominant population, but later, this was mainly composed of mesophilic cocci and lactobacilli. the taxonomical identification by 16s rrna sequence confirmed a large biodiversity related to raw milk microbiota and only five strains of s. macedonicus, lactobacillus plantarum, 21 lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum and e. faecium were detected in both cheeses.

TI  == construction and use of a computerized dna fingerprint database for lactic acid bacteria from silage.
AB  == efficient selection of new silage inoculant strains from a collection of over 10,000 isolates of lactic acid bacteria (lab) requires excellent strain discrimination. toward that end, we constructed a gelcompar ii database of dna fingerprint patterns of ethidium bromide-stained ecori fragments of total lab dna separated by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. we found that the total dna patterns were strain-specific; 56/60 american type culture collection strains of 33 species of lab could be distinguished. enterococcus faecium strains atcc19434 and atcc35667 had identical total dna patterns and riboprints. lactobacillus rhamnosus strains atcc7469 and atcc27773 also had identical total dna patterns, but different riboprints. ecori riboprint patterns could distinguish only about 9/23 lactobacillus plantarum strains and about 6/10 lactobacillus buchneri strains, whereas all 33 strains could be distinguished by  ecori total dna patterns. despite gel-to-gel variation, new dna patterns can be readily grouped with existing patterns using gelcompar ii. the database contains  large homogenous clusters of l. plantarum, e. faecium, l. buchneri, lactobacillus brevis and pediococcus species that can be used for tentative taxonomic assignment. we routinely use the dna fingerprint database to identify and characterize new strains, eliminate duplicate isolates and for quality control of inoculant product strains. the gelcompar ii database has been in continuous use for 7 years and contains more than 3600 patterns representing approximately 700 unique patterns from over 300 gels and is the largest computerized dna fingerprint database for lab yet reported.

TI  == binding of extracellular matrix molecules by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ecm) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. methods and results: ecm molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota and l. johnsonii la1) as well as by l. casei l.c., lactobacillus sp. 2i3 and by l. plantarum lp. the other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. significance and impact of the study: some  animal strains (at least l. casei l.c. and lactobacillus sp. 2i3) are comparable  with the commercially used strains with respect to their ecm binding ability. as  this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.

TI  == bacterial community dynamics during production of registered designation of origin salers cheese as evaluated by 16s rrna gene single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.
AB  == microbial dynamics during processing and ripening of traditional cheeses such as  registered designation of origin salers cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in france, play an important role in the elaboration of sensory qualities. the aim of the present study was to obtain a picture of the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem of rdo salers cheese by using culture-independent methods. this included dna extraction, pcr, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp)  analysis. bacterial and high-gc% gram-positive bacterial primers were used to amplify v2 or v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene. sscp patterns revealed changes during the manufacturing of the cheese. patterns of the ecosystems of cheeses that were provided by three farmers were also quite different. cloning and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene revealed sequences related to lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus pentosus), which were predominant during manufacturing and ripening. bacteria belonging to the high-gc% gram-positive group (essentially corynebacteria) were found by using specific primers. the present molecular approach can effectively describe the ecosystem of artisanal dairy products.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from human vaginal secretions.
AB  == a total of 57 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from the vaginal secretions of 259 patients. of these strains, 37 were isolated from patients attending pre-natal clinics and the remaining strains from patients attending post-natal clinics. the strains were identified by using simple physiological and biochemical tests and their phenotypic relatedness determined by numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns. the genotypic relatedness of representative strains selected from each of the protein profile clusters was determined by numerical analysis of the dna banding patterns obtained from rapd-pcr. the majority of lactobacilli isolated belonged to the species lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus fermentum and enterococcus faecium. a few strains of lactobacillus plantarum and weissella viridescens were also isolated.  one strain, tv 1029, grouped into the same protein profile cluster as e. faecium, but revealed a dna banding pattern closer related to enterococcus faecalis. this  is the first report of w. viridescens associated with the human vagina.

TI  == evolution of microbial populations during traditional feta cheese manufacture and ripening.
AB  == in three different dairies (a, b and c) located in peloponess region (southern greece), traditional feta cheese trials took place february to march using mixtures of sheep's and goat's milk. only small variations in the evolution of microbial groups were observed during the whole ripening period. the main groups, such as thermophilic cocci, mesophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (nslab), presumptive leuconostoc, enterococci and micrococci, reached their highest levels during the first 16 days, and then declined approximately 1-2 log units until the end of ripening. the remaining groups investigated, comprising yeasts, coliforms and escherichia coli, were highest at day 4. the yeasts remained constant, while coliforms and e. coli decreased sharply and were not detectable after 120 days of ripening. a number of 146 isolates (dairy a) taken from all stages of the manufacturing and ripening process were purified and studied. lactobacillus plantarum (58/146) and isolates  of related species lactobacillus pentosus and lactobacillus paraplantarum (16/146) were the most common microorganisms found during cheese ripening. streptococcus thermophilus (23/146) and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (20/146) were detected in high levels up to 20 days, and then gradually reduced. enterococcus faecium (29/146) was found in all manufacturing and ripening stages.

TI  == esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  == in the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. the lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. by studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. lactobacillus plantarum o236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. the intracellular and extracellular fractions of leuconostoc mesenteroides o257, lactobacillus plantarum o236, and lactobacillus acidophilus o177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. l. plantarum o186, l. acidophilus o252, enterococcus faecium o174 and o426, and enterococcus faecalis ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. lactococcus lactis o233, l. plantarum o155, and lactobacillus casei o190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.

TI  == biochemical and genetic characterization of mundticin ks, an antilisterial peptide produced by enterococcus mundtii nfri 7393.
AB  == mundticin ks, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus mundtii nfri 7393 isolated from grass silage in thailand, is active against closely related lactic acid bacteria and the food-borne pathogen listeria monocytogenes. in this study, biochemical and genetic characterization of mundticin ks was done. mundticin ks was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, sequential ion-exchange chromatography, and solid-phase extraction. the gene cluster (mun locus) for mundticin ks production was cloned, and dna sequencing revealed that the mun locus consists of three genes, designated muna, munb, and munc. the muna  gene encodes a 58-amino-acid mundticin ks precursor, munb encodes a protein of 674 amino acids involved in translocation and processing of the bacteriocin, and  munc encodes a mundticin ks immunity protein of 98 amino acids. amino acid and nucleotide sequencing revealed the complete, unambiguous primary structure of mundticin ks; mundticin ks comprises a 43-amino-acid peptide with an amino acid sequence similar to that of mundticin ato6 produced by e. mundtii ato6. mundticin ks and mundticin ato6 are distinguished by the inversion of the last two amino acids at their respective c termini. these two mundticins were expressed in escherichia coli as recombinant peptides and found to be different in activity against certain lactobacillus strains, such as lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus curvatus. mundticin ks was successfully expressed by transformation with the recombinant plasmid containing the mun locus in heterogeneous hosts such as e. faecium, l. curvatus, and lactococcus lactis. based on our results, the mun locus is located on a 50-kb plasmid, pml1, of e. mundtii nfri 7393.

TI  == ruminal supplementation of direct-fed microbials on diurnal ph variation and in situ digestion in dairy cattle.
AB  == to evaluate the effect of direct-fed microbial (dfm) concentration on diurnal rumen ph profiles and in situ digestibilities, nine ruminally cannulated cows in  early lactation were fed treatments consisting of dfm (enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, and saccharomyces cerevisiae) at a level of a) 1 x 10(5) cfu/ml of rumen fluid (10(5)), b) 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml of rumen fluid (10(6)), and c) 1 x 10(7) cfu/ml rumen fluid (10(7)). treatments were directly administered via rumen cannula once daily. cows were fitted with ph probes in their cannula and connected to dataloggers, which monitor ph hourly. the experimental period was 21 d: 7-d adjustment, 14-d for ph, and in situ measurements. cows fed 10(5) were able to sustain a higher nadir ph than were cows fed 10(6) or 10(7). cows fed 10(5) had a higher digestion rate of high moisture ear corn (hmec) dry matter. corn silage digestion was higher for cows fed 10(5) and 10(6) compared with those receiving 10(7). there were no carryover effects of treatment associated with rumen ph when switching from one treatment regimen to the next. results from this study demonstrate that incorporation of a specific level of dfm aids in reducing  diurnal ruminal acidity.

TI  == effect of inoculants on whole-crop barley silage fermentation and dry matter disappearance in situ.
AB  == whole-crop barley harvested at the mid-dough stage was ensiled in 3-l laboratory  silos either directly (at 30.7% dm) or after wilting (37.8% dm), and with or without application of inoculant a, b, or d. each inoculant contained multiple strains of lactobacillus plantarum and enterococcus faecium. two silos per treatment were opened on d 1, 3, 7, 15, and 47 for silage analysis. wilted silages had higher (p < 0.05) ph than unwilted silages, and inoculant b (unwilted crop) and inoculants a, b, and d (wilted crop) decreased (p < 0.05) silage ph compared to the controls. reducing sugars concentration was 36% lower (p < 0.05), on average, in the wilted than in the unwilted silages. silages prepared with inoculants b or d had lower (p < 0.05) concentrations of reducing sugars than the control. wilting of the barley crop further increased the difference between inoculated and control silages (wilting x inoculation p < 0.05). neither wilting  nor silage inoculants affected concentrations of nonprotein n, ammonia n, or free amino acid n in silage. wilting did not affect the concentration of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the silages. across dm levels, inoculant-treated silages had larger (p < 0.01) populations of lab than did the uninoculated controls (7.1 x 10(9) vs 2.3 x 10(9) cfu/g silage dm). wilting resulted in lesser (p < 0.05) silage lactic acid concentration than the directly ensiled crop. at both dm levels, lactic acid concentration was higher (p < 0.001) in inoculated silages than in controls. the in situ soluble and potentially degradable fractions of silage dm were not affected by wilting or inoculant treatment. the rate of degradation of the potentially degradable silage dm was 35% lower (p < 0.05) in wilted than in unwilted silage. as a result, the calculated effective degradability of silage dm was lower (p < 0.001) in wilted than in unwilted silage. inoculants did not influence the rate of degradation or effective degradability of silage dm in the rumen. whole-crop barley ensiled at approximately 30% dm (without wilting) contained higher concentrations of soluble sugars and lactic acid and had higher ruminal degradability of dm than wilted silage (38% dm). although inoculants did not improve dm degradability of barley silage, lower terminal ph and increased concentrations of lactic acid may improve aerobic stability upon feed-out.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == the influence of bacterial inoculants on the microbial ecology of aerobic spoilage of barley silage.
AB  == the aerobic decomposition of barley silage treated with two inoculants (laca and  lacb) containing mixtures of lactobacillus plantarum and enterococcus faecium was investigated over a 28-day period. initially, yeast and bacterial populations were larger in silage inoculated with laca than in silage treated with lacb or water alone (control). differences in the succession of yeasts in silage treated  with laca were observed relative to the other two treatments. from silage treatment with laca, issatchenkia orientalis was the most prevalent yeast taxon over all of the sample times, and the filamentous fungus microascus brevicaulis was also frequently isolated at later sample dates (> or = 14 days). in contrast, saccharomyces exiguus was the most prominent yeast recovered from silage treated  with lacb and water alone on days 2 and 4, although it was supplanted by i. orientalis at later sample times. successional trends of bacteria were similar for all three treatments. lactobacillus spp. were initially the most prevalent bacteria isolated, followed by bacillus spp. (primarily bacillus pumilus). however, the onset of bacillus spp. prominence was faster in laca silage, and klebsiella planticola was frequently recovered at later sample times (> or = 14 days). more filamentous fungi were recovered from laca silage on media containing carboxylmethylcellulose, pectin, or xylan. the most commonly isolated taxa were absidia sp., aspergillus flavus, aspergillus fumigatus, byssochlamys nivea, monascus ruber, penicillium brevicompactum, pseudoallescheria boydii, and m. brevicaulis. the results of this study indicated that the two bacterial inoculants incorporated into barley at the time of ensilage affected the microbial ecology of silage decomposition following exposure to air. however, neither of the microbial inoculants effectively delayed aerobic spoilage of barley silage, and the rate of decomposition of silage treated with one of the inoculants (laca) was actually enhanced.

(1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.

TI  == the feeding of raw, fermented poultry byproducts: using mink as a model.
AB  == in this study, the safety of fermentation as a method of preservation of raw animal byproducts used for animal nutrition was tested. two feeding trials with mink, as a model for nonruminant animals, were carried out. in the first trial mink were given a fermented diet composed of raw poultry and fish byproducts supplemented with cereals, glucose, lactic acid, premix, and starter culture (lactobacillus plantarum and enterococcus faecium). these mink failed to deliver  kits, and 7 of the 30 females in the test group died. at autopsy no specific cause of death could be diagnosed, although all the dead mink showed symptoms of  cachexia. in a second trial, a group of mink kits, during the growth period, was  given a diet composed of fermented poultry byproducts, just before feeding mixed  with raw fish. the weight gain of the mink in the test group decreased statistically compared with that of the control group, mainly for the male members of the group. from the end of october until the beginning of november, during pelt priming, some mink showed symptoms of severe weight loss. it is suggested that the measured increase of amino acid breakdown, and(or) the acidic  ph of the fermented diet, caused these unfavorable results. to examine the effect of the fermented diet on the gut flora, fecal samples were analyzed. the fermented diet changed the composition of the gut flora significantly. in the group that received the fermented diet the number of lactobacilli and the mesophilic aerobic count increased and the number of enterobacteriaceae and enterococci decreased compared with the control group.(abstract truncated at 250  words)

TI  == fermentation of raw poultry byproducts for animal nutrition.
AB  == in this study, the fermentation of raw, inedible poultry byproducts mixed with sugarbeet pulp and dextrose and inoculated with lactobacillus plantarum and(or) enteroccocus faecium resulted in a drop of ph in the byproducts to approximately  4.0 to 4.5 within 48 h. to keep the fermented product stable for a period of 21 d, the addition of > or = 3% (wt/wt) of a fermentable carbohydrate was necessary. with a high inoculation level of approximately 10(8) to 10(9) l. plantarum per gram, or with acidification of the initial mixture with .4% lactic acid, the number of enterobacteriaceae decreased faster than with inoculation at 10(5) l. plantarum per gram, or without initial acidification. after 21 d of fermentation, a high level of enzymatic breakdown of proteins and amino acids was observed: the nonprotein n level increased from 5% to between 15 and 40% of total n and the volatile n level increased from 1% to between 3 and 11% of total n. an increase in histamine, cadaverine, and putrescine was also observed. despite the technological measures taken, such as the application of a high inoculum of starter culture and initial acidification with .4% lactic acid, this amino acid breakdown could not be reduced to an acceptable level. these results suggest that, because of biochemical deterioration, fermentation alone is not a useful method of preservation of raw poultry byproducts.
