TI  == subgingival microbial communities in leukocyte adhesion deficiency and their relationship with local immunopathology.
AB  == leukocyte adhesion deficiency i (lad-i) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by single gene mutations in the cd18 subunit of beta2 integrins which result in defective transmigration of neutrophils into the tissues. affected patients suffer from recurrent life threatening infections and severe oral disease (periodontitis). microbial communities in the local environment (subgingival plaque) are thought to be the triggers for inflammatory periodontitis, yet little is known regarding the microbial communities associated with lad-i periodontitis. here we present the first comprehensive characterization of the subgingival communities in lad-i, using a 16s rrna gene-based microarray, and investigate the relationship of this tooth adherent microbiome to the local immunopathology of periodontitis. we show that the lad subgingival microbiome is distinct from that  of health and localized aggressive periodontitits. select periodontitis-associated species in the lad microbiome included parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, eubacterium brachy and treponema species. pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium not typically found in subgingival plaque is detected in  lad-i. we suggest that microbial products from lad-associated communities may have a role in stimulating the local inflammatory response. we demonstrate that bacterial lps translocates into the lesions of lad-periodontitis potentially triggering immunopathology. we also show in in vitro assays with human macrophages and in vivo in animal models that microbial products from lad-associated subgingival plaque trigger il-23-related immune responses, which have been shown to dominate in patient lesions. in conclusion, our current study  characterizes the subgingival microbial communities in lad-periodontitis and supports their role as triggers of disease pathogenesis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == clinical and microbiological results following nonsurgical periodontal therapy with or without local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == objectives: we assessed if adjunct administration of piperacillin/tazobactam added clinical and microbiological treatment benefits. materials and methods: thirty-six subjects (mean age 52.1 years (sd +/- 10.3)) (ns by group) with chronic periodontitis were randomly enrolled receiving subgingival debridement and the local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam (test group) or debridement alone (control group). bleeding on probing (bop), probing pocket depth (ppd), and microbiological counts of 74 species were studied by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization up to month 6 after treatment. results: mean ppd changes between baseline and month 6 in the test and control groups were 1.5  and 1.8 mm, respectively (ns between groups). bop in both groups decreased from about 80 to 40 %. at 4 and 12 weeks, lower counts of the following bacteria were  found in the test group (site level): fusobacterium species, parvimonas micra, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and a composite load of nine pathogens (p < 0.001). at week 26, subjects receiving local antibiotics had a lower prevalence at tested sites for fusobacterium nucleatum sp. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum, p. micra, and t. denticola. conclusions: at 26 weeks, treatment with or without piperacillin/tazobactam resulted in similar bop and ppd improvements. at week 26  and at the subject level, the prevalence of 4/74 pathogens was found at lower counts in the group receiving local antibiotics. clinical relevance: administration of piperacillin/tazobactam reduces the prevalence of fusobacterium, p. micra, and t. denticola to a greater extent than debridement alone but with no short-term differences in ppd or bop.

TI  == gingival fluid cytokine expression and subgingival bacterial counts during pregnancy and postpartum: a case series.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to assess gingival fluid (gcf) cytokine messenger rna (mrna) levels, subgingival bacteria, and clinical periodontal conditions during a normal pregnancy to postpartum. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial samples were analyzed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gcf samples were assessed with real-time pcr including five proinflammatory cytokines and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. results: nineteen pregnant women with a mean age of 32 years (s.d. +/- 4 years, range 26-42) participated in the study. full-mouth bleeding scores (bop) decreased from an average of 41.2% (s.d. +/- 18.6%) at the 12th week of pregnancy to 26.6% (s.d. +/- 14.4%) at the 4-6 weeks postpartum (p < 0.001). between week 12 and 4-6 weeks postpartum, the mean probing pocket depth changed from 2.4 mm (s.d. +/- 0.4) to 2.3 mm (s.d. +/- 0.3) (p = 0.34). higher counts of eubacterium saburreum, parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and staphylococcus aureus were found at week 12 of pregnancy than at the 4-6 weeks postpartum examinations (p < 0.001). during and after pregnancy, statistically significant correlations between bop scores and bacterial counts were observed. bop scores and gcf levels of selected cytokines were not related to each other and no differences in gcf levels of the  cytokines were observed between samples from the 12th week of pregnancy to 4-6 weeks postpartum. decreasing postpartum counts of porphyromonas endodontalis and  pseudomonas aeruginosa were associated with decreasing levels of il-8 and il-1beta. conclusions: bop decreased after pregnancy without any active periodontal therapy. associations between bacterial counts and cytokine levels varied greatly in pregnant women with gingivitis and a normal pregnancy outcome.  postpartum associations between gcf cytokines and bacterial counts were more consistent. clinical relevance: combined assessments of gingival fluid cytokines  and subgingival bacteria may provide important information on host response.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.
