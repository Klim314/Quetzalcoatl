TI  == a bioinformatics approach to the determination of genes involved in endophytic behavior in burkholderia spp.
AB  == the vast majority of plants harbor endophytic bacteria that colonize a portion of the plant's interior tissues without harming the plant. like plant pathogens, endophytes gain entry into their plants hosts through various mechanisms. bacterial endophytes display a broad range of symbiotic interactions with their host plants. the molecular bases of these plant-endophyte interactions are currently not fully understood. in the present study, a set of genes possibly responsible for endophytic behavior for genus burkholderia was predicted and then compared and contrasted with a number (nine endophytes from different genera) of  endophytes by comparative genome analysis. the nine endophytes included burkholderia phytofirmans psjn, burkholderia spp. strain jk006, azospirillum lipoferum 4b, enterobacter cloacae enhku01, klebsiella pneumoniae 342, pseudomonas putida w619, enterobacter spp. 638, azoarcus spp. bh72, and serratia  proteamaculans 568. from the genomes of the analyzed bacterial strains, a set of  bacterial genes orthologs was identified that are predicted to be involved in determining the endophytic behavior of burkholderia spp. the genes and their possible functions were then investigated to establish a potential connection between their presence and the role they play in bacterial endophytic behavior. nearly all of the genes identified by this bioinformatics procedure encode function previously suggested in other studies to be involved in endophytic behavior.

TI  == characterization of rara, a novel arac family multidrug resistance regulator in klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == transcriptional regulators, such as soxs, rama, mara, and rob, which upregulate the acrab efflux pump, have been shown to be associated with multidrug resistance in clinically relevant gram-negative bacteria. in addition to the multidrug resistance phenotype, these regulators have also been shown to play a role in the cellular metabolism and possibly the virulence potential of microbial cells. as such, the increased expression of these proteins is likely to cause pleiotropic phenotypes. klebsiella pneumoniae is a major nosocomial pathogen which can express the soxs, mara, rob, and rama proteins, and the accompanying paper shows  that the increased transcription of rama is associated with tigecycline resistance (m. veleba and t. schneiders, antimicrob. agents chemother. 56:4466-4467, 2012). bioinformatic analyses of the available klebsiella genome sequences show that an additional arac-type regulator is encoded chromosomally. in this work, we characterize this novel arac-type regulator, hereby called rara  (regulator of antibiotic resistance a), which is encoded in k. pneumoniae, enterobacter sp. 638, serratia proteamaculans 568, and enterobacter cloacae. we show that the overexpression of rara results in a multidrug resistance phenotype  which requires a functional acrab efflux pump but is independent of the other arac regulators. quantitative real-time pcr experiments show that rara (mgh 78578 kpn_02968) and its neighboring efflux pump operon oqxab (kpn_02969_02970) are consistently upregulated in clinical isolates collected from various geographical locations (chile, turkey, and germany). our results suggest that rara overexpression upregulates the oqxab efflux pump. additionally, it appears that oqxr, encoding a gntr-type regulator adjacent to the oqxab operon, is able to downregulate the expression of the oqxab efflux pump, where oqxr complementation  resulted in reductions to olaquindox mics.

TI  == hemolysin as a marker for serratia.
AB  == all serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. dna fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal dna of s. marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. kiliensis, s. grimesii, s. proteamaculans, s. plymutica, s. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. the restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. s. ficaria and s. marinorubra expressed  a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the s. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. the dna of the latter strains did not hybridize with the s. marcescens hemolysin dna probes. some s. marcescens strains, s. kiliensis and s. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. no hybridization was found with dna of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella arerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosus, listeria sp.,  aeromonas sp., legionella sp. and a meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin dna probes are specific for serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than serratia.
