TI  == isolation of anaerobes from bubo associated with chancroid.
AB  == ten men with bubo associated with chancroid were studied for bacterial flora especially anaerobes. anaerobes were isolated from all 10 buboes and eight out of 10 ulcers of chancroid. anaerobic cocci, b melaninogenicus and b fragilis were the most common isolates. anaerobes probably play a role in the pathogenesis of bubo in chancroid.
