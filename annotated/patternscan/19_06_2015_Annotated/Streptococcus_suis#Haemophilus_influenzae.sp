TI  == orientia, rickettsia, and leptospira pathogens as causes of cns infections in laos: a prospective study.
AB  == background: scrub typhus (caused by orientia tsutsugamushi), murine typhus (caused by rickettsia typhi), and leptospirosis are common causes of febrile illness in asia; meningitis and meningoencephalitis are severe complications. however, scarce data exist for the burden of these pathogens in patients with cns disease in endemic countries. laos is representative of vast economically poor rural areas in asia with little medical information to guide public health policy. we assessed whether these pathogens are important causes of cns infections in laos. methods: between jan 10, 2003, and nov 25, 2011, we enrolled  1112 consecutive patients of all ages admitted with cns symptoms or signs requiring a lumbar puncture at mahosot hospital, vientiane, laos. microbiological examinations (culture, pcr, and serology) targeted so-called conventional bacterial infections (streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, s suis) and o tsutsugamushi, rickettsia typhi/rickettsia  spp, and leptospira spp infections in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (csf). we analysed and compared causes and clinical and csf characteristics between patient groups. findings: 1051 (95%) of 1112 patients who presented had csf available for analysis, of whom 254 (24%) had a cns infection attributable to a bacterial or fungal pathogen. 90 (35%) of these 254 infections were caused by o tsutsugamushi, r typhi/rickettsia spp, or leptospira spp. these pathogens were significantly more frequent than conventional bacterial infections (90/1051 [9%] vs 42/1051 [4%]; p<0.0001) by use of conservative diagnostic definitions. cns infections had a high mortality (236/876 [27%]), with 18% (13/71) for r typhi/rickettsia spp, o  tsutsugamushi, and leptospira spp combined, and 33% (13/39) for conventional bacterial infections (p=0.076). interpretation: our data suggest that r typhi/rickettsia spp, o tsutsugamushi, and leptospira spp infections are important causes of cns infections in laos. antibiotics, such as tetracyclines, needed for the treatment of murine typhus and scrub typhus, are not routinely advised for empirical treatment of cns infections. these severely neglected infections represent a potentially large proportion of treatable cns disease burden across vast endemic areas and need more attention. funding: wellcome trust uk.

TI  == the spectrum of central nervous system infections in an adult referral hospital in hanoi, vietnam.
AB  == objectives: to determine prospectively the causative pathogens of central nervous system (cns) infections in patients admitted to a tertiary referral hospital in hanoi, vietnam. methods: from may 2007 to december 2008, cerebrospinal fluid (csf) samples from 352 adults with suspected meningitis or encephalitis underwent routine testing, staining (gram, ziehl-nielsen, india ink), bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction targeting neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. suis, haemophilus influenzae type b, herpes simplex virus (hsv), varicella zoster virus (vzv), enterovirus, and 16s ribosomal rna. blood cultures  and clinically indicated radiology were also performed. patients were classified  as having confirmed or suspected bacterial (bm), tuberculous (tbm), cryptococcal  (crm), eosinophilic (eom) meningitis, aseptic encephalitis/meningitis (aem), neurocysticercosis and others. results: 352 (male: 66%) patients were recruited:  median age 34 years (range 13-85). 95/352 (27.3%) diagnoses were laboratory confirmed and one by cranial radiology: bm (n = 62), tbm (n = 9), aem (n = 19), crm (n = 5), and neurocysticercosis (n = 1, cranial radiology). s. suis predominated as the cause of bm [48/62 (77.4%)]; listeria monocytogenese (n = 1), s. pasteurianus (n = 1) and n. meningitidis (n = 2) were infrequent. aem viruses  were: hsv (n = 12), vzv (n = 5) and enterovirus (n = 2). 5 patients had eom. of 262/352 (74.4%) patients with full clinical data, 209 (79.8%) were hospital referrals and 186 (71%) had been on antimicrobials. 21 (8%) patients died: tbm (15.2%), aem (10%), and bm (2.8%). conclusions: most infections lacked microbiological confirmation. s. suis was the most common cause of bm in this setting. improved diagnostics are needed for meningoencephalitic syndromes to inform treatment and prevention strategies.

TI  == development of a single-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of four pathogens of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == several loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assays have been developed  to detect common causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis (bm). however, no lamp assay is reported to detect streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus suis, which are also among common pathogens of bm. moreover, it is laborious and expensive by performing multiple reactions for each sample to detect bacterial pathogen. thus, we aimed to design and develop a single-tube lamp assay capable of detecting multiple bacterial species, based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna genes of the bacteria. the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna genes of main pathogens involved in bm were aligned to identify conserved regions, which were further used to design broad range specific lamp assay primers. we successfully designed a set of broad range specific lamp assay primers for simultaneous detection of four species including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. suis and s. agalactiae. the broad range lamp assay was highly specific without cross-reactivity with other bacteria including haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis and escherichia coli. the sensitivity of our lamp assay was 100-1000 times higher compared with the conventional pcr assay. the bacterial species could be identified after digestion of the lamp products with restriction endonuclease ddei and haeiii.

TI  == future challenges in the elimination of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == despite the widespread implementation of several effective vaccines over the past few decades, bacterial meningitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis and group b streptococcus (gbs) still results  in unacceptably high levels of human mortality and morbidity. a residual disease  burden due to bacterial meningitis is also apparent due to a number of persistent or emerging pathogens, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp. and streptococcus suis. here, we review the current status of bacterial meningitis caused by these pathogens, highlighting how past and present vaccination programs have attempted to counter  these pathogens. we discuss how improved pathogen surveillance, implementation of current vaccines, and development of novel vaccines may be expected to further reduce bacterial meningitis and related diseases in the future.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  == zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (cas) and metalloproteases (mps) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of  nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. the development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. there is a wealth of data regarding bacterial cas and zinc mps present  in many pathogenic species, such as neisseria spp., helycobacter pylori escherichia coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, haemophilus influenzae, listeria spp, vibrio spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila, streptomyces spp., clostridium spp., enterococcus spp., etc. some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. however, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial mps have been reported except for clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-ca families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and h. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from e. coli, h. pylori, m. tuberculosis, brucella spp., s. pneumoniae, s. enterica and h. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. the catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these cas are well understood as x-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have  been characterized so far. in vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. only  for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis and s. pneumoniae cas it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas and mps represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further  studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

TI  == bacterial carbonic anhydrases as drug targets: toward novel antibiotics?
AB  == carbonic anhydrases (cas, ec 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes which catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. many pathogenic bacteria  encode such enzymes belonging to the alpha-, beta-, and/or gamma-ca families. in  the last decade, the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and helicobacter pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from escherichia coli, h. pylori,mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and haemophilus influenzae have been cloned and characterized in detail. for some of  these enzymes the x-ray crystal structures were determined, and in vitro and in vivo inhibition studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates reported. although efficient inhibitors have been reported for many such enzymes, only for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis, and  s. pneumoniae enzymes it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas represent promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in hong kong: 10-years' experience.
AB  == objective: we studied the etiology, clinical features and outcome of patients with bacterial meningitis from an urban chinese city over a 10-years period. methods: we reviewed the files of all persons aged 15-years old or above diagnosed with community-acquired bacterial meningitis from a regional hospital.  the clinical findings, relevant laboratory and imaging results as well as outcome were recorded in cases with microbiological evidence of meningitis. neurosurgical and pediatric patients were excluded. results: sixty-five patients between the ages of 15 and 86 years of age (mean 52 years) were identified of whom 18 (28%) died. the four most common causes were mycobacteria tuberculosis (46%), streptococcus pneumoniae (11%), streptococcus suis (9%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (8%). neisseria meningitidis and haemophilus influenzae were rare pathogens. the  annual incidence of community-acquired bacterial meningitis was 1.27/100,000 adults. delay in treatment was associated with a poorer prognosis (p<0.001, or=38.84, ci=7.33-205.80). conclusion: the causative organisms found in this region of china differ from that reported from europe and the us; tuberculous meningitis is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis.

TI  == binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  == mannan-binding protein (mbp), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. after binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, mbp activates the classical pathway of the complement system. to investigate the binding capacity of mbp to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of mbp to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (lps)), used as a positive control  strain, showed binding of radiolabelled mbp at a level of 80% compared with binding of mbp to zymosan. binding of labelled mbp to salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. the binding was inhibited by unlabelled mbp, by mannose and by n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of mbp binding capacities could be determined. the encapsulated neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group a were included: n = 22), n. mucosa (n = 1),  haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low mbp binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (ci) 3.3-40.1%). escherichia coli k1 (n = 11), strep. suis (n = 5), strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and n. meningitidis serogroup a (n = 2) showed intermediate mbp binding capacity of 58.4% (95% ci 40.0-76.8%). a third group consisting of non-encapsulated listeria  monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated h. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated  n. meningitidis (n = 2), n. cinera (n = 1) and n. subflava (n = 1) strains had a  high mbp binding capacity of 87.5% (95% ci 62.5-112.5%). the majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low mbp binding capacity.
