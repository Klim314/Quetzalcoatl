TI  == gardnerella vaginalis bacteremia from pulmonary abscess in a male alcohol abuser.
AB  == a case of gardnerella vaginalis bacteremia is reported. this bacteremia occurred  in a male alcohol abuser who developed definite signs of pulmonary abscess and empyema. streptococcus milleri grew from another blood culture, but gardnerella vaginalis was also isolated from a bronchoscopic aspirate and pleural drainage sample as part of mixed flora containing anaerobes, streptococcus species, neisseria sicca, and a haemophilus sp. we discuss the possible pathogenic character of g. vaginalis outside the genital tract from a review of the literature.
