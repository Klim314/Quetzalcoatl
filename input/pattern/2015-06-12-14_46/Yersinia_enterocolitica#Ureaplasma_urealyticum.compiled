TI  - [Ocular findings in infection-linked immune phenomena and secondary diseases (the so-called Reiter's syndrome)].
AB  - Between 1981 and 1987 the authors saw 12 patients with Reiter's syndrome. Lesions included 6 cases of bilateral conjunctivitis in patients with chlamydial infection, 3 of unilateral serofibrinous iridocyclitis in patients with Yersinia enterocolitica, 1 case of bilateral iridocyclitis in a patient with positive chlamydial complement-binding reaction, 1 case of bilateral follicular conjunctivitis following acute gonococcal urethritis, and one case of unilateral serofibrinous iridocyclitis, in a patient with Ureaplasma urealyticum. Immunohistologic work-up of the conjunctival biopsy from the patient with Urea-plasma urealyticum urethritis revealed IgM deposits in the vascular endothelium of conjunctival vessels, C-3 deposits in the conjunctival stroma, and intercellular IgG in the conjunctival epithelium. Since Reiter's syndrome is interpreted as a sequela of secondary immune diseases following a primary infection that may persist in HLA-B27-positive patients, the patients were treated with both topical and systemic anti-infectious and anti-inflammatory agents.
TI  - [The reactive arthritis syndrome. Rheumatological limits].
AB  - The term reactive arthritis (RA) refers to an inflammatory joint disease in the absence of bacteria in the joint, but which is caused by a distant extra-articular infection. They occur as a result of a variety of infections, which are essentially genital or gastro-intestinal in subjects with a particular genetic predisposition characterized by the presence of the HLA-B27 antigen or one of the CREG group of antigens (B7 - B27 - BW22 - BW42). The most complete clinical expression of reactive arthritis is the Fiessinger-Leroy-Reiter syndrome. Apart from the reactive arthritis with a generally accepted aetiology such as those following infections of the genital tract (Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum or of the gastrointestinal tract: Yersinia enterocolitica and pseudotuberculosis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella minor, Campylobacter jejuni), the authors discuss the possibility of including, in a broader definition of RA, post-streptococcal arthritis and cases of arthritis following gonococcal, meningococcal and Brucella infections. RA does not always have a favourable clinical course. It is not exceptional to see a picture of recurrences with progression towards chronic inflammatory rheumatism.
TI  - [National survey on reactive arthritis by the French Society of Rheumatology].
AB  - In 1982, 3370 cases of inflammatory rheumatism were declared. The geographical analysis of the distribution of these cases (departmental and regional) suggests that their distribution is not homogeneous throughout the country, with a predominance of psoriatic arthritis in the Midi and the Pyrenees and a predominance of rheumatic pelvispondylitis in Aquitaine. Based on the number of cases declared, we can calculate the distribution of each type of inflammatory rheumatism by age and by sex and the incidence per million inhabitants in each age group. These figures are only indicative, as the data from some departments was incomplete. The calculation of a "criterion of frequency" attempts to equalize this bias. Reactive arthritis (352 cases) represents 10.4 p. cent of all cases of inflammatory rheumatism. This large series collected over one year confirms the clinical data already established. The responsible organisms, by order of frequency, were: Chlamydia trachomatis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella, Y. pseudotuberculosis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. 50 p. cent of these cases of arthritis were classified as reactive on the basis of clinical findings and history and the bacteria was not isolated. The HLA-B27 antigen is present in 68 p. cent of the 302 cases in which it was tested.
