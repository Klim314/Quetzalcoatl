TI  == oscillibacter valericigenes gen. nov., sp. nov., a valerate-producing anaerobic bacterium isolated from the alimentary canal of a japanese corbicula clam.
AB  == a mesophilic, strictly anaerobic bacterium, strain sjm18-20(t), was isolated from the alimentary canal of a japanese corbicula clam. cells of strain sjm18-20(t) were gram-negative, non-sporulating, straight to slightly curved rods, 2.5-6.0 microm long, and were motile with oscillatory movements by means of peritrichous  flagella. cells elongated to 30 microm after prolonged cultivation. optimum growth was observed at 30 degrees c and ph 6.0-6.5. growth occurred below 4.0 % (w/v) nacl. strain sjm18-20(t) produced acid from d-glucose and a few pentoses such as l-arabinose, d-ribose and d-xylose. n-valeric acid was the major end product from glucose. the genomic dna g+c content of strain sjm18-20(t) was 52.9  mol%. phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rrna gene revealed that strain sjm18-20(t) could be accommodated in clostridial cluster iv of the low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria and that the closest neighbour of this organism (92.6-92.9 % similarity) was the cloned 16s rrna gene sequence of a not-yet cultured bacterium, thought to represent oscillospira guilliermondii. the nearest cultivated neighbours of strain sjm18-20(t) were clostridium orbiscindens dsm 6740(t) and clostridium viride t2-7(t), with sequence similarities of 91.3 and 89.1 %, respectively. on the basis of phenotypic features and phylogenetic position, it is proposed that this isolate represents a novel species in a new genus, oscillibacter valericigenes gen. nov., sp. nov. the type strain of oscillibacter valericigenes is sjm18-20(t) (=nbrc 101213(t) =dsm 18026(t)).
