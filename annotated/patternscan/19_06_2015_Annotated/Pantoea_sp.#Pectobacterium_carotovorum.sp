TI  == functional characterization of the sucrose isomerase responsible for trehalulose  production in plant-associated pectobacterium species.
AB  == fifty-three plant-associated microorganisms were investigated for their ability to convert sucrose to its isomers. these microorganisms included one dickeya zeae isolate and 7 enterobacter, 3 pantoea, and 43 pectobacterium species. eleven out  of the 53 strains (21%) showed the ability to transform sucrose to isomaltulose and trehalulose. among those, pectobacterium carotovorum kkh 3-1 showed the highest bioconversion yield (97.4%) from sucrose to its isomers. in this strain,  the addition of up to 14% sucrose in the medium enhanced sucrose isomerase (siase) production. the siase activity at 14% sucrose (47.6 u/mg dcw) was about 3.6-fold higher than that of the negative control (13.3 u/mg dcw at 0% sucrose).  the gene encoding siase, which is comprised a 1776 bp open reading frame (orf) encoding 591 amino acids, was cloned from p. carotovorum kkh 3-1 and expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant siase (pcsi) was shown to have optimum activity at ph 6.0 and 40 degrees c. the reaction temperature significantly affected the ratio of sucrose isomers produced by pcsi. the amount of trehalulose increased from 47.5% to 79.1% as temperature was lowered from 50 degrees c to 30 degrees c, implying that siase activity can be controlled by reaction temperature.

TI  == [species composition of agents of the horsetail common (equisetum arvense l.) bacteriosises].
AB  == bacterial diseases of weeds horsetail common (equisetum arvense l.) were revealed in the crops of wheat and soya in the fields of kyiv and vinnitsia regions of ukraine. the distinctive symptoms of bacterial affections on the root neck, on stalks of vegetative and spore shoots, on twigs were brown, dark brown or almost  black necrotic spots of oblong form. the necroses increased in size, embraced the stalks. the stalks broke, the plants dried up. patterns of affected plants, isolated and identified phytopathogenic bacteria pseudomonas syringae, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, pantoea agglomerans and curtobacterium sp. were analyzed these bacteria caused pathological process on the horsetail common, wheat and soy under the conditions of artificial inoculation. the composition of bacteria species was different in different years depending on temperature conditions of vegetative period.

TI  == [phytopathogenic bacteria of couch-grass in the crops of wheat].
AB  == bacterialdiseases of weeds in the crops of wheat on the fields of kyiv and vinnytsya regions of ukraine elytrigia repens (l.) nevski agropyrum repens l. were revealed. the following symptoms of bacterial affections: the leaves wither, oval or hatched necrotic spots on green leaves, necroses on the stalks, empty-ears, partial blackening of the ear axes, awns, caryopsises, scales, water-soaked or dark brown with violet shade spots on the rhizomes were found. during the vegetation period bacteria were isolated from the affected plants which caused pathological process in the couch-grass and wheat. the pathogenic bacteria were identified as pseudomonas syringae, p. viridiflava, pseudomonas sp., erwinia carotovora pv. carotovora, pantoea agglomerans, the part of yellow-pigmentary isolates were not identified. some psyringae were isolated from the rhizomes during winterthawing. the paper is presented in ukrainian.

TI  == diverse antibacterial activity of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp.carotovorum isolated in korea.
AB  == fifty-four pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum strains isolated in korea were characterized by a spectrum of antibacterial activities against 7 indicator strains chosen to represent various regions and host plants. all p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum isolates tested could be grouped into 4 classes depending on the pattern of antibacterial substance production. all tested strains had dna fragment(s) homologous to the genes encoding carotovoricin and 21 of them had genes homologous to dna invertase. sixteen strains had genes homologous to the genes encoding carocin s1. several isolates produced antibacterial substances active against strains in brenneria, pantoea, and pectobacterium genera that belonged formerly to the genus erwinia. strains in pseudomonas or xanthomonas sp. were not sensitive to the antibacterial substances produced by p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, except for x. albilineans that was sensitive to antibacterial substances produced by most strains in p. carotovorum  subsp. carotovorum and p. betavasculorum kacc10056. these results demonstrated the diverse patterns of antibacterial substance production and the possibility of the existence of new antibacterial substance(s) produced by p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum isolated in korea.
