TI  == [actinomycosis infection of the cerebellum].
AB  == the case is presented of a 37-year-old male with a cerebellar abscess due to actinomyces israelii. the patient was admitted after dental surgery because of fever and symptoms indicative of raised, intracranial pressure. no abnormalities  were detected in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid. ct scan revealed a space-occupying lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere with perifocal oedema and occlusive hydrocephalus. after emergency external ventriculostomy complete removal of the mass was achieved in a two-stage surgical procedure. culture of the pus under anaerobic conditions resulted in a growth of actinomyces israelii,  peptostreptococcus anaerobius and bifidobacterium adolescentis. a 20-day regimen  of antibiotics including penicillin g 10 million u x 3/d and clindamycin 900 mg x 3/d was administered. the patient made a full recovery. pathogenesis and therapeutic principles of cns infections due to actinomyces israellii are discussed.

TI  == biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.

TI  == [antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  == antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, bacteroides and fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with  metronidazole. in addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against p. prevotii, b. fragilis ss. fragilis and f. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in gam broth containing  of 4 mic, 2 mic, 1 mic and 1/2 mic of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. all the strains of peptococcus and peptostreptococcus including p. anaerobius, p. saccharolyticus, p. prevotii and ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. a concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of bacteroides including b. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). to this concentration all strains of fusobacterium including f. varium (20 strains), f. mortiferum (2 strains) and other fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.
