TI  == cervical microbiota in women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes.
AB  == objective: to analyze the cervical microbiota in women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (pprom) by pyrosequencing and to document associations between cervical microbiota, cervical inflammatory response, microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (miac), histological chorioamnionitis, and intraamniotic infection (iai). study design: sixty-one women with singleton pregnancies complicated by pprom were included in the study. specimens of cervical and amniotic fluid were collected on admission. the cervical microbiota was assessed  by 16s rrna gene sequencing by pyrosequencing. interleukin (il)-6 concentration in the cervical fluid and amniotic fluid was measured by elisa and lateral flow immunoassay, respectively. results: four bacterial community state types [cst i (lactobacillus crispatus dominated), cst iii (lactobacillus iners dominated), cst iv-a (non-lactobacillus bacteria dominated), and cst iv-b (gardnerella vaginalis  and sneathia sanguinegens dominated)] were observed in the cervical microbiota of women with pprom. cervical fluid il-6 concentrations differed between csts (cst i = 145 pg/ml, cst iii = 166 pg/ml, cst iv-a = 420 pg/ml, and cst iv-b = 322 pg/ml; p = 0.004). there were also differences in the rates of miac, of both miac and histological chorioamnionitis, and of iai among csts. no difference in the rate of histological chorioamnionitis was found among csts. conclusions: the cervical  microbiota in pprom women in this study was characterized by four csts. the presence of non-lactobacillus csts was associated with a strong cervical inflammatory response and higher rates of miac, both miac and histological chorioamnionitis, and iai representing a pprom subtype with pronounced inflammation. cst i represents the dominant type of pprom with a low rate of miac, iai, and the combination of miac and histological chorioamnionitis.

TI  == the significance of lactobacillus crispatus and l. vaginalis for vaginal health and the negative effect of recent sex: a cross-sectional descriptive study across groups of african women.
AB  == background: women in sub-saharan africa are vulnerable to acquiring hiv infection and reproductive tract infections. bacterial vaginosis (bv), a disruption of the  vaginal microbiota, has been shown to be strongly associated with hiv infection.  risk factors related to potentially protective or harmful microbiota species are  not known. methods: we present cross-sectional quantitative polymerase chain reaction data of the lactobacillus genus, five lactobacillus species, and three bv-related bacteria (gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, and prevotella bivia) together with escherichia coli and candida albicans in 426 african women across different groups at risk for hiv. we selected a reference group of adult hiv-negative women at average risk for hiv acquisition and compared species variations in subgroups of adolescents, hiv-negative pregnant women, women engaging in traditional vaginal practices, sex workers and a group of hiv-positive women on combination antiretroviral therapy. we explored the associations between presence and quantity of the bacteria with bv by nugent score, in relation to several factors of known or theoretical importance. results: the presence of species across kenyan, south african and rwandan women was remarkably similar and few differences were seen between the two groups of reference women in kenya and south africa. the rwandan sex workers and hiv-positive women had the highest g. vaginalis presence (p = 0.006). pregnant women had a higher lactobacillus genus mean log (7.01 genome equivalents (geq)/ml) compared to the reference women (6.08 geq/ml). l. vaginalis (43%) was second to l. iners (81.9%) highly present in women with a normal nugent score. recent sexual exposure negatively affected the presence of l. crispatus (<0.001), l. vaginalis (p = 0.001), and lactobacillus genus (p < 0.001). having more than one sexual partner in the last three months was associated with an increased prevalence of g. vaginalis (p = 0.044) and l. iners (p = 0.001). conclusions: although the composition of species across the studied african countries was similar, the presence of protective species i.e. l. crispatus and l. vaginalis in women with a normal nugent score appeared lower compared to non-african studies.  furthermore, lactobacillus species were negatively affected by sexual behavioural. strategies to support protective lactobacillus species are urgently  needed. trial registration: the study is registered at the trial registration at  the national health research ethics council south africa with the number doh2709103223.

TI  == complementary seminovaginal microbiome in couples.
AB  == the genital tract microbiome is tightly associated with reproductive health. although many research studies have been performed on the vaginal microbiome, current knowledge of the male microbiome is scarce, and parallel studies examining couples are extremely rare. in this work, we aimed to compare seminal and vaginal microbiomes in couples and to assess the influence of sexual intercourse on vaginal microbiome. the study included 23 couples. microbiomes of  semen and vaginal fluid (pre- and post-intercourse) were profiled using illumina  hiseq2000 sequencing of the v6 region of 16s rrna gene. seminal communities were  significantly more diverse, but with lower total bacterial concentrations than those of the vagina. gardnerella vaginalis was predominant in half of the women whose partners had significant leukocytospermia, but only in one of 17 women who  had a partner without leukocytospermia. there was significant decrease in the relative abundance of lactobacillus crispatus after intercourse, and high concordance between semen and vaginal samples. our data support the hypothesis that semen and vaginal microbiomes are in association, inasmuch as the predominance of g. vaginalis in female partners was significantly related to inflammation in male genital tracts.

TI  == cross-sectional analysis of selected genital tract immunological markers and molecular vaginal microbiota in sub-saharan african women, with relevance to hiv  risk and prevention.
AB  == data on immune mediators in the genital tract and the factors that modulate them  in sub-saharan women are limited. cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) samples from 430 sexually active women from kenya, south africa, and rwanda were analyzed for 12 soluble immune mediators using bio-plex and meso scale discovery multiplex platforms, as well as single enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. ten bacterial species were quantified in vaginal swab samples. bacterial vaginosis (bv) was defined by nugent scoring. cvl samples from hiv-infected women showed a clear-cut proinflammatory profile. pregnant women, adolescents, and women engaging in traditional vaginal practices differed in specific soluble markers compared to reference groups of adult hiv-negative women. cervical mucus, cervical ectopy, abnormal vaginal discharge, and having multiple sex partners were each associated with an increase in inflammatory mediators. the levels of interleukin-1alpha (il-1alpha), il-1beta, il-6, il-12(p70), and il-8 were elevated, whereas the il-1ra/il-1(alpha+beta) ratio decreased in women with bv. the level of gamma interferon-induced protein 10 was lower in bv-positive than in bv-negative women, suggesting its suppression as a potential immune evasion mechanism by bv-associated bacteria. lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus vaginalis were  associated with decreased proinflammatory cytokines and each bv-associated species with increased proinflammatory cytokines. remarkably, the in vitro anti-hiv activity of cvl samples from bv-positive women was stronger than that of bv-negative women. in conclusion, we found significant associations of factors, including vaginal microbiota, which can influence immune mediators in the vaginal environment in sexually active women. these factors need to be considered when establishing normative levels or pathogenic cutoffs of biomarkers of inflammation and associated risks in african women.

TI  == the association of uterine cervical microbiota with an increased risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in korea.
AB  == recent studies have suggested potential roles of the microbiome in cervicovaginal diseases. however, there has been no report on the cervical microbiome in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin). we aimed to identify the cervical microbiota of korean women and assess the association between the cervical microbiota and cin, and to determine the combined effect of the microbiota and human papillomavirus (hpv) on the risk of cin. the cervical microbiota of 70 women with cin and 50 control women was analysed using pyrosequencing based on the 16s rrna gene. the associations between specific microbial patterns or abundance of specific microbiota and cin risk were assessed using multivariate logistic regression, and the relative excess risk due to interaction (reri) and the synergy index (s) were calculated. the phyla firmicutes, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, tenericutes, fusobacteria and tm7 were predominant in the microbiota and four distinct community types were observed in all women. a high score of the pattern characterized by predominance of atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus iners with a minority of lactobacillus crispatus had a higher cin risk (or 5.80, 95% ci 1.7319.4) and abundance of a. vaginae had a higher cin risk (or 6.63, 95% ci 1.6127.2). the synergistic effect  of a high score of this microbial pattern and oncogenic hpv was observed (or 34.1, 95% ci 4.95284.5; reri/s, 15.9/1.93). a predominance of a. vaginae, g. vaginalis and l. iners with a concomitant paucity of l. crispatus in the cervical microbiota was associated with cin risk, suggesting that bacterial dysbiosis and  its combination with oncogenic hpv may be a risk factor for cervical neoplasia.

TI  == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == colonization of the upper genital tract by vaginal bacterial species in nonpregnant women.
AB  == objective: the objective of the study was to evaluate the upper genital tract (ugt) presence of vaginal bacterial species using sensitive molecular methods capable of detecting fastidious bacterial vaginosis (bv)-associated bacteria. study design: vaginal swabs were collected prior to hysterectomy. the excised uterus was sterilely opened and swabs collected from the endometrium and upper endocervix. dna was tested in 11 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for 12 bacterial species: lactobacillus iners, l crispatus, l jensenii, gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, megasphaera spp, prevotella spp, leptotrichia/sneathia, bvab1, bvab2, bvab3, and a broad-range16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene assay. endometrial fluid was tested with luminex and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for cytokines and defensins and tissue for gene expression of defensins and cathelicidin. results: we enrolled 58 women: mean aged 43 +/- 7 years, mostly white (n = 46; 79%) and bv negative (n = 43; 74%). by species-specific quantitative pcr, 55 (95%) had ugt colonization with at least 1  species (n = 52) or were positive by 16s pcr (n = 3). the most common species were l iners (45% ugt, 61% vagina), prevotella spp (33% ugt, 76% vagina) and l crispatus (33% ugt, 56% vagina). median quantities of bacteria in the ugt were lower than vaginal levels by 2-4 log10 ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene copies per swab. there were no differences in the endometrial inflammatory markers between women with no bacteria, lactobacillus only, or any bv-associated species in the ugt. conclusion: our data suggest that the endometrial cavity is not sterile in most women undergoing hysterectomy and that the presence of low levels of bacteria in the uterus is not associated with significant inflammation.

TI  == comparative genomics of lactobacillus crispatus suggests novel mechanisms for the competitive exclusion of gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == background: lactobacillus crispatus is a ubiquitous micro-organism encountered in a wide range of host-associated habitats. it can be recovered from the gastrointestinal tract of animals and it is a common constituent of the vaginal microbiota of humans. moreover, l. crispatus can contribute to the urogenital health of the host through competitive exclusion and the production of antimicrobial agents. in order to investigate the genetic diversity of this important urogenital species, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of l. crispatus. results: utilizing the completed genome sequence of a strain st1 and the draft genome sequences of nine other l. crispatus isolates, we defined the scale and scope of the pan- and core genomic potential of l. crispatus. our comparative analysis identified 1,224 and 2,705 ortholog groups present in all or only some of the ten strains, respectively. based on mathematical modeling, sequencing of additional l. crispatus isolates would result in the identification of new genes and functions, whereas the conserved core of the ten strains was a good representation of the final l. crispatus core genome, estimated to level at  about 1,116 ortholog groups. importantly, the current core was observed to encode bacterial components potentially promoting urogenital health. using antibody fragments specific for one of the conserved l. crispatus adhesins, we demonstrated that the l. crispatus core proteins have a potential to reduce the ability of gardnerella vaginalis to adhere to epithelial cells. these findings thereby suggest that l. crispatus core proteins could protect the vagina from g.  vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis. conclusions: our pan-genome analysis provides  insights into the intraspecific genome variability and the collective molecular mechanisms of the species l. crispatus. using this approach, we described the differences and similarities between the genomes and identified features likely to be important for urogenital health. notably, the conserved genetic backbone of l. crispatus accounted for close to 60% of the ortholog groups of an average l. crispatus strain and included factors for the competitive exclusion of g. vaginalis, providing an explanation on how this urogenital species could improve  vaginal health.

TI  == the vaginal microbiota: what have we learned after a decade of molecular characterization?
AB  == we conducted a systematic review of the medline database (u.s. national library of medicine, national institutes of health, bethesda, md, u.s.a) to determine if  consistent molecular vaginal microbiota (vmb) composition patterns can be discerned after a decade of molecular testing, and to evaluate demographic, behavioral and clinical determinants of vmb compositions. studies were eligible when published between 1 january 2008 and 15 november 2013, and if at least one molecular technique (sequencing, pcr, dna fingerprinting, or dna hybridization) was used to characterize the vmb. sixty three eligible studies were identified. these studies have now conclusively shown that lactobacilli-dominated vmb are associated with a healthy vaginal micro-environment and that bacterial vaginosis  (bv) is best described as a polybacterial dysbiosis. the extent of dysbiosis correlates well with nugent score and vaginal ph but not with the other amsel criteria. lactobacillus crispatus is more beneficial than l. iners. longitudinal  studies have shown that a l. crispatus-dominated vmb is more likely to shift to a l. iners-dominated or mixed lactobacilli vmb than to full dysbiosis. data on vmb  determinants are scarce and inconsistent, but dysbiosis is consistently associated with hiv, human papillomavirus (hpv), and trichomonas vaginalis infection. in contrast, vaginal colonization with candida spp. is more common in  women with a lactobacilli-dominated vmb than in women with dysbiosis. cervicovaginal mucosal immune responses to molecular vmb compositions have not yet been properly characterized. molecular techniques have now become more affordable, and we make a case for incorporating them into larger epidemiological studies to address knowledge gaps in etiology and pathogenesis of dysbiosis, associations of different dysbiotic states with clinical outcomes, and to evaluate interventions aimed at restoring and maintaining a lactobacilli-dominated vmb.

TI  == characterization of the vaginal microbiota of healthy canadian women through the  menstrual cycle.
AB  == background: the vaginal microbial community plays a vital role in maintaining women's health. understanding the precise bacterial composition is challenging because of the diverse and difficult-to-culture nature of many bacterial constituents, necessitating culture-independent methodology. during a natural menstrual cycle, physiological changes could have an impact on bacterial growth,  colonization, and community structure. the objective of this study was to assess  the stability of the vaginal microbiome of healthy canadian women throughout a menstrual cycle by using cpn60-based microbiota analysis. vaginal swabs from 27 naturally cycling reproductive-age women were collected weekly through a single menstrual cycle. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed to amplify the universal target region of the cpn60 gene and generate amplicons representative of the microbial community. amplicons were pyrosequenced, assembled into operational taxonomic units, and analyzed. samples were also assayed for total 16s rrna gene content and gardnerella vaginalis by quantitative pcr and screened  for the presence of mollicutes by using family and genus-specific pcr. results: overall, the vaginal microbiome of most women remained relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle, with little variation in diversity and only modest fluctuations in species richness. microbiomes between women were more different than were those collected consecutively from individual women. clustering of microbial profiles revealed the expected groupings dominated by lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus jensenii. interestingly, two additional clusters were dominated by either bifidobacterium breve or a heterogeneous mixture of nonlactobacilli. direct g. vaginalis quantification correlated strongly with its pyrosequencing-read abundance, and mollicutes, including mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma parvum, and ureaplasma urealyticum, were detected in most samples. conclusions: our cpn60-based investigation of the vaginal microbiome demonstrated that in healthy women most vaginal microbiomes remained stable through their menstrual cycle. of interest in these findings was the presence of bifidobacteriales beyond just gardnerella species. bifidobacteriales are frequently underrepresented in 16s rrna gene-based studies, and their detection by cpn60-based investigation suggests that their significance in the vaginal community may be underappreciated.

TI  == comparison of lower genital tract microbiota in hiv-infected and uninfected women from rwanda and the us.
AB  == introduction: previous studies have shown that alterations of the bacterial microbiota in the lower female genital tract influence susceptibility to hiv infection and shedding. we assessed geographic differences in types of genital microbiota between hiv-infected and uninfected women from rwanda and the united states. methods: genera of lower genital tract bacterial microbiota were identified by high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna gene from 46 us women (36 hiv-infected, 10 hiv-uninfected) and 40 rwandan women (18 hiv-infected, 22 hiv-uninfected) with similar proportions of low (0-3) nugent scores. species of lactobacillus were identified by assembling sequences along with reference sequences into phylogenetic trees. prevalence of genera and lactobacillus species were compared using fisher's exact tests. results: overall the seven most prevalent genera were lactobacillus (74%), prevotella (56%), gardnerella (55%), atopobium (42%), sneathia (37%), megasphaera (30%), and parvimonas (26%), observed at similar prevalences comparing rwandan to us women, except for megasphaera (20% vs. 39%, p = 0.06). additionally, rwandan women had higher frequencies of mycoplasma (23% vs. 7%, p = 0.06) and eggerthella (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.02), and lower frequencies of lachnobacterium (8% vs. 35%, p<0.01) and allisonella (5% vs. 30%, p<0.01), compared with us women. the prevalence of mycoplasma was highest (p<0.05) in hiv-infected rwandan women (39%), compared to  hiv-infected us women (6%), hiv-uninfected rwandan (9%) and us (10%) women. the most prevalent lactobacillus species in both rwandan and us women was l. iners (58% vs. 76%, p = 0.11), followed by l. crispatus (28% vs. 30%, p = 0.82), l. jensenii (20% vs. 24%, p = 0.80), l. gasseri (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.37) and l. vaginalis (20% vs. 7%, p = 0.10). discussion: we found similar prevalence of most major bacterial genera and lactobacillus species in rwandan and us women. further work will be needed to establish whether observed differences differentially impact lower genital tract health or susceptibility to genital infections.

TI  == lactobacillus crispatus dominant vaginal microbiome is associated with inhibitory activity of female genital tract secretions against escherichia coli.
AB  == objective: female genital tract secretions inhibit e. coli ex vivo and the activity may prevent colonization and provide a biomarker of a healthy microbiome. we hypothesized that high e. coli inhibitory activity would be associated with a lactobacillus crispatus and/or jensenii dominant microbiome and differ from that of women with low inhibitory activity. study design: vaginal swab cell pellets from 20 samples previously obtained in a cross-sectional study  of near-term pregnant and non-pregnant healthy women were selected based on having high (>90% inhibition) or low (<20% inhibition) anti-e. coli activity. the v6 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene was amplified and sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2000 platform. filtered culture supernatants from lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and gardnerella vaginalis were also assayed for e. coli inhibitory activity. results: sixteen samples (10 with high and 6 with low activity) yielded evaluable microbiome data. there was no difference in the predominant microbiome species in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (n = 8  each). however, there were significant differences between women with high compared to low e. coli inhibitory activity. high activity was associated with a  predominance of l. crispatus (p<0.007) and culture supernatants from l. crispatus exhibited greater e. coli inhibitory activity compared to supernatants obtained from l. iners or g. vaginalis. notably, the e. coli inhibitory activity varied among different strains of l. crispatus. conclusion: microbiome communities with  abundant l. crispatus likely contribute to the e. coli inhibitory activity of vaginal secretions and efforts to promote this environment may prevent e. coli colonization and related sequelae including preterm birth.

TI  == the composition and stability of the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women  is different from that of non-pregnant women.
AB  == background: this study was undertaken to characterize the vaginal microbiota throughout normal human pregnancy using sequence-based techniques. we compared the vaginal microbial composition of non-pregnant patients with a group of pregnant women who delivered at term. results: a retrospective case-control longitudinal study was designed and included non-pregnant women (n = 32) and pregnant women who delivered at term (38 to 42 weeks) without complications (n =  22). serial samples of vaginal fluid were collected from both non-pregnant and pregnant patients. a 16s rrna gene sequence-based survey was conducted using pyrosequencing to characterize the structure and stability of the vaginal microbiota. linear mixed effects models and generalized estimating equations were used to identify the phylotypes whose relative abundance was different between the two study groups. the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women was different from that of non-pregnant women (higher abundance of lactobacillus vaginalis, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii and lower abundance of 22 other phylotypes in pregnant women). bacterial community state type (cst) iv-b or cst iv-a characterized by high relative abundance of species of genus atopobium as well as the presence of prevotella, sneathia, gardnerella, ruminococcaceae, parvimonas, mobiluncus and other taxa previously shown to be associated with bacterial vaginosis were less frequent in normal pregnancy. the stability of the  vaginal microbiota of pregnant women was higher than that of non-pregnant women;  however, during normal pregnancy, bacterial communities shift almost exclusively  from one cst dominated by lactobacillus spp. to another cst dominated by lactobacillus spp. conclusion: we report the first longitudinal study of the vaginal microbiota in normal pregnancy. differences in the composition and stability of the microbial community between pregnant and non-pregnant women were observed. lactobacillus spp. were the predominant members of the microbial community in normal pregnancy. these results can serve as the basis to study the  relationship between the vaginal microbiome and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  == reciprocal interference between lactobacillus spp. and gardnerella vaginalis on initial adherence to epithelial cells.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common vaginal disorder in women of child-bearing age. it is widely accepted that the microbial switch from normal microflora to the flora commonly associated with bv is characterized by a decrease in vaginal colonization by specific lactobacillus species together with  an increase of g. vaginalis and other anaerobes. however, the order of events leading to the development of bv remains poorly characterized and it is unclear whether the decrease in lactobacilli is a cause or a consequence of the increase  in the population density of anaerobes. our goal was to characterize the interaction between two gardnerella vaginalis strains, one of which was isolated  from a healthy woman (strain 5-1) and the other from a woman diagnosed with bv (strain 101), and vaginal lactobacilli on the adherence to cervical epithelial cells. in order to simulate the transition from vaginal health to bv, the lactobacilli were cultured with the epithelial cells first, and then the g. vaginalis strain was introduced. we quantified the inhibition of g. vaginalis adherence by the lactobacilli and displacement of adherent lactobacilli by g. vaginalis. our results confirmed that pathogenic g vaginalis 101 had a higher capacity for adhesion to the cervical epithelial cells than strain 5-1. interestingly, strain 101 displaced l. crispatus but not l. iners whereas strain  5-1 had less of an effect and did not affect the two species differently. furthermore, l. iners actually enhanced adhesion of strain 101 but not of strain  5-1. these results suggest that bv-causing g. vaginalis and l. iners do not interfere with one another, which may help to explain previous reports that women who are colonized with l. iners are more likely to develop bv.

TI  == interactions between lactobacillus crispatus and bacterial vaginosis (bv)-associated bacterial species in initial attachment and biofilm formation.
AB  == certain anaerobic bacterial species tend to predominate the vaginal flora during  bacterial vaginosis (bv), with gardnerella vaginalis being the most common. however, the exact role of g. vaginalis in bv has not yet been determined. the main goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that g. vaginalis is an early  colonizer, paving the way for intermediate (e.g., fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (e.g., prevotella bivia). theoretically, in order to function as  an early colonizer, species would need to be able to adhere to vaginal epithelium, even in the presence of vaginal lactobacilli. therefore, we quantified adherence of g. vaginalis and other bv-associated bacteria to an inert surface pre-coated with lactobacillus crispatus using a new peptide nucleic acid  (pna) fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) methodology. we found that g. vaginalis had the greatest capacity to adhere in the presence of l. crispatus. theoretically, an early colonizer would contribute to the adherence and/or growth of additional species, so we next quantified the effect of g. vaginalis biofilms  on the adherence and growth of other bv-associated species by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) technique. interestingly, g. vaginalis derived a growth benefit from the addition of a second species, regardless of the species.  conversely, g. vaginalis biofilms enhanced the growth of p. bivia, and to a minor extent of f. nucleatum. these results contribute to our understanding of bv biofilm formation and the progression of the disorder.

TI  == identification and characterisation of vaginal lactobacilli from south african women.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv), which is highly prevalent in the african population, is one of the most common vaginal syndromes affecting women in their  reproductive age placing them at increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases including infection by human immunodeficiency virus-1. the vaginal microbiota of  a healthy woman is often dominated by the species belonging to the genus lactobacillus namely l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii and l. iners, which have been extensively studied in european populations, albeit less so in south african women. in this study, we have therefore identified the vaginal lactobacillus species in a group of 40 african women from soweto, a township on the outskirts of johannesburg, south africa. methods: identification was done by  cultivating the lactobacilli on rogosa agar, de man-rogosa-sharpe (mrs) and blood agar plates with 5% horse blood followed by sequencing of the 16s ribosomal dna.  bv was diagnosed on the basis of nugent scores. since some of the previous studies have shown that the lack of vaginal hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) producing lactobacilli is associated with bacterial vaginosis, the lactobacillus isolates were also characterised for their production of h2o2. results: cultivable lactobacillus species were identified in 19 out of 21 women without bv, in three  out of five women with intermediate microbiota and in eight out of 14 women with  bv. we observed that l. crispatus, l. iners, l. jensenii, l. gasseri and l. vaginalis were the predominant species. the presence of l. crispatus was associated with normal vaginal microbiota (p = 0.024). high level of h2o2 producing lactobacilli were more often isolated from women with normal microbiota than from the women with bv, although not to a statistically significant degree (p = 0.064). conclusion: the vaginal lactobacillus species isolated from the cohort of south african women are similar to those identified in european populations. in accordance with the other published studies, l. crispatus is related to a normal vaginal microbiota. hydrogen peroxide production was not significantly associated to the bv status which could be attributed to the limited number of samples or to other antimicrobial factors that might be involved.

TI  == the microbiota of the human genitourinary tract: trying to see the forest through the trees.
AB  == based on traditional microbiological methods, namely cultivation and microscopic  analyses, the vaginal microbiota (vmb) has been defined as healthy when it is predominated by hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus spp., most prominently  lactobacillis crispatus. similarly, the vmb has been defined as bacterial vaginosis (bv) when it is predominated by gardnerella vaginalis as well as a number of other anaerobic bacterial species. bv is associated with a distinct vaginal discharge syndrome, poor pregnancy outcomes, pelvic inflammatory disease, post-operative wound infections, and endometritis after elective abortions. additionally, bv predisposes women to infection by hiv as well as other sexually  transmitted diseases (stds). the application of molecular techniques over the last decade to studies of the vmb has significantly advanced our understanding of its structure and variation. it is now clear that the diversity of the vmb is far more complex than previously recognized; it is comprised of many heretofore unknown bacteria in addition to those previously identified by culture. here we describe the application of 454 pyrosequencing technology to a study of vaginal specimens from 92 women attending the new orleans std clinic in an effort to obtain a more precise view of how different types of "trees" (bacteria) assemble  to form a recognizable "forest" (vmb). this knowledge will be useful in the design of future clinical studies that investigate the mechanisms by which the vaginal microbiome influences human health and disease.

TI  == effect of sexual debut on vaginal microbiota in a cohort of young women.
AB  == objective: bacterial vaginosis is uncommon in women who are virgins. we estimated effects of sexual debut on vaginal bacterial colonization. methods: women who were virgins and aged 18-22 years enrolled in a study of human papillomavirus acquisition were followed every 4 months for up to 2 years. vaginal swabs from before and after sexual debut or two independent visits for those remaining virgins were tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, gardnerella vaginalis, and the bacterial vaginosis-associated species atopobium vaginae, megasphaera species, leptotrichia species, sneathia species, and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium-1, -2, and -3. results: we evaluated 97 women: 71  who became sexually active and 26 who remained virgins. at first sampling, 22 of  26 (85%) women who remained virgins were colonized with lactobacillus species compared with 22 of 26 (85%) at follow-up (p>.99). g vaginalis was present in 12  of 26 (46%) initially and 11 of 26 (42%) at follow-up (p>.99). among women who became sexually active, colonization with lactobacillus species remained stable:  65 of 71 (92%) compared with 66 of 71 (93%) (p>.99), whereas colonization with g  vaginalis increased (28 of 71 [39%] compared with 40 of 71 [56%]; p=.02). among women who did not initiate sexual activity during the study, two of 26 (8%) had any bacterial vaginosis-associated species detected at both the first and second  visits (p>.99). among women who became sexually active during the study, 15 of 71 (21%) were colonized with bacterial vaginosis-associated species initially compared with 13 of 71 (18%) after sexual debut (p=.77). conclusions: among women who were virgins, vaginal colonization with bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterial species is uncommon and does not change after sexual debut.

TI  == phase i randomized safety study of twice daily dosing of acidform vaginal gel: candidate antimicrobial contraceptive.
AB  == background: acidform gel, an acid-buffering product that inactivates spermatozoa, may be an effective topical non-hormonal contraceptive. this study was designed to evaluate the safety of vaginal dosing and effects of acidform on mucosal immune mediators, antimicrobial properties of genital secretions, and vaginal microbiota. methods: thirty-six sexually abstinent u.s. women were randomized to  apply acidform or hydroxyethylcellulose (hec) placebo gel twice daily for 14 consecutive days. safety was assessed by symptoms and pelvic examination. the impact of gel on mucosal immunity was assessed by quantifying cytokines, chemokines, antimicrobial proteins and antimicrobial activity of genital secretions collected by cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) at screening, 2 hours after gel application, and on days 7, 14 and 21. vaginal microbiota was characterized at enrollment and day 14 using species-specific quantitative pcr assays. results: the median vaginal and cervical ph was significantly lower 2 hours after application of acidform and was associated with an increase in the bactericidal activity of cvl against e. coli. however, 65% of women who received acidform had  at least one local adverse event compared with 11% who received placebo (p = 0.002). while there was no increase in inflammatory cytokines or chemokines, cvl  concentrations of lactoferrin and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra), an  anti-inflammatory protein, were significantly lower following acidform compared to hec placebo gel application. there were no significant changes in lactobacillus crispatus or lactobacillus jensenii in either group but there was a decrease in gardnerella vaginalis in the acidform group (p = 0.08). conclusions:  acidform gel may augment mucosal defense as evidenced by an increase in bactericidal activity of genital secretions against e. coli and a decrease in gardnerella vaginalis colonization. however, acidform was associated with more irritation than placebo and lower levels of antimicrobial (lactoferrin) and anti-inflammatory (il-1ra) proteins. these findings indicate the need for additional safety studies of this candidate non-hormonal contraceptive. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct00850837.

TI  == longitudinal qpcr study of the dynamics of l. crispatus, l. iners, a. vaginae, (sialidase positive) g. vaginalis, and p. bivia in the vagina.
AB  == background: to obtain more detailed understanding of the causes of disturbance of the vaginal microflora (vmf), a longitudinal study was carried out for 17 women during two menstrual cycles. methods: vaginal swabs were obtained daily from 17 non-pregnant, menarchal volunteers. for each woman, gram stains were scored, the  quantitative changes of 5 key vaginal species, i.e. atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus crispatus, l. iners, (sialidase positive) gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia were quantified with qpcr and hydrogen-peroxide production was assessed on tmb+ agar. results: women could be divided in 9 subjects with predominantly normal vmf (grades ia, ib and iab, group n) and 8 with predominantly disturbed vmf (grades i-like, ii, iii and iv, group d). vmf was variable between women, but overall stable for most of the women. menses were the strongest disturbing factor of the vmf. l. crispatus was present at log7-9 cells/ml in grade ia, iab and ii vmf, but concentrations declined 100-fold during menses. l. crispatus below log7 cells/ml corresponded with poor h(2)o(2)-production. l. iners was present at log 10 cells/ml in grade ib, ii and  iii vmf. sialidase negative g. vaginalis strains (average log5 cells/ml) were detected in grade i, i-like and iv vmf. in grade ii vmf, predominantly a mixture  of both sialidase negative and positive g. vaginalis strains (average log9 cells/ml) were present, and predominantly sialidase positive strains in grade iii vmf. the presence of a. vaginae (average log9 cells/ml) coincided with grade ii and iii vmf. p. bivia (log4-8 cells/ml) was mostly present in grade iii vaginal microflora. l. iners, g. vaginalis, a. vaginae and p. bivia all increased around  menses for group n women, and as such l. iners was considered a member of disturbed vmf. conclusions: this qpcr-based study confirms largely the results of previous culture-based, microscopy-based and pyrosequencing-based studies.

TI  == association between trichomonas vaginalis and vaginal bacterial community composition among reproductive-age women.
AB  == objectives: some vaginal bacterial communities are thought to prevent infection by sexually transmitted organisms. prior work demonstrated that the vaginal microbiota of reproductive-age women cluster into 5 types of bacterial communities; 4 dominated by lactobacillus species (l. iners, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii) and 1 (termed community state type (cst) iv) lacking significant numbers of lactobacilli and characterized by higher proportions of atopobium, prevotella, parvimonas, sneathia, gardnerella, mobiluncus, and other taxa. we sought to evaluate the relationship between vaginal bacterial composition and trichomonas vaginalis. methods: self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained cross-sectionally from 394 women equally representing 4 ethnic/racial groups. t. vaginalis screening was performed using pcr targeting the 18s rrna and beta-tubulin genes. vaginal bacterial composition was characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16s rrna genes. a panel of 11 microsatellite markers was used to genotype t. vaginalis. the association between vaginal microbiota and t. vaginalis was evaluated by exact logistic regression. results: t. vaginalis was detected in 2.8% of participants (11/394). of the 11 t. vaginalis-positive cases, 8 (72%) were categorized as cst-iv, 2 (18%) as communities dominated by l. iners, and 1 (9%) as l. crispatus-dominated (p = 0.05). cst-iv microbiota were associated with an 8-fold increased odds of detecting t. vaginalis compared with  women in the l. crispatus-dominated state (or: 8.26, 95% ci: 1.07-372.65). seven  of the 11 t. vaginalis isolates were assigned to 2 genotypes. conclusion: t. vaginalis was associated with vaginal microbiota consisting of low proportions of lactobacilli and high proportions of mycoplasma, parvimonas, sneathia, and other  anaerobes.

TI  == quantification of bacterial species of the vaginal microbiome in different groups of women, using nucleic acid amplification tests.
AB  == background: the vaginal microbiome plays an important role in urogenital health.  quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assays for the most prevalent vaginal lactobacillus species and bacterial vaginosis species g. vaginalis and a. vaginae exist, but qpcr information regarding variation over time is still very limited. we set up qpcr assays for a selection of seven species and defined the temporal variation over three menstrual cycles in a healthy caucasian population with a normal nugent score. we also explored differences in qpcr data between these healthy women and an 'at risk' clinic population of caucasian, african and asian women with and without bacterial vaginosis (bv), as defined by the nugent score. results: temporal stability of the lactobacillus species counts was high with l. crispatus counts of 108 copies/ml and l. vaginalis counts of 106 copies/ml. we identified 2 types of 'normal flora' and one 'bv type flora' with latent class analysis on the combined data of all women. the first group was particularly common in women with a normal nugent score and was characterized by a high frequency of l. crispatus, l. iners, l. jensenii, and l. vaginalis and a correspondingly low frequency of l. gasseri and a. vaginae. the second group was characterized by the predominance of l. gasseri and l. vaginalis and was found most commonly in healthy caucasian women.  the third group was commonest in women with a high nugent score but was also seen in a subset of african and asian women with a low nugent score and was characterized by the absence of lactobacillus species (except for l. iners) but the presence of g. vaginalis and a. vaginae. conclusions: we have shown that the  quantification of specific bacteria by qpcr contributes to a better description of the non-bv vaginal microbiome, but we also demonstrated that differences in populations such as risk and ethnicity also have to be taken into account. we believe that our selection of indicator organisms represents a feasible strategy  for the assessment of the vaginal microbiome and could be useful for monitoring the microbiome in safety trials of vaginal products.

TI  == characteristics of lactobacillus and gardnerella vaginalis from women with or without bacterial vaginosis and their relationships in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the objectives of the present study were to evaluate in vitro the production of antagonistic compounds against gardnerella vaginalis by lactobacillus strains isolated from women with or without bacterial vaginosis (bv), and to select one of the better lactobacillus producers of such a substance to be tested in vivo using a gnotobiotic animal model challenged with one of the more sensitive g. vaginalis isolates. a total of 24 isolates from women with and without bv were identified as g. vaginalis. a higher frequency (p<0.05) of this bacterium was observed in women with bv (56.7%) when compared to healthy women (17.6%). a total of 86 strains of lactobacillus were obtained from healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus strains were more frequently present (p<0.05) in healthy women  (97.5%) than in women with bv (76.7%). lactobacillus crispatus was the predominating strain in both healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus vaginalis were isolated with an intermediate frequency in the two groups. in vitro antagonism assays were performed using as indicators 17 reference strains and the g. vaginalis strains isolated from women with bv and from healthy women.  lactobacillus isolated from healthy women showed the higher antagonistic activity against all the indicator strains when compared with isolates from women with bv. concerning the indicator strains, g. vaginalis found in women with bv was more resistant to the antagonism, particularly when lactobacillus isolates from women  with bv were used as producer strains. a high vaginal population level of g. vaginalis was obtained by intravaginal inoculation of germ-free mice, and this colonization was accompanied by vaginal histopathological lesions. a tenfold decrease in vaginal population level of g. vaginalis and a reduction of histological lesions were observed when the pathogenic challenge was performed in mice previously monoassociated with an l. johnsonii strain. concluding, results of the present study suggest that progression of g. vaginalis-associated bv depends in part on a simultaneous presence of lactobacillus populations with a low antagonistic capacity and of a g. vaginalis strain with a high resistance to  this antagonism. the results could also explain why g. vaginalis is frequently found in the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women.

TI  == development and validation of a semiquantitative, multitarget pcr assay for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == quantitative pcr assays were developed for 4 organisms reported previously to be  useful positive indicators for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (bv)--atopobium vaginae, bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium 2 (bvab-2), gardnerella vaginalis, and megasphaera-1--and a single organism (lactobacillus crispatus) that has been implicated as a negative indicator for bv. vaginal samples (n = 169), classified as positive (n = 108) or negative (n = 61) for bv based on a combination of the nugent gram stain score and amsel clinical criteria, were analyzed for the presence and quantity of each of the marker organisms, and the results were used to construct a semiquantitative, multiplex pcr assay for bv based on detection of 3 positive indicator organisms (a. vaginae, bvab-2, and megasphaera-1) and classification of samples using a combinatorial scoring system. the prototype bv pcr assay was then used to analyze the 169-member developmental sample set and, in a prospective, blinded manner, an additional 227 bv-classified vaginal samples (110 bv-positive samples and 117 bv-negative samples). the bv pcr assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 96.7% (202/209), a specificity of 92.2% (153/166), a positive predictive value of 94.0%, and a negative predictive value of 95.6%, with 21 samples (5.3%) classified as indeterminate for bv. this assay provides a reproducible and objective means of evaluating critical components of the vaginal microflora in women with signs and symptoms of vaginitis and is comparable in diagnostic accuracy to the conventional gold standard for diagnosis of bv.

TI  == extravaginal reservoirs of vaginal bacteria as risk factors for incident bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) represents shifts in microbiota from lactobacillus spp. to diverse anaerobes. although antibiotics relieve symptoms and temporarily eradicate bv-associated bacteria (bvab), bv usually recurs. we investigated the role of extravaginal bvab reservoirs in recurrence. methods: risks for bv acquisition over the course of 1 year were defined. dna in vaginal,  anal, and oral swab samples from enrollment was subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 16s ribosomal rna genes of gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus crispatus, bvab1, bvab2, bvab3, megasphaera spp., lactobacillus jensenii, and leptotrichia/sneathia spp. a case-control approach analyzed bvab detection at enrollment for case patients (bv acquisition) versus controls (none). results: of 239 women enrolled without bv, 199 were seen in follow-up, and 40 experienced bv; 15 had all samples for analysis. detection of g. vaginalis in oral cavity or anal samples and leptotrichia/sneathia spp. in anal samples was more common at enrollment among case patients, who also had higher concentrations of these bacteria and megasphaera relative to 30 controls at each site. in contrast, l. crispatus was detected more frequently in anal samples among controls. conclusions: women who acquire bv are more likely have previous colonization of extravaginal reservoirs with some bvab, and less likely  to have l. crispatus, suggesting that bvab may be acquired vaginally from extravaginal reservoirs.

TI  == detection of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna genes for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.
AB  == to preliminarily evaluate the applicability of bacterial dna as a marker for the  forensic identification of vaginal fluid, we developed and performed pcr-based detection of 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus spp. dominating the vagina  and of bacterial vaginosis-related bacteria from dna extracted from body fluids and stains. as a result, 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii and atopobium vaginae were specifically detected in vaginal fluid and female urine samples. bacterial genes detected in female urine  might have originated from contaminated vaginal fluid. in addition, those of lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis were also detected in non-vaginal body fluids such as semen. because bacterial genes were successfully amplified in dna samples extracted by using the general procedure for animal tissues without any optional treatments, dna samples prepared for the  identification of vaginal fluid can also be used for personal identification. in  conclusion, 16s ribosomal rna genes of l. crispatus, l. jensenii and a. vaginae could be effective markers for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.

TI  == evidence for gardnerella vaginalis uptake and internalization by squamous vaginal epithelial cells: implications for the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv), a common condition seen in premenopausal women, is associated with preterm labor, pelvic inflammatory disease, and delivery of low birth weight infants. gardnerella vaginalis is the predominant bacterial species  associated with bv, although its exact role in the pathology of bv is unknown. using immunofluorescence, confocal and transmission electron microscopy, we found that vk2 vaginal epithelial cells take up g. vaginalis after exposure to the bacteria. confocal microscopy also indicated the presence of internalized g. vaginalis within vaginal epithelial cells obtained from a subject with bv. using  vk2 cells and (35)s labeled bacteria in an invasion assay, we found that a 1 h uptake of g. vaginalis was 21.8-fold higher than heat-killed g. vaginalis, 84-fold compared to lactobacillus acidophilus and 6.6-fold compared to lactobacillus crispatus. internalization was inhibited by pre-exposure of cells to cytochalasin-d. in addition, the cytoskeletal protein vimentin was upregulated in vk2 cells exposed to g. vaginalis, but there was no change in actin cytoskeletal polymerization/rearrangements or vimentin subcellular relocalization post exposure. cytoskeletal protein modifications could represent a potential mechanism for g. vaginalis mediated internalization by vaginal epithelial cells.  finally, understanding vaginal bacteria/host interactions will allow us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of bv pathogenesis.

TI  == [bacterial vaginosis in 2011: a lot of questions remain].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is one of the most frequent vaginal affections. it results from a deep imbalance of the vaginal ecosystem whose mechanisms remain mysterious, even if recent progress were accomplished in their comprehension: if  the flora implied in the bacterial vaginosis is recognized like polymorphic, it appears that gardnerella vaginalis plays a major part with two genomically different forms: a commensal form (slightly adhesive to the epithelial cells), and a pathogenic one (strongly adhesive to the epithelial cells); the changes in  lactobacilli are also to take into account: l. iners could be a marker of the vaginal flora imbalance whereas l. crispatus is generally met in the normal vaginal flora. these findings could influence the composition of coming probiotics; it is recognized that bacterial vaginosis is involved in the risk of  prematurity but molecular quantification of g. vaginalis (and of atopobium vaginae) is more sensitive for the diagnosis of bv what could improve the detection of high-risk pregnant women. the isolated antibiotic treatments are not very effective on the prevention of recurrences. the rebalancing of the vaginal flora is essential. in this field, the local estrogens showed some effectiveness. the use of probiotics is promising and can be recommended in complement of the antibiotic treatment even if the results of the clinical studies are still too heterogeneous to lead to precise indications.

TI  == effects of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria and sexual intercourse on vaginal colonization with the probiotic lactobacillus crispatus ctv-05.
AB  == objective: several fastidious bacteria have been associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv), but their role in lactobacilli recolonization failure is unknown. we studied the effect of 7 bv-associated bacterial species and 2 lactobacillus species on vaginal colonization with lactobacillus crispatus ctv-05 (lactin-v). methods: twenty-four women with bv were given a 5-day course of metronidazole vaginal gel and then randomized 3:1 to receive either lactin-v or placebo applied vaginally once daily for 5 initial consecutive days, followed by a weekly application over 2 weeks. vaginal swabs for l. crispatus ctv-05 culture and 9 bacterium-specific 16s rrna gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were analyzed on several study visits for the 18 women receiving lactin-v. results: vaginal colonization with ctv-05 was achieved in 61% of the participants receiving lactin-v at either day 10 or day 28 visit and 44% at day 28. participants not colonized with ctv-05 had generally higher median concentrations of bv-associated bacteria compared to those who colonized. between enrollment and day 28, the median concentration of gardnerella vaginalis minimally reduced from  10 to 10 16s rrna gene copies per swab in women who colonized with ctv-05 but increased from 10 to 10 in those who failed to colonize (p = 0.19). similarly, the median concentration of atopobium spp. reduced from 10 16s rrna gene copies per swab to below limit of detection in women who colonized with ctv-05, but increased from 10 to 10 in those who failed to colonize (p = 0.04). the presence  of endogenous l. crispatus at enrollment was found to be significantly associated with a reduced odds of colonization with ctv-05 on day 28 (p = 0.003), and vaginal intercourse during the study significantly impaired successful ctv-05 colonization (p = 0.018). conclusion: vaginal concentration of certain bv-associated bacteria, vaginal intercourse during treatment, and the presence of endogenous l. crispatus at enrollment predict colonization with probiotic lactobacilli.

AB  == a group of lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of 31 healthy women was characterized by (gtg)(5)-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) fingerprinting in order to evaluate this method for identification of vaginal lactobacilli. obtained fingerprints were compared with profiles available in an in-house database of the ccm bacteria collection covering type and reference strains of multiple lactic acid bacteria including lactobacilli. selected strains representing individual clusters were further identified by phes gene sequencing. in total, six lactobacillus species were found among lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of healthy women. the (gtg)(5)-pcr method identified lactobacillus gasseri (11 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (one), and some of the lactobacillus jensenii strains (eight out of 11), but failed to identify the remaining strains, including the lactobacillus crispatus (18), lactobacillus mucosae (one), and lactobacillus vaginalis (one) species. l. jensenii strains were distributed over  two fingerprint clusters. the majority of samples was dominated by one (gtg)(5)-pcr type. the rep-pcr fingerprinting using the (gtg)(5) primer allowed straightforward identification of many, but not all, isolates. this method has been shown to be a useful tool for fast screening and grouping of vaginal lactobacilli, but its combination with another identification method is needed to obtain reliable identification results. in addition, lactobacillus acidophilus was not shown to be the most common inhabitant of the female genital tract as generally assumed.

TI  == correlation between api 50 ch and multiplex polymerase chain reaction for the identification of vaginal lactobacilli in isolates.
AB  == identification of lactobacillus sp. strains by phenotypic methods may lead to doubtful results possibly interfering in the reliability of the epidemiological and probiotics studies. therefore this study aimed to determine the best methodology for the identification of the large diversity of lactobacilli species found in the vagina by comparing two techniques, one based on their biochemical profile and other employing molecular biology. a carbohydrate fermentation test (api 50 ch) was compared with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the identification of species of vaginal lactobacilli from 135 healthy women. the kappa index was used to evaluate agreement between the methods. using the molecular technique, l. crispatus (32.6%), l. jensenii (25%) and l. gasseri (20.6%) were the most frequent species. however, using the biochemical technique, the most frequent species were: l. acidophilus (34.8%), l. crispatus (27.2%) and  l. fermentum (13%). although l. acidophilus was the most frequent specie found by biochemical tests, no strain of this microorganism was detected by pcr. agreement between the methods was low for identification of all the most common species. although rates of l. crispatus detected were similar using both methods (32.6% and 27.2%), agreement between them was relatively low (kappa = 0.52). conclusions: our results confirmed the limitation of the biochemical method and the applicability of a previously published molecular method (multiplex pcr) for  the identification of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract, focusing on further necessity of its improvement for also targeting l. vaginalis and l. iners.

AB  == lactobacilli are naturally found in the gastrointestinal tract of chickens, and there is interest in utilizing autochthonous strains for the delivery of therapeutic proteins. previously we identified three chicken-derived lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus agilis la3, lactobacillus vaginalis lv5, and lactobacillus crispatus lc9, which persist in the gastrointestinal tract of chickens fed either a commercial or high-protein diet. in the current study, we investigated the ability to electrotransform these strains, determined plasmid vector stability, and compared reporter gene expression directed by several different promoters. the la3 and lv5 strains were reproducibly transformed with efficiencies of 10(8) and 10(6) transformants per microgram of plasmid dna, respectively. the third strain tested, l. crispatus lc9, was recalcitrant to all  transformation protocols examined. the plasmid vectors ptrk563 and ptrkh2 were maintained over 100 generations in la3 and lv5, respectively. the ability of la3  and lv5 to express the heterologous reporter gene gfp was analyzed using heterologous and homologous promoters. transformants of both la3 and lv5 containing the la3 ldhl promoter were the most fluorescent. to our knowledge, this is the first report of successful transformation and heterologous protein expression in l. agilis and l. vaginalis. the ability of these strains to express heterologous proteins in vitro indicates their potential utility as in vivo delivery vectors for therapeutic peptides to the chicken gastrointestinal tract.

AB  == background: women living with hiv and co-infected with bacterial vaginosis (bv) are at higher risk for transmitting hiv to a partner or newborn. it is poorly understood which bacterial communities constitute bv or the normal vaginal microbiota among this population and how the microbiota associated with bv responds to antibiotic treatment. methods and findings: the vaginal microbiota of 132 hiv positive tanzanian women, including 39 who received metronidazole treatment for bv, were profiled using illumina to sequence the v6 region of the 16s rrna gene. of note, gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus iners were detected in each sample constituting core members of the vaginal microbiota. eight major clusters were detected with relatively uniform microbiota compositions. two clusters dominated by l. iners or l. crispatus were strongly associated with a normal microbiota. the l. crispatus dominated microbiota were associated with low ph, but when l. crispatus was not present, a large fraction of l. iners was required to predict a low ph. four clusters were strongly associated with bv, and were dominated by prevotella bivia, lachnospiraceae, or a mixture of different species. metronidazole treatment reduced the microbial diversity and perturbed the bv-associated microbiota, but rarely resulted in the  establishment of a lactobacilli-dominated microbiota. conclusions: illumina based microbial profiling enabled high though-put analyses of microbial samples at a high phylogenetic resolution. the vaginal microbiota among women living with hiv  in sub-saharan africa constitutes several profiles associated with a normal microbiota or bv. recurrence of bv frequently constitutes a different bv-associated profile than before antibiotic treatment.

TI  == lactobacillus strain ecology and persistence within broiler chickens fed different diets: identification of persistent strains.
AB  == lactobacilli are autochthonous residents in the chicken gastrointestinal tract, where they may potentially be used as probiotics, competitive exclusion agents, or delivery vehicles. the aim of this study was to use an in vivo model to investigate the effect of diet and competing lactic acid bacteria on the colonization of inoculated lactobacillus strains, with the goal of identifying strains which can consistently colonize or persist for an extended period of several weeks. chicken-derived lactobacillus strains were genetically marked with rifampin resistance and administered on day 0 to chickens fed either a normal commercial diet or a specially formulated high-protein diet. chickens fed the high-protein diet were also coinoculated with two different mixes of additional lactic acid bacteria. enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence-based pcr (eric-pcr) was used to identify rifampin-resistant isolates recovered from chickens. three strains, belonging to the species lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus crispatus, and lactobacillus vaginalis, were commonly reisolated from the chickens on both diets at days 21 and 42. the ability of these strains to persist was confirmed in a second chicken trial. all three strains persisted throughout the production period in the chickens fed a commercial diet, while only the l. agilis and l. vaginalis strains persisted in the chickens fed the high-protein diet. in both in vivo trials, competing lactic  acid bacteria modified representation of the strains recovered, with all three stains capable of competing in the presence of one or both mixes of coinoculated  strains. the in vivo model successfully identified three persistent strains that  will be characterized further.

TI  == risks for acquisition of bacterial vaginosis among women who report sex with women: a cohort study.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is common in women who have sex with women.  while cross-sectional data support a role for sexual transmission, risks for incident bv have not been prospectively studied in this group. methodology/principal findings: we studied risks for bv acquisition in a prospective cohort study of women (age 16-35 years) who reported sex with other women (>or=1 partner, prior year). women were followed for one year with examinations at quarterly visits and for genital symptoms at any time. species-specific 16s rrna gene pcrs for bv-associated bacteria (bvab) were applied to vaginal fluid obtained at enrollment. sexual behaviors were ascertained by computer-assisted interview. of 335 participants, 239 had no bv at baseline; 199 were seen in follow-up (median follow-up 355 days, 4.0 visits/subject). forty women experienced >or=1 bv episode. risks for incident bv  were presentation <or=14 days since onset of menses (hazard ratio (hr) 2.3 (95% ci, 1.2-4.7), report of new sex partner with bv history (hr 3.63 (1.1-11.9)), change in vaginal discharge (hr 2.6 (1.3-5.2)) and detection of any of several bvab in vaginal fluid at enrollment, including bvab1 (hr 6.3 (1.4-28.1)), bvab2 (hr 18.2 (6.4-51.8)), bvab3 (hr 12.6 (2.7-58.4)), g. vaginalis (hr 3.9 (1.5-10.4)), atopobium vaginae (hr 4.2 (1.9-9.3)), leptotrichia spp (9.3 (3.0-24.4)), and megasphaera-1 (hr 11.5 (5.0-26.6)). detection of lactobacillus crispatus at enrollment conferred reduced risk for subsequent bv (hr 0.18 (0.08-0.4)). detailed analysis of behavioral data suggested a direct dose-response relationship with increasing number of episodes of receptive oral-vulvovaginal sex (hr 1.02 (95% ci, 1.00-1.04). conclusions/significance: vaginal detection of several bvab in bv-negative women predicted subsequent bv, suggesting that changes in vaginal microbiota precede bv by weeks or months. bv acquisition was associated with report of new partner with bv; associations with  sexual practices - specifically, receptive oral sex - require further investigation.

TI  == temporal variability of human vaginal bacteria and relationship with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: little is known about short-term bacterial fluctuations in the human  vagina. this study used pcr to assess the variability in concentrations of key vaginal bacteria in healthy women and the immediate response to antibiotic treatment in women with bacterial vaginosis (bv). methodology/principal findings: twenty-two women assessed for bv using amsel's criteria were evaluated daily for  7 or 14 days, then at 2, 3 and 4 weeks, using a panel of 11 bacterium-specific quantitative pcr assays. participants with bv were treated with 5 days of intravaginal metronidazole. participants without bv had vaginal biotas dominated  by lactobacilli, whose levels fluctuated with menses. with onset of menstruation, quantities of lactobacillus jensenii and lactobacillus crispatus decreased and were found to be inversely related to gardnerella vaginalis concentrations (p<0.001). women with bv had a variety of fastidious bacteria whose concentrations dropped below detection thresholds 1-5 days after starting metronidazole. recurrent bv was characterized by initial profound decreases of bv-associated bacteria after treatment followed by subsequent increases at relapse. conclusions/significance: the microbiota of the human vagina can be highly dynamic. healthy women are colonized with lactobacillus species, but levels can change dramatically over a month. marked increases in g. vaginalis were observed during menses. participants with bv have diverse communities of fastidious bacteria that are depleted by vaginal metronidazole therapy. women with recurrent bv initially respond to antibiotic treatment with steep declines in bacterial concentrations, but these bacteria later reemerge, suggesting that antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is not an important factor mediating bv recurrence.

TI  == vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against candida spp.
AB  == urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. the treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. in this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against candida spp. the lab were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with c. albicans, c. glabrata, c. krusei, and c. tropicalis, adhesion to caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). all  lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four candida species into different degrees; among them l. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. the highest amount of lactic acid was produced  by l. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by l. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), l. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and l. jensenii (5.4 g/l). all isolates produced h2o2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri,  l. johnsonii, and l. vaginalis. only l. agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii and l.  ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial caco-2 cells. among the isolates evaluated, l agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii, and l. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.

TI  == comparison of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: the normal microbial flora of the vagina plays an important role in preventing genital and urinary tract infections in women. thus an accurate understanding of the composition and ecology of the ecosystem is important to understanding the etiology of these diseases. this study aimed to compare the characteristics of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) by quantitative culture and pcr methods. main lactobacillus species include l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii and l. iners. methods: a total of 150 women attending gynecology outpatient clinic of beijing friendship hospital, were diagnosed as having bv because three or more of the following criteria were met (standard of amsel's composite criteria): homogeneous discharge, elevated vaginal ph (ph > 4.5), production of amines, and presence of  "clue" cells. those with less than three of the criteria were considered as healthy. simultaneously, smears were made of vaginal fluid and gram stained, then were assessed qualitatively as normal (grade i), intermediate (grade ii), or consistent with bv (grade iii). gardnerella vaginalis were identified by using vitek 2 compact and pcr methods. lactobacillus species were identified by pcr methods. gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacilli colony counts were determined by  calculating the most number of colonies of each species in the appropriate plates (colonies between 10 and 300), corrected by the dilution of the sample in the plates, and multiplied by 10 (to account for plating 100 microl), in order to get colony forming units per milliliter of vaginal secretion. results: bv was diagnosed in 31% (46/150) patients using the composite criteria, the remainder being regarded as healthy. the majority of patients with bv had a smear assessed  as grade iii (91%, 42/46) and minority of them had a smear assessed as grade ii (9%, 4/46). the majority of healthy women had a smear assessed as grade i (64%, 67/104). smears assessed as grade ii were found (36%, 37/104) among patients diagnosed as healthy, with less than three of the composite criteria. l. crispatus was cultured from 94% of healthy women and 83% of women with bv, with the former colonies count average value of 10(6) and the latter of 10(3). l. gasseri, l. iners, and l. jensenii were cultured from 85%, 68% and 43% of healthy women; and 28%, 89% and 44% of bv women, respectively. conclusions: the quantities of four lactobacillus species except l. jensenii had a significant difference between healthy women and women with bv. our results provide support for the negative association between l. iners and l. gasseri. although l. crispatus were existent both in healthy and bv positive women's vagina, the numbers of l. crispatus were significantly different for the dominant number in healthy women. smears of vaginal fluid and gram stain play an important guiding role in bacteria culture.

TI  == [prevalence and characterization of vaginal lactobacillus species in women at reproductive age without vulvovaginitis].
AB  == purpose: to identify species of lactobacillus isolated from the vaginal contents  of healthy and asymptomatic women, determining the most prevalent species and characterizing them phenotypically. methods: lactobacillus have been isolated in  selective milieu from samples of the vaginal contents of 135 women without complaints of vaginal secretion, and with negative laboratorial diagnosis of vaginal infection, followed up at an outpatient clinic. after being identified by multiplex pcr, the isolates have been submitted to rnar 16s gene sequencing, when necessary. they have also been evaluated concerning the production of lactic acid, h2o2, bacteriocins and the ability to adhere to epithelial cells. results:  eight-three lactobacillus strains were isolated and identified, l. crispatus (30.1%), l. jensenii (26.5%), l. gasseri (22.9%) e l. vaginalis (8.4%), being the prevalent species. only 20 of those isolates did not present h2o2 production, in  detectable amounts. from the 37 strains selected for the test of adhesion to the  epithelial cells, 12 presented 50 to 69% of adhesion, 10 presented 70% or more, and the remaining, little or no adhesion at all. none of the tested strains produced bacteriocins. conclusions: the lactobacillus species more prevalent in women without vulvovaginitis, isolated in selective culture milieu and identified by molecular methods were l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. besides the fact of being more prevalent, these strains also presented better production of h2o2, and reached lower ph values in the culture milieu.

TI  == comparison of oral and vaginal metronidazole for treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy: impact on fastidious bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition that is associated with preterm birth and acquisition of complex communities of vaginal bacteria that include several fastidious species. treatment of bv in pregnancy has mixed effects on the risk of preterm delivery, which some hypothesize is due to variable antibiotic efficacy for the fastidious bacteria. both oral and intravaginal metronidazole can be used to treat bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy, but little is known about the impact of different routes of antibiotic administration on concentrations of fastidious vaginal bacteria. methods: this was a sub-study of a larger randomized trial of oral versus vaginal metronidazole for treatment of bv in pregnancy. fifty-three women were evaluated, including 30  women who received oral metronidazole and 23 who received intravaginal metronidazole. bacterial taxon-specific quantitative pcr assays were used to measure concentrations of bacterial vaginosis associated bacterium (bvab) 1, 2, and 3, gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium species, leptotrichia/sneathia species, megasphaera species, and lactobacillus crispatus before and after antibiotic treatment. results: concentrations of leptotrichia and sneathia spp. and the fastidious clostridia-like bacterium designated bvab1 decreased significantly with oral (p = .002, p = .02) but not vaginal therapy (p = .141, p = .126). the fastidious bacterium bvab3 did not significantly decrease with either treatment.  concentrations of atopobium spp., reportedly resistant to metronidazole in vitro, dropped significantly with oral (p = .002) and vaginal (p = .001) treatment. there was no significant difference in the magnitude of change in bacterial concentrations between oral and vaginal treatment arms for any of the bacterial species. lactobacillus crispatus concentrations did not change. conclusion: both  oral and vaginal metronidazole therapy in pregnant women result in a significant  decrease in concentrations of most bv-associated anaerobic bacteria, with the exception that leptotrichia, sneathia and bvab1 do not significantly decrease with vaginal metronidazole therapy. these data suggest that the route of antibiotic administration has a minor impact on bacterial eradication in pregnant women with bv. trial registration: this trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number nct00153517.

TI  == preterm labor and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria among urban women.
AB  == aims: bacterial vaginosis (bv) affects millions of women, is extremely prevalent  and is frequently chronic. we recognize numerous microbiologic variations among women with bv and this variability may explain the limited effectiveness of metronidazole in curing bv and/or reducing the risk of spontaneous preterm birth  (sptb) among bv-positive pregnant women. we assessed the independent role of seven common bv-associated bacteria on the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (sptb) among urban pregnant women. methods: this prospective cohort study was conducted within an urban obstetrics practice at temple university hospital in philadelphia, pa. fifty pregnant women with documented singleton pregnancies between 25-36 weeks' gestation from february 2007 through june 2007 who presented to the labor and delivery unit for evaluation of uterine contractions/preterm labor were enrolled. results: we found that high median levels of gardnerella vaginalis and low median levels of lactobacillus crispatus were significantly predictive of sptb. slightly higher levels of megasphaera-like species were also  found among the group of women experiencing a sptb during the follow-up period. conclusions: further identification of the individual attributable risk for separate bv-associated bacteria may be most useful in developing successful treatments to prevent sptb among bv positive women.

TI  == quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in port-a-cul and copan transport systems.
AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

AB  == our objective was to determine the morphotype of the adherent bacteria in liquid-based cytology (lbc) in smears with healthy and disturbed vaginal flora. and to use pcr technology on the same fixed cell sample to establish dna patterns of the 16s rna genes of the bacteria in the sample. thirty samples were randomly  selected from a large group of cervical cell samples suspended in a commercial coagulant fixative "(boonfix)." pcr was used to amplify dna of five bacterial species: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, gardnerella vaginalis, and mycoplasma hominis. the lbc slides were then analyzed by light microscopy to estimate bacterial adhesion. dna of lactobacilli  was detected in all cell samples. seventeen smears showed colonization with gardnerella vaginalis (range 2.6 x 10(2)-3.0 x 10(5) bacteria/mul boonfix sample). two cases were identified as dysbacteriotic with high dna values for gardnerella vaginalis and low values for lactobacillus crispatus. the sample with the highest concentration for gardnerella vaginalis showed an unequivocal gardnerella infection. this study indicates that the adherence pattern of a disturbed flora in liquid-based cervical samples can be identified unequivocally, and that these samples are suitable for quantitative pcr analysis. this cultivation independent method reveals a strong inverse relationship between gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus crispatus in dysbacteriosis and unequivocal gardnerella infection.

TI  == atopobium vaginae triggers an innate immune response in an in vitro model of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal disorder among women of reproductive age. the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis is poorly understood, but is defined by a transition in the vaginal flora from the predominant lactobacillus species to other bacterial species such as atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis. this change is associated with an increase in vaginal cytokine secretion. we hypothesize that vaginal epithelial cells respond to bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria by triggering an innate immune response.  we observed that vaginal epithelial cells secreted interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in response to atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis, but not to lactobacillus crispatus. atopobium vaginae induced increased levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 transcripts, as well as increased transcripts for the antimicrobial peptide beta-defensin 4. this innate immune response required live bacteria capable of protein synthesis in direct contact with vaginal epithelial cells. the response of vaginal epithelial cells was mediated by toll-like receptor 2, required the adaptor protein myd88, and involved activation of the nfkappab signaling pathway. these results suggest that atopobium vaginae stimulates an innate immune response from vaginal epithelial cells, leading to localized cytokine and defensin production, and possibly contributes to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == the human vaginal bacterial biota and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the bacterial biota of the human vagina can have a profound impact on the health  of women and their neonates. changes in the vaginal microbiota have been associated with several adverse health outcomes including premature birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, and acquisition of hiv infection. cultivation-independent molecular methods have provided new insights regarding bacterial diversity in this important niche, particularly in women with the common condition bacterial vaginosis (bv). pcr methods have shown that women with bv have complex communities of vaginal bacteria that include many fastidious species, particularly from the phyla bacteroidetes and actinobacteria. healthy women are mostly colonized with lactobacilli such as lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, and lactobacillus iners, though a variety of other bacteria may be present. the microbiology of bv is heterogeneous. the presence of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae coating the vaginal epithelium in some subjects with bv suggests that biofilms may contribute to this condition.

TI  == quantitative determination by real-time pcr of four vaginal lactobacillus species, gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae indicates an inverse relationship between l. gasseri and l. iners.
AB  == background: most studies of the vaginal microflora have been based on culture or  on qualitative molecular techniques. here we applied existing real-time pcr formats for lactobacillus crispatus, l. gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis and developed new formats for atopobium vaginae, l. iners and l. jensenii to obtain a quantitative non culture-based determination of these species in 71 vaginal samples from 32 pregnant and 28 non-pregnant women aged between 18 and 45 years.  results: the 71 vaginal microflora samples of these women were categorized, using the ison and hay criteria, as refined by verhelst et al. (2005), as follows: grade ia: 8 samples, grade iab: 10, grade ib: 13, grade i-like: 10, grade ii: 11, grade iii: 12 and grade iv: 7.l. crispatus was found in all but 5 samples and was the most frequent lactobacillus species detected. a significantly lower concentration of l. crispatus was found in grades ii (p < 0.0001) and iii (p = 0.002) compared to grade i. l. jensenii was found in all grades but showed higher concentration in grade iab than in grade ia (p = 0.024). a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were present in high concentrations in grade iii, with log10 median concentrations (log10 mc), respectively of 9.0 and 9.2 cells/ml. twenty (38.5%) of the 52 g. vaginalis positive samples were also positive for a. vaginae. in grade ii we found almost no l. iners (log10 mc: 0/ml) but a high concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 8.7/ml). by contrast, in grade iii we found a high concentration of l. iners (log10 mc: 8.3/ml) and a low concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 0/ml). these results show a negative association between l. gasseri and l. iners (r = -0.397, p = 0.001) and between l. gasseri and a. vaginae (r = -0.408, p < 0.0001). conclusion: in our study we found a clear negative association between l. iners and l. gasseri and between a. vaginae and l. gasseri. our results do not provide support for the generally held proposition that grade ii is an intermediate stage between grades i and iii, because l. gasseri, abundant in grade ii is not predominant in grade iii, whereas l. iners,  abundant in grade iii is present only in low numbers in grade ii samples.

AB  == aims: lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining vaginal health of women. the aim of this study was to compare the species richness and relative abundance  of lactobacillus and other lactic acid bacteria in women of two geographically distant countries, uganda and korea. methods and results: vaginal samples were obtained from two women populations in uganda and korea. the lactobacillus rogosa sl agar was used for initial isolation of lactic acid bacteria. after phenotypic  analyses, the 16s rrna gene was amplified by polymerase-chain reaction and analysed by the blast program and phylogenetic tree construction. a total of 338  (128 korean and 210 ugandan) vaginal lactic acid bacterial strains were isolated, including five genera: lactobacillus, leuconostoc, pediococcus, streptococcus and weissella. while lactobacillus crispatus was common in both populations, lactobacillus fermentum was common only in korean women, and lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus vaginalis only in ugandan women. among other lactic acid bacteria, weissella was more common in ugandan, and pediococcus in korean women. all weissella strains produced hydrogen peroxide, and all pediococcus strains inhibited candida species. conclusion: although many  lactic acid bacteria colonize women, their species distributions may be different in women of geographically separated communities. significance and impact of the  study: the knowledge of species richness and relative abundance of vaginal lactic acid bacteria, including lactobacillus, pediococcus and weissella, may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial replacement therapy.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus challenge on gardnerella vaginalis biofilms.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common infectious condition in women. it is  caused primarily by anaerobic bacteria which rapidly form biofilms recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment, elevate vaginal ph, induce inflammatory processes and displace indigenous lactobacilli from the vault. gardnerella vaginalis is commonly associated with these infections. microscopy analysis showed that within 72 h, viable g. vaginalis covered a surface area of 567 microm(2), reached a depth of 16 microm and a density of approximately 104 microm(3). they maintained  these levels for a further 3 days unless challenged with lactobacilli strains. lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 produced the biggest displacement of gardnerella. this was not due to ph, which remained between 4.7 and 5.1 for all experiments, nor by hydrogen peroxide which is produced in low amounts by strain l. reuteri rc-14, high amounts by l. crispatus 33820 and not at all by l. rhamnosus gr-1. deconvolution microscopy showed changes in structure and viability of the biofilms, with loss of dense gardnerella biofilm pods. for the first time, a strain of l. iners, the most commonly isolated vaginal lactobacillus in healthy women, was tested for potential probiotic properties. it was found to disrupt gardnerella biofilm surface area, density and depth, albeit to a lesser extent than l. reuteri rc-14. these studies help to provide insight into the clinical situation in which probiotic and indigenous vaginal lactobacilli can interfere with gardnerella's presence and reduce the risk of bacterial vaginosis.

AB  == in the present study, lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the cecum of chickens bred  either under intensive (commercial broilers) or extensive (free-range) conditions were isolated, identified and some of their probiotic characteristics determined. the lab identified by 16s-23s rrna pcr-ardra were mainly of lactobacillus species and to a lesser extent of enterococcus spp. for all animals. free-range chickens  showed a higher presence of lactobacillus acidophilus while lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus johnsonii were more frequently recovered from commercial broilers. lactobacillus crispatus was found only in commercial broilers, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus agilis only in free-range chickens and  lactobacillus salivarius in both types. enterococcus isolates from ceca of commercial broilers showed a higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. lactobacillus isolates from free-range chickens presented a higher frequency of in vitro antagonistic activity against selected pathogens than from commercial broilers. all lab isolates had predominantly non-hydrophobic surfaces, but with variations depending on age of the chickens and breeding conditions. animal breeding caused variation on composition, antimicrobial susceptibility, antagonistic activity and surface hydrophobicity of lab from chicken cecum. lab isolates from ceca of free-range chickens have potential as probiotic agents, which may be used in the future as replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth  promoters.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing  degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l.  gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.

TI  == selection and identification of anaerobic lactobacilli producing inhibitory compounds against vaginal pathogens.
AB  == two strains of lactobacillus crispatus (15l08 and 21l07) and one strain of lactobacillus jensenii (5l08) were selected from amongst 100 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant to mucosal colonization and the production of h2o2 and/or bacteriocin-like compound. all three strains self-aggregated and adhered to vaginal epithelial cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as gardnerella vaginalis and candida albicans. lactobacillus crispatus 15l08 was characterized as a potential h2o2 producer. a high level of bacteriocin-like compound was synthesized by l. jensenii 5l08, with a bactericidal mode of action for g. vaginalis, c. albicans and escherichia coli. however, h2o2-dependent activity alone was not sufficient to inhibit the growth of c. albicans. simultaneous actions of h2o2 and bacteriocin-like compound produced by lactobacilli may be important for antagonizing pathogenic bacteria. these strains of lactobacilli may be excellent candidates for eventual use as probiotics to restore the normal microbial communities in the vaginal ecosystem.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == prebiotic effects of oligosaccharides on selected vaginal lactobacilli and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select endogenous human vaginal lactobacilli strains on the basis of the main probiotic properties observed in the vaginal environment in order to use them for the evaluation of the potential prebiotic properties of oligosaccharides. from vaginal samples of 50 women with a normal flora, 17 lactobacilli strains were first isolated because of their high level of hydrogen peroxide production. then six strains were selected mainly for their ability (i) to adhere to vaginal cells, (ii) to produce compounds in sufficient amount, such as lactic acid, having an inhibitory action on pathogens, and less importantly, (iii) to demonstrate arginine deiminase activity. these six strains  were found to belong to three distinct species: lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii and l. vaginalis. one strain of each species was chosen as a potential vaginal probiotic strain with regard to our criteria. these three strains were then used to evaluate the prebiotic properties of different oligosaccharide series: two fructooligosaccharide series (fos actilight and fos raftilose) and two glucooligosaccharide series varying by their osidic linkages (alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos and alpha-1,2/alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos). the test was based on the ability of the oligosaccharides to promote the growth of the three beneficial strains selected but not of pathogenic microorganisms often encountered in urogenital infections such as candida albicans, escherichia coli and gardnerella vaginalis. oligosaccharide hydrolysis was followed by hplc analysis. this revealed that two oligosaccharide series (fos actilight dp3 and all alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos dp > or = 4) were used only by the lactobacilli strains, the pathogenic microorganisms being unable to metabolise them. the selected lactobacilli and oligosaccharides are good candidates for incorporation  in a formula to prevent vaginal infections.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of atopobium vaginae.
AB  == background: previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of bv. methods: nine strains of atopobium vaginae, four strains of gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of lactobacillus iners and one strain each of bifidobacterium breve, b. longum, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the etest. results: all nine strains of a. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). we found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2  to more than 256 microg/ml. the four g. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. all lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). conclusion: clindamycin has higher activity against g. vaginalis and  a. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all a. vaginae isolates are metronidazole  resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on  a more limited number of strains.

TI  == comparison between gram stain and culture for the characterization of vaginal microflora: definition of a distinct grade that resembles grade i microflora and  revised categorization of grade i microflora.
AB  == background: the microbiological diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually made  using nugent's criteria, a useful but rather laborious scoring system based on counting bacterial cell types on gram stained slides of vaginal smears. ison and  hay have simplified the score system to three categories and added a fourth category for microflora with a predominance of the streptococcus cell type. because in the nugent system several cell types are not taken into account for a  final score, we carried out a detailed assessment of the composition of the vaginal microflora in relation to standard gram stain in order the improve the diagnostic value of the gram stain. to this purpose we compared gram stain based  categorization of vaginal smears with i) species specific pcr for the detection of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae and with ii) tdna-pcr for the identification of most cultivable species. results: a total of 515 samples were obtained from 197 pregnant women, of which 403 (78.3%) were categorized as grade  i microflora, 46 (8.9%) as grade ii, 22 (4.3%) as grade iii and 8 (1.6%) as grade iv, according to the criteria of ison and hay. another 36 samples (7.0%) were assigned to the new category 'grade i-like', because of the presence of diphtheroid bacilli cell types. we found that 52.7% of the grade i-like samples contained bifidobacterium spp. while l. crispatus was present in only 2.8% of the samples and g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were virtually absent; in addition, the species diversity of this category was similar to that of grade ii specimens.based on the presence of different lactobacillus cell types, grade i specimens were further characterized as grade ia (40.2%), grade iab (14.9%) and grade ib (44.9%). we found that this classification was supported by the finding  that l. crispatus was cultured from respectively 87.0% and 76.7% of grade ia and  iab specimens while this species was present in only 13.3% of grade ib specimens, a category in which l. gasseri and l. iners were predominant. conclusion: further refinement of gram stain based grading of vaginal smears is possible by distinguishing additional classes within grade i smears (ia, iab and ib) and by adding a separate category, designated grade i-like. a strong correlation was found between grade ia and the presence of l. crispatus and between grade i-like  and the presence of bifidobacteria. this refinement of gram stain based scoring of vaginal smears may be helpful to improve the interpretation of the clinical data in future studies, such as the understanding of response to treatment and recurrence of bacterial vaginosis in some women, and the relationship between bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth.

TI  == characterization of vaginal microflora of healthy, nonpregnant women by chaperonin-60 sequence-based methods.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to use a novel method that was based on  the application of chaperonin-60 sequencing to describe the vaginal microflora of 16 healthy women. study design: asymptomatic women consented for vaginal swabs to be collected at the time of a clinical pelvic examination. total genomic dna was  isolated from the vaginal swabs. degenerate, universal polymerase chain reaction  primers were used to amplify an approximately 555 base pair region of the universal chaperonin-60 gene, which is found in all eubacteria and eukaryotes, from the total genomic dna and libraries of cloned polymerase chain reaction products were constructed. library clones were sequenced, and the resulting sequences were assigned to taxonomic groups on the basis of similarity to reference sequence data. presence of chlamydophila psittaci sequences in the samples was confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. results: sixteen of the 23 women who were enrolled had normal flora by nugent's score of <4 and had adequate polymerase chain reaction product for assessment. vaginal flora libraries were dominated by a variety of sequences with similarity to lactobacillus spp l. crispatus, l. iners, l. gasseri, l. jensenii, and l. buchneri. other sequences that were identified included representatives of gardnerella spp, sequences with similarity to porphyromonas spp and megasphaera spp and sequences identical to c psittaci. conclusion: culture-independent, chaperonin-60 sequence-based molecular methods can lead to the identification of  greater diversity within defined taxa compared with those that are identified by  standard culture-based methods and to the identification of novel organisms that  were not previously associated with vaginal flora.

TI  == susceptibility to some antifungal drugs of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  == samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women. lactobacilli were isolated from ten of these women. fifty-eight lactobacillus isolates were identified as l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii spp. lactis, l. crispatus, l. plantarum, l. cellobiosus, l. jensenii, l. salivarius, l. curvatus, l. brevis and l. oris. the inhibitory effect of isoconazole and oxiconazole in 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 microg/ml concentrations on 58 lactobacillus spp. and candida albicans (ajd 180) were investigated, using an agar diffusion method. although both antifungal drugs showed a large inhibitory effect on c. albicans, oxiconazole had a very low inhibitory effect on lactobacillus isolates. the natural resistance of lactobacilli to anti-fungal drugs may enable the development of an antifungal drug(s)/ probiotic combination  for antifungal activity and lactobacilli replacement therapy.

TI  == identification and h(2)o(2) production of vaginal lactobacilli from pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth and relation with outcome.
AB  == lactobacilli, principally the strains that are hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) producing, may have a protective effect against vaginal colonization by pathogenic species such as those that cause bacterial vaginosis. previous reports have also suggested that h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli in the vagina may protect pregnant women against ascending infection of the chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cavity. we report the identification and h(2)o(2) production of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal swabs collected at 20 weeks' gestation from a population of pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth. we also report the correlation between identification and h(2)o(2) production in relation to the outcomes of chorioamnionitis and preterm birth. lactobacilli were identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. h(2)o(2) production by isolates was determined by a semiquantitative method. the most commonly isolated species were l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. vaginalis and l. jensenii. amounts of h(2)o(2)  produced by lactobacilli varied widely. the presence of lactobacilli producing high levels of h(2)o(2) in the vagina of this population of pregnant women was associated with a reduced risk of bacterial vaginosis at 20 weeks' gestation and  subsequent chorioamnionitis. l. jensenii and l. vaginalis produced the highest levels of h(2)o(2). we postulate that h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli are able to reduce the incidence of ascending infections of the uterus and the subsequent production of proinflammatory molecules which are important in the pathogenesis of chorioamnionitis and preterm birth.

TI  == antimicrobial components of vaginal fluid.
AB  == objective: we examined the antimicrobial activity and composition of vaginal fluid. study design: vaginal fluid from preweighed tampons was assayed for ph, lactic acid, and antimicrobial polypeptides. the fluid was also fractionated by molecular filtration. antimicrobial activity of whole fluid was determined against representative resident and exogenous microbes, and its fractions were tested against escherichia coli. results: vaginal fluids (5/5 donors) were permissive for lactobacillus crispatus and vaginalis and candida albicans, but not for escherichia coli, streptococcus group b, and lactobacillus jensenii in three of five donors. the antimicrobial activity against e coli was predominantly in a <3-kd fraction and correlated with both low ph and high lactic acid content. compared with a matched ph buffer, lactic acid markedly suppressed the growth of  e coli. concentrated 2- or 5-fold, the protein-rich fraction was active against e coli. conclusion: vaginal fluid exerts selective antimicrobial activity against nonresident bacterial species. the activity is mediated by lactic acid, low ph, and antimicrobial polypeptides.

TI  == genetic diversity of vaginal lactobacilli from women in different countries based on 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli are widely distributed in food and the environment, and some colonize the human body as commensal bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the species of lactobacilli that colonize the vagina and compare them with those found in food and the environment. methods and results: thirty-five lactobacillus strains from women from seven countries were isolated, and sequences from 16s rrna genes were determined and compared with existing data in  genbank. a phylogenetic tree was achieved using the neighbour-joining method based on the analysis of 1465 nucleotides. the results showed that most vaginal isolates were l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. some were l. vaginalis, l. fermentum, l. mucosae, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus. two isolates from a native american woman displayed distinct branches, indicating novel phylotypes. few vaginal isolates matched food or environmental lactobacillus species. conclusions: most women worldwide were colonized by three common lactobacillus species: l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of vaginal lactobacillus species richness and distribution in women worldwide may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial  replacement therapy.

TI  == characterisation and selection of a lactobacillus species to re-colonise the vagina of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == this paper reports the results of characterising and selecting a strain of lactobacillus for potential use as a probiotic in regenerating the vaginal flora  of women with recurrent episodes of bacterial vaginosis (bv). bv is a condition characterised by a depletion of vaginal lactobacilli accompanied by an overgrowth of a mixed vaginal flora of aerobic, anaerobic and micro-aerophilic species in very large numbers. bv has been associated with various gynaecological and obstetric complications and has an extremely high recurrence rate, due in part to the failure to establish a normal vaginal flora after antimicrobial therapy. a total of 60 vaginal isolates of lactobacilli was assessed for characteristics considered important for vaginal re-colonisation. the characteristics studied were the in-vitro inhibitory activity of the lactobacilli against bacterial species isolated from women with recurrent bv, acid production after growth of the lactobacilli in liquid culture, production of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) and adhesiveness of the lactobacilli to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells (vec). four strains of lactobacilli, l. acidophilus (61701 and 61880), l. crispatus (55730) and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii (65407), demonstrated the greatest  inhibitory activity against the bv-associated bacterial species. two of these isolates (55730 and 61880) produced h2o2. all four isolates produced a highly acidic environment after growth in liquid medium (ph <4). only one of these (strain 61701) was strongly adherent to vec (>100 bacteria/vec). a further isolate (l. acidophilus 48101) did not demonstrate maximum inhibitory activity against bv-associated bacteria, but was found to be a strong producer of h2o2 and was also highly adherent to vec. isolates 61701 and 48101 could be candidates for use as probiotics for vaginal re-colonisation.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine on genital microflora, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and trichomonas vaginalis in vitro.
AB  == background: chlorhexidine is a disinfectant that has been used in skin and mouth  washes and as a preservative in some vaginal lubricants. a gel containing 0.25% chlorhexidine gluconate has been found to be effective against chlamydia trachomatis in vitro and in animal models. applied vaginally, 5 g of this gel could achieve vaginal fluid concentrations of < or = 1250 microg/ml. goal: to test the in vitro activity of chlorhexidine in a gel over a ph range of 4 to 8 in the presence or absence of blood. study design: organisms were exposed to chlorhexidine for 30 minutes to 2 hours, and the minimum cidal concentration (mcc) was calculated. results: the mcc for neisseria gonorrhoeae was 25 microg/ml at 30 minutes and 12.5 microg/ml at 1 to 2 hours of exposure, whereas the mcc for trichomonas vaginalis was 1250 microg/ml. chlorhexidine was more active at ph 8 than ph 4, and less active in the presence of blood. the mcc for lactobacillus crispatus was 1250 microg/ml at ph 4 and only 125 microg/ml at ph 8. conclusions: based on its in vitro activity, chlorhexidine may be an appropriate topical microbicide for prevention of gonorrhea, but not for prevention of trichomoniasis. this study suggests that the presence of blood and ph affect the  activity of chlorhexidine against genital pathogens and commensals.

TI  == the identification of vaginal lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal dna probes to 20 american type culture collection lactobacillus strains. most women were colonized by l. crispatus (32%), followed by l. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated l. 1086v (15%), l. gasseri (5%), l. fermentum (0.3%), l. oris (0.3%), l. reuteri  (0.3%), l. ruminis (0.3%), and l. vaginalis (0.3%). h2o2 was produced by 95% of l. crispatus and 94% of l. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of l. 1086v.  colonization by l. crispatus or l. jensenii was positively associated with being  white (p<.001), age >/=20 years (p=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (p=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (p<.001) and gonorrhea (p=.03). l. crispatus and l. jensenii, not l. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.

TI  == acid production by vaginal flora in vitro is consistent with the rate and extent  of vaginal acidification.
AB  == perinatally, and between menarche and menopause, increased levels of estrogen cause large amounts of glycogen to be deposited in the vaginal epithelium. during these times, the anaerobic metabolism of the glycogen, by the epithelial cells themselves and/or by vaginal flora, causes the vagina to become acidic (ph approximately 4). this study was designed to test whether the characteristics of  acid production by vaginal flora in vitro can account for vaginal acidity. eight  vaginal lactobacillus isolates from four species-l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. crispatus, and l. jensenii-acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (3.2 to 4.8) that matches the range seen in the lactobacillus-dominated human vagina (ph 3.6 to 4.5 in most women) (b. andersch, l. forssman, k. lincoln, and p. torstensson, gynecol. obstet. investig. 21:19-25, 1986; l. cohen, br. j. vener. dis. 45:241-246, 1969; j. paavonen, scand. j. infect. dis. suppl. 40:31-35, 1983; c. tevi-benissan, l. belec, m. levy, v. schneider-fauveau, a. si mohamed, m.-c. hallouin, m. matta, and g. gresenguet, clin. diagn. lab. immunol. 4:367-374, 1997). during exponential growth, all of these lactobacillus species acidified their growth medium at rates on the order of 10(6) protons/bacterium/s. such rates, combined with an estimate of the total number of lactobacilli in the vagina, suggest that vaginal lactobacilli could reacidify the vagina at the rate  observed postcoitally following neutralization by the male ejaculate (w. h. masters and v. e. johnson, human sexual response, p. 93, 1966). during bacterial  vaginosis (bv), there is a loss of vaginal acidity, and the vaginal ph rises to >4.5. this correlates with a loss of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of diverse bacteria. three bv-associated bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia,  and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (4.7 to 6.0) consistent with the characteristic elevated vaginal ph associated with bv. together, these observations are consistent with vaginal flora, rather than epithelial cells, playing a primary role in creating the acidity of the vagina.
