TI  - Crystal structure analysis of a fatty acid double-bond hydratase from Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Bacteria have evolved mechanisms for the hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids. Hydroxy fatty acid formation may be the first step in such a process; however, knowledge of the structural and mechanistic aspects of this reaction is scarce. Recently, myosin cross-reactive antigen was shown to be a bacterial FAD-containing hydratase which acts on the 9Z and 12Z double bonds of C16 and C18 non-esterified fatty acids, with the formation of 10-hydroxy and 10,13-dihydroxy fatty acids. These fatty acid hydratases form a large protein family which is conserved across Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with no sequence similarity to any known protein apart from the FAD-binding motif. In order to shed light on the substrate recognition and the mechanism of the hydratase reaction, the crystal structure of the hydratase from Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAH) was determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. Crystal structures of apo LAH and of LAH with bound linoleic acid were refined at resolutions of 2.3 and 1.8 A, respectively. LAH is a homodimer; each protomer consists of four intricately connected domains. Three of them form the FAD-binding and substrate-binding sites and reveal structural similarity to three domains of several flavin-dependent enzymes, including amine oxidoreductases. The additional fourth domain of LAH is located at the C-terminus and consists of three alpha-helices. It covers the entrance to the hydrophobic substrate channel leading from the protein surface to the active site. In the presence of linoleic acid, the fourth domain of one protomer undergoes conformational changes and opens the entrance to the substrate-binding channel of the other protomer of the LAH homodimer. The linoleic acid molecule is bound at the entrance to the substrate channel, suggesting movement of the lid domain triggered by substrate recognition.
TI  - Prediction of surface exposed proteins in Streptococcus pyogenes, with a potential application to other Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in silico prediction of bacterial surface exposed proteins is of growing interest for the rational development of vaccines and in the study of bacteria-host relationships, whether pathogenic or host beneficial. This interest is driven by the increase in the use of DNA sequencing as a major tool in the early characterization of pathogenic bacteria and, more recently, even of complex ecosystems at the host-environment interface in metagenomics approaches. Current protein localization protocols are not suited to this prediction task as they ignore the potential surface exposition of many membrane-associated proteins. Therefore, we developed a new flow scheme, SurfG+, for the processing of protein sequence data with the particular aim of identification of potentially surface exposed (PSE) proteins from Gram-positive bacteria, which was validated for Streptococcus pyogenes. The results of an exploratory case study on closely related lactobacilli of the acidophilus group suggest that the yogurt bacterium Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) dedicates a relatively important fraction of its coding capacity to secreted proteins, while the probiotic gastrointestinal (GI) tract bacteria L. johnsonii and L. gasseri appear to encode a larger variety of PSE proteins, that may play a role in the interaction with the host.
TI  - Cellular and humoral systemic and mucosal immune responses stimulated in volunteers by an oral polybacterial immunomodulator "Dentavax".
AB  - The oral polybacterial immunomodulator Dentavax (D), composed of killed cells from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates was created for immunoprophylaxis and therapy of oral mucosa and parodont inflammations. The stimulating effect of the preparation was evaluated in twelve volunteers immunized for 10 consecutive days. On days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 49 after the last immunization peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte subsets, T lymphocyte activation and PB phagocytic activity, were studied by flow cytometry. PB lymphocyte proliferative responses to PHA, rIL-2, LPS and D were evaluated radiometrically. The production of TNF-alpha in supernatants of in vitro stimulated lymphocytes and specific IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies in serum and saliva was determined by ELISA. Ultrastructural morphologic changes in T and B lymphocyte populations were also investigated. Although no significant changes in the levels of basic lymphocyte subsets were detected, the early/late (CD57+/CD57-) CD8 T effectors ratio was increased at the end of the studied period, as were the percentage of PHA-responding (CD69+) T cells and PB phagocytizing cells. The most prominent lymphoprolipherative responses were measured upon costimulation with LPS+D and PHA+D on day 21. Electron-microscopic studies demonstrated a significant effect of D on both T and B cell activity. TNF-alpha concentration increased progressively from day 7 till the end of the investigation. Maximal concentrations were observed after stimulation with D and LPS. An increased level of specific salivary and serum antibodies against the components of D was found, with highest levels between days 7 and 21. Specific secretory IgA predominated in saliva as compared to IgM and IgG. Our results demonstrate the stimulating effect of Dentavax on PB lymphocyte functional activity and the specific humoral systemic and mucosal immunity.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and resistance-modifying activities of aqueous crude khat  extracts against oral microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess antimicrobial activities of aqueous crude khat (Catha edulis) extracts against a panel of oral microorganisms and to test their ability to modify bacterial resistance to tetracycline and penicillin in vitro. DESIGN: Lyophilized aqueous extracts were prepared from three khat cultivars. The agar dilution method of the NCCLS was used to test the extracts, at concentrations of 20-1.25 mg/ml, against 33 oral strains. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth. Slight growth was defined as marked growth reduction (MGR). The E-test was used to determine the MICs of tetracycline and penicillin-G for three resistant strains in absence and presence of a sub-MIC of the khat extracts (5mg/ml). RESULTS: Eighteen strains (55%) were sensitive to the extracts (MICs 5-20 mg/ml). Most of these were periodontal pathogens with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythensis being the most susceptible (MIC 5-10mg/ml). Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces israelii and some streptococci were not sensitive. Except for Lactobacillus acidophilus that showed MGR at 1mg/ml, cariogenic species were neither sensitive. The extracts were active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC 10-20 mg/ml) but not against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus. The presence of the khat extracts at a sub-MIC resulted in a 2-4-fold potentiation of the tested antibiotics against the resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: Khat has water-soluble constituents possessing selective antibacterial activity against oral bacteria. There is preliminary evidence for presence of an antibiotic resistance-modifying component. Further investigation is needed to identify the active components and assess their clinical relevance.
TI  - Surface expression of the conserved C repeat region of streptococcal M6 protein within the Pip bacteriophage receptor of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The C repeat region of the M6 protein (M6c) from Streptococcus pyogenes was expressed within the Pip bacteriophage receptor on the surface of Lactococcus lactis. M6c was also detected in the culture medium. The pip-emm6c allele was integrated into the chromosome and stably expressed without antibiotic selection. The level of cell-associated surface expression of PipM6c was 0.015% of total cellular protein. The amount of PipM6c on the cell surface was increased about 17-fold by expressing pip-emm6c from a high-copy-number plasmid. Replacing the native pip promoter with stronger promoters isolated previously from Lactobacillus acidophilus increased surface expression of PipM6c from the high-copy-number plasmid up to 27-fold. Concomitantly, the amount of PipM6c in the medium increased 113-fold. The amount of PipM6c did not vary greatly between exponential- and stationary-phase cultures. Western blots indicated that the full-length PipM6c protein and most of the numerous proteolytic products were found only on the cell surface, whereas only one proteolytic fragment was found in the culture medium.
TI  - Immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator 'Dentavax' in a rabbit experimental model.
AB  - The immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator, Dentavax (D), composed of killed cells from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates, have been investigated on an experimental rabbit model. In this model, mixed suspensions of the above bacterial wild strains have been injected in six sides of oral mucosa. A long-lasting inflammation with the development of infiltrates and confluating abscesses has been observed. The influence of orally given Dentavax on the course of the model infection as well as on the dynamics of the immune response has been studied. A two-fold decrease in the duration and severity of inflammatory reaction, confirmed by the histological findings, has been registered. In immunised animals, an activation of polymorphonuclear phagocytosis, together with stimulation of humoral systemic and mucosal immunity with synthesis of specific serum (predominantly, IgG) and coproantibodies (predominantly, S-IgA) determined by ELISA, has been found. The results obtained proved the strong immunostimulating and protective effects of the preparation D, which is meant for the prophylaxis and treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases.
TI  - [The development of a treatment method for streptococcal tonsillitis in children].
AB  - Kept under continuous medical surveillance were 77 children with streptococcal tonsillitis. In all patients, a pathogenic streptococcus (GABHS) was invariably found in culture. Among other common features of the above disease were decline in the tonsil colony resistance state and lowering of those parameters characterizing immunity. A highly efficient means of treating tonsillitis of streptococcal etiology has been elaborated, relying on the use of macrolides and L. acidophilus according to our methods, which can, we believe, come to be widely used in health care practice.
TI  - Further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  - Various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (TK; EC 2.7.1.21). Taking the specific TK activity of Escherichia coli K12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific TK activities. In the Gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than Staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and Streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of Strep. pyogenes (29%). Neisseria sicca, a Gram-negative coccus, lacked TK. Gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (Bacillus, 13-51%; Clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of B. megaterium (2%) and C. difficile (1-3%). Among the Gram-positive asporogenous rods, Listeria monocytogenes and six species of Lactobacillus (especially L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and L. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). Of the species of Pseudomonas studied, most lacked TK but Ps. fluorescens and Ps. maltophilia had significant TK activity (15-53%). Of the Gram-negative facultative anaerobes, Vibrio lacked TK, while Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella (148-1120%), Escherichia (59-141%), Klebsiella (78-299%) and Serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. Proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'Pr. rettgerella' (307%). Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium and related organisms other than Streptomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium lacked TK. The seven species of Candida tested, and Cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked TK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Immunoelectron microscopic studies on the localization of peptidoglycan peptide subunit pentapeptides in bacterial cell walls.
AB  - The peptide subunit pentapeptide H-L-Ala-D-Glu(L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala-OH)-NH2 of peptidoglycan was localized in the cell walls of several Gram-positive bacteria employing the indirect immunoferritin technique. Specific antibodies to the D-alanyl-D-alanine moiety of non-crosslinked peptide subunit pentapeptide were raised in rabbits by immunization with synthetic immunogen albumin-(CH2CO-Gly-L-Ala-L-Ala-D-Ala-D-Ala-OH)39. Specificity of these antibodies for the peptide subunit pentapeptide and not for the peptide subunit tetrapeptide was corroborated in a Farr-type radio-active hapten binding assay. Specificity of labelling with ferritin was established by immunoelectron microscopic controls, and by the excellent correlation between specific labelling of cells with ferritin and the particular peptidoglycan primary structure of bacterial strains investigated. Cells of Lactobacillus gasseri, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus revealing non-crosslinked peptide subunit pentapeptides in their peptidoglycans could specifically be labelled. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bacillus subtilis, on the contrary, missing such pentapeptides, failed in labelling. The implication of this method to possibly localize the points of attack of penicillin or cycloserine is discussed.

AB  - Smith, Rodney F. (University of Maryland, Baltimore), Donald E. Shay, and Norman  J. Doorenbos. Antimicrobial action of nitrogen-containing steroids. J. Bacteriol. 85:1295-1299. 1963.-A new group of 16 synthetic nitrogen-containing steroids have been tested against a variety of microorganisms for antimicrobial properties. The gradient plate screening method, serial dilution, and dry weight techniques were used in the studies. The organisms tested consisted of 14 gram-negative bacteria, 10 gram-positive bacteria, 2 actinomycetes, 7 yeasts, and 8 molds. Inhibitory properties were found to be specific and potent in four compounds, with inhibitory concentrations as low as 0.37 mug/ml. Three of the active steroids are 4-aza cholestanes and one is a 4-nor-3,5-secocholestane amide. Sensitivity to the compounds was greatest in the gram-positive bacteria, followed by the yeasts and molds. The gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. All 16 steroids interfered to some extent with pigmentation in Serratia marcescens but not with pigment production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a few instances, some of the molds were stimulated by the steroids at a concentration of 250 mug/ml.
