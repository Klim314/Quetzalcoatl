TI  == isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in dammam  in eastern saudi arabia.
AB  == objective: this study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of dammam, in the eastern region of saudi arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. materials and methods: the analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. results: there were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria sicca, micrococcus luteus, proteus mirabilis, bacillus subtilis, and enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. there were fungal isolates as follows: alternaria alternata, aspergillus niger, cladosporium sp., penicillium spp., aspergillus flavus, aspergillus fumigatus, rhizopus stolonifer, aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. conclusions: the study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to  the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. this means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial flora associated with chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses.
AB  == chronic maxillary sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the role of microbial infection remains undefined. bacteria have been isolated from chronically inflamed sinuses; however, their role in the chronicity of inflammation is unknown. the objective of this study was to determine whether bacteria are present in clinical samples from chronic maxillary sinusitis and to  assess the diversity of the flora present. washes and/or tissue samples from endoscopic sinus surgery on 11 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were subjected to pcr amplification of bacterial 16s rdna using three universal primer pairs, followed by cloning and sequencing. the samples were also assessed for the presence of bacteria and fungi by conventional culture methods. viable bacteria and/or bacterial 16s rdna were detected from maxillary sinus samples of five of the 11 patients examined (45 %). three sinus samples were positive by both pcr and culture methods, one was positive only by pcr, and one only by culture. thirteen bacterial species were identified: abiotrophia defectiva, enterococcus avium, eubacterium sp., granulicatella elegans, neisseria sp., prevotella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sp. fungi were not detected. in one  patient streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis, and in another patient pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected from both the sinus and the oral cavity using species-specific pcr primers. these results suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be detected in nearly half of chronic maxillary sinusitis  cases.

TI  == pilg gene cluster and split pill genes involved in pilus biogenesis, motility and genetic transformation in the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc 6803.
AB  == the unicellular motile cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc 6803 exhibits phototactic motility that depends on the type iv-like thick pilus structure. by gene disruption analysis, we showed that a gene cluster of slr1041, slr1042, slr1043 and slr1044, whose predicted products are homologous to pata, chey, chew  and mcp, respectively, was more or less required for pilus assembly, motility and natural transformation competency with extraneous dna. by sequence homology, the  missing chea-like gene in this cluster was identified as novel split genes, slr0073 and slr0322, at separate loci on the genome. this was confirmed by non-motile phenotype of their disruptants. unique hyperpiliation was observed in  the slr1042 and slr0073 disruptants, suggestive of their specific interaction with pilt1. the genes, thus identified as pil genes in this study, were designated pilg (slr1041), pilh (slr1042), pili (slr1043), pilj (slr1044), pill-n (slr0073) and pill-c (slr0322).

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == type iv pili are involved in plant-microbe and fungus-microbe interactions.
AB  == adherence of bacteria to eukaryotic cells is essential for the initiation of infection in many animal and human pathogens, e.g. neisseria gonorrhoeae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. adhesion-mediating type iv pili, filamentous surface appendages formed by pilin subunits, are crucial virulence factors. here, we report that type iv pilus-dependent adhesion is also involved in plant-bacteria and fungus-bacteria interactions. nitrogen-fixing, endophytic bacteria, azoarcus  sp., can infect the roots of rice and spread systemically into the shoot without  causing symptoms of plant disease. formation of pili on solid media was dependent on the pilab locus. pila encodes an unusually short (6.4 kda) putative pilin precursor showing 100% homology to the conserved n-terminus of the pseudomonas aeruginosa type iv pilin. pilb encodes for a 14.2 kda polypeptide showing similarity to fimf, a component of type i fimbriae of escherichia coli. it was found to be extruded beyond the cell surface by immunofluorescence studies, and it may, therefore, be part of a pilus assembly complex or the pilus itself. both  genes are involved in the establishment of bacteria on the root surface of rice seedlings, as detected by fluorescence microscopy. moreover, both genes are necessary for bacterial adhesion to the mycelium of an ascomycete, which was isolated from the same rhizosphere as the bacteria. in co-culture with the fungus, azoarcus sp. forms complex intracytoplasmic membranes, diazosomes, which  are related to efficient nitrogen fixation. adhesion to the mycelium appears to be crucial for this process, as diazosomes were absent and nitrogen fixation rates were decreased in pilab mutants in co-culture.

TI  == cloning and functional analysis of the pmma gene encoding phosphomannomutase from the photosynthetic prokaryote prochlorothrix hollandica.
AB  == the pmma gene encoding a bifunctional phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (pmm/pgm) from the photosynthetic prokaryote, prochlorothrix hollandica has been  cloned and sequenced. the gene encodes a 51827 da polypeptide 48% identical to the pmm of azospirillum brasilense, 37% identical to the pgms of pathogenic neisseria sp. and 37% identical to the bifunctional algc pgm/pmm of pseudomonas aeruginosa. the pmma gene encodes an enzyme having both pgm and pmm activities as judged by both enzyme assays and complementation analysis in which the cloned gene partially corrected the pgm-1 mutation of escherichia coli.

TI  == bacteraemia and meningitis among hospital patients with diarrhoea.
AB  == to characterize bacteraemia and meningitis in diarrhoeal patients, the records of 3395 blood cultures and 120 cerebrospinal fluid (csf) cultures from 6132 patients admitted with diarrhoea to the clinical research centre of the international centre for diarrhoeal disease research, bangladesh during 1989 were analysed. microorganisms were isolated from 12% (417 of 3395) of blood cultures and 9% (11  of 120) of csf cultures. children below 5 years of age represented 80% of all patients who had blood cultures and 82% of those who had csf cultures made. the nutritional status was significantly lower in patients who had positive blood cultures than in those who had negative cultures. 23% (97 of 417) of patients with positive blood cultures and 45% (5 of 11) with positive csf cultures died. deaths occurred twice as often among patients who had organisms isolated than among those who had no organisms isolated from blood cultures. the organisms isolated from blood cultures which predicted most deaths were pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria meningitidis, escherichia coli and klebsiella sp., and they were multiresistant. we conclude that bacteraemia and meningitis remain serious complications associated with diarrhoea, especially in malnourished children; the therapeutic problem is further complicated by multiple drug resistance of the isolates.

TI  == effect of granulocytopenia on oral microbial relationships in patients with acute leukemia.
AB  == risk for acute infection increases as granulocyte levels decrease secondary to myelosuppressive chemotherapy in patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (anll). acute exacerbations of concomitant inflammatory periodontal diseases can  result in systemic infections in these patients. however, host-oral bacterial relationships in the periodontium in patients with anll are not well understood.  twenty-one adult patients with anll with periodontal disease ranging from gingivitis to severe periodontitis were studied. supragingival and subgingival plaque specimens were collected before chemotherapy (prechemotherapy), and at a defined midpoint of myelosuppression (midchemotherapy; day 14). all specimens were extensively cultured both aerobically and anaerobically. data were submitted to a partial correlational analysis, controlling for covariation relation to oral hygiene intervention and antibiotic administration. levels of total yeast exhibited a significant association with staphylococcus sp. at supragingival sites midchemotherapy (r = 0.68, p less than or equal to 0.05). levels of total yeast also correlated positively with pseudomonas aeruginosa at subgingival sites both prechemotherapy (r = 0.70, p less than or equal to 0.01) and midchemotherapy (r = 0.61, p less than or equal to 0.05). significant correlations of levels of veillonella sp. with neisseria sp. and gram-negative enteric bacilli were observed in both supragingival (r = 0.95, 0.77, p values less than or equal to 0.01) and subgingival (r = 0.69, 0.61, p values less than or equal to 0.05) plaque specimens midchemotherapy but not prechemotherapy. these data suggest that potentially pathogenic bacteria occur in plaque simultaneous with granulocytopenia in these patients. multiple mechanisms, including intergeneric coaggregation and other symbiotic relationships, may influence infectivity of the mixed plaque flora and thus contribute to the oral ecology observed in these patients.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == the in vitro activity of tigemonam: a comparison with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the activity of tigemonam was compared with that of aztreonam, cefuroxime, cephalexin, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, gentamicin, and ofloxacin, using an agar dilution method. tigemonam was active against strains containing known beta-lactamases of tem and oxa types, but strains containing broad-spectrum (group iv) enzymes were less susceptible. the mic90 of tigemonam against the common enterobacteriaceae was less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l. the mic90s against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were 0.5 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively. pseudomonas, staphylococci, and bacteroides sp. were less susceptible (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l). protein binding in human serum was found to be 62.5%; the presence of serum had only a modest effect on the activity of tigemonam.

TI  == aztreonam in the treatment of gram-negative meningitis and other gram-negative infections.
AB  == ninety patients (41 males, 49 females) with a diagnosis of meningitis, urinary tract infection (uti), gastroenteritis or other miscellaneous gram-negative infections were enrolled. their ages ranged from 7 days to 10 years, with a mean  age of 4 months. 58 (63%) patients had an etiology confirmed by either positive culture (52; 89%) or latex agglutination (6; 10%). 41 of these patients had meningitis diagnosed by positive cse culture (38) or by positive csf latex agglutination (3); 27/41 patients also had positive blood cultures. aztreonam mic100 for 27 isolates of haemophilus influenzae, all ampicillin-sensitive, was 0.19 micrograms/ml; 4 salmonella sp., 1 neisseria meningitidis and 1 serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by 0.19 micrograms/ml, and the mic100 for 2 klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 proteus vulgaris and 2 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were 0.045 and 0.19, 0.022 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == direct and indirect pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in mixed infections in children.
AB  == the recent emergence of numerous aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains has been associated with an increase in the failure rate of penicillins in the therapy of infection caused by these organisms. these include  respiratory tract, skin of soft tissue, female genital tract, intra-abdominal, and other miscellaneous infections. the important aerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) include staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and legionella sp. the anaerobic blpb are all bacteroidiaceae and include bacteroides fragilis group, b. melaninogenicus group, b. oralis, b. oris-buccae, and fusobacterium sp. laboratory, animal, and clinical studies that support the indirect pathogenicity  of these organisms and the distribution of these blpb in various infections are reviewed. blpb may not only have a direct pathogenic role in causing the infection, but also an indirect pathogenic role. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin  therapy, but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of aerobic and anaerobic blpb require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against  all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of pd 127,391, an enhanced-spectrum quinolone.
AB  == the in vitro activity of pd 127,391, a dihalogenated quinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, and cefuroxime against 525 recent isolates and well-characterized antimicrobial agent-resistant  strains. the mics of pd 127,391 against 90% of members of the family enterobacteriaceae, bacteroides fragilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria sp.,  and streptococcus pneumoniae were less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. some 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococci were susceptible to 0.25 micrograms of pd 127,391 per ml. against most strains, pd 127,391 was 2- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin, but it was 64-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against b. fragilis. strains of members of the family enterobacteriaceae which were resistant to nalidixic acid were less susceptible to all of the quinolones tested, including pd 127,391. the mic and minimum lethal concentration of pd 127,391 against three strains of chlamydia trachomatis were each 0.06 microgram/ml, and the mic against 90% of 21 strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis was 1 microgram/ml. pd 127,391 was less active at ph 5, its maximal  activity being at ph 7 to 8. the presence of urine at ph 5.9 decreased the bactericidal activity. the protein binding of pd 127,391 was 2 to 7%, and serum had little effect on activity.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == in vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. a-56620 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, bacteroides sp. and clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. a-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than a-56620. both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae (mic 0.015 micrograms/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mk less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). both agents were more active against streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. they inhibited enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus  at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. these agents show  overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefodizime were evaluated by agar dilution for 746 bacterial strains isolated in two hospitals. for enterobacteriaceae mics ranged from 0.008 micrograms/ml to more than 128 micrograms/ml (mode mic: 0.25); mode mics varied across species, ranging from 0.016 micrograms/ml for proteus mirabilis to 1 microgram/ml for citrobacter; mics ranged from 0.12 to 8 for most enterobacter and from 1 to 64 for serratia. the rare cefotaxime-resistant strains, most of which were citrobacter or enterobacter, also showed resistance to cefodizime. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter, with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128. haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly  susceptible (mic less than or equal to 0.008-0.016). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant. whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low  mics (0.03-0.12). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium (0.008 to 1) than for bacteroids (8 to 128 mu g/ml). our results show that cefodizime has the same properties as other third-generation cephalosporins: cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains also exhibit resistance to cefodizime.

AB  == ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l.  pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than  or equal to 6.3 mg/l. although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher mic values, and most bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. the overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant  to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. the activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid ph and in urine, but serum had no effect on mics or mbcs. increase in ofloxacin mics for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.

TI  == [multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (n-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftizoxime on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == the susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. additionally, the mic of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at  a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode mic varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. a few enterobacter and citrobacter strains are resistant. little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively).  haemophilus sp. (mic 0.01-0.03) and neisseria (mic less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. the mic of methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other streptococci and pneumococci have low mics (less than  0.008-0.025). the susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; mic ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for bacteroides sp.

TI  == trends in the development of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == in many ways it is ironic that the first description of a beta-lactamase occurred in 1940 with an enzyme isolated from escherichia coli since in recent years there has been a major interest in gram-negative species and the development of agents  to overcome the hydrolytic action of beta-lactamases of gram-negative species. there have been four distinctly different approaches to the development of new beta-lactam antibiotics. these have been the search for inhibitors of beta-lactamases and agents such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam are examples of  compounds which by virtue of kcat function act as suicide inhibitors and make old antibiotics new. there has been the modification of the penicillin and cephem nucleus to increase beta-lactamase stability or failing that to improve the ability of the compounds to pass through the cell wall and increase affinity for  critical beta-lactam receptors, i.e. penicillin-binding proteins. there has been  the development of carbapenem type of agents such as imipenem which would have broad activity including aerobic, anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative species. there has been the discovery of the monobactam agents of which aztreonam is an example of a compound with great beta-lactamase stability but with activity limited to gram-negative aerobic species. bacterial resistance has indeed been the major factor that has modified use of beta-lactams and influenced the development of the aforementioned types of drugs. the widespread presence of beta-lactamases in common pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis has made it necessary to have beta-lactamase stable compounds for initial therapy of infection. it is possible to analyze structure-activity relations of beta-lactam compounds to determine changes which  will be most advantageous in light of known and expected resistance patterns. but the increased realization in recent years of the importance of the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam drugs has made it essential that the development  of new compounds be based on an integration of microbiological and pharmacokinetic parameters. interest in the prevention of resistant flora has also affected the development of new drugs since it is increasingly appreciated that alteration of intestinal flora contributes to selection of drug resistant microorganisms. finally, new toxicities or adverse effects associated with the use of certain new agents has modified the development of certain compounds.

TI  == in vitro activity of enoxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of norfloxacin, new beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == enoxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 740 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% escherichia coli, klebsiella  sp., aeromonas sp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii at less than or equal to 0.8 micrograms/ml. the majority of pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.1 micrograms/ml.  haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp. were inhibited by less than 0.1 micrograms/ml. although most staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml, some streptococcal species had minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6.3 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and bacteroides sp. had minimal inhibitory concentrations greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml. activity of enoxacin and norfloxacin was similar. enoxacin inhibited organisms resistant to cefotaxime, moxalactam, gentamicin, and piperacillin. enoxacin was less active in urine at an acid ph than in broth, but serum did not decrease minimal inhibitory  concentrations or minimal bactericidal concentrations. there was no major difference between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations. resistance frequency development was less than 10(-9) for most bacterial species.

TI  == survival of bacteria after freezing of human semen in liquid nitrogen.
AB  == thirty-four semen samples from fertile men were subjected to bacteriologic evaluation before and after freezing to -196 degrees c using 10% glycerol as the  protective medium. cultures of the fresh portions from all ejaculates examined showed the presence of aerobic bacteria. staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium sp., alpha-streptococci, and nonhemolytic streptococci were found so commonly that they were considered commensals. enterococci, escherichia coli,  s. aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococci group b, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. maltophilia, and p. fluorescens, were also recovered from a few semen samples of these fertile men. practically all bacteria isolated from the fresh ejaculate were also recovered from the portions frozen in liquid nitrogen.
