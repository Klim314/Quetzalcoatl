TI  == [illumina sequencing 16s rrna tagging reveals diverse vaginal microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == objective: to analyze and compare vaginal microbiomes in healthy women at child-bearing ages and patients with bacterial vaginosis (bv). methods: a total of 74 vaginal swabs of the vaginal fornix were collected from 37 bv patients and  37 healthy women. bv status was assessed according to amsels clinical criteria for all the subjects and confirmed using gram-stain criteria (nugent scores). genomic dna of the samples was extracted for amplifying the 16s rrna v6 hypervariable region by pcr and pyrosequencing by illumina. bipes, uchime, tsc and gast were employed to analyze the information of the species from the samples. results: lactobacillus was the predominant species in healthy women (more than 95%), including mainly l. iners and l. crispatus, with a small quantity of gardnerella, granulicatella, streptococcus, prevotella, escherichia and other genus. the alpha diversity was significantly increased in 30 bv patients (p<0.001), and beta diversity also changed obviously shown by decreased  lactobacillus (varying from 45% to 1%, consisting mainly of l. iners) or even absence lactobacillus in 6 cases, with increased relative abundance of gardnerella, prevotella, granulicatella, anaerococcus, parvimonas, peptoniphilus.harei, peptostreptococcus, and dialister. different from previous data, 7 bv cases showed a predominance of the rare species l.gasseri and l.acidophilus (75% to 50%). conclusion: lactobacillus is the predominant vaginal  species in healthy women (mainly l. iners and l. crispatus) co-existing with many other bacteria and a variety of microorganisms. lactobacillus is significantly decreased and even absent in most of bv patients, and some cases show the predominance of the rare species l.gasseri and l.acidophilus.

TI  == acid production by vaginal flora in vitro is consistent with the rate and extent  of vaginal acidification.
AB  == perinatally, and between menarche and menopause, increased levels of estrogen cause large amounts of glycogen to be deposited in the vaginal epithelium. during these times, the anaerobic metabolism of the glycogen, by the epithelial cells themselves and/or by vaginal flora, causes the vagina to become acidic (ph approximately 4). this study was designed to test whether the characteristics of  acid production by vaginal flora in vitro can account for vaginal acidity. eight  vaginal lactobacillus isolates from four species-l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. crispatus, and l. jensenii-acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (3.2 to 4.8) that matches the range seen in the lactobacillus-dominated human vagina (ph 3.6 to 4.5 in most women) (b. andersch, l. forssman, k. lincoln, and p. torstensson, gynecol. obstet. investig. 21:19-25, 1986; l. cohen, br. j. vener. dis. 45:241-246, 1969; j. paavonen, scand. j. infect. dis. suppl. 40:31-35, 1983; c. tevi-benissan, l. belec, m. levy, v. schneider-fauveau, a. si mohamed, m.-c. hallouin, m. matta, and g. gresenguet, clin. diagn. lab. immunol. 4:367-374, 1997). during exponential growth, all of these lactobacillus species acidified their growth medium at rates on the order of 10(6) protons/bacterium/s. such rates, combined with an estimate of the total number of lactobacilli in the vagina, suggest that vaginal lactobacilli could reacidify the vagina at the rate  observed postcoitally following neutralization by the male ejaculate (w. h. masters and v. e. johnson, human sexual response, p. 93, 1966). during bacterial  vaginosis (bv), there is a loss of vaginal acidity, and the vaginal ph rises to >4.5. this correlates with a loss of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of diverse bacteria. three bv-associated bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia,  and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (4.7 to 6.0) consistent with the characteristic elevated vaginal ph associated with bv. together, these observations are consistent with vaginal flora, rather than epithelial cells, playing a primary role in creating the acidity of the vagina.

TI  == delta 22-beta-muricholic acid in monoassociated rats and conventional rats.
AB  == bile acids were analyzed in the bile, small and large intestines, and feces of germ-free rats after a single inoculation with one of six intestinal bacteria that had been originally isolated from human feces. bacteroides vulgatus and bifidobacterium longum preferentially deconjugated tauro-beta-muricholic acid and taurocholic acid, respectively. clostridium ramosum, peptostreptococcus productus and lactobacillus gasseri deconjugated both bile acids, but escherichia coli did  not deconjugate either one. rats inoculated with bacteria that deconjugated tauro-beta-muricholic acid produced delta 22-beta-muricholic acid in the feces. in contrast, delta 22-cholic acid could not be detected in rats inoculated with bacteria that deconjugated taurocholic acid.
