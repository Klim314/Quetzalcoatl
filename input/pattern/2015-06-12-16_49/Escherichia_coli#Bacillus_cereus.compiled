TI  - Study of Lactic Acid Bacteria Community From Raw Milk of Iranian One Humped Camel and Evaluation of Their Probiotic Properties.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Camel milk is amongst valuable food sources in Iran. On the other hand, due to the presence of probiotic bacteria and bacteriocin producers in camel milk, probiotic bacteria can be isolated and identified from this food product. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present research were the isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria from camel milk and evaluation of their probiotic properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of ten samples of camel milk were collected from the Golestan province of Iran under aseptic conditions. Bacteria were isolated by culturing the samples on selective medium. Isolates were identified by amplification of the 16S rDNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and were then screened and grouped by the Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) method. To evaluate probiotic properties, representative isolates of different ARDRA profiles were analyzed. The antimicrobial activity of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) against Pediococcus pentosaceus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus was examined by the agar diffusion assay. Acid and bile tolerance of isolates were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 64 isolates were analyzed based on biochemical tests and morphological characteristics. The most frequently isolated LAB was Enterococci. Weissella, Leuconostoc, Lactobacilli and Pediococci were less frequently found. Based on restriction analysis of the ITS, the isolates were grouped into nine different ARDRA patterns that were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing as P. pentosaceus, Enterococcus faecium strain Y-2, E. faecium strain JZ1-1, E. faecium strain E6, E. durans, E. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus casei and Weissella cibaria. The results showed that antimicrobial activity of the tested isolates was remarkable and P. pentosaceus showed the most antibacterial activity. In addition, E. durans, E. lactis, L. casei and P. pentosaceus were selected as probiotic bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the presence of bacteriocin-producing bacteria and probiotic bacteria in camel milk from the Golestan province of Iran.
TI  - Correlations between cyanobacterial density and bacterial transformation to the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state in four freshwater water bodies.
AB  - Nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton density and community composition, and the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state of heterotrophic bacteria were investigated in three connected reservoirs and a small isolated lake in South China to study the relationship between biotic and abiotic factors and the VBNC state in bacteria. Nutrient concentrations in the reservoirs increased in the direction of water flow, whereas Wenshan Lake was more eutrophic. Cyanobacterial blooms occurred in all four water bodies, with differing seasonal trends and dominant species. In Xili and Tiegang Reservoirs, the VBNC ratio (percent of VBNC state bacteria over total viable bacteria) was high for most of the year and negatively correlated with cyanobacterial density. Laboratory co-culture experiments were performed with four heterotrophic bacterial species isolated from Wenshan Lake (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella peneumoniae, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus cereus) and the dominant cyanobacterial species (Microcystis aeruginosa). For the first three bacterial species, the presence of M. aeruginosa induced the VBNC state and the VBNC ratio was positively correlated with M. aeruginosa density. However, B. cereus inhibited M. aeruginosa growth. These results demonstrate that cyanobacteria could potentially regulate the transformation to the VBNC state of waterborne bacteria, and suggest a role for bacteria in cyanobacterial bloom initiation and termination.
TI  - Kinetics of bacterial inactivation by 405nm and 520nm light emitting diodes and the role of endogenous coproporphyrin on bacterial susceptibility.
AB  - Photodynamic inactivation studies of microbial pathogens have focused on the use  of an external photosensitizer or a precursor compound to eliminate bacteria. The present study investigated the inactivation kinetics of six bacterial pathogens by a 405nm light emitting diode (LED) without the addition of any external compound. The role of endogenous coproporphyrin on the bacterial susceptibility to LEDs was also examined. Pathogens were illuminated with LEDs at 25, 10 and 4 degrees C for 9h and the inactivation curves were modeled using six different equations. Endogenous coproporphyrin was quantified using an HPLC system equipped with a fluorescence detector. At a dose of 306J/cm2, the 405nm LED brought about 4.0, 2.1 and 1.9 log reductions in the populations of Staphylococcus aureus at 25, 10 and 4 degrees C, respectively. At all three temperatures, the population of Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes reduced by approximately 2.3 and 1.9 log respectively. Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed moderate susceptibility to 405nm LED while Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most resistant. Of the six models tested, Hom model proved most suitable. This study demonstrated that 405nm LEDs can be useful in the inactivation of bacterial pathogens with the aid of endogenous coproporphyrin alone.
TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities from Jatropha dioica roots.
AB  - The antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of organic extracts obtained from roots of the medicinal plant Jatropha dioica (Euphorbiaceae) were investigated. In order to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, the organic extracts were tested against clinical isolates of the human pathogens Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis and Sporothrix schenckii. Results revealed that the hexane extract possess the stronger activity and a broader microbicide spectrum compared to the acetone and ethanol extracts. The activity of hexane extract may be attributed in part to the presence of beta-sitosterol, the major compound identified by bioautography. The hexane extract, as well as the bioactive fraction were not cytotoxic when assays were profiled against the normal cell lines Chang, OK and LLCPK-1 (IC50>1000 mug mL(-1)).
TI  - Supercritical CO2 extraction of functional compounds from Spirulina and their biological activity.
AB  - Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) extraction and fractionation of Spirulina platensis was carried out to obtain functional compounds with antioxidant, antimicrobial and enzyme inhibitory activities. Extraction of SCCO2 was carried out using 200 g of Spirulina powder at 40 masculineC under 120 bar pressure with CO2 flow rate of 1.2 kg h(-1). SCCO2 fraction obtained was further treated with hexane and ethyl acetate to identify its components. Individual components were identified by comparing mass spectra of samples with standard data and retention indices (RI) of C5-C20 n-alkanes mixture using the kovat index formula. The phenolic and flavonoid content of the SCCO2 extract was found to be 0.34 +/- 0.01 g/100 g and 0.12 +/- 0.01 g/100 g respectively. The SCCO2 extract had antioxidant activity with IC50 value of 109.6 +/- 3.0 mug mL(-1) for DPPH (2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl radical), IC50 value of 81.66 +/- 2.5 mug mL(-1) for reducing power and IC50 value of 112.70 +/- 0.8 mug mL(-1) for hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. Further, antioxidant activity study on oxidative induced DNA damage was analysed to elucidate the positive role of SCCO2 extract. SCCO2 extracts showed high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus FRI 722 and Bacillus cereus F 4810) compared to that of Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli MTCC 108 and Yersinia enterocolitica MTCC 859). The SCCO2 extract exhibited inhibitory activity on both Angiotensin-1 converting enzyme and alpha-glucosidase with IC50 values of 274 +/- 1.0 mug mL(-1) and 307 +/- 2.0 mug mL(-1) respectively.
TI  - Sonodynamic action of curcumin on foodborne bacteria Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Bacterial contamination is an important cause of foodborne diseases. The present  study aimed to investigate sonodynamic action of curcumin on foodborne bacteria Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). The uptake of curcumin was measured for optimizing the concentration incubation time before ultrasound sonication, and colony forming units (CFU) were counted after ultrasound treatment. The chromosomal DNA fragmentation of bacteria was analyzed and the effect of hypoxic condition on the antibacterial efficacy of sonodynamic action of curcumin was also assessed in this study. The results showed that the maximum uptake of curcumin in B. cereus and E. coli occurred in 50min after curcumin incubation. Curcumin had sonodynamic bactericidal activity in a curcumin dose-dependent manner, and 5.6-log reduction in CFU of B. cereus was observed after curcumin treatment (2.0muM), however, only 2-log reduction in CFU of E. coli after 40muM curcumin treatment. No significant change in chromosomal DNA was found after the combined treatment of curcumin and ultrasound. The survival of B. cereus and E. coli after sonodynamic treatment in hypoxic group was significantly higher than that in normal oxygen group. These findings indicated that sonodynamic action of curcumin had significant inactivation effect on foodborne bacteria, and B. cereus was more sensitive to sonodynamic treatment of curcumin than E. coli. Sonodynamic antibacterial activity of curcumin might be dependent on the oxygen environment.
TI  - PCR detection and identification of bacterial contaminants in ocular samples from post-operative endophthalmitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening complication of ocular surgery which requires urgent medical consideration including comprehensive diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a sensitive molecular method has been extensively used for detection of microbial species in clinical specimens. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the causative organisms of endophthalmitis in our patient population using a procedure based on PCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vitreous samples from 32 patients with post-operative endophthalmitis were collected. Total vitreous DNA was extracted and then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using PCR with a pair of HAD2 universal primers. Library of PCR products from 16S rRNA, cloned into the pTZ57R/T vector. The ligated products were then transformed into E. coli DH5alpha strain and grown in the LB-ampicillin/X-Gal/IPTG plate. RESULTS: From the total of 32 vitreous samples, 18 specimens were positive, illustrating the presence of bacterial infection (56.4 %). Twelve species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus were identified using BLAST for known 16S rRNA sequences. CONCLUSION: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) accompanied with cloning and sequencing approved to be sensitive and specific. The rapid molecular technique was useful in detection of 12 major microbial species, in infectious endophthalmitis.
TI  - Bioactive compounds isolated from submerged fermentations of the Chilean fungus Stereum rameale.
AB  - Liquid fermentations of the fungus Stereum rameale (N degrees 2511) yielded extracts with antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity reached its peak after 216 h of stirring. Bioassay-guided fractionation methods were employed for the isolation of the bioactive metabolites. Three known compounds were identified: MS-3 (1), vibralactone (2) and vibralactone B (3). The three compounds showed antibacterial activity as a function of their concentration. Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of compound 1 against Gram-positive bacteria were as follows: Bacillus cereus (50 mug/mL), Bacillus subtilis (10 mug/mL) and Staphylococcus aureus (100 mug/mL). Compounds 2 and 3 were active only against Gram-negative bacteria. The MBC of compound 2 against Escherichia coli was 200 mug/mL. Compound 3 inhibited significantly the growth of E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MBC values of 50 and 100 mug/mL, respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 Lactobacillus and three Bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. Agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (pH 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; CFS) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; CFW) from de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. Acid CFS and CFW showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against C. albicans. Neutralized CFS/CFW assays showed six strains active against S. aureus (L. acidophilus L-1, L. brevis 1, L. fermentum 1, B. animalis subsp. lactis L-3), E. coli (L. bulgaricus 6) or B. cereus (L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic). Inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized CFS (L. bulgaricus 6, L. helveticus 3, L. plantarum 24-2L, L. fermentum 1)/CFW (L. plantarum 24-5D, L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic) was detected. Some strains maintained activity after pH neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. The antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the Epsilometer test method. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. Four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (L. rhamnosus Lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (L. acidophilus L-1 and L. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; L. casei L-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). Vancomycin MICs > 256 mug/mL indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. The antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of native California medicinal plant extracts isolated from Rhamnus californica and Umbellularia californica.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global public health. Medicinal plants have long been used as remedies for infectious diseases by native cultures around the world and have the potential for providing effective treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections. Rhamnus californica (Rhamnaceae) and Umbellularia californica (Lauraceae) are two indigenous California plant species historically used by Native Americans to treat skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. This study aimed to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of R. and U. californica against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: Methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of R. and U. californica were prepared by soxhlet extraction and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays. Chemical profiling of the extracts was performed using standard methods. RESULTS: All extracts inhibited the growth of MRSA and other Gram-positive bacteria with MICs of 3.3-6.0 mg/ml. Gram-negative organisms were unaffected by these extracts. U. californica extracts (leaves and bark) had the lowest MIC values. Chemical profiling detected the presence of quinones, alkaloids, flavonoids, cardenolides, tannins and saponins in these extracts. Our study is the first to report the antimicrobial properties of R. and U. californica and illustrates their promising anti-MRSA potential. CONCLUSIONS: Our results give scientific credence to the traditional medicinal uses of these plants by the indigenous peoples of California. Further investigation of the secondary metabolites responsible for the antimicrobial activity of these extracts against MRSA is warranted.
TI  - A novel antimicrobial flavonoid from the stem bark of Commiphora pedunculata (Kotschy & Peyr.) Engl.
AB  - A new flavonoid, 2-(3,5-dihydroxy-4-methoxy-phenyl)-3,5-dihydroxy-8,8-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-8H-pyra no[3,2]chromen-4-one, together with previously reported epicatechin was isolated from the ethyl acetate soluble fraction of the methanol extract of the stem bark of Commiphora pedunculata. The structures of these compounds were elucidated based on extensive analysis of their spectral data, including 1 and 2D NMR. The compounds were active against 9 out of 12 tested microorganisms including a resistant strain; vancomycin-resistant entrococci (VRE), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The zones of inhibition ranged between 22 and 34 mm against the microorganisms. The minimum inhibitory concentration was as low as 6.25 mug/mL against Shigella dysentriae, Bacillus cereus and S. aureus while the minimum bactericidal concentration was as low as 50 mug/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, VRE and C.albicans. This is the first report of the isolation of the compound.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities and mechanism of sugar fatty acid esters against five food-related bacteria.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activities of sugar fatty acid esters, with different fatty acid and saccharide moieties, against five food-related bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Sucrose monocaprate showed the strongest antibacterial activity against all tested bacteria, especially Gram-positive bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 2.5 and 10mM, respectively. The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for Gram-positive bacteria were 10mM. Time-kill assay also showed that sucrose monocaprate significantly inhibit the growth of tested bacteria. The permeability of the cell membrane and intracellular proteins were both changed by sucrose monocaprate according to cell constituents' leakage, SDS-PAGE and scanning electron microscope assays. It is suggested that sucrose monocaprate, with both emulsifying and antibacterial activities, have a potential to serve as a safe multifunctional food additive in food industries.
TI  - Assessment of the microbial load of some medicinal plants commonly used in Romania.
AB  - AIM: This study aims to assess the microbial load of some medicinal plants (Matricaria chamomilla, Achillea millefolium, Ocimum basilicum, Calendula officinalis, Tilia cordata, Hypericum perforatum) commonly used as medicinal teas. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 24 samples collected from the local market, as well as from the spontaneous flora of Galati County, were analyzed in terms of the total number of germs, the content of coliform bacteria, yeasts and molds, and the presence of specific pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, Salmonella spp.). RESULTS: The values obtained for total number of germs, yeasts and molds were in accordance with the limits set by the European Pharmacopoeia for plant products to which hot water is added before use. In the case of specific pathogenic bacteria, the presence of E. coli was confirmed in 41.66% of the samples, the presence of Coagulase-positive Staphylococcus in 16.66% of the samples, and the presence of Bacillus cereus in 33.33% of the samples. Salmonella spp. was absent in all samples. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights a certain microbial load of medicinal plants analyzed, emphasizing the importance of quality control in all stages of production.
TI  - Effect of UV-C light on the microbial and sensory quality of seasoned dried seafood.
AB  - This study investigated the effects of different doses of UV-C light at 253.7 nm  (0-18 kJ/m2) on the reduction of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus in contaminated seasoned dried filefish (Thamnaconus modestus) and sliced squid (Todarodes pacificus) surfaces and sensory quality. The counts of all three bacteria were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by the increase of UV-C dosage. E. coli, S. aureus and B. cereus on filefish with 18 kJ/m2 of UV-C maximally reduced by 2.70, 2.55 and 2.57 log CFU/g, respectively; however, on the sliced squid using the same UV dose reduced the same bacteria by 1.35, 0.54 and 1.05 log CFU/g, respectively. However, the results suggest that 6 to 9 kJ/m2 of UV-C could be used for the inactivation of E. coli and B. cereus in these dried fishery products without any changes in sensory quality. However, S. aureus levels on sliced squid will require a combination of UV-C light and chemical treatment.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial properties of 2,3-dideoxyglucosides of terpene alcohols and phenols.
AB  - Essential oils and their oxygenated terpene constituents possess potent antimicrobial properties. In the present study, a facile synthetic route to the 2,3-dideoxy 1-O-glucosides of important phenols and terpene alcohols in excellent yields (85-96%) has been delineated. Studies on their antimicrobial action against four food-borne pathogens - Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica - demonstrated that the zone of inhibition, in general, was higher for the 2,3-unsaturated 1-O-glucoside derivatives (1b-6b) and the corresponding saturated glucosides (1c-5c) when compared to the parent alcohols/phenols (1-6). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values for these derivatives too were generally lower than those of the parent compounds. Furthermore, the time-kill and bacteriolysis assays too demonstrated the greater antimicrobial potential of the derivatives. The 2,3-dideoxy 1-O-glucosides of phenols and terpene alcohols were more effective in their antimicrobial action than the corresponding parent compounds. The study indicated that these novel derivatives can find useful application in control of food-related pathogenic microbes in foods.
TI  - Isolation of lactic acid bacteria showing anti-oxidative and probiotic activities from kimchi and infant feces.
AB  - The purpose of this study aimed to investigate the lactic acid bacteria with anti-oxidative and probiotic activities isolated from Korean healthy infant feces and kimchi. A1, A2, S1, S2, and S3 isolates were assigned to Lactobacillus sp. A3, A4, E1, E2, E3, and E4 isolates were assigned to Leuconostoc sp. on the basis of their physiological properties and 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis. Most strains were confirmed as safe bio resources through non-hemolytic activities and non-production of harmful enzymes such as beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase and tryptophanase etc. Isolated 11 strains showed different resistant to acid and bile acids. In addition, 11 strains exhibited antibacterial activity against food-borne bacteria, especially Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, all strains showed the highest levels of hydrophobicity. The antioxidant effects of 11 strains culture filtrate include 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity, 2.2'-azino-bis (2-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation scavenging activity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The results revealed that most strains culture filtrate have effectively scavenging activity at DPPH and ABTS radicals. All strains appeared effectively superoxide dismutase activity. In conclusion, isolated strains A1, A3, S1, and S3 have good probiotic activities applicable to the development for functional foods and health-related products. Also these might be contributed to prevent and control several disease associated with oxidative stress using as probiotics.
TI  - Challenge study of the pathogen reduction capacity of the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma technology.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although most pathogen reduction systems for plasma primarily target viruses, bacterial contamination may also occur. This study aimed to investigate the bacterial reduction capacity of a methylene blue (MB) treatment process and its virus inactivation capacity in lipaemic plasma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial concentrations in plasma units spiked with different bacterial strains were measured before and after the following steps of the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma procedure: leucocyte filtration, MB/light treatment and MB filtration. Virus inactivation was investigated for three virus types in non-lipaemic, borderline lipaemic and highly lipaemic plasma. RESULTS: Leucocyte filtration alone efficiently eliminated most of the tested bacteria by more than 4 logs (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus) or to the limit of detection (LOD) (>/= 4.8 logs; Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella pneumoniae). MB/light and MB filtration further reduced Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus to below the LOD. The small bacterium Brevundimonas diminuta was reduced by 1.7 logs by leucocyte filtration alone, and to below the LOD by additional MB/light treatment and MB filtration (>/= 3.7 logs). Suid herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus and human immunodeficiency virus 1 were efficiently inactivated by THERAFLEX MB-Plasma, independent of the degree of lipaemia. CONCLUSION: THERAFLEX MB-Plasma efficiently reduces bacteria, mainly via the integrated filtration system. Its virus inactivation capacity is sufficient to compensate for reduced light transparency due to lipaemia.
TI  - Ieodoglucomide C and Ieodoglycolipid, New Glycolipids from a Marine-Derived Bacterium Bacillus licheniformis 09IDYM23.
AB  - Chemical examination of the ethyl acetate extract from the fermentation broth of  the marine-derived bacterium Bacillus licheniformis resulted in the isolation of two new glycolipids, ieodoglucomide C (1) and ieodoglycolipid (2). The structural characterization of 1 and 2 was achieved by extensive spectroscopic evidence, including 2D NMR experiments. A combination of chemical derivatization techniques followed by NMR studies, LC-MS data analysis and a literature review was deployed for the establishment of the stereo-configurations of 1 and 2. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited good antibiotic properties against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MICs ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 muM. Furthermore, the antifungal activity of 1 and 2 was evaluated against plant pathogenic fungi Aspergillus niger, Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis cinerea and Colletotrichum acutatum as well as the human pathogen Candida albicans. Compounds 1 and 2 inhibited the mycelial growth of these pathogens with MIC values of 0.03-0.05 muM, revealing that these compounds are good candidates for the development of new fungicides.
TI  - Development of intestinal microflora and occurrence of diarrhoea in sucking foals: effects of Bacillus cereus var. toyoi supplementation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Almost all foals develop transient diarrhoea within the first weeks of life. Studies indicated different viral, bacterial, and parasitic causes, such as rotavirus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Cryptosporidium are discussed. But little is known about the development of intestinal microflora in foals. The present study investigated whether the supplementation with Bacillus cereus var. toyoi would modify the developing intestinal microflora and consequently reduce diarrhoea in foals. From birth, the foals were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: placebo (10 mL isotonic NaCl, n = 8), low dosage (LD; 5 x 10(8) cfu B. cereus var. toyoi, n = 7) and high dosage (HD; 2 x 10(9) cfu B. cereus var. toyoi, n = 10). Treatment groups were supplemented orally once a day for 58 days. Faeces scoring and sampling were performed within the first 24 h after birth and on day 9, 16, 23, 30, 44, 58 of the foal's life and also on the first day of diarrhoea. Culture-plate methods were used to analyse the bacterial microflora. RESULTS: Eighty-eight per cent of the foals developed diarrhoea (placebo 7/8, LD 5/7, HD 10/10) during the first 58 days of life. Bacillus cereus var. toyoi supplementation had no effect on bacterial microflora. Clostridium perfringens and enterobacteria were equally prevalent in foals with diarrhoea and those who were not afflicted. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the supplementation of B. cereus var. toyoi had no effect on the occurrence of diarrhoea and health status in the foals.
TI  - Antimicrobial evaluation of plants used for the treatment of diarrhoea in a rural community in northern Maputaland, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zulu people living in the rural area of Maputaland (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) rely heavily on medicinal plants for the treatment of diarrhoea. Abundant availability of medicinal plants in the study area offers low cost health care, but scientific validation is needed in order to lend credibility to the traditional use against many ailments including diarrhoeal infections. With this in mind a study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of 23 plant species which are used for the treatment of diarrhoea in rural Maputaland. Four 1:1 plant combinations were also evaluated to determine their interactive effects against seven diarrhoea-related bacterial pathogens. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays were undertaken on dichloromethane-methanol (CH2Cl2: MeOH) and aqueous crude extracts. The following micro-organisms were selected for this study and were tested based on their association with stomach ailments and diarrhoea; Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), Proteus vulgaris (ATCC 33420), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Shigella flexneri (ATCC 25875) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 12600). The fractional inhibitory concentration index (SigmaFIC) was determined for plants traditionally used in combination. RESULTS: Shigella flexneri proved to be the most susceptible pathogen, where the organic extract of Terminalia sericea showed the most prominent noteworthy antibacterial activity (mean MIC value of 0.04 mg/mL). The aqueous extracts generally showed poorer antimicrobial activity with some exceptions i.e. Acacia burkei, Brachylaena transvaalensis against B. cereus and B. transvaalensis against S. flexneri. In the combination studies, synergy was predominant with mean (across all pathogens) SigmaFIC values of 0.30 for Acanthospermum glabratum with Krauseola mosambicina; SigmaFIC values of 0.46 for A. glabratum with Psidium guajava; SigmaFIC values of 0.39 for B. transvaalensis with P. guajava and SigmaFIC values of 0.88 (additive) for the combination of B. transvaalensis with Sclerocarya birrea. CONCLUSION: This study provided some insight into the bacterial in vitro efficacies of plants traditionally used to treat diarrhoea by the people of Northern Maputaland. Very little connection was observed between frequency of use and efficacy. Plant combinations demonstrated favourable efficacy with mostly synergistic effects noted, lending some credibility to their use in combination.
TI  - Secondary metabolites of Seseli rigidum: Chemical composition plus antioxidant, antimicrobial and cholinesterase inhibition activity.
AB  - Extracts of different polarity obtained from various plant parts (root, leaf, flower and fruit) of Seseli rigidum were studied by different antioxidant assays: DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity, by total reducing power method as well as via total content of flavonoids and polyphenols. Essential oils of all plant parts showed weak antioxidant characteristics. The inhibitory concentration range of the tested extracts, against bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger was 0.01-1.50mg/mL and of a microbicidal 0.02-3.00mg/mL. In the interaction with cholinesterase, all essential oils proved effective as inhibitors. The highest percentage of inhibition versus human and horse cholinesterase was shown by root essential oil (38.20% and 48.30%, respectively) among oils, and root hexane extract (40.56% and 50.65% respectively). Essential oils and volatile components of all plant parts were identified by GC, GC-MS and headspace/GC-MS. Statistical analysis of the ensemble of results showed that the root essential oil composition differed significantly from essential oils of other parts of the plant. Taking into account all of the studied activities, the root hexane extract showed the best overall properties. By means of high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry, the 30 most abundant constituents were identified in extracts of different polarity. The presence of identified constituents was linked to observed specific biological activities, thus designating compounds potentially responsible for each exhibited activity.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, KL-1Y, from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1.
AB  - Three bacteriocins from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. The bacteriocin peptides KL-1X, -1Y and -1Z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 Da, respectively. All three peptides were stable at pH 2-12 and 25 degrees C and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees C for 30 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min. However, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. KL-1Y showed broad inhibitory activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis DMST 17368, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739. KL-1X and -1Z inhibited only Gram-positive bacteria. KL-1X, KL-1Y and KL-1Z exhibited synergistic activity. The successful amino acid sequencing of KL-1Y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin KL-1Y". Plantaricin KL-1Y exhibited bactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus JCM 2152(T). Compared to nisin, KL-1Y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 AU/mL against the growth of Bacillus coagulans JCM 2257(T), B. cereus JCM 2152(T), Listeria innocua ATCC 33090(T), Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 118, E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only B. coagulans JCM 2257(T) and B. cereus JCM 2152(T). Therefore, the novel plantaricin KL-1Y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  - Foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni,  Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. To help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. Topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and physicochemical methods (heat, UV light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. Possible areas for future research are suggested. Plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. The collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - Organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles for bacterial inhibition: synthesis and characterization of doped and undoped ONPs with Ag/Au NPs.
AB  - Organic nanoparticles (ONPs) of lipoic acid and its doped derivatives ONPs/Ag and ONPs/Au were prepared and characterized by UV-Visible, EDS, and TEM analysis. The antibacterial properties of the ONPs ONPs/Ag and ONPs/Au were tested against bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi). Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and bacterial growth inhibition tests show that ONPs/Ag are more effective in limiting bacterial growth than other NPs, particularly, for Gram positive than for Gram-negative ones. The order of bacterial cell growth inhibition was ONPs/Ag > ONPs > ONPs/Au. The morphology of the cell membrane for the treated bacteria was analyzed by SEM. The nature of bond formation of LA with Ag or Au was analyzed by molecular orbital and density of state (DOS) using DFT.
TI  - Biosynthesis, characterization, and antimicrobial applications of silver nanoparticles.
AB  - In the present study, the strain Brevibacterium frigoritolerans DC2 was explored  for the efficient and extracellular synthesis of silver nanoparticles. These biosynthesized silver nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry, which detected the formation of silver nanoparticles in the reaction mixture and showed a maximum absorbance at 420 nm. In addition, field emission transmission electron microscopy revealed the spherical shape of the nanoparticles. The dynamic light scattering results indicated the average particle size of the product was 97 nm with a 0.191 polydispersity index. Furthermore, the product was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and elemental mapping, which displayed the presence of elemental silver in the product. Moreover, on a medical platform, the product was checked against pathogenic microorganisms including Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella enterica, Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The nanoparticles demonstrated antimicrobial activity against all of these pathogenic microorganisms. Additionally, the silver nanoparticles were evaluated for their combined effects with the commercial antibiotics lincomycin, oleandomycin, vancomycin, novobiocin, penicillin G, and rifampicin against these pathogenic microorganisms. These results indicated that the combination of antibiotics with biosynthesized silver nanoparticles enhanced the antimicrobial effects of antibiotics. Therefore, the current study is a demonstration of an efficient biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles by B. frigoritolerans DC2 and its effect on the enhancement of the antimicrobial efficacy of well-known commercial antibiotics.
TI  - A rapid and miniaturized method for the selection of microbial phenol degraders using colourimetric microtitration.
AB  - A high-throughput method is described, consisting of a colourimetric microtitration for screening phenol-degrading microorganisms, using a mixture of 4-aminoantipyrine and potassium ferricyanide as the colour indicator. This contemporary study summarizes a new method to determine phenol-degrading bacteria isolated from different areas. The method was used for testing a total of 72 bacteria collected from the natural environment and five known strains obtained from diagnostic and research laboratories employing 200 mg/L phenol (the linear range saturation concentration). Depending on the change in colour indicator, the degradation profiles of 11 strains of bacteria are shown, of which seven strains were able to degrade more than 80 % of phenol within 6-8 h, while the other four strains took 12-24 h. Two of the environmentally isolated strains showed high efficiency of phenol degradation and were confirmed by the high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. These strains were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing as unique (Escherichia coli moh1 and Bacillus cereus moh2) and were deposited in the GenBank of NCBI. Two pathogenic strains (Uropathogenic E. coli and Salmonella sp.) were found to be the fast degraders of phenol, which is of medical concern, as phenol is generally used as a disinfectant in hospitals. This method can be used for the estimation and screening of phenol degraders in a single step, for its application in bioremediation as well as in hospitals for screening the phenol resistance of pathogens.
TI  - Characterization of films based on chitosan lactate and its blends with oxidized  starch and gelatin.
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chitosan lactate (CHL) was tested against bacteria and phytopathogenic fungi. Then, the structural, physicochemical and antimicrobial properties of films based on CHL, oxidized potato starch (OPS), and gelatin (GEL) were investigated. With the exception of Rhizopus nigricans, CHL was effective against the target organisms. Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) were more sensitive to CHL than Gram-negative bacteria (Pectobacterium carotovorum and Escherichia coli). Cryo-SEM images showed total miscibility between the polymers in the blends and the ATR-FTIR spectra revealed that there was an interaction among the polymeric components. Pure CHL films displayed the highest moisture content (25.51%), water vapor permeability (48.78gmmm(-2)d(-1)kPa(-1)), and the lowest tensile and puncture strength (2.00 and 1.45MPa, respectively) among the studied films. CHL50/GEL50 films had lower permeability, higher mechanical strength, and lower elongation compared to CHL50/OPS50 films. Films obtained from CHL and CHL50/GEL50 were completely water-soluble and did not show sorbitol recrystallization. The incorporation of CHL into OPS and GEL films did not affect their transparency and improved UV-blocking capacity. CHL films were the only ones that exhibited antibacterial efficiency. Antifungal activities against Alternaria alternata and Monilinia fructigena were detected for CHL and CHL50/GEL50 films.
TI  - Microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  - The present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (FABs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). Samples were screened for Escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. Microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log CFU/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (P < 0.05), whereas the other FABs contained , 25 CFU/25 ml microorganisms. Unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7 to 14.1%) or pH (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. Despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and B. cereus (detected in all FABs) were present in some products. B. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (P < 0.05). The finding that spore-forming B. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality FAB products. New strategic quality management plans for various FABs are needed.
TI  - Expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in Canada.
AB  - Enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in Canada and globally. Understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. Expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously, to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information is difficult or expensive to obtain. Thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. The elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. Experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. Estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. Transmission was attributed primarily to food for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Trichinella spp., all three Vibrio spp. categories explored, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as Campylobacter spp., four Escherichia coli categories, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. Water was the primary pathway for Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and Shigella spp. Consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. This study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for Canada, considering all possible transmission routes. Further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and E. coli subgroups in Canada.
TI  - Grafted alpha-hydroxyphosphonic acids onto polymeric supports: preparation, characterization, and antimicrobial effect.
AB  - The paper deals with the preparation and characterization of compounds with antimicrobial activity: alpha-hydroxyphosphonic acids grafted onto styrene-12%-(15%)-divinylbenzene copolymer. These products proved to have antimicrobial effect against two species of gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two species of gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and a species of yeast (Candida albicans). Tests showed the reduction of bacterial load at different time intervals during the 18 h of contact.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antiquorum-sensing studies. Part 3: Synthesis and biological evaluation of new series of [1,3,4]thiadiazoles and fused [1,3,4]thiadiazoles.
AB  - New series of [1,3,4]thiadiazoles and fused [1,3,4]thiadiazoles were synthesized. The newly synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli. Compounds 3b and 10a displayed the highest activity against E. coli with MIC value of 78.125 mug/mL. In addition, compound 10a exhibited the highest activity against B. cereus with MIC value of 156.25 mug/mL. The antifungal activity of these compounds was also tested against Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus 3375. Compounds 3b, 5a, 10a, and 12b showed the best activity against A. flavus 3375 with MIC value of 19.531 mug/mL. The same compounds were examined for their antiquorum-sensing activity against Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472, whereas compounds 3b, 5a, and 12b exhibited moderate activity. In vitro cytotoxicity testing of compounds 3b,c, 5a, 6a, 10a, and 12a,b against human normal lung fibroblast (W138) cell line was performed. The in vivo acute toxicity of the same compounds was also tested and the obtained results indicated that compound 10a is the least toxic analog. The same compounds were studied for their DNA-binding affinity and the obtained results showed that compounds 3b, 10a, and 12a,b have moderate DNA-binding affinity.
TI  - The development of a green approach for the biosynthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles by using Panax ginseng root extract, and their biological applications.
AB  - The biosynthesis of nanoparticles has received attention because of the development of economic and environmentally friendly technology for the synthesis of nanoparticles. The study develops a convenient method for the green synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles by utilizing fresh root extract of the four-year old Panax ginseng plant, and evaluated the antimicrobial applications of silver nanoparticles against pathogenic microorganisms. P. ginseng is a well-known herbal medicinal plant, and its active ingredients are mainly ginsenosides. The fresh root of the 4 year old P. ginseng plant has been explored for the synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles without the use of any additional reducing and capping agents. The reduction of silver nitrate led to the formation of silver nanoparticles within 2 h of reaction at 80 degrees C. The gold nanoparticles were also successfully synthesized by the reduction of auric acid at 80 degrees C, within 5 min of reaction. The biosynthesized gold and silver nanoparticles were characterized by techniques using various instruments, viz. ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis spectroscopy), field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), elemental mapping, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In addition, the silver nanoparticles have shown antimicrobial potential against Bacillus anthracis, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria: promising supplements for enhancing the biological activities of kombucha.
AB  - Kombucha is sweetened black tea that is fermented by a symbiosis of bacteria and  yeast embedded within a cellulose membrane. It is considered a health drink in many countries because it is a rich source of vitamins and may have other health benefits. It has previously been reported that adding lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus) strains to kombucha can enhance its biological functions, but in that study only lactic acid bacteria isolated from kefir grains were tested. There are many other natural sources of lactic acid bacteria. In this study, we examined the effects of lactic acid bacteria from various fermented Vietnamese food sources (pickled cabbage, kefir and kombucha) on kombucha's three main biological functions: glucuronic acid production, antibacterial activity and antioxidant ability. Glucuronic acid production was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, antibacterial activity was assessed by the agar-well diffusion method and antioxidant ability was evaluated by determining the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity. Four strains of food-borne pathogenic bacteria were used in our antibacterial experiments: Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 and Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778. Our findings showed that lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from kefir are superior to those from other sources for improving glucuronic acid production and enhancing the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of kombucha. This study illustrates the potential of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kefir as biosupplements for enhancing the bioactivities of kombucha.
TI  - Bacillus halodurans Strain C125 Encodes and Synthesizes Enzymes from Both Known Pathways To Form dUMP Directly from Cytosine Deoxyribonucleotides.
AB  - Analysis of the genome of Bacillus halodurans strain C125 indicated that two pathways leading from a cytosine deoxyribonucleotide to dUMP, used for dTMP synthesis, were encoded by the genome of the bacterium. The genes that were responsible, the comEB gene and the dcdB gene, encoding dCMP deaminase and the bifunctional dCTP deaminase:dUTPase (DCD:DUT), respectively, were both shown to be expressed in B. halodurans, and both genes were subject to repression by the nucleosides thymidine and deoxycytidine. The latter nucleoside presumably exerts its repression after deamination by cytidine deaminase. Both comEB and dcdB were cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and purified to homogeneity. Both enzymes were active and displayed the expected regulatory properties: activation by dCTP for dCMP deaminase and dTTP inhibition for both enzymes. Structurally, the B. halodurans enzyme resembled the Mycobacterium tuberculosis enzyme the most. An investigation of sequenced genomes from other species of the genus Bacillus revealed that not only the genome of B. halodurans but also the genomes of Bacillus pseudofirmus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus hemicellulosilyticus, Bacillus marmarensis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus megaterium encode both the dCMP deaminase and the DCD:DUT enzymes. In addition, eight dcdB homologs from Bacillus species within the genus for which the whole genome has not yet been sequenced were registered in the NCBI Entrez database.
TI  - Characterization and in vitro biological activities of Thai traditional fermented shrimp pastes.
AB  - In this work, chemical and biological characteristics of two types of Thai fermented shrimp paste, Kapi Ta Dam and Kapi Ta Deang, at different fermentation periods and their raw materials were investigated. Kapi had low water activity and high proteins with high glutamic acid and lysine. Both Kapis, which had different sources, showed similar characteristics. The number of lactic acid bacteria in the products increased during the early stages of fermentation. Free alpha-amino acid contents in the products increased with the fermentation time. The water extracts from Kapi products showed strong antioxidative activities against ABTS(+) radical, and ACE inhibitory activity but they did not exhibit antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium. Biological activities in Kapi could be developed by fermentation process, enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins and non-enzymatic browning reactions. Kapi could, thus, serve as a potential source of natural bioactive substances.
TI  - Mechanical and antibacterial properties of novel high performance chitosan/nanocomposite films.
AB  - Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticle was successfully synthesized using hydrothermal method as well as, silver (Ag) nanoparticle was direct prepared during chitosan nanocomposites preparation. Chitosan films were investigated by recognized the effect of kinds of acids (formic or acetic acid). Correspondingly, using of concentrated NaOH was checking for facilitating de-casting of the films. Utilization of formic acid arisen higher quality films than those films produced using acetic acid as solvent. Optimization was based on the mechanical properties for both types of acids solvent. Furthermore, the elasticity of the prepared films was enhanced by blending hydroxyl ethylcellulose (HEC) with chitosan. Loading the films by silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles (Ag-NPs and ZnO) was achieved during the preparation of films under the optimum conditions. Characterizations of the prepared ZnO nanoparticles and the prepared nanocomposites films were investigated by FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TEM and EDAX. Chitosan nanocomposite films displayed good Antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhamrium, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria monocyte. Therefore, these films can be used for packaging applications.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal and in vitro antileukaemia activity of metal complexes  with thiosemicarbazones.
AB  - 1-phenyl-3-methyl-4-benzoyl-5-pyrazolone 4-ethyl-thiosemicarbazone (HL) and its copper(II), vanadium(V) and nickel(II) complexes: [Cu(L)(Cl)].C(2)H(5)OH.(1), [Cu(L)(2)].H(2)O (2), [Cu(L)(Br)].H(2)O.CH(3)OH (3), [Cu(L)(NO(3))].2C(2)H(5)OH (4), [VO(2)(L)].2H(2)O (5), [Ni(L)(2)].H(2)O (6), were synthesized and characterized. The ligand has been characterized by elemental analyses, IR, (1) H NMR and (13) C NMR spectroscopy. The tridentate nature of the ligand is evident from the IR spectra. The copper(II), vanadium(V) and nickel(II) complexes have been characterized by different physico-chemical techniques such as molar conductivity, magnetic susceptibility measurements and electronic, infrared and electron paramagnetic resonance spectral studies. The structures of the ligand and its copper(II) (2, 4), and vanadium(V) (5) complexes have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The composition of the coordination polyhedron of the central atom in 2, 4 and 5 is different. The tetrahedral coordination geometry of Cu was found in complex 2 while in complex 4, it is square planar, in complex 5 the coordination polyhedron of the central ion is distorted square pyramid. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the complexes against Escherichia coli, Salmonella abony, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and the antifungal activity against Candida albicans strains was higher for the metal complexes than for free ligand. The effect of the free ligand and its metal complexes on the proliferation of HL-60 cells was tested.
TI  - Improved in vitro assay for determining the mucin adherence of bacteria sensitive to Triton X-100 treatment.
AB  - Mucin-associated microbiota are in relatively close contact with the intestinal epithelium and may thus have a more pronounced effect on host health. We have previously developed a simple mucin agar assay to simulate initial mucus colonization by intestinal microbial communities. Adherence of microbiota was estimated using flow cytometry after detachment with Triton X-100. In this study, the effect of this detergent on the cultivability of both virulent and commensal strains was investigated. Mucin attachment of selected strains was evaluated using the mucin adhesion assay. Bacteria were dislodged from the mucin surface by incubation with Triton or from the whole mucin agar layer using a stomacher. Mechanical extraction resulted in 1.24 +/- 0.42, 2.69 +/- 0.44, and 1.56 +/- 0.85 log CFU/mL higher plate counts of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli strains, respectively, than the chemical method. The sensitivity of bacteria to Triton varied among microbial species and strains. Among others, Triton inhibited the growth of Salmonella enterica LMG 10396 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa LMG 8029 on laboratory media, although these bacteria maintained their viability during this treatment. Only Gram-positive strains, Enterococcus hirae LMG 6399 and L. rhamnosus GG, were not affected by this detergent. Therefore, the mechanical method is recommended for the extraction of mucin-adhered bacteria that are sensitive to Triton, especially when followed by traditional cultivation techniques. However, this approach can also be recommended for strains that are not affected by this detergent, because it resulted in higher recovery of adhered L. rhamnosus GG compared to the chemical extraction.
TI  - Polydiacetylene nanovesicles as carriers of natural phenylpropanoids for creating antimicrobial food-contact surfaces.
AB  - The ultimate goal of this study was developing antimicrobial food-contact materials based on natural phenolic compounds using nanotechnological approaches. Among the methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-encapsulated phenolics tested, curcumin showed by far the highest activity toward Escherichia coli with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.4 mM. Curcumin was enclosed in liposome-type polydiacetylene/phosholipid nanovesicles supplemented with N-hydroxysuccinimide and glucose. The fluorescence spectrum of the nanovesicles suggested that curcumin was located in their bilayer region. Free-suspended nanovesicles tended to bind to the bacterial surface and demonstrated bactericidal activity toward Gram-negative (E. coli) and vegetative cells of Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus) bacteria reducing their counts from 5 log CFU mL(-1) to an undetectable level within 8 h. The nanovesicles were covalently bound to silanized glass. Incubation of E. coli and B. cereus with nanovesicle-coated glass resulted in a 2.5 log reduction in their counts. After optimization this approach can be used for controlling microbial growth, cross-contamination, and biofilm formation on food-contacting surfaces.
TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in Seri Kembangan, Malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  - This study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around Seri Kembangan, a city in Malaysia. Pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of OTUs with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. Taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed across all samples. The highest appearance frequencies (100%) were OTUs closely related to Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas sp. and Pseudomonas putida. Several OTUs were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazaki, Cronobacter turisensis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Hafnia alvei, Kurthia gibsonii, Salmonella bongori, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella tyhpi, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. The condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. Regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.
TI  - Safety, efficacy and utility of methods of transferring adhesive and cohesive Escherichia coli cells to microplates to avoid aerosols.
AB  - The virtual colony count (VCC) microbiological assay has been utilized for over a decade to measure the antimicrobial activity of peptides such as defensins and LL-37 against biosafety level (BSL)-1 and BSL-2 bacteria including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterobacter aerogenes. In addition, a modified pipetting technique was presented in a 2011 study of defensin activity against the BSL-3 pathogen Bacillus anthracis. Both studies were published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. Here I report that the method can also detect cross-contamination caused by aerosols utilizing the VCC method of data analysis by quantitative growth kinetics (QGK). The QGK threshold time, or T t, equivalent to the cycle time C t reported in 1996 by Heid et al., precisely identifies when wells were inoculated.
TI  - Purification and identification of an antibacterial protein from the symbiotic bacteria associated with novel entomopathogenic nematode, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp.
AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) belonging to the families steinernematidae and heterorhabditidae and their symbiotic bacteria Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus are well-known as biological control agents and are found to produce a wide range of bioactive secondary metabolites. Studies carried out at the Central Tuber Crops Research Institute (CTCRI) on entomopathogenic nematodes resulted in the identification of novel EPN belonging to the family Rhabditidae. This study reports the purification of a high molecular weight antibacterial protein from culture filtrates of a bacterium (Bacillus cereus) symbiotically associated with a novel entomopathogenic nematode Rhabditis (Oscheius) species, maintained at CTCRI laboratory. Fermentation conditions were standardized and optimum antibacterial activity was observed in tryptic soy broth after 48 h incubation at 30 degrees C. The aqueous extracts yielded antibacterial proteins which were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. Native gel electrophoresis indicated an active protein of molecular mass 220KDa which resolved into a major band of 90 kDa and a minor band of about 40 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The 90 kDa protein showed antibacterial activity and was further analysed by MALDI TOF-MS/MS. The protein was identified as a TQXA (Threonine-glutamine dipeptide) domain containing protein from Bacillus cereus. The protein was found to be active against Bacillus subtilis MTCC2756, Staphylococus aureus MTCC902 and Escherichia coli MTCC 2622 and was thermally stable.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activities of seven Eucalyptus species essential oils leaves.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this paper, we have studied the essential oils chemical composition of the leaves of seven Eucalyptus species developed in Tunisia. Eucalyptus leaves were picked from trees growing in different arboretums in Tunisia. Choucha and Mrifeg arboretums located in Sedjnene, region of Bizerte (Choucha: E. maideni, E. astrengens et E. cinerea; Mrifeg : E. leucoxylon), Korbous arboretums located in the region of Nabeul, North East Tunisia with sub-humid bioclimate, (E. lehmani), Souiniet-Ain Drahem arboretum located in region of Jendouba (E. sideroxylon, E. bicostata). Essential oils were individually tested against a large panel of microorganisms including Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6539), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC29212), Listeria ivanovii (RBL 30), Bacillus cereus (ATCC11778). RESULTS: The yield of essential oils ranged from 1.2% to 3% (w/w) for the different Eucalyptus species. All essential oils contain alpha-pinene, 1,8-cineol and pinocarveol-trans for all Eucalyptus species studied. The 1,8-cineol was the major compound in all species (49.07 to 83.59%). Diameter of inhibition zone of essential oils of Eucalyptus species varied from 10 to 29 mm. The largest zone of inhibition was obtained for Bacillus cereus (E. astrengens) and the lowest for Staphylococcus aureus (E. cinerea). The essential oils from E. maideni, E. astrengens, E. cinerea (arboretum of Bizerte), E. bicostata (arboretum of Aindraham) showed the highest antibacterial activity against Listeria ivanovii and Bacillus cereus. CONCLUSION: The major constituents of Eucalyptus leaves essential oils are 1,8-cineol (49.07 to 83.59%) and alpha-pinene (1.27 to 26.35%). The essential oils from E. maideni, E. astrengens, E. cinerea, E. bicostata showed the highest antibacterial activity against Listeria ivanovii and Bacillus cereus, they may have potential applications in food and pharmaceutical products.
TI  - Evaluation of antioxidant, total phenol and flavonoid content and antimicrobial activities of Artocarpus altilis (breadfruit) of underutilized tropical fruit extracts.
AB  - Artocarpus altilis (breadfruit) pulp, peel and whole fruit were extracted with various solvents such as hexane, dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol. The antioxidant activity of these extracts were examined using the stable 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging test. IC50 was 55 +/- 5.89 mug/ml for the pulp part of methanol extract. In the beta-carotene bleaching assay, the antioxidant activity was 90.02 +/- 1.51 % for the positive control (Trolox) and 88.34 +/- 1.31 % for the pulp part of the fruit methanol extract. The total phenolic content of the crude extracts was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure; methanol pulp part demonstrated the highest phenol content value of 781 +/- 52.97 mg GAE/g of dry sample. While the total flavonoid content was determined using the aluminium chloride colorimetric assay, the highest value of 6213.33 +/- 142.22 mg QE/g was indicated by pulp part of the fruit methanol extract. The antimicrobial activity of the crude extracts was tested using disc diffusion method against pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Candida albicans. Methanol extract of pulp part was recorded to have the highest zone of inhibition against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and MBC/minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) for the extracts were also determined using the microdilution method ranging from 4000 to 63 mug/ml against pathogenic microbes. The MBC/MFC values varied from 250 to 4000 mug/ml. A correlation between antioxidant activity assays, antimicrobial activity and phenolic content was established. The results shows that the various parts of A. altilis fruit extracts promising antioxidant activities have potential bioactivities due to high content of phenolic compounds.
TI  - Microbial diversity of mangrove sediment in Shenzhen Bay and gene cloning, characterization of an isolated phytase-producing strain of SPC09 B. cereus.
AB  - Phytases hydrolyze phytate to release inorganic phosphate, which decreases the requirement for phosphorus in fertilizers for crops and thus reduces environmental pollutants. This study analyzed microbial communities in rhizosphere sediment, collected in September 2012 from Shenzhen Bay, Guangdong, China, using high-throughput pyrosequencing; the results showed that the dominant taxonomic phyla were Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, and the proportion of the beneficial bacteria, Bacillus, was 4.95 %. Twenty-nine culturable, phytase-producing bacteria were isolated, their phosphorus solubilization capacity was analyzed, and they were taxonomically characterized. Their phylogenetic placement was determined using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence analysis. The result shows that most of the isolates are members of the order Bacillales, although seven strains of Enterobacteriales, two strains of Pseudomonadales, and one strain of Oceanospirillales were also identified. The phytase gene was cloned from SPC09, Bacillus cereus, which showed the highest phosphorus solubilizing ability among the isolated strains. The gene encoded a primary translation product of 335 amino acids. A construct including the 1005-nt ORF fragment, Bc-phy, was transformed into Escherichia coli. The recombinant phytase was produced and purified, which revealed the temperature optima at 60 degrees C and pH optima at 6.5. The assessment by quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed an abundance of bacteria containing the Bc-phy gene; the level was generally higher in the mangrove forest than in the tidal flats and in surface soil compared to bottom soil, and the highest value was obtained in June. Herein, we report on the cloning, characterization, and activity of a novel phytase isolated from a mangrove system.
TI  - Phenolic acids profile, antioxidant and antibacterial activity of chamomile, common yarrow and immortelle (Asteraceae).
AB  - Chamomile, common yarrow and immortelle ethanolic extracts were chemically analysed with respect to phenolics. Twelve phenolic acids were separated and identified by HPLC-DAD and the presence of rosmarinic acid was additionally confirmed by LC-MS. Five methods were applied for the evaluation of extracts' antioxidant properties (FRAP, DPPH, ABTS, chelating activity, Briggs-Rauscher reaction), while the antibacterial activity was tested against some of the major food-borne pathogens (Campylobacter coli, Escherichia coli, Salmonella Infantis, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus). Immortelle extract was the richest in phenolics with a dominant flavonoid fraction, while the other two extracts contained higher amount of non-flavonoids. The phenolic acid profile also varied; high concentration of rosmarinic acid was found in chamomile and common yarrow, while caffeic acid was dominant in immortelle. The best antioxidant properties were obtained for chamomile extract, while good antimicrobial activity, especially against Gram-positive bacterial species, was detected for immortelle. The obtained results could be used as a tool for chemotaxonomic classification of the investigated plants or for their potential application as natural antioxidants/antimicrobials.
TI  - Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of bio-aerosols in surgery rooms and emergency department of an educational hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bio-aerosols are a potential hazard in hospitals and are mostly produced by hospital staff, patients and visitors. Bio-aerosols are solid or liquid particles pending in the air and they consist of aerosols accompanying micro-organisms or organic compounds of micro-organisms such as endotoxin, metabolite, toxin and other parts of organism. Those are a potential hazard in hospitals and are mostly produced by hospital staff, patients and visitors. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the types and amount of bacterial contamination in operating rooms and emergency department of an educational hospital in Zahedan, South-East of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 72 samples were collected from three operating rooms and three rooms in the emergency department of an educational hospital during 2012. On the first day of every month, a sample was taken from each room during the morning shift; active sampling was done on plates consisting of blood agar and brain-heart infusion agar (BHI) for 10 minutes in the axis of a one-story Anderson impactor (flow rate 28.1 litter per minutes) and SIBATA air pump SIP 32-L and samples were then placed in a 35 degrees C Incubator. Bacterial colonies were counted; warm coloring and differential tests were done and the data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS: Seventeen types of bacteria were detected including Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Viridians, Pneumococcus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Diphtheroid, Citrobacter and Enterobacter. Quantitative bacterial results showed that the number of observed bacteria in the emergency department with an average of 103.88 +/- 33.84 cfu/m(3) was more than that of the surgery rooms with an average of 63.32 +/- 32.94 cfu/m(3). Furthermore, the highest average number of all counted colonies (106 +/- 28.45 cfu/m(3)) was determined in autumn. In all samples, S. aureus and Micrococcus were the most detected bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested relatively relaxed limits of 100 cfu/m(3) for bacteria and 50 cfu/m(3) for fungi in the hospital air. Therefore, quantitative and qualitative outcomes of this study demonstrate that contamination level and bacterial variety in surgery rooms and emergency departments is high and effective measures must be taken to control the possible health risks.
TI  - Analysis of Bacillus cereus toxicity using PCR, ELISA and a lateral flow device.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of immunodetection methods and PCR analysis of enterotoxigenic Bacillus cereus strains. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-eight enterotoxigenic B. cereus group strains linked to food-borne outbreaks and illnesses were studied with 30 exclusivity nonenterotoxigenic strains including Bacillus amyoliquifaciens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella and Escherichia coli for this assessment. The PCR results showed 80% agreement with immunoassays for the Nhe target and 84% for the Hbl product. All exclusivity strains were PCR and serologically negative. CONCLUSIONS: PCR has proven to be a valuable tool when used in conjunction with immunoassays to quickly identify enterotoxigenic B. cereus group strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study assessed the utility of rapid methods to characterize enterotoxigenic profiles of B. cereus group strains. The identification of enterotoxigenic bacteria and any associated toxins detected from food products is essential in food defense programs as public health officials search for methods to rapidly and accurately screen a global food supply.
TI  - Introducing Urtica dioica, A Native Plant of Khuzestan, As an Antibacterial Medicinal Plant.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urtica dioica is a flowering plant with long history of use in folk medicine and as a food source. OBJECTIVES: This study examined in vitro antibacterial potential of alcoholic extracts of U. dioica. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hydroalcoholic extracts from aerial parts were prepared using aqueous solution of ethanol and methanol and their inhibitory effects against clinical isolates was examined by disc diffusion method at different doses. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) indexes were also investigated. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was also performed to find structural changes of affected bacteria consequent to exposing with extracts. RESULTS: Both extracts were active against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli with respectively 16, 10, 18, and 14 mm (methanolic) and 11, 9, 17, and 16 mm (ethanolic) inhibition zone. The MIC of ethanolic extract against S. epidermidis and E. coli was respectively 10 and 40 mg/mL. The MIC of methanolic extract against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was 40 and 10 mg/mL, respectively. The MBC was found only for S. epidermidis (20 mg/mL). In SEM analysis the round shape of S. epidermidis was changed and irregular shapes were appeared, which suggest that the main target of these extracts was cell wall. CONCLUSIONS: Extracts of U. dioica showed significant antibacterial effect against some clinically important pathogenic bacteria. Based on the obtained results it can be concluded that U. dioica is useful as antibacterial and bactericidal agent in treating infectious diseases.
TI  - Effects of climate change on the persistence and dispersal of foodborne bacterial pathogens in the outdoor environment: A review.
AB  - Abstract According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), warming of the climate system is unequivocal. Over the coming century, warming trends such as increased duration and frequency of heat waves and hot extremes are expected in some areas, as well as increased intensity of some storm systems. Climate-induced trends will impact the persistence and dispersal of foodborne pathogens in myriad ways, especially for environmentally ubiquitous and/or zoonotic microorganisms. Animal hosts of foodborne pathogens are also expected to be impacted by climate change through the introduction of increased physiological stress and, in some cases, altered geographic ranges and seasonality. This review article examines the effects of climatic factors, such as temperature, rainfall, drought and wind, on the environmental dispersal and persistence of bacterial foodborne pathogens, namely, Bacillus cereus, Brucella, Campylobacter, Clostridium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio and Yersinia enterocolitica. These relationships are then used to predict how future climatic changes will impact the activity of these microorganisms in the outdoor environment and associated food safety issues. The development of predictive models that quantify these complex relationships will also be discussed, as well as the potential impacts of climate change on transmission of foodborne disease from animal hosts.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of cauliflower, broccoli, and okara byproducts against foodborne bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial potential of cauliflower, broccoli, and okara byproducts was assessed against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria monocytogenes serovar 4b growth behavior was assessed under exposure to 5% vegetable byproducts added to the reference medium, buffered peptone water (0.1% [wt/vol]), at 37 degrees C. Although the byproducts were not effective against L. monocytogenes, they were bactericidal against Salmonella Typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7, and B. cereus. The most promising results were achieved with the cauliflower-Salmonella Typhimurium combination, because the bacterial population was reduced by 3.11 log10 cycles after 10 h of incubation at 37 degrees C as a result of 5% cauliflower addition. Further studies were carried out for this combination, at different cauliflower concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 15%) and at temperatures in the range of 5-37 degrees C. The greatest inactivation level (6.11 log10 cycles) was achieved at refrigeration temperature (5 degrees C) using 15% cauliflower addition. Both temperature and cauliflower concentration significantly (p</=0.05) influenced the Salmonella Typhimurium inactivation level. The kinetic parameters were adjusted to mathematical models. The modified Gompertz mathematical model provided an accurate fit (root-mean-square error (RMSE) [0.00009-0.21] and adjusted-R(2) [0.81-0.99]) to experimental Salmonella Typhimurium survival curves describing inactivation kinetics of the pathogen to the antimicrobial effect of cauliflower byproduct.
TI  - Microbiological and physicochemical analysis of yatei (Tetragonisca angustula) honey for assessing quality standards and commercialization.
AB  - Due to the interest in the production and trading of yatei (Tetragonisca angustula) honey in the province of Misiones, Argentina, in this work we assessed microbiological and physicochemical parameters in order to contribute to the elaboration of standards for quality control and promote commercialization. Results showed that yatei honey samples had significantly different microbiological and physicochemical characteristics in comparison to established quality standards for Apis mellifera honey. Thus, we observed that values for pH (3.72), glucose (19.01 g/100g) and fructose (23.74 g/100g) were lower than A. mellifera quality standards, while acidity (79.42 meq/kg), moisture (24%), and mould and yeast count (MY) (3.02 log CFU/g) were higher. The acid content was correlated with glucose (R2=0.75) and fructose (R2=0.68) content, and also with mould and yeast counts (R2=0.45) to a lesser extent. The incidence of microorganisms in yatei honey samples reached 42.85% and 39% for Clostridium sulfite-reducers and Bacillus spp., respectively. No C. botulinum or B. cereus cells were detected. Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. incidence was similar (ca. 7.14%), whereas Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. were not detected. We conclude that the microbiological and physicochemical properties of yatei honey are different from those of A. mellifera honey; hence, different quality standards could be implemented to promote its commercialization.
TI  - Antimicrobial and inhibition on heat-induced protein denaturation of constituents isolated from Polygonatumverticillatum rhizomes.
AB  - This study was designed to assess the susceptibility of various microorganisms and inhibition on heat-induced protein denaturation against diosgenin and santonin, isolated from Polygonatum verticillatum rhizomes. Both diosgenin and santonin showed significant zone of inhibition when studied against various Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi). In antifungal assay, only santonin exhibited profound sensitivity against various fungi (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma harzianum and Fusarium oxysporum) used in the test. Both diosgenin and santonin also exhibited marked attenuation on heat-induced protein denaturation in a concentration-dependent manner with EC50 values of 375 and 310 mug/mL, respectively. In conclusion, both the isolated compounds have antimicrobial potential supported by strong inhibition on protein denaturation and thus support the antimicrobial uses of plant in traditional system of treatment.
TI  - Chemical composition and biological activity of Pulicaria vulgaris essential oil  from Iran.
AB  - The present study investigated the chemical composition of the essential oil (EO) from aerial parts (flowering stage) of Pulicaria vulgaris Gaertn. by GC-MS. Also, the antimicrobial activity of the EO against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungi (Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans) was tested. In total, 23 compounds were recognized, accounting for 98.08% of the EO. The main compounds in the EO were thymol (50.22%), p-menth-6-en-2-one (carvotanacetone, 20.2%), thymol isobutyrate (16.88%), menthan-2-one (4.31%), 1-methyl-1,2-propanedione (4.13%), 2,5-dimethoxy-p-cymene (4.01%), myrtenol (1.22%), linalool (1.1%), and beta-myrcene (1.9%). Results of antibacterial test of P. vulgaris essential oil showed that all assayed concentrations significantly inhibited the growth of B. cereus, S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at P < 0.05. MIC for B. cereus, S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa was 17.5, 25.2, 19.4 and 33.2 mug/mL respectively; antifungal screening of the essential oil of P. vulgaris showed that the oil significantly inhibited the growth of A. niger and C. albicans (MIC = 15.5 and 9.9 mug/mL, respectively). Results of cytotoxicity assay showed that the essential oil exhibited a significant cytotoxic activity against both cell lines. In case of MCF-7 and Hep-G2 cell lines, IC50 of the essential oil were 5.36 and 7.16 mug/ml, respectively. The potent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of the EO may be attributed to its high contents of thymol, carvotanacetone and thymol isobutyrate. Antimicrobial and antitumor chemotherapies are showing diminishing effectiveness because of emergence of drug-resistance. Hence, using efficient natural chemotherapeutic agents such as Pulicaria vulgaris essential oil with fewer side effects is an encouraging approach to fight cancer and infectious diseases in medicine, agriculture, food science and related fields.
TI  - Characteristics and phylogeny of Bacillus cereus strains isolated from Maari, a traditional West African food condiment.
AB  - Maari is a spontaneously fermented food condiment made from baobab tree seeds in  West African countries. This type of product is considered to be safe, being consumed by millions of people on a daily basis. However, due to the spontaneous nature of the fermentation the human pathogen Bacillus cereus occasionally occurs in Maari. This study characterizes succession patterns and pathogenic potential of B. cereus isolated from the raw materials (ash, water from a drilled well (DW) and potash), seed mash throughout fermentation (0-96h), after steam cooking and sun drying (final product) from two production sites of Maari. Aerobic mesophilic bacterial (AMB) counts in raw materials were of 10(5)cfu/ml in DW, and ranged between 6.5x10(3) and 1.2x10(4)cfu/g in potash, 10(9)-10(10)cfu/g in seed mash during fermentation and 10(7) - 10(9) after sun drying. Fifty three out of total 290 AMB isolates were identified as B. cereus sensu lato by use of ITS-PCR and grouped into 3 groups using PCR fingerprinting based on Escherichia coli phage-M13 primer (M13-PCR). As determined by panC gene sequencing, the isolates of B. cereus belonged to PanC types III and IV with potential for high cytotoxicity. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences of glpF, gmk, ilvD, pta, pur, pycA and tpi revealed that the M13-PCR group 1 isolates were related to B. cereus biovar anthracis CI, while the M13-PCR group 2 isolates were identical to cereulide (emetic toxin) producing B. cereus strains. The M13-PCR group 1 isolates harboured poly-gamma-D-glutamic acid capsule biosynthesis genes capA, capB and capC showing 99-100% identity with the environmental B. cereus isolate 03BB108. Presence of cesB of the cereulide synthetase gene cluster was confirmed by PCR in M13-PCR group 2 isolates. The B. cereus harbouring the cap genes were found in potash, DW, cooking water and at 8h fermentation. The "emetic" type B. cereus were present in DW, the seed mash at 48-72h of fermentation and in the final product, while the remaining isolates (PanC type IV) were detected in ash, at 48-72h fermentation and in the final product. This work sheds light on the succession and pathogenic potential of B. cereus species in traditional West African food condiment and clarifies their phylogenetic relatedness to B. cereus biovar anthracis. Future implementation of GMP and HACCP and development of starter cultures for controlled Maari fermentations will help to ensure a safe product.
TI  - [Purification of recombinant Bacillus cereus ResD-ResE proteins expressed in Escherichia coli strains].
AB  - Recombinant E. coli strains expressing the Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579T resD and resEgenes fused with the ubiquitin gene were constructed, and purification of the ResD and ResE proteins was performed. The approach used in the study allowed us to increase the protein yield of the electrophoretic homogeneous ResD andResE proteins without denaturation steps up to 150 mg per gram of wet cell weight.
TI  - The Cyclic Antibacterial Peptide Enterocin AS-48: Isolation, Mode of Action, and  Possible Food Applications.
AB  - Enterocin AS-48 is a circular bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus. It contains a 70 amino acid-residue chain circularized by a head-to-tail peptide bond. The conformation of enterocin AS-48 is arranged into five alpha-helices with a compact globular structure. Enterocin AS-48 has a wide inhibitory spectrum on Gram-positive bacteria. Sensitivity of Gram-negative bacteria increases in combination with outer-membrane permeabilizing treatments. Eukaryotic cells are bacteriocin-resistant. This cationic peptide inserts into bacterial membranes and causes membrane permeabilization, leading ultimately to cell death. Microarray analysis revealed sets of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in Bacillus cereus cells treated with sublethal bacteriocin concentration. Enterocin AS-48 can be purified in two steps or prepared as lyophilized powder from cultures in whey-based substrates. The potential applications of enterocin AS-48 as a food biopreservative have been corroborated against foodborne pathogens and/or toxigenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica) and spoilage bacteria (Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Bacillus spp., Paenibacillus spp., Geobacillus stearothermophilus, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Staphylococcus carnosus, Lactobacillus sakei and other spoilage lactic acid bacteria). The efficacy of enterocin AS-48 in food systems increases greatly in combination with chemical preservatives, essential oils, phenolic compounds, and physico-chemical treatments such as sublethal heat, high-intensity pulsed-electric fields or high hydrostatic pressure.
TI  - A halotolerant thermostable lipase from the marine bacterium Oceanobacillus sp. PUMB02 with an ability to disrupt bacterial biofilms.
AB  - A halotolerant thermostable lipase was purified and characterized from the marine bacterium Oceanobacillus sp. PUMB02. This lipase displayed a high degree of stability over a wide range of conditions including pH, salinity, and temperature. It was optimally active at 30 degrees C and pH 8.0 respectively and was stable at higher temperatures (50-70 degrees C) and alkaline pH. The molecular mass of the lipase was approximately 31 kDa based on SDS-PAGE and MALDI-ToF fingerprint analysis. Conditions for enhanced production of lipase by Oceanobacillus sp. PUMB02 were attained in response surface method-guided optimization with factors such as olive oil, sucrose, potassium chromate, and NaCl being evaluated, resulting in levels of 58.84 U/ml being achieved. The biofilm disruption potential of the PUMB02 lipase was evaluated and compared with a marine sponge metagenome derived halotolerant lipase Lpc53E1. Good biofilm disruption activity was observed with both lipases against potential food pathogens such as Bacillus cereus MTCC1272, Listeria sp. MTCC1143, Serratia sp. MTCC4822, Escherichia coli MTCC443, Pseudomonas fluorescens MTCC1748, and Vibrio parahemolyticus MTCC459. Phase contrast microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy showed very effective disruption of pathogenic biofilms. This study reveals that marine derived hydrolytic enzymes such as lipases may have potential utility in inhibiting biofilm formation in a food processing environment and is the first report of the potential application of lipases from the genus Oceanobacillus in biofilm disruption strategies.
TI  - Effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  - Antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. White mustard essential oil (WMEO) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. The objective of this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of WMEO against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. The bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. All microorganisms were inhibited by WMEO at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). In general, WMEO was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. Salmonella Enteritidis and S. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. The effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. Soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of WMEO against L. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against Salmonella Enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h. Sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of WMEO against Salmonella Enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against L. monocytogenes. The presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of WMEO against L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis. Thus, WMEO is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant heterotrophic plate count bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria in aquifers of the Mooi River, North West province, South Africa.
AB  - Groundwater in the Mooi River catchment is prone to mining, agricultural, municipal and septic tank pollution. In this study physico-chemical and microbiological parameters were determined using appropriate methods. Bacterial isolates were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing (heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria (ARB)) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Escherichia coli). Antibiotic resistance tests were also performed. Physico-chemical parameters were generally within target water quality ranges for drinking water. HPC bacteria ranged between 10(5) and 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. E. coli were enumerated from Trimpark, School and Cemetery. The Blaauwbank borehole was negative for faecal streptococci. Pseudomonas spp. were most abundant in the bulk water. Opportunistic pathogens isolated included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Alcaligenes, Flavobacterium, Bacillus cereus and Mycobacterium spp. Varying patterns of antibiotic resistance were observed. Most HPC bacterial isolates were resistant to cephalothin and/or amoxicillin and a few were resistant to erythromycin and streptomycin. Pseudomonas spp. was also the most abundant ARB. Other ARBs included Alcaligenes faecalis, Ochrobactrum sp. and Achromobacter sp. ARBs were resistant to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, and/or amoxicillin compared to HPCs. The presence of E. coli and ARB in these groundwater sources indicates potential human health risks. These risks should be further investigated and quantified, and groundwater should be treated before use.
TI  - Antibacterial and cytotoxic potential of silver nanoparticles synthesized using latex of Calotropis gigantea L.
AB  - The present study aimed to synthesis silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in a greener route using aqueous latex extract of Calotropis gigantea L. toward biomedical applications. Initially, synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed through UV-Vis spectroscopy which shows the surface plasmonic resonance peak (SPR) at 420 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis provides clear evidence that protein fractions present in the latex extract act as reducing and stabilizing bio agents. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy confirms the presence of silver as a major constituent element. X-ray diffractograms displays that the synthesized AgNPs were biphasic crystalline nature. Electron microscopic studies such as Field emission scanning electron microscopic (Fe-SEM) and Transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveals that synthesized AgNPs are spherical in shape with the size range between 5 and 30 nm. Further, crude latex aqueous extract and synthesized AgNPs were evaluated against different bacterial pathogens such as Bacillus cereus, Enterococci sp, Shigella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Compared to the crude latex aqueous extract, biosynthesized AgNPs exhibits a remarkable antimicrobial activity. Likewise in vitro anticancer study manifests the cytotoxicity value of synthesized AgNPs against tested HeLa cells. The output of this study clearly suggesting that biosynthesized AgNPs using latex of C. gigantea can be used as promising nanomaterial for therapeutic application in context with nanodrug formulation.
TI  - Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of Pleurostylia capensis Turcz (Loes) (celastraceae).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pleurostylia capensis is a large tree that can reach the maximum height of 20 m long, and it have been traditionally used as cosmetic, for steam bath, ritual body wash, and as a purgative to treat symptoms of witchcraft. Using ethanol, chloroform, dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EA), and water extracts, leaves, bark and roots of Pleurostylia capensis were investigated scientifically for their effectiveness in antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities using standard methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extracts were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis), Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella oxytoca, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium), and Candida albicans. The antioxidant activity was investigated using 2, 2-diphenlyl-1-picrylhadrazyl (DPPH), free radical scavenging assay. The anti-inflammatory activity of P. capensis extracts was evaluated against both cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX 1 and 2). RESULTS: The ethyl acetate extracts of P. capensis showed a strong antimicrobial activity against B. cereus, K. pneumonia, S. pyogenes, and M. smegmatis with MIC value of 0.39 and 0.78 mg/ml. While the ethanol bark extract was most active against M. smegmatis with MIC value of 0.78 mg/ml; the least potent activity was observed with dichloromethane, chloroform and water extracts, with an MIC value ranging from 1.56 mg/ml to 50.0 mg/ml. The plant extracts proved to be good antioxidant agent, whereas extracts of ethanol were the most active, with IC50 ranging from 1.00 to 1.74 microg/ml, which is lower, and in close range to Vitamin C (1.40 microg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Its moderation to potent inhibitory activity was observed in all extracts. Ethanol and dichloromethane extracts were among the most potent when compared to water and petroleum ether extracts. The water extracts showed to be nontoxic on the Hek cell line with an IC50 value of 204.0, and 207.3 microg/ml (roots and bark) respectively. The dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, chloroform and ethanol extracts showed to be toxic on the Hek cell, with IC50 range from 5.94 to 42.91microg/ml. The results obtained indicate the effectiveness of these plants.
TI  - [Purification of recombinant Bacillus cereus ResD-ResE proteins expressed in Escherichia coli strains].
AB  - Recombinant E. coli strains expressing the Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579T resD and resEgenes fused with the ubiquitin gene were constructed, and purification of the ResD and ResE proteins was performed. The approach used in the study allowed us to increase the protein yield of the electrophoretic homogeneous ResD andResE proteins without denaturation steps up to 150 mg per gram of wet cell weight.
TI  - Pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of Linum usitatissimum (Flaxseed) in  infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Linum usitatissimum, commonly known as Flaxseed has traditionally been used for the management of diarrhea and gastrointestinal infections. This study was planned to assess pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of Flaxseed in infectious and non-infectious diarrhea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The crude aqueous-methanolic extract of Flaxseed was studied using the in vivo castor oil-induced diarrhea, gut motility and enteropooling assays. Mechanistic basis was further elucidated by testing the inhibitory effect on spontaneously contracting isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, suspended in a 10ml tissue bath containing Tyrode solution, maintained at 37 degrees C and aerated with carbogen. Antibacterial efficacy of the Flaxseed extract was tested against different enteric and non-enteric pathogenic bacteria using in vitro antibacterial assays. RESULTS: Flaxseed extract reduced the diarrheal score in mice, by 39%, 63.90% and 68.34% at the respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. Intestinal secretions were reduced by 24.12%, 28.09% and 38.80%, whereas the intestinal motility was reduced by 31.66%, 46.98% and 56.20% at respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. When tested on isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, Flaxseed extract produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both spontaneous and high K(+) (80mM)-induced contractions, and shifted the concentration-response curves of Ca(++) to the right with suppression of the maximum response, similar to that caused by verapamil. Flaxseed extract was found to possess bactericidal activity at the tested concentrations of 12.5mg/ml, against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (100%), Escherichia coli K1 (88.88%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (98.76%), Bacillus cereus (92.64%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (76.83%) and Salmonella typhi (26.91+/-3.35%). The concentration of 10mg/ml showed bactericidal effects against all the aforementioned pathogens except Escherichia coli K1, whereas for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi, it was bacteriostatic at this concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Linum usitatissimum (Flaxseed) extract exhibits antidiarrheal and antispasmodic activities by virtue of its antimotility and antisecretory effects which are mediated possibly through inhibition of Ca(++) channels, though additional mechanism(s) cannot be ruled out. Flaxseed extract proved effective against both enteric and non-enteric pathogens causing diarrhea, thus ensuring wide coverage and rationalizing its medicinal use in both the infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.
TI  - Production and purification of anti-bacterial biometabolite from wild-type Lactobacillus, isolated from fermented bamboo shoot: future suggestions and a proposed system for secondary metabolite onsite recovery during continuous fermentation.
AB  - Wild-type lactobacillus isolated form Khorisa, a fermented bamboo shoot product of Assam, India were evaluated for production anti-bacterial secondary biometabolites, against Staphylococcus aureus. Submerged fermentation technique was used for the production of secondary anti-microbial biometabolite by a single wild-type lactobacillus strain, which tested positive for the release of anti-bacterial factor(s). Crude cell-free supernatant was obtained, followed by extraction in water-immiscible solvents viz., chloroform, hexane, petroleum ether. Chloroform extract of cell-free crude supernatant showed maximum yield (0.054 g/ml) and inhibited all indicator bacterial strains viz., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus. Yields of hexane and petroleum ether extract were 0.052 and 0.026 g/ml, respectively. Minimum lethal dose concentration assay of the chloroform extract showed LDmin values at 27, 1.68, and 1.68 mg/ml for E. coli, S. aureus, and B. cereus, respectively. Kill time for all the indicator bacterial strains were less than 12 h. The efficacy of the anti-bacterial substance seemed to depend on the presence of organic acids, particularly lactic acid. Conceptual-based suggestion for the development of an onsite secondary metabolites recovery system during continuous fermentation has also been attempted.
TI  - In vitro antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-proliferative activities of purple potato extracts (Solanum tuberosum cv Vitelotte noire) following simulated gastro-intestinal digestion.
AB  - Analyses of antioxidant and in vitro antimicrobial and anti-proliferative activities of anthocyanin-rich extracts from purple potatoes, Solanum tuberosum L. cv Vitelotte noire (Solanaceae), were performed by simulating both a domestic cooking process and human digestion. Extracts of crude and cooked purple potato did not exhibit antimicrobial activity against the tester strains: Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The behaviour changed after the simulated gastrointestinal transit, when an inhibition halo was observed against all tester strains used, ranging from 0.53 cm against B. cereus to 0.82 cm against E. coli. In addition antioxidant activity exhibited, before and after the simulated gastrointestinal digestion (5.96 mg/mL +/- 0.92; 28 mg/mL +/- 0 .13, respectively) and the persistence of anti-proliferative activity against the colon cancer cells Caco-2, SW48 and MCF7, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, after the simulated digestion, (EC50 = 0.21; 1.13 mug/mL), suggest that vitelotte consumption might bring tangible benefits for human health.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial and anthelmintic activities with total phenolic contents of Piper betel leaves.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to investigate the antibacterial and anthelmintic activities and to determine total phenolic contents of methanolic extract of Piper betel leaves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extract was subjected to assay for antibacterial activity using both gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains through disc diffusion method; anthelmintic activity with the determination of paralysis and death time using earthworm (Pheritima posthuma) at five different concentrations and the determination of total phenolic contents using the Folin-ciocalteau method. RESULTS: The extract showed significant (p<0.01) zone of inhibitions against gram positive Staphylococcus aureus [(6.77+/-0.25) mm] and Gram negative Escherichia coli [(8.53+/-0.25) mm], Salmonella typhi [(5.20+/-0.26) mm], Shigella dysenteriae [(11.20+/-0.26) mm] compared to positive control Azithromycin (ranging from 20.10+/-0.17 to 25.20+/-0.35 mm) while no zone inhibitory activity was found for both the extract and the standard drug against Gram positive Bacillus cereus. The extract also showed potent anthelmintic activity requiring less time for paralysis and death compared to the standard drug albendazole (10 mg/ml). At concentrations 10, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg/ml, leaves extract showed paralysis at mean time of 9.83+/-0.60, 8.50+/-0.29, 6.60+/-0.17, 6.20+/-0.44 and 4.16+/-0.60; death at 11.33+/-0.88, 9.67+/-0.33, 7.83+/-0.17, 7.16+/-0.60 and 5.16+/-0.72 minutes, respectively. Whereas the standard drug showed paralysis and death at 19.33+/-0.71 and 51.00+/-0.23 minutes respectively. The extract confirmed the higher concentration of phenolic contents (124.42+/-0.14 mg of GAE /g of extract) when screened for total phenolic compounds. CONCLUSION: As results confirmed potential antibacterial and anthelmintic activities of Piper betel leaves extract, therefore it may be processed for further drug research.
TI  - The biosynthesis of UDP-d-FucNAc-4N-(2)-oxoglutarate (UDP-Yelosamine) in Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579: Pat and Pyl, an aminotransferase and an ATP-dependent Grasp protein that ligates 2-oxoglutarate to UDP-4-amino-sugars.
AB  - Surface glycan switching is often observed when micro-organisms transition between different biotic and abiotic niches, including biofilms, although the advantages of this switching to the organism are not well understood. Bacillus cereus grown in a biofilm-inducing medium has been shown to synthesize an unusual cell wall polysaccharide composed of the repeating subunit -->6)Gal(alpha1-2)(2-R-hydroxyglutar-5-ylamido)Fuc2NAc4N(alpha1-6)GlcNAc(beta1--> , where galactose is linked to the hydroxyglutarate moiety of FucNAc-4-amido-(2)-hydroxyglutarate. The molecular mechanism involved in attaching 2-hydroxyglutarate to 4-amino-FucNAc has not been determined. Here, we show two genes in B. cereus ATCC 14579 encoding enzymes involved in the synthesis of UDP-FucNAc-4-amido-(2)-oxoglutarate (UDP-Yelosamine), a modified UDP-sugar not previously reported to exist. Using mass spectrometry and real time NMR spectroscopy, we show that Bc5273 encodes a C4''-aminotransferase (herein referred to as Pat) that, in the presence of pyridoxal phosphate, transfers the primary amino group of l-Glu to C-4'' of UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-GlcNAc to form UDP-4-amino-FucNAc and 2-oxoglutarate. Pat also converts 4-keto-xylose, 4-keto-glucose, and 4-keto-2-acetamido-altrose to their corresponding UDP-4-amino-sugars. Bc5272 encodes a carboxylate-amine ligase (herein referred as Pyl) that, in the presence of ATP and Mg(II), adds 2-oxoglutarate to the 4-amino moiety of UDP-4-amino-FucNAc to form UDP-Yelosamine and ADP. Pyl is also able to ligate 2-oxoglutarate to other 4-amino-sugar derivatives to form UDP-Yelose, UDP-Solosamine, and UDP-Aravonose. Characterizing the metabolic pathways involved in the formation of modified nucleotide sugars provides a basis for understanding some of the mechanisms used by bacteria to modify or alter their cell surface polysaccharides in response to changing growth and environmental challenges.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity of biodegradable films prepared from Schiff bases of zein.
AB  - Pure zein is known to be very hydrophobic, but is still inappropriate for coating and film applications because of their brittle nature. In an attempt to improve the flexibility and the antimicrobial activity of these coatings and films, Chemical modification of zein through forming Schiff bases with different phenolic aldhydes was tried. Influence of this modifications on mechanical, topographical, wetting properties and antimicrobial activity of zein films were evaluated. The chemical structure of the Schiff bases films were characterized by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The results indicate an improvement in mechanical properties with chemically modification of zein to form Schiff bases leading to a reduction in the elastic modulus. An increase in the elongation at break has been observed, but with slight influence on tensile strength. Plasticized zein films have similar initial contact angle ( approximately 40 degrees ). An increase in reaction temperature and time increases film's affinity towards water. As shown by contact angle measurements, a noticeable relation was found between film composition and the hydrophilicity. Surface topography also varied by forming Schiff bases, becoming rougher than zein-based films. The antibacterial activities of zein and Schiff bases of zein-based films were investigated against gram-positive bacteria (Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Clostridium sporogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella enterica). It was found that the antibacterial activity of the Schiff bases-based films was more effective than that of zein-based films.
TI  - Immunomodulatory effect of non-viable components of probiotic culture stimulated  with heat-inactivated Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus on holoxenic mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Competition of probiotic bacteria with other species from the intestinal microbiota involves different mechanisms that occur regardless of probiotics' viability. The objective of this paper was to assess the cytokine serum levels in holoxenic mice after oral administration of non-viable components (NVC) of Enterococcus faecium probiotic culture stimulated with heat-inactivated Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus in comparison to NVC of unstimulated E. faecium probiotic culture. METHODS: Probiotic E. faecium CMGb 16 culture, grown in the presence of heat-inactivated cultures of E. coli and B. cereus CMGB 102, was subsequently separated into supernatant (SN) and heat-inactivated cellular sediment (CS) fractions by centrifugation. Each NVC was orally administered to holoxenic mice (balb C mouse strain), in three doses, given at 24 hours. Blood samples were collected from the retinal artery, at 7, 14, and 21 days after the first administration of the NVC. The serum concentrations of IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) interleukins were assessed by ELISA method. RESULTS: After the oral administration of SN component obtained from the probiotic culture stimulated with heat-inactivated cultures of B. cereus CMGB 102 and E. coli O28, the serum concentrations of IL-12 were maintained higher in the samples collected at 7 and 14 days post-administration. No specific TNF-alpha profile could be established, depending on stimulated or non-stimulated probiotic culture, NVC fraction, or harvesting time. CONCLUSION: The obtained results demonstrate that non-viable fractions of probiotic bacteria, stimulated by other bacterial species, could induce immunostimulatory effects mediated by cytokines and act, therefore, as immunological adjuvants.
TI  - An in vitro antibacterial and antifungal effects of cadmium(II) complexes of hexamethyltetraazacyclotetradecadiene and isomers of its saturated analogue.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial and antifungal effects of cadmium(II) complexes with hexamethyltetraazacyclotetradecadiene ligands. METHODS: Five coordinated square pyramidal cadmium(II) complexes and six coordinated square octahedral cadmium(II) complexes have been synthesized by interaction of 5,7,7,12,14,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-4,11-diene (denoted by L.2HClO4) and C-chiral isomers of its saturated analogue (denoted by 'teta' and 'tetb') with different salts of Cd(2+) ion [e.g. CdI2, Cd(NO3)2.6H2O, CdCl2.2H2O and Cd(ClO4)2.6H2O] in methanolic solution. Complexes of the ligands were investigated for antibacterial activity by disc diffusion method and antifungal effect by poisoned food technique. RESULTS: The newly synthesized cadmium(II) complexes of the ligands were screened as potential antimicrobial agent against a number of medically important bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae and Escherichia coli) and against two fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus aculeatus). The growth inhibiting activity of the ligands and complexes against bacteria and fungi were compared with the standard antibiotic ampicillin and commercially important antifungal agent, griseofulvin respectively. Among them some of the macrocyclic complexes were found to be more fungitoxic and antibacterial than the reference antifungal drug griseofulvin and antibacterial drug ampicillin respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hexamethyltetraazacyclotetradecadiene ligands and its complexes could be considered as very potential antibacterial and antifungal agent with further investigation.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of Athrixia phylicoides DC. (bush tea), Monsonia burkeana (special tea) and synergistic effects of both combined herbal teas.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the chemical compositions and evaluate the antimicrobial  activity of bush tea (Athrixia phylicoides DC.), special tea (Monsonia burkeana) and synergy (combination of bush tea and special tea). METHODS: Total polyphenols were determined using the methods reported by Singleton and Rossi (1965) and modified by Waterman and Mole (1994). Tannins were determined using vanillin HCL methods described by Prince et al. (1978). Total antioxidants were determined using the methods described by Awika et al. (2004). The micro dilution technique using 96-well micro-plates, as described by Eloff (1998) was used to obtain the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) and minimum microbicidal concentration (MMC) values of the ethanol extracts against the microorganisms under study. The microbes strain used was Gram negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumonia; Gram positive bacteria such as Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and a fungus Candida albicans. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that special tea contains significantly higher content of total polyphenols (8.34 mg/100 g) and total antioxidant (0.83 mg/100 g) as compared to bush tea [total polyphenols (6.41 mg/100g) and total antioxidant (0.63 mg/100g)] and combination of bush tea and special tea [total polyphenols (6.42 mg/100 g) and total antioxidant (0.64 mg/100 g)]. There was no significant difference in tannins between bush tea, special tea and synergy. The results of antimicrobial activity (MIC and MMC) demonstrated that the ethanol extracts of bush tea, special tea and synergy possessed antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms at different zones. The MIC of bush tea ranged from 1.56 to 12.50 mg/mL while the MMC ranged from 0.78 to 12.50 mg/mL. Special tea's MIC ranged from 0.39 to 12.50 mg/mL while the MMC ranged from 0.01 to 12.50 mg/mL. The MIC of synergy ranged from 3.13 to 12.50 mg/mL while the MMC ranged from 3.13 to 12.50 mg/mL without positive synergistic effect recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Both bush and special tea contain total polyphenols, total antioxidants and tannins with special tea containing a significantly higher total polyphenols and total antioxidant as compared to bush tea and synergy. Bush tea, special tea and synergy possess antimicrobial activity at various degrees.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Polish herbhoneys.
AB  - The present study focuses on samples of Polish herbhoneys (HHs), their chemical composition and antimicrobial activity. A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method was used to analyse eight samples of herbal honeys and three samples of nectar honeys. Their antimicrobial activities were tested on selected Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus schleiferi) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria, as well as on pathogenic fungi Candida albicans. Ether extracts of HHs showed significant differences in composition but the principal groups found in the extracts were phenolics and aliphatic hydroxy acids typical of royal jelly and unsaturated dicarboxylic acids. In spite of the differences in chemical composition, antimicrobial activity of the extracts of HHs against all the tested microorganisms except E. coli was observed.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a mucin specific mycelial lectin from Aspergillus gorakhpurensis: application for mitogenic and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lectins are carbohydrate binding proteins or glycoproteins that bind  reversibly to specific carbohydrates present on the apposing cells, which are responsible for their ability to agglutinate red blood cells, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, etc. Interest in lectins has been intensified due to their carbohydrate specificity as they can be valuable reagents for the investigation of cell surface sugars, purification and characterization of glycoproteins. The present study reports the purification, characterization and evaluation of mitogenic and antimicrobial potential of a mycelial lectin from Aspergillus gorakhpurensis. METHODS: Affinity chromatography on mucin-sepharose column was carried out for purification of Aspergillus gorakhpurensis lectin. The lectin was characterized for physico-chemical parameters. Mitogenic potential of the lectin was evaluated against splenocytes of Swiss albino mice by MTT assay. Antimicrobial activity of the purified lectin has also been evaluated by disc diffusion assay. RESULTS: Single-step affinity purification resulted in 18.6-fold purification of the mycelial lectin. The molecular mass of the lectin was found to be 70 kDa and it was composed of two subunits of 34.8 kDa as determined by gel filtration chromatography, SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analysis. pH optima of the lectin was found to be 6.5-9.5, while optimum temperature for lectin activity was 20-30 degrees C. Lectin was stable within a pH range of 7.0-10.5 and showed fair thermostability. EDTA did not affect lectin activity whereas it was found susceptible to the denaturants tested. MTT assay revealed strong mitogenic potential of A. gorakhpurensis lectin at a concentration upto 150 microg/mL. Antimicrobial activity assay showed its potent antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcous aureus and Escherichia coli and marginal antifungal activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the mitogenic and antimicrobial potential of Aspergillus gorakhpurensis lectin. The results will provide useful guidelines for further research in clinical applications of this lectin.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial activities of exopolysaccharides from Bifidobacterium bifidum WBIN03 and Lactobacillus plantarum R315.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the antioxidant and antibacterial  activities of exopolysaccharide (EPS) from Bifidobacterium bifidum WBIN03 (B-EPS) and Lactobacillus plantarum R315 (L-EPS). The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-radical scavenging, hydroxyl radical-scavenging, and superoxide radical-scavenging abilities were measured to evaluate antioxidant activity. Inhibition of erythrocyte hemolysis and lipid peroxidation was also measured. Both B-EPS and L-EPS had strong scavenging ability against DPPH and superoxide radicals at high concentration. The inhibitory effect of B-EPS on erythrocyte hemolysis was stronger than that of L-EPS in a concentration range from 0.30 to 1.00 mg/mL, whereas the hydroxyl scavenging ability of L-EPS (39.15 +/- 0.58%) was significantly higher than that of 0.15 mg/mL ascorbic acid (24.33 +/- 1.17%) and B-EPS (17.89 +/- 3.30%) at 0.10 mg/mL. The inhibition of lipid peroxidation of 0.50 mg/mL B-EPS and L-EPS was 13.48 +/- 1.74% and 12.43 +/- 0.51%, respectively, values lower than that of ascorbic acid at the same concentration (23.20 +/- 1.41%). Furthermore, all these abilities were enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner. Agar diffusion assay showed that both EPS exhibited antibacterial activities against tested pathogens such as Cronobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphyloccocus aureus, Candida albicans, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhimurium, and Shigella sonnei at 300 mug/mL. In conclusion, both EPS have antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and could have applications in the food industry.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from Australian dairy farm environments.
AB  - The ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. In dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. This survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3 caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in Victoria, Australia. A total of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. The prevalence of the Bacillus cereus group, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cronobacter, Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli, Listeria, Salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), and Yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. The 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the B. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by Cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. The highest occurrence of any pathogen was the B. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. Fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. Salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. Out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. All of the CPS were Staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. Pathogenic Listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 L. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 L. monocytogenes-positive water sample. Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a single raw milk sample. Cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms, predominantly in feed samples. No Y. enterocolitica was detected. Results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. Monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as Cl. perfringens and B. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.
TI  - Terpenoids, flavonoids and caffeic acid derivatives from Salvia viridis L. cvar.  Blue Jeans.
AB  - Three diterpenoids, 1-oxomicrostegiol (1), viroxocin (2), viridoquinone (3), were isolated from the roots of Salvia viridis L. cvar. Blue Jeans. Five known diterpenoids, microstegiol (4), 7alpha-acetoxy-14-hydroxy-8,13-abietadiene-11,12-dione (5; 7-O-acetylhorminone tautomer), 7alpha,14-dihydroxy-8,13-abietadiene-11,12-dione (6; horminone tautomer), ferruginol and salvinolonyl 12-methyl ether (7) were also found in the roots together with 1-docosyl ferulate (8), and a mixture of 2-(4'-alkoxyphenyl) ethyl alkanoates (9). Two lupane triterpenoids, 2alpha-acetoxy-lup-20(29)-en-3beta-ol (10), and 3beta-acetoxy-lup-20(29)-en-2alpha-ol (11) were found in the aerial parts together with known compounds, lup-20(29)-ene-2alpha,3beta-diol (12), ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, beta-sitosterol and beta-sitosterol glucoside. A known phenylpropanoid, trans-verbascoside (or acteoside; 13), was the main constituent in the polar fraction of the aerial part, and it is now reported in the genus Salvia for the first time. Other polyphenolic compounds were cis-verbascoside (14), leucosceptoside A (15), martynoside (16), caffeic acid, 6-O-caffeoyl-glucose (18), rosmarinic acid, salidroside, luteolin-7-O-alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-galactopyranoside, luteolin-7-O-beta-galactopyranoside, luteolin-7-O-alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-glucopyranoside, luteolin-7-O-beta-glucopyranoside, and apigenin-7-O-beta-glucopyranoside. The structures were determined by 1D-, 2D-NMR and HR-ESI-MS techniques. Compounds 6, 10, ferruginol, ursolic acid and oleanolic acid exhibited antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 775) with MIC 50 muM, 25 muM, 50 muM, 12.5 muM, 12.5 muM respectively. Ferruginol, ursolic acid and oleanolic acid were also active against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6571), and Bacillus cereus (ATCC 2599) with MIC 12.5-50 muM. 4 was also active against S.aureus (ATCC 6571) with MIC 50 muM. These values are consistent with previous studies on the antimicrobial activity of Salvia diterpenoids.
TI  - Development of biopolymer nanocomposite for silver nanoparticles and Ciprofloxacin controlled release.
AB  - Screening of biopolymeric gel beads containing Silver NanoParticles (Ag-NPs) stabilized in Guar Gum Alkyl Amine (GGAA) and Ciprofloxacin (Cip) was carried out in order to obtain a novel nanocomposite with controlled release profile of both antimicrobians. The selected matrix composed of Alginate/High Methoxyl Pectin (HMP)/GGAA (4:4:1) was able to co-incorporate Ag-NPs and Cip with encapsulation efficiency higher than 70%. SEM images revealed good cohesivity and compatibility between the biopolymers and the cargos. Beads provided protection against Ag-NPs degradation at acidic pHs and HMP would played a key role providing hydrophobic regions. While Cip release profile showed a pH independent diffusional process, Ag-NPs release was restricted to matrix erodability. Calcium quelating agents and/or alginate degrading enzymes could modulate the release profile. The bactericidal activity of beads was tested in liquid medium, showing cooperative effects between the antimicrobials against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. TEM images confirmed interaction of Ag-NPs with bacterial surfaces followed by membrane damage. Results suggested the nanocomposite matrix as a promising system for oral treatment of intestinal infectious diseases caused by multidrug resistant and unknown microorganisms, since both Cip and Ag-NPs would be able to reach intestine in the active form.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Antarctic bryozoans: an ecological perspective with potential for clinical applications.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of Antarctic bryozoans and the ecological functions of the chemical compounds involved remain largely unknown. To determine the significant ecological and applied antimicrobial effects, 16 ether and 16 butanol extracts obtained from 13 different bryozoan species were tested against six Antarctic (including Psychrobacter luti, Shewanella livingstonensis and 4 new isolated strains) and two bacterial strains from culture collections (Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus). Results from the bioassays reveal that all ether extracts exhibited antimicrobial activity against some bacteria. Only one butanol extract produced inhibition, indicating that antimicrobial compounds are mainly lipophilic. Ether extracts of the genus Camptoplites inhibited the majority of bacterial strains, thus indicating a broad-spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Moreover, most ether extracts presented activities against bacterial strains from culture collections, suggesting the potential use of these extracts as antimicrobial drugs against pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Reducing pathogens by using zinc oxide nanoparticles and acetic acid in sheep meat.
AB  - Practical applications of different concentrations (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mM) of zinc oxide (ZnO) suspensions containing 1 % acetic acid were investigated against the pathogenic bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus. ZnO suspensions (0, 1, 3, 6, and 8 mM) containing acetic acid had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of L. monocytogenes, E. coli, and S. aureus during 12 h of incubation, and the 8 mM suspensions of ZnO were the most effective against all the strains. These data suggested that the antibacterial activity of ZnO was concentration dependent. Thus, 6 and 8 mM ZnO were selected for further studies in meat. ZnO nanoparticles reduced initial growth of all inoculated strains in meat. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the antibacterial activity of ZnO nanoparticles in meat and indicates the potential of these nanoparticles as an antibacterial agent in the food industry.
TI  - Bacteriological quality of vegetables from organic and conventional production in different areas of Korea.
AB  - Foods grown in organic production systems have been described as representing an  increased risk to public health compared with foods from conventional production. Leafy vegetables (spinach, romaine lettuce, and green sesame leaves) grown in organic and conventional systems were collected from various areas in Korea and examined using standard culture methods to compare the microbiological quality of the produce grown in the two agricultural systems. The 354 samples of these leafy vegetables were analyzed for levels of indicator bacteria (aerobic bacteria, coliforms, and Escherichia coli) and the prevalence of the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Salmonella. Aerobic bacteria and coliforms were detected in all vegetable types, but nonpathogenic E. coli was below the limit of detection in all samples. B. cereus was the most prevalent pathogen, found on 7 (11.1%) of the 63 organic spinach samples. The prevalence of S. aureus was highest in organic sesame leaves; it was found on 5 (8.0%) of the 63 samples. The prevalence of L. monocytogenes was highest on organic romaine lettuce and spinach; it was found in 4 (6.4%) of 63 samples of each type of vegetable. E. coli O157:H7 found on only 1 (1.58%) of 55 conventional spinach samples. These results suggest that farming type at most only slightly affects the hygienic quality of leafy vegetables, and no effect was found for sample collection area. Salmonella was not isolated from any of the conventional or organic leafy vegetables. These results do not support the hypothesis that organic produce poses a substantially greater risk of pathogen contamination than does conventional produce.
TI  - Structural data and biological properties of almond gum oligosaccharide: application to beef meat preservation.
AB  - Enzymatic hydrolysis of almond gum generates low molecular weight oligosaccharides (OAG) with a yield of 33.5%. The generated oligosaccharides were purified and identified. OAG analyses show that the most prominent residues were galactose and arabinose with traces of xylose, rhamnose, glucose and mannose. The glycosyl linkage positions were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showing a main chain composed of galactose units [ --> 3)-Gal-(1 --> ] branched mainly with arabinose residues [Ara-(1 --> ]. The antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of OAG were investigated. As regards the in vitro antioxidant activities, the OAG showed a high total antioxidant activity (347 mug ascorbic acid equivalent/mL), an important DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging activity (IC50 = 0.64 mg/mL) and a high reducing capacity (RP0.5AU = 3.6 mg/mL). Furthermore, OAG had a high antimicrobial activity against Salmonella thyphimirium, Bacillus cereus, Actinomycetes sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Alternaria alternate and Candidat albicans. Finally, OAG efficiency was tested using 0.5%; 0.75% and 1% concentrations in beef meat preservation. Microbial growth and lipid oxidation were monitored during 9 days at 4 degrees C. The results showed significant inhibitions (p < 0.05) of lipid oxidation and microbial growth in ground beef meat containing OAG.
TI  - Cobalt(II) complexes with the antimicrobial drug enrofloxacin: structure, antimicrobial activity, DNA- and albumin-binding.
AB  - The cobalt(II) complexes with the quinolone antimicrobial agent enrofloxacin (Herx) in the presence of the nitrogen-donor heterocyclic ligands pyridine (py), 2,2'-bipyridylamine (bipyam), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), 2,2'-bipyridine (bipy) or the oxygen-donor ligand N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were synthesized and characterized. The crystal structures of complexes [Co(erx)2(py)2].MeOH.6H2O and [Co(erx)2(bipyam)].4.5MeOH.1.25H2O were determined by X-ray crystallography. The deprotonated enrofloxacinato ligands are bidentately bound to cobalt(II) ion through the pyridone oxygen and a carboxylato oxygen. The antimicrobial activity of the complexes was tested against five different microorganisms (Escherichia coli XL1, Xanthomonas campestris ATCC 33013, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633) and the complexes were more active than free Herx. The binding of the complexes to calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) was monitored by spectroscopic techniques, viscosity measurements, cyclic voltammetry and by mobility shift experiments in agarose gel electrophoresis with CT DNA and plasmid DNA (pDNA). All complexes exhibited a preference for binding to the supercoiled structure of the pDNA. The ability of the complexes to displace ethidium bromide (EB) from the EB-DNA complex was also investigated. The experiments indicated intercalation as the most possible mode and the DNA-binding strength of the complexes were also calculated. The complexes bind to human or bovine serum albumin protein exhibiting relatively high binding constant values.
TI  - The Antibacterial Activity of Cassia fistula Organic Extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cassia fistula, is a flowering plant and a member of Fabaceae family. Its leaves are compound of 4 - 8 pairs of opposite leaflets. There are many Cassia species around the world which are used in herbal medicine. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to examine in vitro anti-bacterial activity of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula native to Khuzestan, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The microbial inhibitory effect of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula was tested on 3 Gram positive: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis and 5 Gram negative: Salmonella Typhi, Kelebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis bacterial species using disc diffusion method at various concentrations. The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) were measured by the tube dilution assay. RESULTS: The extract of C. fistula was effective against B. cereus, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. The most susceptible microorganisms to ethanolic and methanolic extracts were E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Also B. cereus and S. aureus showed the least sensitivity to ethanolic and methanolic extracts, respectively. The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) of ethanolic extracts against S. aureus, E. coli, S. epidermidis and K. pneumoniae were also determined. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to the obtained results and regarding to the daily increase of the resistant microbial strains to the commercial antibiotics, it can be concluded that these extracts can be proper candidates of antibacterial substance against pathogenic bacterial species especially S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Antibacterial and Antifungal Activity of Holothuria leucospilota Isolated From Persian Gulf and Oman Sea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergence of antimicrobial resistance toward a number of conventional antibiotics has triggered the search for antimicrobial agents from a variety of sources including the marine environment. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of Holothuria leucospilota from Qeshm and Kharg Islands against some selected bacteria and fungi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this investigation, sea cucumbers from two coastal cities of Persian Gulf were collected in March and May 2011 and identified by the scale method according to the food and agriculture organization of the United Nations. Antibacterial activity of hydroalcoholic extracts of the body wall, cuvierian organs and coelomic fluid, methanol, chloroform, and n-hexane extracts of the body wall were evaluated by the spot test. In addition, their antifungal activity was assessed by the broth dilution method. RESULTS: The displayed effect was microbiostatic at concentrations of 1000 and 2000 microg/mL rather than microbicidal. The highest activity of hydroalcoholic extracts was exhibited by body wall, cuvierian organs and coelomic fluid against Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Aspergillus niger, A. fumigatus, A. flavus and A. brasilensis. However, none of the methanol, chloroform and n-haxane extracts showed appreciable effects against Shigella dysenteriae, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans. Moreover, cuvierian organs did not possess any antifungal potential. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that water-methanol extracts from the body wall of H. leucospilota possess antibacterial and antifungal activity. However, additional and in-depth studies are required to isolate and identify the active component(s).

Compound 2 displayed strong inhibitory effects on the growth of A. solani and S. aureus with MIC of 3.13 muM for each. Compounds 2 and 3 displayed a significant growth-inhibition activity on R. sativus.
TI  - Thiophene acetylenes and furanosesquiterpenes from Xanthopappus subacaulis and their antibacterial activities.
AB  - In a search for naturally occurring antibacterial compounds in medicinal plants,  six hitherto unknown thiophene acetylenes, named 10,11-threo-xanthopappin D, 10,11-erythro-xanthopappin D, 10,11-cis-xanthopappin B, 5-(but-4-chloro-3-hydroxy-1-ynyl)-2-(Z)-pent-3-ene-1-ynylthiophene, 5-(but-4-chloro-3-hydroxy-1-ynyl)-2-(E)-pent-3-ene-1-ynylthiophene, 5-(but-3,4-dihydroxy-1-ynyl)-2-(Z)-pent-3-ene-1-ynylthiophene and two furanosesquiterpenes, as well as fifteen known compounds, were isolated from Xanthopappus subacaulis, which has been used as a traditional Tibetan medicine in China.

Schiff's base ligand and its metal complexes were screened for their antibacterial and antifungal activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, respectively. Kirby-Bauer single disk susceptibility test was used for antibacterial activity and well diffusion method for antifungal activity of the compounds on the used fungi.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria via photosensitization of vitamin K3 by UV-A light.
AB  - This study investigated inactivation of bacteria with ultraviolet light A irradiation in combination with vitamin K3 as a photosensitizer. Six bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli suspended in vitamin K3 aqueous solution were exposed to ultraviolet light A. Five of six bacteria, with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were reduced by eight logs with 1600 muM of vitamin K3 and 5.8 J cm(-2) UV-A irradiation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reduced by four logs under these conditions. Reactive oxygen species including singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion radical were generated in vitamin K3 aqueous solution under UV-A irradiation. These results suggest that vitamin K3 and UV-A irradiation may be effective for bacterial inactivation in environmental and medical applications.
TI  - Compositional studies and Biological activities of Perovskia abrotanoides Kar. oils.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current study has been designed to evaluate the chemical composition  of essential and fixed oils from stem and leaves of Perovskia abrotanoides and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of these oils. RESULTS: GC-MS analysis of essential oil identified 19 compounds with (E)-9-dodecenal being the major component in stem and hexadecanoic acid in leaves. In contrast, GC-MS analysis of fixed oil showed 40 constituents with alpha-amyrin the major component in stem and alpha-copaene in leaves. The antioxidant activity showed the highest value of 76.7% in essential oil from leaves in comparison with fixed oil from stem (45.9%) through inhibition of peroxidation in linoleic acid system. The antimicrobial assay tested on different microorganisms (e.g. E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, Nitrospira, S. epidermis, A. niger, A. flavus and C. albicans) showed the higher inhibition zone at essential oil from leaves (15.2 mm on B. cereus) as compared to fixed oil from stem (8.34 mm on S. aureus) and leaves (11.2 mm on S. aureus). CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed the fact that essential oil analyzed from Perovskia abrotanoides stem and leaves could be a promising source of natural products with potential antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, as compared to fixed oil.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Ammodaucus leucotrichus fruit oil from Algerian Sahara.
AB  - Three fruit oil samples of Ammodaucus leucotrichus Cosson & Durieu from Algerian  Sahara were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC(RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The main compounds were perillaldehyde (87.0-87.9%) and limonene (7.4-8.2%). The antimicrobial effect of the essential oil was evaluated against bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi. High antibacterial activity was observed against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus. Enterobacter cloaceae, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella typhimurium, with MIC values between 0.5-1.0 microL/mL. Fungal strains were also sensitive to the essential oil (MIC values: 0.25-0.75 microL/mL).The most potent activity was observed against the filamentous fungi, Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillusflavus (0.25-0.50 microL/mL).
TI  - Behavior of transition state regulator AbrB in batch cultures of Bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  - The transition state regulator AbrB is involved in the regulation of various cellular functions such as exponential growth, transition state and sporulation onset, due to its ability to activate, suppress or prevent the inappropriate expression of various genes in Bacillus subtilis. In order to understand combined behavior in batch cultures of AbrB in Bacillus thuringiensis, we cloned and expressed the abrB gene of B. thuringiensis in Escherichia coli. The deduced sequence of abrB gene coded for a protein consisting of 94 amino acids with ~10.5 kDa protein that shares 100 and 85 % identity with those from Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis. The recombinant AbrB protein was used as antigen for the production of rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-AbrB. Two media cultures with carbon: nitrogen ratios of 7.0, but varying access to nutrients were tested in batch cultures. In the case of both media, AbrB accumulation occurred from the beginning of the process and was maximal during early exponential growth. Thereafter, the level of AbrB decreased when there were no nutrient limitations and coincided with a decreased value in specific growth rate, although growth continued exponentially. Nonetheless, sporulation onset was determined 3 h and 4 h later, in media with highly metabolizable nutrients clean medium and Farrera medium, respectively. Hence, the maximal level of AbrB accumulation in batch cultures of B. thuringiensis is not influenced by limiting nutrients; however, nutrient availability affects the required time lapse for transition state regulator accumulation.
TI  - Lumazine peptides penilumamides B-D and the cyclic pentapeptide asperpeptide A from a gorgonian-derived Aspergillus sp. fungus.
AB  - Three new lumazine peptides, penilumamides B-D (2-4), and one known analogue, penilumamide (1), together with a new cyclic pentapeptide, asperpeptide A (5), were isolated from the gorgonian-derived fungus Aspergillus sp. XS-20090B15. Among them, 2 was obtained from the feeding culture with l-methionine of this strain. All structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and chemical derivatization. Compounds 1-4 are rare lumazine peptides, of which 1 and 3 are formed from 2 by oxidation of the l-methionine residue.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using lingonberry and cranberry juices and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - In this study lingonberry and cranberry juices were used for silver nanoparticle  synthesis. The berry juices were characterized by total phenolics, total anthocyanins and benzoic acid content, respectively 1.9-2.7mg/ml, 55.2-83.4mg/l and 590.8-889.2mg/l. The synthesis of silver nanoparticles was performed at room temperature assisting in solutions irradiated by ultraviolet for 30min. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and microscopy confirmed the formation of nanoparticles as well as the dark red color of colloid of silver samples showed the formation of stable nanoparticles. Broad localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peaks in UV-vis spectra indicated the formation of polydispersive silver nanoparticles and LSPR was observed at 485nm and 520nm for the silver nanoparticles synthesis using lingonberry and cranberry juices, respectively. The antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles was determined against the reference strains of microorganisms that could be found in food products: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 13076, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and foodborne B. cereus producing and non-producing enterotoxins. Silver nanoparticles showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and were most active against S. aureus ATCC 25923, B. subtilis ATCC 6633 and B. cereus ATCC 11778 reference cultures, and less active against C. albicans ATCC 10231 and foodborne B. cereus. It can be concluded that lingonberry and cranberry juices could be used as bioreductants for silver ions.
TI  - Influence of Albizia lebbeck Saponin and Its Fractions on In Vitro Gas Production Kinetics, Rumen Methanogenesis, and Rumen Fermentation Characteristics.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of crude seed powder (CSP) and gross saponins extract (GSE) of seeds of Albizia lebbeck on antimicrobial activity by taking two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus), two Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhi) bacteria, and two fungi species (Aspergillus niger and Candida butyric) were taken at 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 microg levels using agar well diffusion method. Zone of inhibition was increased with increasing of concentration of CSP and saponins which indicates that Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli), Gram-positive bacteria (B. cereus), and A. niger were significantly susceptible to inhibition. Another experiment was conducted to study the effect of GSE and saponins fraction A and B of A. lebbeck supplementation at 6% on DM basis on methane production and other rumen fermentation parameters using in vitro gas production test, by taking three different type diets, that is, high fiber diet (D1, 60R : 40C), medium fiber diet (D2, 50R : 50C), and low fiber diet (D3, 40R : 60C). Significant (P </= 0.05) increase was seen in IVDMD, methane production; however ammonia nitrogen concentration decreased as compared to control. The methane production was reduced in a range between 12 and 49% by saponin supplemented diets except in case of GSE in D2. Sap A showed the highest methane reduction per 200 mg of truly digested substrate (TDS) than other treatment groups. Results in relation with quantification of methanogens and protozoa by qPCR indicated the decreasing trend with saponins of A. lebbek in comparison with control except total methanogen quantified using mcr-A based primer.
TI  - A metallo-beta-lactamase is responsible for the degradation of ceftiofur by the bovine intestinal bacterium Bacillus cereus P41.
AB  - Ceftiofur is a highly effective veterinary cephalosporin, yet it is rapidly degraded by bacteria in the gut. The goal of this work was to directly determine the mechanism of ceftiofur degradation by the bovine intestinal isolate Bacillus cereus P41. B. cereus P41 was isolated from the feces of a cow that had not been treated with cephalosporins, and was found to rapidly degrade ceftiofur in culture. Analysis of spent culture media by HPLC/UV and HPLC/MS revealed one major metabolite of ceftiofur, with a negative ion m/z of 127. Comparison of ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, and cefpodoxime degradation suggested that the major stable ceftiofur metabolite was the thiofuroic acid group eliminated from the C-3 position of the drug after hydrolysis by beta-lactamase. Genomic DNA from B. cereus P41 was cloned into Escherichia coli, and the transformants were screened for growth in the presence of ceftiofur. DNA sequencing of the plasmid pHSG299-BC-3 insert revealed the presence of a gene encoding a metallo-beta-lactamase. Incubation of ceftiofur with either the E. coli transformant or a commercial B. cereus metallo-beta-lactamase showed degradation of the drug and formation of the same major metabolite produced by B. cereus P41. These data demonstrate that a metallo-beta-lactamase plays a major role in the degradation of ceftiofur by the bovine intestinal bacterium B. cereus P41.
TI  - Characterization of a novel Manduca sexta beta-1, 3-glucan recognition protein (betaGRP3) with multiple functions.
AB  - Recognition of pathogens by insect pattern recognition receptors is critical to mount effective immune responses. In this study, we reported a new member (betaGRP3) of the beta-1, 3-glucan recognition protein (betaGRP) family from the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta. Unlike other members of the M. sexta betaGRP family proteins, which contain an N-terminal small glucan binding domain and a C-terminal large glucanase-like domain, betaGRP3 is 40-45 residues shorter at the N-terminus and lacks the small glucan binding domain. The glucanase-like domain of betaGRP3 is most similar to that of M. sexta microbe binding protein (MBP) with 78% identity. betaGRP3 transcript was mainly expressed in the fat body, and both its mRNA and protein levels were not induced by microorganisms in larvae. Recombinant betaGRP3 purified from Drosophila S2 cells could bind to several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and yeast, as well as to laminarin (beta-1, 3-glucan), mannan, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and meso-diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-type peptidoglycan (PG), but did not bind to Lysine-type PG. Binding of betaGRP3 to laminarin could be competed well by free laminarin, mannan, LPS and LTA, but almost not competed by free PGs. Recombinant betaGRP3 could agglutinate Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli in a calcium-dependent manner and showed antibacterial (bacteriostatic) activity against B. cereus, novel functions that have not been reported for the betaGRP family proteins before. M. sexta betaGRP3 may serve as an immune surveillance receptor with multiple functions.
TI  - Antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  - Grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. These metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. Grapes are used to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. Grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. This overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components against foodborne (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus), medical (Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (Candida albicans, Botrytis cinerea), parasites (Eimeria tenella, Trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin A, Shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. Also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects associated with wine consumption. The collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial properties of the essential oil and ethanol extract from the stem of Aglaia odorata Lour.
AB  - The stem-derived essential oil of Aglaia odorata Lour. was obtained by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type system. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the oil revealed the identification of 39 compounds, representing 76.4% of the oil; germacrene D (20.3%), alpha-humulene (17.1%), alpha-himachalene (12.7%) and beta-caryophyllene (10.2%) were the major components. Ar-turmerone (1) and eichlerialactone (2) were isolated from the stem oil and ethanolic stem extract of this plant species, respectively. Antimicrobial activities of the oil and ethanol extract were tested against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains including Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, as well as three rice fungal pathogens Bipolaris oryzae, Pyricularia oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani using broth microdilution method. The oil and 1 exhibited significant antifungal activity against the three rice pathogens tested, whereas 2 exhibited good antibacterial activity against both the Gram-positive pathogens tested.
TI  - Development of 23 individual TaqMan(R) real-time PCR assays for identifying common foodborne pathogens using a single set of amplification conditions.
AB  - Most of the acute intestinal diseases are caused by foodborne pathogens with infants and elderly people being at major risk. The aim of this study was to develop a procedure to simultaneously detect 20 foodborne pathogens in complex alimentary matrices such as milk, cheese and meat. The list of targets include, among the others, Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Escherichia coli spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. The accuracy of detection was determined by using ATCC strains as positive and negative controls. The achieved sensitivity of each of assays was 1 pg of genomic DNA, which was equivalent to approximately 1 cfu. The working ranges of the TaqMan((R)) Real-time PCR assays, when used quantitatively on cheese and meat samples inoculated with serial dilution of Listeria spp., Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, Salmonella enterica, Shigella boydii, E. coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterobacter sakazakii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 10(8) cfu/g to 10(4) cfu/g. No matrix interferences were observed.
TI  - Evaluation of indirect impedance for measuring microbial growth in complex food matrices.
AB  - The suitability of indirect impedance to accurately measure microbial growth in real food matrices was investigated. A variety of semi-solid and liquid food products were inoculated with Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteriditis, Candida tropicalis or Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and CO2 production was monitored using a conductimetric (Don Whitely R.A.B.I.T.) system. The majority (80%) of food and microbe combinations produced a detectable growth signal. The linearity of conductance responses in selected food products was investigated and a good correlation (R(2) >/= 0.84) was observed between inoculum levels and times to detection. Specific growth rate estimations from the data were sufficiently accurate for predictive modeling in some cases. This initial evaluation of the suitability of indirect impedance to generate microbial growth data in complex food matrices indicates significant potential for the technology as an alternative to plating methods.
TI  - Influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - The results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. To be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (DA) and molecular weights (MW) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. They were tested at different pH values for their antimicrobial activities against four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi), four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria solani). Chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (DA and MW) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. Considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower DA and the lower pH give the larger efficiency. Antibacterial activity was further enhanced for Gram-negative bacteria with decreasing MW, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the Gram-positive. Concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. Fungal growth decreased with increasing MW for F. oxysporum and decreasing DA for A. solani, but no MW or DA dependences were observed with A. niger.
TI  - Eremophilane-type sesquiterpenoids with diverse skeletons from Ligularia sagitta.
AB  - Five new highly oxygenated eremophilane-type sesquiterpenoids, possessing C19 (1  and 2), C15 (3 and 4), and C14 (8) skeletons, along with eight known eremophilenolides were obtained from the aerial parts of Ligularia sagitta. The absolute configuration of 1 was assigned by X-ray diffraction analysis and that of 3 by ECD spectroscopy. Compounds 1-10 were evaluated for their antibacterial activities against Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Erwinia carotovora. Compounds 4 and 5 displayed broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against these bacteria with MIC values of approximately 7.25 mug/mL, followed by 3 and 6 with MIC values in the range of 23.0-125.0 mug/mL. Compounds 3 and 8 showed mild activity against three human tumor cell lines (IC50 approximately 13 muM). Preliminary structure-activity relationships for these eremophilenolides are reported.
TI  - Radiation-treated ready-to-eat (RTE) chicken breast Adobo for immuno-compromised  patients.
AB  - Usually in hospitals low-bacterial diets are served to immuno-compromised patients (ICPs). However, low-bacterial diets still pose a high risk of microbial infections and limit the food selection of the patients. Thus, pathogen-free dishes must be made available. This study presents the development of pathogen-free ready-to-eat (RTE) Filipino ethnic food chicken breast Adobo, sterilized by exposure to high-dose gamma rays (25 kGy) in combination with conventional treatments. Frozen vacuum-packed samples artificially inoculated with Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, were exposed to 25 kGy gamma radiation for complete sterilization. Microbial quality and sterility of the samples were analysed following 15, 30, and 60 days of storage at -4 degrees C. The effects of high-dose gamma irradiation on the nutritional quality and sensory characteristics of RTE chicken breast Adobo were also evaluated.
TI  - The genetic diversity of cereulide biosynthesis gene cluster indicates a composite transposon Tnces in emetic Bacillus weihenstephanensis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cereulide is a cyclic dodecadepsipeptide ionophore, produced via non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), which in rare cases can lead to human death. Early studies had shown that emetic toxin formation belongs to a homogeneous group of Bacillus cereus sensu stricto and the genetic determinants of cereulide (a 24-kb gene cluster of cesHPTABCD) are located on a 270-kb plasmid related to the Bacillus anthracis virulence plasmid pXO1. RESULTS: The whole genome sequences from seven emetic isolates, including two B. cereus sensu stricto and five Bacillus weihenstephanensis strains, were compared, and their inside and adjacent DNA sequences of the cereulide biosynthesis gene clusters were analyzed. The sequence diversity was observed, which classified the seven emetic isolates into three clades. Different genomic locations of the cereulide biosynthesis gene clusters, plasmid-borne and chromosome-borne, were also found. Potential mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were identified in the flanking sequences of the ces gene cluster in all three types. The most striking observation was the identification of a putative composite transposon, Tnces, consisting of two copies of ISces element (belonging to IS6 family) in opposite orientations flanking the ces gene cluster in emetic B. weihenstephanensis. The mobility of this element was tested by replacing the ces gene cluster by a KmR gene marker and performing mating-out transposition assays in Escherichia coli. The results showed that Tnces::km transposes efficiently (1.04 x 10(-3) T/R) and produces 8-bp direct repeat (DR) at the insertion sites. CONCLUSIONS: Cereulide biosynthesis gene clusters display sequence diversity, different genomic locations and association with MGEs, in which the transposition capacity of a resistant derivative of the composite transposon Tnces in E. coli was demonstrated. Further study is needed to look for appropriate genetic tools to analysis the transposition of Tnces in Bacillus spp. and the dynamics of other MGEs flanking the ces gene clusters.
TI  - Lipodiscamides A-C, new cytotoxic lipopeptides from Discodermia kiiensis.
AB  - Lipodiscamides A-C, three new lipodepsipeptides, were characterized from the marine sponge Discodermia kiiensis. These structurally rare cyclic lipodepsipeptides were found to possess an unprecedented dilactone macrocycle and, thus, represent a new family of lipopeptides. They are the only lipopeptides bearing 4S-hydroxy-trans-2-enoate, and noncanonical amino acids, l-3-ureidoalanine (Uda), E-dehydronorvaline (Denor), and d-citrulline (Cit). MTT assays against P388 and HeLa cells revealed the moderate cytotoxicity of all three compounds.
TI  - Investigating the potential of under-utilised plants from the Asteraceae family as a source of natural antimicrobial and antioxidant extracts.
AB  - Antimicrobial properties of ethanol and water extracts from eight Asteraceae species were investigated against three Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA and Bacillus cereus) and two Gram negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) bacterial strains. Ethanol extracts from Centaurea scabiosa, Arctium minus, Taraxacum officinale, Centaurea nigra and Cirsium palustre demonstrated antimicrobial activity against strains of S. aureus, MRSA and B. cereus (MIC=187.5-365mug/ml). Ethanol extracts also had higher antioxidant activities and phenolic content demonstrating a link between these compounds and the bioactivity of these extracts. Further investigation into the phenolic content of ethanol extracts using UPLC-MS/MS lead to the identification and quantification of numerous phenolic compounds in all species including; 18 from Cirsium arvense, 16 from Cirsium vulgare, 19 from C. palustre, 15 from C. nigra, 17 from C. scabiosa, 14 from Sonchus asper, 17 from A. minus and 11 from T. officinale.
TI  - Characterization of the cell surface properties of drinking water pathogens by microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon and electrophoretic mobility measurements.
AB  - The surface characteristics of microbial cells directly influence their mobility  and behavior within aqueous environments. The cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) and electrophoretic mobility (EPM) of microbial cells impact a number of interactions and processes including aggregation, adhesion to surfaces, and stability of the cells within the aqueous environments. These cell characteristics are unique to the bacterial species and are a reflection of the large diversity of surface structures, proteins, and appendages of microorganisms. CSH and EPM of bacterial cells contribute substantially to the effectiveness of drinking water treatment to remove them, and therefore an investigation of these properties will be useful in predicting their removal through drinking water treatment processes and transport through drinking water distribution systems. EPM and CSH measurements of six microbiological pathogen or surrogate species suspended in phosphate-buffered water are reported in this work. Two strains of Vibrio cholerae were hydrophobic, while three strains of Escherichia coli were hydrophilic. Bacillus cereus was categorized as moderately hydrophobic. The strains of E. coli had the highest (most negative) EPM. Based on the measurements, E. coli species is predicted to be most difficult to remove from water while V. cholerae will be the easiest to remove.
TI  - Electrochemical detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in human fluid samples via pyocyanin.
AB  - The ability to quickly detect the presence of pathogenic bacteria in patient samples is of the outmost importance to expedient patient care. Here we report the direct, selective, and sensitive detection of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, spiked in human whole blood with sodium heparin, urine, sputum, and bronchial lavage samples using unmodified, disposable carbon electrode sensors that detect the presence of pyocyanin, a virulence factor that is unique to this species. Square wave voltammetry scans of biological fluids from healthy individuals spiked with P. aeruginosa showed a clear pyocyanin response within one day of culturing at 37 degrees C. Scans of supernatants taken from cultures of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Bacillus cereus taken over a span of three days in the potential range from -0.5 to 0 V vs. an Ag/AgCl reference showed no electrochemically detectable molecules with the exception of P. aeruginosa. The results indicate the potential to sensitively and selectively determine the presence of P. aeruginosa in human samples via the electrochemical detection of pyocyanin in less than 5 min, without any sample preparation or separation steps.
TI  - A multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus in Korean ready-to-eat food.
AB  - A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for simultaneous  detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus in various Korean ready-to-eat foods. The six specific primer pairs for multiplex PCR were selected based on the O157 antigen (rfbE) gene of E. coli O157:H7, the DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB) gene of B. cereus, the toxin regulatory protein (toxR) gene of V. parahaemolyticus, the invasion protein A (invA) gene of Salmonella spp., the hemolysin (hly) gene of L. monocytogenes, and the thermonuclease (nuc) gene of S. aureus. The 16S rRNA gene was targeted as an internal control gene in the presence of bacterial DNA. The specificity and sensitivity assays for multiplex primer pairs were investigated by testing different strains. When this multiplex PCR assay was applied to evaluate the validity of detecting six foodborne pathogens in artificially inoculated several ready-to-eat food samples, the assay was able to specifically simultaneously detect as few as 1 colony-forming unit/mL of each pathogen after enrichment for 12 h. Their presence in naturally contaminated samples also indicates that the developed multiplex PCR assay is an effective and informative supplement for practical use.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial features of vasopressors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drugs administered as intravenous infusion may be contaminated during several stages of production or preparation. However studies focusing on antibacterial effects of vasopressor drugs are very rare. This study investigates the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the clinically used forms of vasopressors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro antimicrobial activities of vasopressor drugs of different concentrations were investigated by using the micro dilution technique. Microorganisms used in the test were Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ATCC 911, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 43251, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus 702 Roma, Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC607, Candida albicans ATCC 60193, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae RSKK 251. Antibacterial assays were performed in Mueller-Hinton broth at pH 7.3 and antifungal assays were performed in buffered Yeast Nitrogen Base at pH 7.0. RESULTS: Two different dopamine preparations showed antimicrobial activity. No other study drug showed any antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion, dopamine's antibacterial effects may be advantageous for inhibiting the spread of bacterial contamination during the preparation of the infusion solutions. However, it is important that strict guidelines regarding the need for sterile equipment and deliverables be adhered to during all procedures performed in the intensive care units.
TI  - Expression of Ciona intestinalis variable region-containing chitin-binding proteins during development of the gastrointestinal tract and their role in host-microbe interactions.
AB  - Variable region-containing chitin-binding proteins (VCBPs) are secreted, immune-type molecules that have been described in both amphioxus, a cephalochordate, and sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis, a urochordate. In adult Ciona, VCBP-A, -B and -C are expressed in hemocytes and the cells of the gastrointestinal tract. VCBP-C binds bacteria in the stomach lumen and functions as an opsonin in vitro. In the present paper the expression of VCBPs has been characterized during development using in situ hybridization, immunohistochemical staining and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technologies. The expression of VCBP-A and -C is detected first in discrete areas of larva endoderm and becomes progressively localized during differentiation in the stomach and intestine, marking the development of gut tracts. In "small adults" (1-2 cm juveniles) expression of VCBP-C persists and VCBP-A gradually diminishes, ultimately replaced by expression of VCBP-B. The expression of VCBP-A and -C in stage 7-8 juveniles, at which point animals have already started feeding, is influenced significantly by challenge with either Gram-positive or -negative bacteria. A potential role for VCBPs in gut-microbiota interactions and homeostasis is indicated.
TI  - Synergistic effects of NaOCl and ultrasound combination on the reduction of Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus in raw laver.
AB  - The current study investigated the synergistic effects of NaOCl (50-200 ppm)/ultrasound (37 kHz, 380 W for 5-100 min) combination on the reduction of Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus in raw laver. The synergistic reductions were not dependent on concentrations of NaOCl and times of ultrasound. Synergistic reduction ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 log10 colony-forming units (CFU)/g and 0.1-1.1 log10 CFU/g, respectively, for E. coli and B. cereus, with the largest synergistic reduction in the combination of 200 ppm NaOCl and 60-min ultrasound. Moreover, significant differences of "L" (lightness), "a" (redness), and "b" (yellowness) were not observed in combined with 50-200 ppm NaOCl and 100-min ultrasound compared to those in raw laver treated by only 100-min ultrasound. The results in the current study indicate that the combined treatment of 200 ppm NaOCl and 60-min ultrasound could be regarded a potential optimum hurdle approach in the seaweed production, processing, and distribution process to enhance seaweed safety.
TI  - Computational studies of the first order kinetic reactions for mononuclear copper(II) complexes having a hard-soft NS donor ligand.
AB  - The chelation behaviour of 4-((E)-2-(1-(thiophen-2-yl)ethylidene)hydrazinyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrrole- 3-carbonitrile (HL) towards Cu(II) ions has been investigated. These Cu(II) complexes are characterized by elemental analyses, molar-solid conductance, ESR, FTIR and electronic spectral studies. Also, the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters (Ea, A, DeltaH, DeltaS, DeltaG) for all thermal decomposition steps have been evaluated using Coats-Redfern and Horowitz-Metzger methods. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity of the ligand and its complexes were studied against Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Gram-positive Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and pathogenic fungi Pseudomonas aeruginosa by using minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) method.
TI  - Draft genome sequences of two Bacillus thuringiensis strains and characterization of a putative 41.9-kDa insecticidal toxin.
AB  - In this work, we report the genome sequencing of two Bacillus thuringiensis strains using Illumina next-generation sequencing technology (NGS). Strain Hu4-2, toxic to many lepidopteran pest species and to some mosquitoes, encoded genes for two insecticidal crystal (Cry) proteins, cry1Ia and cry9Ea, and a vegetative insecticidal protein (Vip) gene, vip3Ca2. Strain Leapi01 contained genes coding for seven Cry proteins (cry1Aa, cry1Ca, cry1Da, cry2Ab, cry9Ea and two cry1Ia gene variants) and a vip3 gene (vip3Aa10). A putative novel insecticidal protein gene 1143 bp long was found in both strains, whose sequences exhibited 100% nucleotide identity. The predicted protein showed 57 and 100% pairwise identity to protein sequence 72 from a patented Bt strain (US8318900) and to a putative 41.9-kDa insecticidal toxin from Bacillus cereus, respectively. The 41.9-kDa protein, containing a C-terminal 6x HisTag fusion, was expressed in Escherichia coli and tested for the first time against four lepidopteran species (Mamestra brassicae, Ostrinia nubilalis, Spodoptera frugiperda and S. littoralis) and the green-peach aphid Myzus persicae at doses as high as 4.8 microg/cm2 and 1.5 mg/mL, respectively. At these protein concentrations, the recombinant 41.9-kDa protein caused no mortality or symptoms of impaired growth against any of the insects tested, suggesting that these species are outside the protein's target range or that the protein may not, in fact, be toxic. While the use of the polymerase chain reaction has allowed a significant increase in the number of Bt insecticidal genes characterized to date, novel NGS technologies promise a much faster, cheaper and efficient screening of Bt pesticidal proteins.
TI  - Phytochemistry and Preliminary Assessment of the Antibacterial Activity of Chloroform Extract of Amburana cearensis (Allemao) A.C. Sm. against Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase-Producing Strains.
AB  - The chloroform extract of the stem bark of Amburana cearensis was chemically characterized and tested for antibacterial activity.The extract was analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The main compounds identified were 4-methoxy-3-methylphenol (76.7%), triciclene (3.9%), alpha -pinene (1.0%), beta -pinene (2.2%), and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3.1%). Preliminary antibacterial tests were carried out against species of distinct morphophysiological characteristics: Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica Serotype Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determinate in 96-well microplates for the chloroform extract and an analogue of themain compound identified, which was purchased commercially.We have shown that plant's extract was only inhibitory (but not bactericidal) at the maximum concentration of 6900 mu g/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus. Conversely, the analogue 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol produced MICs ranging from215 to 431 mu g/mL against all bacterial species.New antibacterial assays conducted with such chemical compound against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains have shown similarMICresults and minimumbactericidal concentration (MBC) of 431 mu g/mL.We conclude that A. cearensis is a good source of methoxy-methylphenol compounds,which could be screened for antibacterial activity againstmultiresistant bacteria fromdifferent species.
TI  - Water-based oligochitosan and nanowhisker chitosan as potential food preservatives for shelf-life extension of minced pork.
AB  - Water-based chitosans in the forms of oligochitosan (OligoCS) and nanowhisker chitosan (CSWK) are proposed as a novel food preservative based on a minced pork model study. The high surface area with a positive charge over the neutral pH range (pH 5-8) of OligoCS and CSWK lead to an inhibition against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative microbes (Salmonella enteritidis and Escherichia coli O157:H7). In the minced pork model, OligoCS effectively performs a food preservative for shelf-life extension as clarified from the retardation of microbial growth, biogenic amine formation and lipid oxidation during the storage. OligoCS maintains almost all myosin heavy chain protein degradation as observed in the electrophoresis. The present work points out that water-based chitosan with its unique morphology not only significantly inhibits antimicrobial activity but also maintains the meat quality with an extension of shelf-life, and thus has the potential to be used as a food preservative.
TI  - Microwave-assisted synthesis of diverse pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones and their antibacterial activities.
AB  - With the aim of developing a general and practical method for library production, a novel and efficient two-phase microwave-assisted cascade reaction between isatins and beta-ketoamides in [Bmim]BF4/toluene was developed for the synthesis of pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones. The features of this methodology are, the use of microwave-assisted rapid synthesis, mild reaction conditions, high yields, operational simplicity, facile product separation, and recyclability. Furthermore, the antibacterial activities of the pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-dione derivatives produced were evaluated against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter aerogenes) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus). These derivatives showed antibacterial activities against Gram-positive strains that were at least equivalent to that against Gram-negative strains. Compound 7{3,5} displayed the most potent antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa (MIC = 0.5 mug/mL) and greater activity than standard ampicillin (MIC = 1 mug/mL). Compound 7{4,7} exhibited the best inhibitory activity against E. coli and E. aerogenes (MIC = 1 and 0.5 mug/mL), compared with the standard ampicillin (both MICs = 1 mug/mL). The synthesized pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones are expected to be widely used as lead compounds for the development of new antibacterial agents.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial metabolites from an endophytic Aspergillus sp. associated with Melia azedarach.
AB  - Seven known metabolites, dianhydro-aurasperone C (1), isoaurasperone A (2), fonsecinone A (3), asperpyrone A (4), asperazine (5), rubrofusarin B (6) and (R)-3-hydroxybutanonitrile (7), were isolated from the culture of Aspergillus sp. KJ-9, a fungal endophyte isolated from Melia azedarach and identified by spectroscopic methods. All isolates were evaluated in vitro against several phytopathogenic fungi (Gibberella saubinetti, Magnaporthe grisea, Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Alternaria solani) and pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphyloccocus aureus and Bacillus cereus). Compounds 3 and 7 were active against almost all phytopathogenic fungi tested with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 6.25-50 muM. Moreover, compound 3 was active against all pathogenic bacteria with MIC in the range of 25-100 muM. Compound 7 is a rare new natural product isolated from a natural source for the first time, and the detailed NMR data of 1 were first assigned.
TI  - Antibacterial Activities and In Vitro Anti-Inflammatory (Membrane Stability) Properties of Methanolic Extracts of Gardenia coronaria Leaves.
AB  - This work is carried out with Gardenia coronaria leaves that belong to the family Rubiaceae, which is a small-to-medium-sized but tall, deciduous tree, 7.6-9 m high on an average. Leaves are used for the treatment of rheumatic pain and bronchitis. The leaf of the plant consists of coronalolide, coronalolic acid, coronalolide methyl ester, ethyl coronalolate acetate triterpenes (secocycloartanes), and so forth. Methanol extract from the leaves of Gardenia coronaria was completely screened for membrane stability and antibacterial activity. The lower concentrations of Methanolic leaf extract of Gardenia coronaria gave good antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, but higher concentrations gave relatively more projecting antibacterial activity in vitro as compared with Kanamycin. The crude drug's anti-inflammatory effects were compared with those of Aspirin as positive control. The Methanolic extracts of Gardenia coronaria leaves possessed a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms like Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Shigella sonnei, Shigella boydii, and Proteus mirabilis, with a zone of inhibition from 10 to 16 mm. The extract also showed good membrane stability to be considered as having significant anti-inflammatory action.
TI  - Survival of foodborne pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes) and Bacillus cereus spores in fermented alcoholic beverages (beer and refined rice wine).
AB  - Only limited information is available on the microbiological safety of fermented  alcoholic beverages because it is still a common belief that such beverages do not provide a favorable environment for bacterial growth and survival. Thus, in this study, we examined the survival of major foodborne pathogens and spores in fermented alcoholic beverages. Foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) and B. cereus spores (initial population, 3 to 4 log CFU/ml) were inoculated separately into three types of beer and refined rice wine, which were then stored at 5 and 22 degrees C. Bacterial counts were assayed periodically for up to 28 days. Vegetative B. cereus counts decreased rapidly, whereas B. cereus spore counts remained constant (P > 0.05) for a long period of time in all beverages. Vegetative B. cereus cells formed spores in beer at 5 and 22 degrees C, and the spores survived for long periods. Among vegetative cells, E. coli O157:H7 had the highest survival (only 1.49 to 1.56 log reduction during 28 days in beer at 5 degrees C). Beer and refined rice wine supported microbial survival from several days to several weeks. Our results appear to contradict the common belief that pathogens cannot survive in alcoholic beverages. Long-term survival of pathogens (especially B. cereus and E. coli O157:H7) in beer and refined rice wine should be taken into consideration by the manufacturers of these beverages. This study provides basic information that should help further research into microbial survival in alcoholic beverages and increase the microbiological safety regulation of fermented alcoholic beverages.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial contamination in apheresis and pooled random-donor platelet units.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite existing strategies, bacterial contamination of platelets (PLTs) remains a problem, and reliable testing near the time of use is needed. We evaluated the BacTx assay (Immunetics, Inc.), a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial peptidoglycan, for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Apheresis- and whole blood-derived PLT units, the latter tested in 6-unit pools, inoculated with 10 representative bacterial species (eight aerobic, two anaerobic), were tested with the BacTx assay at two sites to determine analytic sensitivity and time to detection. Specificity on sterile PLTs and reproducibility across different PLT units and assay kit lots was also determined. RESULTS: Analytical sensitivity for the 10 bacterial species ranged from 6.3 x 10(2) to 7.6 x 10(4) colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. In time-to-detection studies after inoculation of PLTs with 0.7 to 5.3 CFUs/mL, 10 replicates of all eight aerobic species were positive when bacterial titers were above the analytic sensitivity detection limit, which occurred at 48 hours for 60 PLT units and at 72 hours for the remaining 4 units, as well as at 7 days for all units. Specificity was 99.8% and reproducibility was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The BacTx assay had an analytical sensitivity below the 10(5) CFUs/mL threshold of clinical significance, detected all eight aerobic bacterial species 48 to 72 hours after inoculation as well as at 7 days, and had high specificity and reproducibility. These findings suggest that the BacTx assay will be a valuable test for detection of clinically relevant levels of bacterial contaminants in PLT units and pools near time of use.
TI  - Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Delphinium denudatum root extract exhibits antibacterial and mosquito larvicidal activities.
AB  - Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using aqueous root extract of Delphinium denudatum (Dd) by reduction of Ag(+) ions from silver nitrate solution has been investigated. The synthesized DdAgNPs were characterized by using UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The prepared DdAgNPs showed maximum absorbance at 416nm and particles were polydispersed in nature, spherical in shape and the size of the particle obtained was85nm. The DdAgNPs exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Bacillus cereus NCIM 2106, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027. The DdAgNPs showed potent larvicidal activity against second instar larvae of dengue vector Aedes aegypti with a LC50 value of 9.6ppm.
TI  - Crystal and solution structure analysis of FhuD2 from Staphylococcus aureus in multiple unliganded conformations and bound to ferrioxamine-B.
AB  - Iron acquisition is a central process for virtually all organisms. In Staphylococcus aureus, FhuD2 is a lipoprotein that is a high-affinity receptor for iron-bound hydroxamate siderophores. In this study, FhuD2 was crystallized bound to ferrioxamine-B (FXB), and also in its ligand-free state; the latter structures are the first for hydroxamate-binding receptors within this protein family. The structure of the FhuD2-FXB conformation shows that residues W197 and R199 from the C-terminal domain donate hydrogen bonds to the hydroxamate oxygens, and a ring of aromatic residues cradles the aliphatic arms connecting the hydroxamate moieties of the siderophore. The available ligand-bound structures of FhuD from Escherichia coli and YfiY from Bacillus cereus show that, despite a high degree of structural conservation, three protein families have evolved with critical siderophore binding residues on either the C-terminal domain (S. aureus), the N-terminal domain (E. coli), or both (B. cereus). Unliganded FhuD2 was crystallized in five conformations related by rigid body movements of the N- and C-terminal domains. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) indicates that the solution conformation of unliganded FhuD2 is more compact than the conformations observed in crystals. The ligand-induced conformational changes for FhuD2 in solution are relatively modest and depend on the identity of the siderophore. The crystallographic and SAXS results are used to discuss roles for the liganded and unliganded forms of FhuD2 in the siderophore transport mechanism.
TI  - The first report on flavonoid isolation from Annona crassiflora Mart.
AB  - Annona crassiflora, a native tree from Brazilian Cerrado, is reported to possess  several ethnomedical uses. Here, we report the isolation and unambiguous characterisation of the flavonoids quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosil(1 --> 6)-O-alpha-L-arabinoside (1), known as peltatoside, kaempferol-3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside (2), quercetin-3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside (3), quercetin-3-O-beta-L-arabinopiranoside (4) and the ( - )-epicatechin (5) from the hydroalcoholic portion of the leaf ethanolic extract. Their structures were elucidated by using 1D and 2D NMR, ESI-MS, UV/Vis spectroscopy, optical rotation analysis and literature data comparison. The leaf ethanolic extract and its isolated compounds were evaluated by using antimicrobial, antioxidant and larvicidal assays, expressing antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. This is the first report on flavonoid isolation from A. crassiflora.
TI  - Colloidal polyaniline dispersions: antibacterial activity, cytotoxicity and neutrophil oxidative burst.
AB  - Polyaniline colloids rank among promising application forms of this conducting polymer. Cytotoxicity, antibacterial activity, and neutrophil oxidative burst tests were performed on cells treated with colloidal polyaniline dispersions. The antibacterial effect of colloidal polyaniline against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was most pronounced for Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 3,500 mug mL(-1). The data recorded on human keratinocyte (HaCaT) and a mouse embryonic fibroblast (NIH/3T3) cell lines using an MTT assay and flow cytometry indicated a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of colloid, with the absence of cytotoxic effect at around 150 mug mL(-1). The neutrophil oxidative burst test then showed that colloidal polyaniline, in concentrations <150 mug mL(-1), was not able to stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species in neutrophils and whole human blood. However, it worked efficiently as a scavenger of those already formed.
TI  - Cerecidins, novel lantibiotics from Bacillus cereus with potent antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides that are widely produced by Gram-positive bacteria, including many species of the Bacillus group. In the present study, one novel gene cluster coding lantibiotic cerecidins was unveiled in Bacillus cereus strain As 1.1846 through genomic mining and PCR screening. The designated cer locus is different from that of conventional class II lantibiotics in that it included seven tandem precursor cerA genes, one modification gene (cerM), two processing genes (cerT and cerP), one orphan regulator gene (cerR), and two immunity genes (cerF and cerE). In addition, one unprecedented quorum sensing component, comQXPA, was inserted between cerM and cerR. The expression of cerecidins was not detected in this strain of B. cereus, which might be due to repressed transcription of cerM. We constitutively coexpressed cerA genes and cerM in Escherichia coli, and purified precerecidins were proteolytically processed with the endoproteinase GluC and a truncated version of putative serine protease CerP. Thus, two natural variants of cerecidins A1 and A7 were obtained which contained two terminal nonoverlapping thioether rings rarely found in lantibiotics. Both cerecidins A1 and A7 were active against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria. Cerecidin A7, especially its mutant Dhb13A, showed remarkable efficacy against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MDRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), and even Streptomyces.
TI  - Antibacterial potency of housefly larvae extract from sewage sludge through bioconversion.
AB  - Use of the fly to convert sewage sludge into nutrient-rich soil conditioner and amendment is an attractive approach for sludge bioconversion. During this process, fecal coliforms, an indicating pathogen, in sludge were reduced to 5.3 x 10(2) most probable number/g dry solid from initial 3.32 x 10(6) MPN/g dry solid. It was also found that the extract of larvae grown in sludge during bioconversion have an observable inhibitory effect against bacteria compared to larvae grown in wheat bran as measured by minimum bacterial concentration tests. In vitro antimicrobial assay tests over time also showed that the extract had strong inhibitory efficiencies of ca. 99% against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens, while the efficiency was 69% and 57% against Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. The observed pathogenic bacterial cell membrane damage was found to be responsible for the phenomenon mentioned above, with nuclear acids leaching out quickly and alkaline phosphatase increasing in the outer membrane, followed by an increase of beta-galactosidase in the inner membrane. Clearly, housefly larvae extract from sewage sludge through bioconversion possesses antibacterial potency against pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Influence of phenolic compounds of Kangra tea [Camellia sinensis (L) O Kuntze] on bacterial pathogens and indigenous bacterial probiotics of Western Himalayas.
AB  - Phenolic compounds of nutraceutical importance viz., catechins (C), (-)-epicatechin (EC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) were estimated in fresh green tea shoots of Camellia sinensis (L) O Kuntze cultivar. The total polyphenols and total catechins were in the range of 219.90 to 317.81 and 140.83 to 271.39 g/kg, respectively in monthly samples of tea. The values of C, EC, EGC, EGCG and ECG in tea powders as analyzed through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were in the range of 1.560 to 3.661, 13.338 to 27.766, 26.515 to 39.597, 62.903 to 102.168 and 18.969 to 39.469 mg/g, respectively. Effect of tea extracts and standard flavanols against five pathogenic bacteria viz., Listeria monocytogenes (MTCC-839), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC-741), Bacillus cereus (MTCC-1272), Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC-96) and Escherichia coli (MTCC-443), and eleven indigenous potential bacterial probiotics belonging to genera Enterococcus, Bacillus and Lactobacillus spp. obtained from fermented foods of Western Himalayas, was investigated. EGCG, ECG and EGC exhibited antibacterial activity but, C and EC did not show this activity. Tea extracts having high concentrations of EGCG and ECG were more potent in antibacterial action against bacterial pathogens. Tea extracts and standard flavan-3-ols augmented viability of potential probiotics in an order of EGCG > EGC > ECG > EC > C. Tea extracts and standard flavanols had no antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (MTCC-443) but, in combination with probiotic culture supernatants, this activity was seen. The Kangra tea thus, exerts antibacterial effect on bacterial pathogens through EGCG, ECG and EGC constituents while stimulatory effect on growth of indigenous potential probiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial and physical-mechanical properties of agar-based films incorporated with grapefruit seed extract.
AB  - The use of synthetic petroleum based packaging films caused serious environmental problems due to their difficulty in recycling and poor biodegradability. Therefore, present study was aimed to develop natural biopolymer-based antimicrobial packaging films as an alternative for the synthetic packaging films. As a natural antimicrobial agent, grapefruit seed extract (GSE) has been incorporated into agar to prepare antimicrobial packaging film. The films with different concentrations of GSE were prepared by a solvent casting method and the resulting composite films were examined physically and mechanically. In addition, the films were characterized by FE-SEM, XRD, FT-IR and TGA. The incorporation of GSE caused increase in color, UV barrier, moisture content, water solubility and water vapor permeability, while decrease in surface hydrophobicity, tensile strength and elastic modulus of the films. As the concentration of GSE increased from 0.6 to 13.3 mug/mL, the physical and mechanical properties of the films were affected significantly. The addition of GSE changed film microstructure of the film, but did not influence the crystallinity of agar and thermal stability of the agar-based films. The agar/GSE films exhibited distinctive antimicrobial activity against three test food pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. These results suggest that agar/GSE films have potential to be used in an active food packaging systems for maintaining food safety and extending the shelf-life of the packaged food.
TI  - Food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  - The term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following recent consumption of a particular food or drink. Millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. The food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus, Arcobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. botulinum and Bacillus cereus and helminths viz., Taenia. They also include protozoa viz., Trichinella, Sarcocystis, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum. The zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. The viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. Food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. This along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. Serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. ELISA, Latex agglutination test, Lateral flow assays, Immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), multiplex PCR, immuno-PCR, Realtime PCR, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR, DNA microarrays and probes are widely used. Along with these LAMP assays, Capillary Electrophoresis-Single Strand Confirmation polymorphism (CE-SSCP); Flow cytometry, FISH, Biosensors, Direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. Most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. With the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. Adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to HACCP principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. All these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.
TI  - Multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay for detection of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella sp., Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in spiked shrimps (Penaeus monodon).
AB  - The coastal aquaculture mainly shrimps constitute major export sector in Bangladesh and is increasingly shaped by international trade conditions and by national responses to those stringent quality and safety standards. PCR based validated methods for detection of major bacterial pathogens in shrimp might be very useful tool for ensuring quality and safety standards of exportable shrimps. The objective of this study was to evaluate overall performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the multiplex PCR assay for detection of Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella sp. and Escherichia coli O157:H7 from spiked shrimp samples. The targeted genes were ompW for V. cholerae, tdh for V. parahaemolyticus, sefA for Salmonella spp. and hlyEHEC for E. coli O157:H7. The genomic DNA was extracted by using standard method and amplified accordingly. Sensitivity of the assay was tested by inoculating the shrimp homogenate with viable cells of laboratory references strains (target pathogens). The genes were amplified individually both from culture homogenate and spiked samples. Twenty different uniplex and multiplex PCR assay were performed; the results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of multiplex PCR are comparable to that of the results of uniplex PCR for the samples. DNA extracted from shrimp samples spiked with non-target pathogen (Bacillus cereus, Shigella flexneri and Staphylococcus aureus) yielded negative results.
TI  - Efficacy of commercial natural antimicrobials alone and in combinations against pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Microbial control strategies are needed in the food industry to prevent foodborne illnesses and outbreaks and prolong product shelf life. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of the commercial natural antimicrobials white mustard essential oil (WMEO), citrus flavonoid and acid blend (CFAB), olive extract (OE), Nisaplin (a compound containing nisin), and lauric arginate (LAE) alone and in combinations against foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms. MICs of individual and combined antimicrobials against Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined at pH 6.0 and 25 degrees C. WMEO was most effective against B. cereus and S. aureus, with MICs of 250 and 500 mg/liter, respectively. CFAB inhibited all tested microorganisms, requiring only 12 to 35 mg/liter for gram-positive bacteria. For OE, 2,000 mg/liter was needed to achieve microbial inhibition. Nisaplin at 400 to 1,200 mg/liter inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. LAE was effective at low concentrations and required only 20 to 50 mg/liter to inhibit all tested microorganisms. When WMEO was combined with other antimicrobials, the effects were usually additive except for WMEO plus Nisaplin and WMEO+OE, which had synergistic activity against L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis, respectively. An antagonistic effect was observed for WMEO+CFAB against E. aerogenes. For WMEO+LAE+CFAB, additive antimicrobial effects were noted against all strains tested except S. aureus, where a synergistic effect occurred. These findings suggest that these commercial natural antimicrobials have potential to enhance food safety by inhibiting foodborne pathogens and extending product shelf life.
TI  - Expression, purification, and solubility optimization of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase  1 from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase 1 cleaves the ester bond of peptidyl-tRNA thereby recycling peptidyl-tRNAs generated from premature termination of translation and expression of minigenes and short ORFs. Bacterial Pth1 is essential, highly conserved, and has no essential eukaryotic homolog making it a good target for antibacterial development. Herein we describe the cloning of pth1 gene from Bacillus cereus as an N-terminal hexahistidine fusion protein. Solubility was optimized for overexpression in Escherichia coli. Purity greater than 95% was achieved in one chromatography step. Yields greater than 12mg of purified Pth1 per liter of minimal media were achieved and buffer conditions for long-term solubility were determined. Enzymatic activity of Pth1 from B. cereus was confirmed and quantification of Michaelis-Menten parameters reported.
TI  - Brown seaweed (Saccharina japonica) as an edible natural delivery matrix for allyl isothiocyanate inhibiting food-borne bacteria.
AB  - The edible, brown seaweed Saccharina japonica was prepared as powder in the size  range 500-900 mum for the desorption release of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC). Powders were used as raw (containing lipids) and as de-oiled, where the lipid was removed. In general, de-oiled powders adsorbed larger masses of AITC after vapour or solution contact. Mass adsorbed due to solution contact exceeded vapour contact. Larger particles adsorbed more than smaller particles. No chemical bonding between AITC and the powder surface occurred. Release from vapour deposited particles reached 70-85% available within 72 h; solution deposited reached 70-90% available at 192 h. The larger amounts of AITC adsorbed via solution deposition resulted in greater vapour-phase concentrations at 72 h for antimicrobial activity studies. No loss of activity was detected against Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium or Bacillus cereus. Only a nominal activity against Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated. S. japonica powder could be used as an edible, natural vehicle for AITC delivery.
TI  - Hydrothermal synthesis of copper based nanoparticles: antimicrobial screening and interaction with DNA.
AB  - Copper based nanoparticles (Cu-based NPs) of different compositions and sizes have been hydrothermally synthesized by varying the reaction time in the presence of the biocompatible surfactants polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan laurate (Tween 20) and polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000). Effective control of the above synthetic parameters gave rise to Cu, Cu2O and Cu/Cu2O NPs of 10-44 nm. The antibacterial activity of the NPs was screened against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Xanthomonas campestris, Escherichia coli) bacteria. The Cu-based NPs induce pDNA degradation in a dose-dependent manner as well as extensive ds CT-DNA degradation. Cu2O NPs of 16 nm and 12 nm exhibit the lowest IC50 values (2.13 mug/mL and 3.7 mug/mL) against B. cereus and B. subtilis, respectively. The agarose gel electrophoresis of ds CT-DNA treated with Cu2O NPs demonstrated degradation at high concentration. In lower concentrations, viscosity measurements indicated groove binding. In regard to the enhanced antibacterial effect and specificity of Cu2O NPs against the Gram-positive strains, the activity pathway was further explored and ROS production and lipid peroxidation verified. The released copper ions 5.15 mg/L in distilled water and 16.32 mg/L in nutrient medium, found below the critical value to inhibit bacterial growth and thus nanosized composition effect is predominant.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and biological studies of substituted quinozoline-4-(3H)-ones containing diazepine moiety.
AB  - The synthesis and characterization of new series of 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives have been presented. The structures were confirmed by elemental analyses, IR spectral, (1)H NMR spectral and mass spectral data. All the compounds were screened for in vitro antimicrobial and anthelmintic activities. The antibacterial activity was tested against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive), Bacillus cereus (Gram positive), Escherichia coli (Gram negative) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram negative). The antifungal activity was tested against Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans. All the compounds showed considerable antimicrobial activity against the microorganism studied. The significant anthelmintic activity of all novel compounds was demonstrated against Pheretima posthuma. Based on the nature of substituent present, the structure-activity correlation of novel compounds was discussed.
TI  - In Vitro Characterization of a Recombinant AHL-Lactonase from Bacillus cereus Isolated from a Striped Catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) Pond.
AB  - aiiA gene encoding AHL-lactonase was isolated from Bacillus cereus strain N26.2,  originating from a striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) pond in Vietnam. This gene, abbreviated as aiiA(N26.2), was cloned and expressed in a competent Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. The resulting protein, abbreviated as AiiAN26.2, was highly active in the pH range of 6-8 and could retain 80 % of the maximum activity under storage for 5 days at 4 degrees C or for 3 days at 20 degrees C. These properties of AiiAN26.2 protein confers its future application via feed supplementation, with the purpose of controlling aquaculture pathogens which regulate the virulence via a quorum sensing system.
TI  - Further in vitro evaluation of antiradical and antimicrobial activities of phytol.
AB  - The antiradical activity of phytol was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance towards hydroxyl radical (.OH), superoxide anion radical (.O2(-)), methoxy radical (.CH2OH), carbon-dioxide anion radical (.CO2(-)), as well as towards nitric-oxide radical (.NO) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (.DPPH) radical. It reduced the production of all tested radicals showing more promising activity against .CO2(-), .CH2OH and .DPPH radicals (56%, 50% and 48%, respectively) in comparison with .NO, .O2(-) and .OH radicals (38%, 23% and 15%, respectively). The antimicrobial activity of phytol was evaluated by the microdilution method against eight bacterial and eight fungal strains. To varying degrees, it was proven to be active against all tested bacteria and fungi (MIC 0.003-0.038 mg/mL and MBC 0.013-0.052 mg/mL, MIC 0.008-0.016 mg/mL and MFC 0.090-0.520 mg/mL, respectively). According to the obtained results, medical foods containing phytol may support development of new therapies for heart disease.
TI  - Effects of Methanol Extract of Wedelia chinensis Osbeck (Asteraceae) Leaves against Pathogenic Bacteria with Emphasise on Bacillus cereus.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the methanol extract of Wedelia chinensis leave was studied and tested against three pathogenic Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis and Stapylococcus aureus) and three pathogenic Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus rettgeri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) by the disk diffusion assay and broth dilution methods. The extract exhibited favourable antibacterial activity against the bacterial cells but was more potent against Gram positive bacteria with the minimum inhibition concentration of 3.12 to 6.25 mg/ml compared to the Gram negative bacteria which had minimum inhibition concentration values of 25 mg/ml. The time-kill study suggested that the extract possessed bactericidal properties at higher concentrations and eradicated the growth of bacterial cells. The major abnormalities occurred to the bacterial cells after exposed to the extract were complete alterations in their morphology and collapsed of the cells beyond repair. The methanol extract of W. chinensis may be an effective antibacterial agent to treat bacterial infections.
TI  - Trifolium pratense L. as a potential natural antioxidant.
AB  - The essential oils of three different growth stages of Trifolium pratense L. (TP1, TP2 and TP3) were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and tested for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. The highest content of volatile compounds was found in the essential oil sample TP1, where terpenes such as beta-myrcene (4.55%), p-cymene (3.59%), limonene (0.86%), tetrahydroionone (1.56%) were highlighted due to their biological activity. The antioxidant activity was determined by following the scavenging capacity of the essential oils for the free radicals DPPH., NO. and O2.-, as well as effects of the investigated oils on lipid peroxidation (LP). In all three cases, the sample TP1 showed the best radical-capturing capacity for DPPH. (27.61+/-0.12 microg/mL), NO. (16.03+/-0.11 microg/mL), O2.- (16.62+/-0.29 microg/mL) and also had the best lipid peroxidation effects in the Fe2+/ascorbate induction system (9.35+/-0.11 microg/mL). Antimicrobial activity was evaluated against the following bacteria cultures: Escherichia coli (ATCC10526), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 11632) and Bacillus cereus (ATCC 10876). None of the examined essential oil samples showed inhibitory effects on the tested bacterial strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from Ankober District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditional medicinal plants have long been used in Ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. Despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in Ankober District. METHODS: About 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Plant extracts from Embelia schimperi Vatke (Myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 microg/ml against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes. Growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium Hochst. (Lamiaceae) against S. pyogenes, and those of Rubus steudneri Schweinf. (Rosaceae) against S. epidermidis at an MIC value of 128 microg/ml. Generally, 74% of ethanol extracts (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial strains tested at an MIC value of 512 microg/ml or below. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of Ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed strong antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different natural honeys from Transylvania, Romania.
AB  - Honey is used in food industry and medicine due to its nutritive, therapeutic and dietetic qualities. The microbiological characteristics of 10 unpasteurized honey samples of known origin, collected from Transylvania beekeepers (Romania) were determined. The antibacterial activity of these types of honey against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella anatum, Salmonella choleraesuis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii and Listeria monocytogenes strains was studied. The most sensitive to the antibacterial activity were the two staphylococus strains (the largest diameter of inhibition zone was 18 mm) and B. subtilis strains (13.5 mm). The strains of B. cereus, E. coli, L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. were found to present resistance to some of the honey samples. Manna, sunflower and polyfloral honeys presented high antibacterial activity while acacia and linden honeys had a lower activity in terms of the number of sensible strains. Statistical analysis shows that the type of strains and the type of honey have influence on the diameter of inhibition.
TI  - Haplophytin B from Maclurodendron porteri.
AB  - An alkaloid from Maclurodendron porteri has been isolated and characterized. Extraction process was conducted by acid-base extraction method followed by column chromatography. The structure was established by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The compound was identified as haplophytin B which occurs commonly in the Rutaceae family. However, this is the first time this alkaloid was isolated and reported from the species. The compound showed no inhibition against Staphylococus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli and no cytotoxic activity against H199 and A549 cell lines.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant activities of honey collected from Timergara (Dir, Pakistan).
AB  - In this study honeys of Acacia modesta, Prunus persica, Zizyphus sativa and Isodon rogosus plants were tested against two Gram-positive bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus), two Gram-negative bacterial strains (Klebsilla pneumonia and Escherichia coli) and two fungal strains (Alternaria alternata and Trichoderma harzianum) through Agar well diffusion method. The tested honeys showed high antimicrobial activities to the tested bacterial and fungal strains. All the tested honeys were more active against Gram-negative bacterial strains than the Gram-positive bacterial strains. They showed lower activity against the tested fungal strains as compared to all the tested bacterial strains. The given honeys showed free radical scavenging activity also.
TI  - PSP: rapid identification of orthologous coding genes under positive selection across multiple closely related prokaryotic genomes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: With genomic sequences of many closely related bacterial strains made available by deep sequencing, it is now possible to investigate trends in prokaryotic microevolution. Positive selection is a sub-process of microevolution, in which a particular mutation is favored, causing the allele frequency to continuously shift in one direction. Wide scanning of prokaryotic genomes has shown that positive selection at the molecular level is much more frequent than expected. Genes with significant positive selection may play key roles in bacterial adaption to different environmental pressures. However, selection pressure analyses are computationally intensive and awkward to configure. RESULTS: Here we describe an open access web server, which is designated as PSP (Positive Selection analysis for Prokaryotic genomes) for performing evolutionary analysis on orthologous coding genes, specially designed for rapid comparison of dozens of closely related prokaryotic genomes. Remarkably, PSP facilitates functional exploration at the multiple levels by assignments and enrichments of KO, GO or COG terms. To illustrate this user-friendly tool, we analyzed Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus genomes and found that several genes, which play key roles in human infection and antibiotic resistance, show significant evidence of positive selection. PSP is freely available to all users without any login requirement at: http://db-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/PSP/. CONCLUSIONS: PSP ultimately allows researchers to do genome-scale analysis for evolutionary selection across multiple prokaryotic genomes rapidly and easily, and identify the genes undergoing positive selection, which may play key roles in the interactions of host-pathogen and/or environmental adaptation.
TI  - New hydrazones with pyrazolone structure: synthesis, characterization and biological evaluation.
AB  - AIM: To design new hydrazones with pyrazolone structure with improved biological  properties. MATERIAL AND METHODS: New hydrazones of antipyrine have been prepared by reaction of 4-aminophenazone (4-aminoantipyrine) with chloracetylchoride and hydrazine hydrate and then condensation with various aromatic aldehydes. RESULTS: The synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Sarcinalutea ATCC 9341, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, Bacillus subtilis) and Gram negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922) and pathogenic yeasts (Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Candida sake, Candidaglabrata). Some of them were found to have good antibacterial and antifungal activity. The antioxidant activity of these compounds was also evaluated using the total antioxidant capacity test. CONCLUSIONS: The chemical modulations performed on antipyrine structure have a good influence on the biological activity of the synthesized compounds.
TI  - New derivatives of aryl-propionic acid. Synthesis and biological evaluation.
AB  - AIM: To design new derivatives of aryl-propionic acid with potential antibacterial and antioxidant activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: New hydrazone of ibuprofen (2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid) have been synthesized by reaction of ethyl ester of ibuprofen with hydrazine hydrate and then condensation of corresponding hydrazide with various aromatic aldehydes. RESULTS: The synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Sarcinalutea ATCC 9341, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, Bacillus subtilis) and Gram negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922). Some of them were found to have good antibacterial activity. The antioxidant activity of these compounds was also tested using the total antiox idant capacity test. CONCLUSIONS: The chemical modulations performed on ibuprofen structure have a good influence on the biological activity of the synthesized compounds.
TI  - Capillary electrophoresis of microbial aggregates.
AB  - Uncontrolled aggregation of bacterial cells is a significant disadvantage of electrophoretic separations. Various aspects of the electrophoretic behavior of different strains of Gram-positive Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus(1), and Micrococcus luteus bacteria and Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria were investigated in this study. Our findings indicate that bacteria can be rapidly analyzed by CZE with surface charge modification by calcium ions (Ca(2+)). Bound Ca(2+) ions increase zeta potential to more than 2.0 mV and significantly reduce repulsive forces. Under the above conditions, bacterial cells create compact aggregates, and fewer high-intensity signals are observed in electropherograms. The above can be attributed to the bridging effect of Ca(2+) between bacterial cells. CE was performed to analyze bacterial aggregates in an isotachophoretic mode. A single peak was observed in the electropherogram.
TI  - Alcoholytic cleavage of polyhydroxyalkanoate chains by class IV synthases induced by endogenous and exogenous ethanol.
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)-producing Bacillus strains express class IV PHA synthase, which is composed of the subunits PhaR and PhaC. Recombinant Escherichia coli expressing PHA synthase from Bacillus cereus strain YB-4 (PhaRCYB-4) showed an unusual reduction of the molecular weight of PHA produced during the stationary phase of growth. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the low-molecular-weight PHA revealed that its carboxy end structure was capped by ethanol, suggesting that the molecular weight reduction was the result of alcoholytic cleavage of PHA chains by PhaRCYB-4 induced by endogenous ethanol. This scission reaction was also induced by exogenous ethanol in both in vivo and in vitro assays. In addition, PhaRCYB-4 was observed to have alcoholysis activity for PHA chains synthesized by other synthases. The PHA synthase from Bacillus megaterium (PhaRCBm) from another subgroup of class IV synthases was also assayed and was shown to have weak alcoholysis activity for PHA chains. These results suggest that class IV synthases may commonly share alcoholysis activity as an inherent feature.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the roots, stems and leaves of Alchornea floribunda.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alchornea floribunda Mull. Arg. is used in traditional medicine across Africa for the treatment of bacterial, fungal, parasitic and inflammatory disorders. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the crude extracts of different plant parts in order to provide a scientific rationale for the proposed broad efficacy of Alchornea floribunda in the treatment of bacterial infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracts of roots, stems and leaves were prepared using solvents of various polarities in order to extract a wide range of phytochemicals. The antibacterial activity of these crude extracts was evaluated by micro-dilution assay, against Gram-positive (i.e. Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus) as well as Gram-negative (i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. RESULTS: Generally, the ethanol (EtOH), methanol (MeOH), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and chloroform (CHCl3) extracts demonstrated the best activities, with the leaves exhibiting the highest average activity for six of the eight pathogens. Of these, the ethanolic leaf extract was the most active against Staphylococcus aureus with an MIC value of 50microg/mL. Some other notable activity was observed for the ethyl acetate and chloroform root extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (50microg/mL), and for selected stem extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (50microg/mL), Klebsiella pneumoniae (63microg/mL) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (63microg/mL). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the promising antibacterial activity of Alchornea floribunda against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria responsible for gastrointestinal, skin, respiratory and urinary ailments, and validates its use in the ethnopharmacology of the region.
TI  - Synergy of antibacterial and antioxidant activities from crude extracts and peptides of selected plant mixture.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A plant mixture containing indigenous Australian plants was examined  for synergistic antimicrobial activity using selected test microorganisms. This study aims to investigate antibacterial activities, antioxidant potential and the content of phenolic compounds in aqueous, ethanolic and peptide extracts of plant mixture. METHODS: Well diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assays were used to test antibacterial activity against four pathogenic bacteria namely Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1- picrylhydrazyl) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assays were used to evaluate antioxidant activity. HPLC and gel filtration were used for purification of the peptides. Scanning electron microscope was applied to investigate the mode of attachment of the peptides on target microbial membranes. RESULTS: Aqueous extraction of the mixture showed no inhibition zones against all the test bacteria. Mean diameter of inhibition zones for ethanol extraction of this mixture attained 8.33 mm, 7.33 mm, and 6.33 mm against S. aureus at corresponding concentrations of 500, 250 and 125 mg/ml while E .coli showed inhibition zones of 9.33 mm, 8.00 mm and 6.66 mm at the same concentrations. B. cereus exhibited inhibition zones of 11.33 mm, 10.33 mm and 10.00 mm at concentrations of 500, 250 and 125 mg/ml respectively. The peptide extract demonstrated antibacterial activity against S. aureus, E. coli and B. cereus. The MIC and MBC values for ethanol extracts were determined at 125 mg/ml concentration against S. aureus and E. coli and B. cereus value was 31.5 mg/ml. MIC and MBC values showed that the peptide extract was significantly effective at low concentration of the Australian plant mixture (APM). Phenolic compounds were detected in hot aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the plant mixture. Hot aqueous, ethanol and peptides extracts also exhibited antioxidant activities. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that APM possessed good antibacterial and antioxidant activities following extraction with different solvents. The results suggest that APM provide a new source with antibacterial agents and antioxidant activity for nutraceutical or medical applications.
TI  - A one-pot system for production of L-2-aminobutyric acid from L-threonine by L-threonine deaminase and a NADH-regeneration system based on L-leucine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase.
AB  - L-2-Aminobutyric acid (L-ABA) is an unnatural amino acid that is a key intermediate for the synthesis of several important drugs. It can be produced by transaminase or dehydrogenase from alpha-ketobutyric acid, which can be synthesized enzymatically from the bulk amino acid, L-threonine. Deamination of L-threonine followed by a hydrogenation reaction gave almost the theoretical yield and was estimated to be more cost-effective than the established chemical process. L-Threonine deaminase from Escherichia coli, L-leucine dehydrogenase from Bacillus cereus, and formate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas sp. were over-expressed in E. coli and used for one-pot production of L-ABA with formate as a co-substrate for NADH regeneration. 30 mol L-threonine were converted to 29.2 mol L-ABA at 97.3 % of theoretical yield and with productivity of 6.37 g l(-1) h(-1) at 50 l. This process offers a promising approach to fulfil industrial requirements for L-ABA.
TI  - Effects of Aronia melanocarpa constituents on biofilm formation of Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Many bacteria growing on surfaces form biofilms. Adaptive and genetic changes of  the microorganisms in this structure make them resistant to antimicrobial agents. Biofilm-forming organisms on medical devices can pose serious threats to human health. Thus, there is a need for novel prevention and treatment strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of Aronia melanocarpa extracts, subfractions and compounds to prevent biofilm formation and to inhibit bacterial growth of Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus in vitro. It was found that several aronia substances possessed anti-biofilm activity, however, they were not toxic to the species screened. This non-toxic inhibition may confer a lower potential for resistance development compared to conventional antimicrobials.
TI  - Identification of 3-sulfinopropionyl coenzyme A (CoA) desulfinases within the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase superfamily.
AB  - In a previous study, the essential role of 3-sulfinopropionyl coenzyme A (3SP-CoA) desulfinase acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acd) in Advenella mimigardefordensis strain DPN7(T) (AcdDPN7) during degradation of 3,3'-dithiodipropionic acid (DTDP) was elucidated. DTDP is a sulfur-containing precursor substrate for biosynthesis of polythioesters (PTEs). AcdDPN7 showed high amino acid sequence similarity to acyl-CoA dehydrogenases but was unable to catalyze a dehydrogenation reaction. Hence, it was investigated in the present study whether 3SP-CoA desulfinase activity is an uncommon or a widespread property within the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase superfamily. Therefore, proteins of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase superfamily from Advenella kashmirensis WT001, Bacillus cereus DSM31, Cupriavidus necator N-1, Escherichia coli BL21, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Burkholderia xenovorans LB400, Ralstonia eutropha H16, Variovorax paradoxus B4, Variovorax paradoxus S110, and Variovorax paradoxus TBEA6 were expressed in E. coli strains. All purified acyl-CoA dehydrogenases appeared as homotetramers, as revealed by size exclusion chromatography. AcdS110, AcdB4, AcdH16, and AcdKT2440 were able to dehydrogenate isobutyryl-CoA. AcdKT2440 additionally dehydrogenated butyryl-CoA and valeryl-CoA, whereas AcdDSM31 dehydrogenated only butyryl-CoA and valeryl-CoA. No dehydrogenation reactions were observed with propionyl-CoA, isovaleryl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, and glutaryl-CoA for any of the investigated acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Only AcdTBEA6, AcdN-1, and AcdLB400 desulfinated 3SP-CoA and were thus identified as 3SP-CoA desulfinases within the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family, although none of these three Acds dehydrogenated any of the tested acyl-CoA thioesters. No appropriate substrates were identified for AcdBL21 and AcdWT001. Spectrophotometric assays provided apparent Km and Vmax values for active substrates and indicated the applicability of phylogenetic analyses to predict the substrate range of uncharacterized acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Furthermore, C. necator N-1 was found to utilize 3SP as the sole source of carbon and energy.
TI  - A large outbreak of salmonellosis associated with sandwiches contaminated with multiple bacterial pathogens purchased via an online shopping service.
AB  - Food sold over the internet is an emerging business that also presents a concern  with regard to food safety. A nationwide foodborne disease outbreak associated with sandwiches purchased from an online shop in July 2010 is reported. Consumers were telephone interviewed with a structured questionnaire and specimens were collected for etiological examination. A total of 886 consumers were successfully contacted and completed the questionnaires; 36.6% had become ill, with a median incubation period of 18 h (range, 6-66 h). The major symptoms included diarrhea (89.2%), abdominal pain (69.8%), fever (47.5%), headache (32.7%), and vomiting (17.3%). Microbiological laboratories isolated Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Salmonella Virchow, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli from the contaminated sandwiches, Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Virchow from the patients, and Salmonella Enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus from food handlers. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis genotyping suggested a common origin of Salmonella bacteria recovered from the patients, food, and a food handler. Among the pathogens detected, the symptoms and incubation period indicated that Salmonella, likely of egg origin, was the probable causative agent of the outbreak. This outbreak illustrates the importance of meticulous hygiene practices during food preparation and temperature control during food shipment and the food safety challenges posed by online food-shopping services.
TI  - [Diagnosis and control of human food poisoning outbreaks].
AB  - Medical microbiology laboratories play a key role in the investigation of foodborne disease outbreaks. Bacterial pathogens (Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, etc) have historically been implicated in foodborne illness, while the role of viruses (especially Norovirus) appears to have been underestimated. Culture-based diagnosis has gradually been complemented, or replaced, by rapid molecular methods applied directly to biological samples. These new tools should help to reduce the number of outbreaks in which the etiological agent goes unidentified, and to improve the exhaustiveness of notifications.
TI  - The long-term effects of phage concentration on the inhibition of planktonic bacterial cultures.
AB  - Since the early 1920s there has been an interest in using bacteriophages (phages) for the control of bacterial pathogens. While there are many factors that have limited the success of phage bio-control, one particular problem is the variability of outcomes between phages and bacteria. Specifically, there is a significant need for a better understanding of how initial phage concentrations affect long-term bacterial inhibition. In work reported herein three phages were isolated for Escherichia coli K12, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, as well as Bacillus cereus and bio-control experiments were performed with phage concentrations ranging from 10(5) to 10(8) plaque forming units per mL over the course of 72 h. For four of the nine phages isolated there was a linear relationship between inhibition and phage concentration, suggesting the effect of phage concentration is important at longer time scales. For three of the isolated phages, phage concentrations had no effect on bacterial inhibition suggesting that even at the lowest concentration the method of action was saturated and lower concentrations might still be effective. Additionally, a cocktail was created and was compared to the previously isolated phages. There was no statistical difference between the cocktail and the best performing phage highlighting the importance of selecting the appropriate phages for treatment. These results suggest that, for certain phages, there is a strong relationship between phage concentration and long-term bacterial growth inhibition and the initial phage concentration is an important indicator of the long-term outcome.
TI  - Crystal structure of Bacillus cereus class Ib ribonucleotide reductase di-iron NrdF in complex with NrdI.
AB  - Class Ib ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) use a dimetal-tyrosyl radical (Y*) cofactor in their NrdF (beta2) subunit to initiate ribonucleotide reduction in the NrdE (alpha2) subunit. Contrary to the diferric tyrosyl radical (Fe(III)2-Y*) cofactor, which can self-assemble from Fe(II)2-NrdF and O2, generation of the Mn(III)2-Y* cofactor requires the reduced form of a flavoprotein, NrdIhq, and O2 for its assembly. Here we report the 1.8 A resolution crystal structure of Bacillus cereus Fe2-NrdF in complex with NrdI. Compared to the previously solved Escherichia coli NrdI-Mn(II)2-NrdF structure, NrdI and NrdF binds similarly in Bacillus cereus through conserved core interactions. This protein-protein association seems to be unaffected by metal ion type bound in the NrdF subunit. The Bacillus cereus Mn(II)2-NrdF and Fe2-NrdF structures, also presented here, show conformational flexibility of residues surrounding the NrdF metal ion site. The movement of one of the metal-coordinating carboxylates is linked to the metal type present at the dimetal site and not associated with NrdI-NrdF binding. This carboxylate conformation seems to be vital for the water network connecting the NrdF dimetal site and the flavin in NrdI. From these observations, we suggest that metal-dependent variations in carboxylate coordination geometries are important for active Y* cofactor generation in class Ib RNRs. Additionally, we show that binding of NrdI to NrdF would structurally interfere with the suggested alpha2beta2 (NrdE-NrdF) holoenzyme formation, suggesting the potential requirement for NrdI dissociation before NrdE-NrdF assembly after NrdI-activation. The mode of interactions between the proteins involved in the class Ib RNR system is, however, not fully resolved.
TI  - Isolation and identification of a new intracellular antimicrobial peptide produced by Paenibacillus alvei AN5.
AB  - A wild-type, Gram-positive, rod-shaped, endospore-forming and motile bacteria has been isolated from palm oil mill sludge in Malaysia. Molecular identification using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the bacteria belonged to genus Paenibacillus. With 97 % similarity to P. alvei (AUG6), the isolate was designated as P. alvei AN5. An antimicrobial compound was extracted from P. alvei AN5-pelleted cells using 95 % methanol and was then lyophilized. Precipitates were re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), producing an antimicrobial crude extract (ACE). The ACE showed antimicrobial activity against Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076, Escherichia coli ATCC 29522, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 and Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014. By using SP-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography, Sephadex G-25 gel filtration and Tricine SDS-PAGE, the ACE was purified, which produced a ~2-kDa active band. SDS-PAGE and infrared (IR) spectroscopy indicated the proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial compound in the ACE, and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy and de novo sequencing using an automatic, Q-TOF premier system detected a peptide with the amino acid sequence F-C-K-S-L-P-L-P-L-S-V-K (1,330.7789 Da). This novel peptide was designated as AN5-2. The antimicrobial peptide exhibited stability from pH 3 to 12 and maintained its activity after being heated to 90 degrees C. It also remained active after incubation with denaturants (urea, SDS and EDTA).
TI  - Novel highly thermostable endolysin from Thermus scotoductus MAT2119 bacteriophage Ph2119 with amino acid sequence similarity to eukaryotic peptidoglycan recognition proteins.
AB  - In this study, we present the discovery and characterization of a highly thermostable endolysin from bacteriophage Ph2119 infecting Thermus strain MAT2119 isolated from geothermal areas in Iceland. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene affiliated the strain with the species Thermus scotoductus. Bioinformatics analysis has allowed identification in the genome of phage 2119 of an open reading frame (468 bp in length) coding for a 155-amino-acid basic protein with an Mr of 17,555. Ph2119 endolysin does not resemble any known thermophilic phage lytic enzymes. Instead, it has conserved amino acid residues (His(30), Tyr(58), His(132), and Cys(140)) that form a Zn(2+) binding site characteristic of T3 and T7 lysozymes, as well as eukaryotic peptidoglycan recognition proteins, which directly bind to, but also may destroy, bacterial peptidoglycan. The purified enzyme shows high lytic activity toward thermophiles, i.e., T. scotoductus (100%), Thermus thermophilus (100%), and Thermus flavus (99%), and also, to a lesser extent, toward mesophilic Gram-negative bacteria, i.e., Escherichia coli (34%), Serratia marcescens (28%), Pseudomonas fluorescens (13%), and Salmonella enterica serovar Panama (10%). The enzyme has shown no activity against a number of Gram-positive bacteria analyzed, with the exception of Deinococcus radiodurans (25%) and Bacillus cereus (15%). Ph2119 endolysin was found to be highly thermostable: it retains approximately 87% of its lytic activity after 6 h of incubation at 95 degrees C. The optimum temperature range for the enzyme activity is 50 degrees C to 78 degrees C. The enzyme exhibits lytic activity in the pH range of 6 to 10 (maximum at pH 7.5 to 8.0) and is also active in the presence of up to 500 mM NaCl.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activities of Leaf Extracts of Guava (Psidium guajava L.) on Two Gram-Negative and Gram-Positive Bacteria.
AB  - Aim. To determine the antimicrobial potential of guava (Psidium guajava) leaf extracts against two gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis) and two gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) which are some of foodborne and spoilage bacteria. The guava leaves were extracted in four different solvents of increasing polarities (hexane, methanol, ethanol, and water). The efficacy of these extracts was tested against those bacteria through a well-diffusion method employing 50 mu L leaf-extract solution per well. According to the findings of the antibacterial assay, the methanol and ethanol extracts of the guava leaves showed inhibitory activity against gram-positive bacteria, whereas the gram-negative bacteria were resistant to all the solvent extracts. The methanol extract had an antibacterial activity with mean zones of inhibition of 8.27 and 12.3 mm, and the ethanol extract had a mean zone of inhibition of 6.11 and 11.0 mm against B. cereus and S. aureus, respectively. On the basis of the present finding, guava leaf-extract might be a good candidate in the search for a natural antimicrobial agent. This study provides scientific understanding to further determine the antimicrobial values and investigate other pharmacological properties.
TI  - Sodium and potassium competition in potassium-selective and non-selective channels.
AB  - Potassium channels selectively conduct K(+), primarily to the exclusion of Na(+), despite the fact that both ions can bind within the selectivity filter. Here we perform crystallographic titration and single-channel electrophysiology to examine the competition of Na(+) and K(+) binding within the filter of two NaK channel mutants; one is the potassium-selective NaK2K mutant and the other is the non-selective NaK2CNG, a CNG channel pore mimic. With high-resolution structures of these engineered NaK channel constructs, we explicitly describe the changes in K(+) occupancy within the filter upon Na(+) competition by anomalous diffraction. Our results demonstrate that the non-selective NaK2CNG still retains a K(+)-selective site at equilibrium, whereas the NaK2K channel filter maintains two high-affinity K(+) sites. A double-barrier mechanism is proposed to explain K(+) channel selectivity at low K(+) concentrations.
TI  - Effect of different in vitro culture extracts of black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) on toxic metabolites-producing strains.
AB  - In the present study, the effect of different in vitro cultures (callus, in vitro shoots) and commercially available peppercorn extract was investigated for its activity against toxic metabolite-producing strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Salmonella typhi, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans). These in vitro cultures were extracted with ethanol, hexane, and chloroform, and the antipathogenic activity was determined by well-diffusion method. Hexane extract of callus showed 22 mm zone of inhibition against B. cereus, 23 mm against S. aureus, while regenerated shoots and seeds have shown 24.3 and 26 mm zones of inhibition. The ethanolic extracts of regenerated Piper shoots have shown 25 mm activity against S. aureus, 21 mm against B. cereus, and 16 mm in the case of C. albicans in comparison with standard antibiotics. Peppercorn extracts in chloroform and ethanol had shown activities against B. cereus (23.6 mm) and B. subtilis (23.5 mm). During in vitro organogenesis and morphogenesis, cells and tissues produced a comparable phytochemicals profile like mother plant. Morphogenesis is critically controlled by the application of exogenous plant-growth regulators. Such addition alters the hormonal transduction pathways, and cells under in vitro conditions regenerate tissues, which are dependant on the physiological state of cells, and finally enhance the production of secondary metabolites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to compare the antimicrobial potential of in vitro regenerated tissues and peppercorn with standard antibiotics. In conclusion, most of the extracts showed pronounced activities against all the pathogenic microbes. This is a preliminary work, and the minimum inhibitory concentration values needs to be further explored. Regenerated tissues of P. nigrum are a good source of biologically active metabolites for antimicrobial activities, and callus culture presented itself as a good candidate for such activities.
TI  - Development of new active packaging film made from a soluble soybean polysaccharide incorporated Zataria multiflora Boiss and Mentha pulegium essential oils.
AB  - An active edible film from soluble soybean polysaccharide (SSPS) incorporated with different concentrations of Zataria multiflora Boiss (ZEO) and Mentha pulegium (MEO) essential oils was developed, and the film's optical, wettability, thermal, total phenol and antioxidant characteristics were investigated, along with their antimicrobial effectiveness against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. The film's colour became darker and more yellowish and had a lower gloss as the levels of ZEO or MEO were increased. Antioxidant activity of the films was determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and ferric-reducing antioxidant power assays. DPPH was reduced in the range of 19.84-74.12% depending on the essential oil type and concentration. Film incorporated with 3% (v/v) ZEO showed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (IC50=4188.60+/-21.73mg/l and EC50=8.86+/-0.09mg/ml, respectively), compared with the control and MEO added film. Films containing ZEO were more effective against the tested bacteria than those containing MEO. S. aureus was found to be the most sensitive bacterium to both ZEO or MEO, followed by B. cereus and E. coli. A highest inhibition zone of 387.05mm(2) was observed for S. aureus around the films incorporated with 3% (v/v) ZEO. The total inhibitory zone of 3% (v/v) MEO formulated films was 21.98 for S. typhimurium and 10.15mm(2) for P. aeruginosa. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis revealed a single glass transition temperature (Tg) between 16 and 31 degrees C. The contact angle increased up to 175% and 38% as 3% (v/v) of ZEO or MEO used: it clearly shows that films with ZEO were more hydrophobic than those with MEO. The results showed that these two essential oils could be incorporated into SSPS films for food packaging.
TI  - Potential cellular targets and antibacterial efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma.
AB  - Atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (APNTP) has been gaining increasing interest as a new alternative antibacterial approach. Although this approach has demonstrated promising antibacterial activity, its exact mechanism of action remains unclear. Mechanistic elucidation of the antimicrobial activity will facilitate development and rational optimisation of this approach for potential medical applications. In this study, the antibacterial efficacy of an in-house-built APNTP jet was evaluated alongside an investigation of the interactions between APNTP and major cellular components in order to identify the potential cellular targets involved in plasma-mediated bacterial destruction mechanisms. The investigated plasma jet exhibited excellent, rapid antibacterial activity against a selected panel of clinically significant bacterial species including Bacillus cereus, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of which were completely inactivated within 2 min of plasma exposure. Plasma-mediated damaging effects were observed, to varying degrees, on all of the investigated cellular components including DNA, a model protein enzyme, and lipid membrane integrity and permeability. The antibacterial efficacy of APNTP appears to involve a multiple-target mechanism, which potentially reduces the likelihood of emergence of microbial resistance towards this promising antimicrobial approach. However, cellular membrane damage and resulting permeability perturbation was found to be the most likely rate-determining step in this mechanism.
TI  - Volatile analysis and antimicrobial screening of the parasitic plant Cuscuta reflexa Roxb. from Nepal.
AB  - The essential oil from the parasitic vine Cuscuta reflexa Roxb., collected from Kirtipur, Kathmandu, Nepal, was obtained by hydrodistillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. From a total of 62 peaks, 61 compounds were identified in the oil, accounting for 99.6% of the oil. The majority of the essential oil was dominated by the relatively rare component cis-3-butyl-4-vinylcyclopentane (26.4%). The oil also contained substantial amounts of limonene (5.1%) and (E)-nerolidol (9.5%). Biological screening for antimicrobial activities did not show appreciable activity against either Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) or Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. However, marginal activity against Aspergillus niger was observed (minimum inhibitory concentration = 313 mug/mL).
TI  - Comparison of antibacterial activity of Ag nanoparticles synthesized from leaf extract of Parthenium hystrophorus L in aqueous media and Gentamicin sulphate: in-vitro.
AB  - Monodisperse silver (Ag) nanoparticles were synthesized by using Parthenium hystrophorus L leaf extract in aqueous media. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by using UV-vis spectrophotometer, X-ray diffracto-meter (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and dynamics light scattering (DLS). Size-dependent antibacterial activities of Ag nanoparticles were tested against Gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus. Ag nanoparticles having 20 +/- 2 nm size in diameter show maximum zone of inhibition (23 +/- 2.2 mm) in comparison to 40 nm and 70 nm diameter nanoparticles for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The zone of inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus were 19 +/- 1.8 mm, 15 +/- 1.5 mm and 11 +/- 1 mm for 20 nm, 40 nm, and 70 nm, respectively. In addition, affect of concentration of 20 nm size Ag nanoparticles on Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus species were also reported and results were compared with 10 microg/ml dose of Gentamicin sulphate. The Parthenium hystrophorus L leaf extract capped 20 +/- 2 nm Ag nanoparticles (7.5 microg/ml) shows statistically significant antibacterial activity than Gentamicin sulphate (10 microg/ml) against Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Functional role of the MrpA- and MrpD-homologous protein subunits in enzyme complexes evolutionary related to respiratory chain complex I.
AB  - NADH:quinone oxidoreductase or complex I is a large membrane bound enzyme complex that has evolved from the combination of smaller functional building blocks. Intermediate size enzyme complexes exist in nature that comprise some, but not all of the protein subunits in full size 14-subunit complex I. The membrane spanning complex I subunits NuoL, NuoM and NuoN are homologous to each other and to two proteins from one particular class of Na(+)/H(+) antiporters, denoted MrpA and MrpD. In complex I, these ion transporter protein subunits are prime candidates for harboring important parts of the proton pumping machinery. Using a model system, consisting of Bacillus subtilis MrpA and MrpD deletion strains and a low copy expression plasmid, it was recently demonstrated that NuoN can rescue the strain deleted for MrpD but not that deleted for MrpA, whereas the opposite tendency was seen for NuoL. This demonstrated that the MrpA-type and MrpD-type proteins have unique functional specializations. In this work, the corresponding antiporter-like protein subunits from the smaller enzymes evolutionarily related to complex I were tested in the same model system. The subunits from 11-subunit complex I from Bacillus cereus behaved essentially as those from full size complex I, corroborating that this enzyme should be regarded as a bona fide complex I. The hydrogenase-3 and hydrogenase-4 antiporter-like proteins on the other hand, could substitute equally well for MrpA or MrpD at pH7.4, suggesting that these enzymes have intermediate forms of the antiporter-like proteins, which seemingly lack the functional specificity.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of polyhalobenzonitrile quinazolin-4(3H)-one derivatives.
AB  - A novel series of polyhalobenzonitrile quinazolin-4(3H)-one derivatives were synthesized and characterized by NMR, IR, MS, and HRMS spectra. All of the newly prepared compounds were screened for antimicrobial activities against four strains of bacteria (Gram-positive bacterial: Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus; Gram-negative bacterial: Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and one strain of fungi (Candida albicans). Among the synthesized compounds, 5-(dimethylamino)-8-(2,4,5-trichloro-isophthalonitrile) quinazolin-4(3H)-one (7k) exhibited significant activity towards Gram-positive bacterial, Gram-negative bacterial, and the fungi strains. The MIC (0.8-3.3mug/mL) and MBC (2.6-7.8mug/mL) for this compound were close to those of nofloxacin, chlorothalonil, and fluconazole, making it the most potent antimicrobial agents in the series.
TI  - Chemical composition and biological activity of the essential oil from leaves of  Moringa oleifera Lam. cultivated in Mozambique.
AB  - The antioxidant capacity and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Moringa oleifera (Moringaceae) grown in Mozambique was investigated. The chemical composition was studied by means of GC and GC-MS analysis. Hexacosane (13.9%), pentacosane (13.3%) and heptacosane (11.4%) were the main components. Ultra High Performance Chromatography-DAD analysis detected the flavonoids quercetin (126 mug/g) and luteolin (6.2 mug/g). The essential oil exhibited a relatively low free radical scavenging capacity. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil was assayed against two Gram-positive strains (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus), two Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and five fungal strains of agro-food interest (Penicillium aurantiogriseum, Penicillium expansum, Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium digitatum, and Aspergillus niger spp.). B. cereus and P. aeruginosa, as well as the fungal strains were sensitive to the essential oil.
TI  - Durable contact active antimicrobial materials formed by a one-step covalent modification of polyvinyl alcohol, cellulose and glass surfaces.
AB  - In this work we have applied a direct covalent linkage of quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) to prepare a series of contact active antimicrobial surfaces based on widely utilized materials. Formation of antimicrobial polyvinyl alcohol (PVA-QAS), cellulose (cellulose-QAS) and glass (glass-QAS) surfaces was achieved by one step synthesis with no auxiliary linkers. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed tridentate binding mode of the antimicrobial agent. The antimicrobial activity of the prepared materials was tested on Bacillus cereus, Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Active site density of the modified materials was examined and found to correlate with their antimicrobial activity. Stability studies at different pH values and temperatures confirmed that the linkage of the bioactive moiety to the surface is robust and resistant to a range of pH and temperatures. Prolonged long-term effectiveness of the contact active materials was demonstrated by their repeated usage, without loss of the antimicrobial efficacy.
TI  - pGIAK1, a heavy metal resistant plasmid from an obligate alkaliphilic and halotolerant bacterium isolated from the Antarctic Concordia station confined environment.
AB  - pGIAK1 is a 38-kb plasmid originating from the obligate alkaliphilic and halotolerant Bacillaceae strain JMAK1. The strain was originally isolated from the confined environments of the Antarctic Concordia station. Analysis of the pGIAK1 38,362-bp sequence revealed that, in addition to its replication region, this plasmid contains the genetic determinants for cadmium and arsenic resistances, putative methyltransferase, tyrosine recombinase, spore coat protein and potassium transport protein, as well as several hypothetical proteins. Cloning the pGIAK1 cad operon in Bacillus cereus H3081.97 and its ars operon in Bacillus subtilis 1A280 conferred to these hosts cadmium and arsenic resistances, respectively, therefore confirming their bona fide activities. The pGIAK1 replicon region was also shown to be functional in Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, but was only stably maintained in B. subtilis. Finally, using an Escherichia coli - B. thuringiensis shuttle BAC vector, pGIAK1 was shown to display conjugative properties since it was able to transfer the BAC plasmid among B. thuringiensis strains.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of novel organocobaloximes as potential catecholase and antimicrobial activity agents.
AB  - An asymmetric, potentially bidentate dioxime ligand (H(2)L) was formed by condensation of 4-biphenylchloroglyoxime and napthyl-1-amine. Two equivalents of H(2)L were reacted with CoCl(2) . 6H(2)O under appropriate conditions with deprotonation of the dioxime ligand. A series of new organocobaloxime derivatives of the type [CoR(HL)(2)Py], [CoRL(2)PyB(2)F(4)], and [CoRL(2)Py(Cu(phen))(2)] (H(2)L = 4-(napthyl-1-amino)biphenylglyoxime; phen = 1,10-phenathroline; R = izopropyl and benzyl; Py = pyridine) were synthesized. The products were characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductance, FT-IR, (1)H NMR, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Catecholase-like activity properties of all complexes were also studied. All complexes are catalysts for the oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol to 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone in methanol. Antimicrobial activity studies of H(2)L and the six complexes were carried out on standard strains (human pathogenic) of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudominas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi) and the yeast Candida albicans. The compounds showed a significant inhibition of the growth of the Gram-positive bacteria tested. Among the tested microorganisms, S. aureus was the most sensitive strain, especially to H(2)L and its complexes.
TI  - YaxAB, a Yersinia enterocolitica pore-forming toxin regulated by RovA.
AB  - The transcriptional regulator RovA positively regulates transcription of the Yersinia enterocolitica virulence gene inv. Invasin, encoded by inv, is important for establishment of Y. enterocolitica infection. However, a rovA mutant is more attenuated for virulence than an inv mutant, implying that RovA regulates additional virulence genes. When the Y. enterocolitica RovA regulon was defined by microarray analysis, YE1984 and YE1985 were among the genes identified as being upregulated by RovA. Since these genes are homologous to Xenorhabdus nematophila cytotoxin genes xaxA and xaxB, we named them yaxA and yaxB, respectively. In this work, we demonstrate the effects of YaxAB on the course of infection in the murine model. While a yaxAB mutant (DeltayaxAB) is capable of colonizing mice at the same level as the wild type, it slightly delays the course of infection and results in differing pathology in the spleen. Further, we found that yaxAB encode a probable cytotoxin capable of lysing mammalian cells, that both YaxA and YaxB are required for cytotoxic activity, and that the two proteins associate. YaxAB-mediated cell death occurs via osmotic lysis through the formation of distinct membrane pores. In silico tertiary structural analysis identified predicted structural homology between YaxA and proteins in pore-forming toxin complexes from Bacillus cereus (HBL-B) and Escherichia coli (HlyE). Thus, it appears that YaxAB function as virulence factors by inducing cell lysis through the formation of pores in the host cell membrane. This characterization of YaxAB supports the hypothesis that RovA regulates expression of multiple virulence factors in Y. enterocolitica.
TI  - Metal based pharmacologically active agents: synthesis, structural characterization, molecular modeling, CT-DNA binding studies and in vitro antimicrobial screening of iron(II) bromosalicylidene amino acid chelates.
AB  - In recent years, great interest has been focused on Fe(II) Schiff base amino acid complexes as cytotoxic and antitumor drugs. Thus a series of new iron(II) complexes based on Schiff bases amino acids ligands have been designed and synthesized from condensation of 5-bromosalicylaldehyde (bs) and alpha-amino acids (L-alanine (ala), L-phenylalanine (phala), L-aspartic acid (aspa), L-histidine (his) and L-arginine (arg)). The structure of the investigated iron(II) complexes was elucidated using elemental analyses, infrared, ultraviolet-visible, thermogravimetric analysis, as well as conductivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Moreover, the stoichiometry and the stability constants of the prepared complexes have been determined spectrophotometrically. The results suggest that 5-bromosalicylaldehyde amino acid Schiff bases (bs:aa) behave as dibasic tridentate ONO ligands and coordinate to Fe(II) in octahedral geometry according to the general formula [Fe(bs:aa)2].nH2O. The conductivity values between 37 and 64 ohm(-1) mol(-1) cm(2) in ethanol imply the presence of nonelectrolyte species. The structure of the complexes was validated using quantum mechanics calculations based on accurate DFT methods. Geometry optimization of the Fe-Schiff base amino acid complexes showed that all complexes had octahedral coordination. In addition, the interaction of these complexes with (CT-DNA) was investigated at pH=7.2, by using UV-vis absorption, viscosity and agarose gel electrophoresis measurements. Results indicated that the investigated complexes strongly bind to calf thymus DNA via intercalative mode and showed a different DNA binding according to the sequence: bsari>bshi>bsali>bsasi>bsphali. Moreover, the prepared compounds are screened for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity against three types of bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus and three types of anti fungal cultures, Penicillium purpurogenium, Aspergillus flavus and Trichotheium rosium. The results of these studies indicated that the metal complexes exhibit a stronger antibacterial and antifungal efficiency than their corresponding Schiff base amino acid ligands.
TI  - Synthesis, Spectral, and In Vitro Antibacterial Studies of Organosilicon(IV) Complexes with Schiff Bases Derived from Amino Acids.
AB  - The present work stems from our interest in the synthesis, characterization, and  antibacterial evaluation of organosilicon(IV) complexes of a class of amino-acid-based Schiff base which have been prepared by the interaction of ethoxytrimethylsilane with the Schiff bases (N OH) in 1 : 1 molar ratio. These complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductance, and spectroscopic studies including electronic IR and NMR ((1)H, (13)C, and (29)Si) spectroscopy. The analytical and spectral data suggest trigonal bipyramidal geometry around the silicon atom in the resulting complexes. The ligands and their organosilicon complexes have also been evaluated for in vitro antimicrobial activity against bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Nocardia spp., E. aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Staphylococcus spp.). The complexes were found to be more potent as compared to the ligands.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated Bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
AB  - The cell free culture filtrate of Bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. The structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (FABMS, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (1)H-(1)H COSY, (1)H-(13)C HMBC) and Marfey's method. The compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (CDPs): cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp), cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val), cyclo(D-Pro-D-Met), and cyclo(D-Pro-D-Phe), respectively. Compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus) except cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val). Cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val) recorded activity only against Gram positive bacteria. Best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against S. aureus (4 mug/ml). The four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (Trichophyton rubrum, Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin B, the standard fungicide. The highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) was recorded against T. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. The activity of cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against T. rubrum, C. neoformans and C. albicans were better than amphotericin B, the standard antifungal agent. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of CDPs against the human pathogenic fungi T. rubrum and C. neoformans. The four CDPs are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. We conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - The diversity and antimicrobial activity of Preussia sp. endophytes isolated from Australian dry rainforests.
AB  - Limited knowledge currently exists regarding species diversity and antimicrobial  activity of endophytic isolates of Preussia within Australia. This report describes endophytic Preussia species that were identified through molecular analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region. Screening for antimicrobial secondary metabolites was determined by testing crude ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts derived from fungal mycelia against a panel of ATCC type strains which included Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the opportunist yeast pathogen Candida albicans. Subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography generated fractions of bioactive EtOAc extracts which were subject to confirmatory testing using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference microdilution antimicrobial activity assay. A total of 18 Preussia were isolated from nine host plants with 6/18 having a <97 % sequence similarity to other known species in Genbank, suggesting that they are new species. In preliminary screening, 13/18 Preussia isolates revealed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes tested, whilst 6/18 isolates, including 4/6 putative new species showed specific antimicrobial activity against MRSA and C. albicans. These results highlight the antimicrobial potential of Australian Preussia spp. and also the importance of Australian dry rainforests as an untapped repository of potentially significant bioactive compounds.
TI  - Three different bacterial detection systems for platelet concentrates under inter-laboratory conditions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A variety of screening methods are currently used worldwide in order  to decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted sepsis and improve the safety of PCs. METHODS/MATERIALS: PCs inoculated with five different transfusion-relevant species of bacteria at concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 colony-forming units (CFU)ml(-1) were stored at 22 degrees C for 7 days. Flow cytometry (FACS), BacT/Alert automated culturing, and a quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) were then used to detect the presence of bacteria in samples prepared from these PCs. RESULTS: At the initial spiking concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 CFU ml(-1), Q-PCR detected all five bacterial species tested. Screening with the BacT/Alert culture-based system allowed bacterial detection (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 15.13 h for all three spiking concentrations. Using FACS, positive signals were obtained for all three concentrations of Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus on day 1 and for initial spiking concentrations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus of 1 CFU ml(-1) on day 2. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, detection of an initial inoculum of 1 CFU ml(-1) was possible only beginning on day 6. CONCLUSION: This study shows that under standard laboratory conditions the sensitivity of FACS in the detection of bacterial contamination of PCs was lower than that of either the BacT/Alert automated culturing method or Q-PCR.
TI  - Antioxidative, antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of the phenolics of Leea indica leaf extract.
AB  - This study investigated the phytochemical, antioxidative, antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of Leea indica leaf ethanol extract. Phytochemical values namely total phenolic and flavonoid contents, total antioxidant capacity, DPPH radical scavenging effect, FeCl3 reducing power, DMSO superoxide scavenging effect and Iron chelating effects were studied by established methods. Antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic effects were screened by disk diffusion technique, food poison technique and brine shrimp bioassay, respectively. Results showed the total phenolic content 24.00 +/- 0.81 g GAE/100 g, total flavonoid content 194.68 +/- 2.43 g quercetin/100 g and total antioxidant capacity 106.61 +/- 1.84 g AA/100 g dry extract. Significant (P < 0.05) IC50 values compared to respective standards were recorded in DPPH radical scavenging (139.83 +/- 1.40 mug/ml), FeCl3 reduction (16.48 +/- 0.64 mug/ml), DMSO superoxide scavenging (676.08 +/- 5.80 mug/ml) and Iron chelating (519.33 +/- 16.96 mug/ml) methods. In antibacterial screening, the extract showed significant (P < 0.05) zone of inhibitions compared to positive controls Ampicillin and Tetracycline against Gram positive Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, and Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negative Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, and Escherichia coli. Significant minimum inhibitory concentrations compared to tetracycline were obtained against the above organisms. In antifungal assay, the extract inhibited the growth of Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans and Fusarium equisetii by 38.09 +/- 0.59, 22.58 +/- 2.22, and 22.58 +/- 2.22%, respectively. The extract showed a significant LC50 value compared to vincristine sulfate in cytotoxic assay. The results evidenced the potential antioxidative, antimicrobial and cytotoxic capacities of Leea inidica leaf extract to be processed for pharmaceutical use.
TI  - Isolation and screening of bioactive principle from Chaetomorpha antennina against certain bacterial strains.
AB  - Microbial pathogens develop resistance to a particular antibiotic after repeated  administration during the treatment of infectious diseases. Moreover, multiple drug resistance is a very common problem especially in hospital acquired infections. Therefore, it is necessary to find out alternative antibacterial drugs and the present trend is focused on seaweeds. This preliminary research work was carried out to find out the antibacterial activity of petroleum ether extract of Chaetomorpha antennina. The extracts were tested against Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 121, Bacillus cereus MTCC 492, Bacillus subtilis MTCC 441, Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 530, Escherichia coli MTCC 443 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 779 by agar well diffusion technique. It was observed that petroleum ether extract showed prominent zone of inhibition against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus even at 50 mug/ml concentration. The maximum spectrum of activity was observed against Staphylococcus aureus ranged from 7.3 +/- 0.8 to 18 +/- 2.4 mm at the concentration 50 to 500 mug/ml, respectively. Hence the most susceptible bacterium was Staphylococcus aureus among the tested organisms. However, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are also susceptible. But the Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella pneumoniae are resistant against the tested extract.
TI  - A product of heme catabolism modulates bacterial function and survival.
AB  - Bilirubin is the terminal metabolite in heme catabolism in mammals. After deposition into bile, bilirubin is released in large quantities into the mammalian gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We hypothesized that intestinal bilirubin may modulate the function of enteric bacteria. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of bilirubin on two enteric pathogens; enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), a Gram-negative that causes life-threatening intestinal infections, and E. faecalis, a Gram-positive human commensal bacterium known to be an opportunistic pathogen with broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance. We demonstrate that bilirubin can protect EHEC from exogenous and host-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the absorption of free radicals. In contrast, E. faecalis was highly susceptible to bilirubin, which causes significant membrane disruption and uncoupling of respiratory metabolism in this bacterium. Interestingly, similar results were observed for other Gram-positive bacteria, including B. cereus and S. aureus. A model is proposed whereby bilirubin places distinct selective pressure on enteric bacteria, with Gram-negative bacteria being protected from ROS (positive outcome) and Gram-positive bacteria being susceptible to membrane disruption (negative outcome). This work suggests bilirubin has differential but biologically relevant effects on bacteria and justifies additional efforts to determine the role of this neglected waste catabolite in disease processes, including animal models.
TI  - Enhanced antimicrobial activity of peptide-cocktails against common bacterial contaminants of ex vivo stored platelets.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of blood components such as ex vivo-stored platelets is a major safety risk in transfusion medicine. We have recently shown that synthetic antimicrobial peptides named PD1-PD4 derived from the thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins, and repeats of Arg-Trp (RW1-RW5) demonstrate microbicidal activity against selected bacteria and viruses. In the present study, we selected PD3, PD4, RW2, RW3 and RW4 and evaluated each individual peptide and their various combinations to see whether the cocktail regimen enhances the antimicrobial activity above and over the individual peptides. Stored platelet or plasma samples spiked with known titres of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus cereus were treated with either individual peptides or with peptides in various combinations. Analyses revealed that individual peptides show moderate microbicidal activity (10- to 100-fold reduction) against the tested bacteria relative to their combined regimen. The peptide combinations (RW2 + RW4, RW2 + RW3 + RW4 and PD4 + RW3 + RW4) on the other hand enhanced the microbicidal activity (c.10 000-fold reduction) and revealed a minimal inhibitory concentration of 5 muM. Time-kill kinetics indicated that these three peptide combinations exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity bringing about a 100-fold reduction of bacterial titres within 20 min of incubation. The present study therefore demonstrates the synergistic effect of antimicrobial peptides when used in combinations and provides a proof-of-concept of its potential application as a molecular tool towards pathogen reduction and further extends the possibility of using peptide combinatorial therapeutics as broad-spectrum antibiotics or as alternatives to combat drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - A concise synthesis and antimicrobial activity of a novel series of naphthylpyridine-3-carbonitrile compounds.
AB  - A novel series of acyclic nucleosides 2-5 and 13a-c were synthesized by utilizing 4-phenyl-6(naphthalen-2-yl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropridine-3-carbonitrile (1) as a key starting material. Chlorination of 1 yielded the chloro analogue 6 that was allowed to react with urea, thiourea, thiosemicarbazide and alicyclic secondary amines to produce the corresponding derivatives 7a-c and 11a-c. Further condensation of 6 with various amino acids provided the compounds 8-10, whereas hydrazinolysis of 6 yielded the hydrazinyl analogue 12 which was condensed with different isothiocyanates and acid anhydrides to afford derivatives 18-20, respectively. Upon treatment of 12 with sodium nitrite, the azide derivative 14 was obtained which was subjected to reaction with various active methylene compounds to obtain the corresponding triazolo derivatives 15-17. The structure assignment of the new compounds is based on chemicaland spectroscopic evidence. Antimicrobial evaluation of the newly synthesized derivatives was performed using ciprofloxacin and fluconazole as reference antibacterial and antifungal drugs. The most effective compounds against the tested bacterial and fungal isolates were the benzothiohydrazide compound 18b followed by the hydrazone and the phthalic anhydride derivatives 13c and 20, respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activity and Phytochemical Constituents of Leaf Extracts of Cassia  auriculata.
AB  - Plants produce a wide variety of phytochemical constituents, which are secondary  metabolites and are used either directly or indirectly in the pharmaceutical industry. 'For centuries, man has effectively used various components of plants or their extracts for the treatment of many diseases, including bacterial infections. In the present study methanol, chloroform and aqueous extracts of Cassia auriculata leaf were subjected for antimicrobial activity by well-diffusion method against six bacterial strains namely Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The results revealed that the methanol and chloroform extracts exhibited strong inhibitory activity against all the tested organisms (zone of inhibition of 12-20 mm), except Pseudomonas aeruginosa (zone of inhibition 10 mm or nil). The aqueous extracts showed moderate activity by 'Zone of inhibition </=12 or nil). The extracts were screened for their phytochemical constituents by standard protocols' and were shown to contain carbohydrates, proteins, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, saponins and tannins. The antibacterial activity of these extracts is possibly linked to the presence of flavonoids, steroid, saponins and/or tannins. Further studies are needed to determine the precise active principles from Cassia auriculata.
TI  - Bioactive metabolites from an endophytic Cryptosporiopsis sp. inhabiting Clidemia hirta.
AB  - An endophytic Cryptosporiopsis sp. was isolated from Clidemia hirta and analyzed  for its secondary metabolites that lead to the isolation of three bioactive molecules. The compounds were purified from the culture broth of the fungus and their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods as (R)-5-hydroxy-2-methylchroman-4-one (1), 1-(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)pentan-1-one (2) and (Z)-1-(2-(2-butyryl-3-hydroxyphenoxy)-6-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxybut-2-en-1-one (3). Compound 1 exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against the human leukemia cell line, HL-60 with an IC50 of 4 mug/ml. This compound induced G2 arrest of the HL-60 cell cycle significantly. In addition, out of these compounds, 2 and 3 were active against several bacterial pathogens. Compound 2 was active against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with IC50 values varying from 18 to 30 mug/ml, and compound 3 displayed activity against Pseudomonas fluorescens with an IC50 value of 6 mug/ml. Compounds 2 and 3 are novel whereas compound 1 was reported earlier but the stereochemistry of its C-2 methyl is established for the first time.
TI  - Bioinert membranes prepared from amphiphilic poly(vinyl chloride)-g-poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) graft copolymers.
AB  - Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) membrane was hydrophilically modified by grafting with poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (POEM) using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The successful grafting of PVC main chain by POEM was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The molecular weight and hydrophilicity of membranes increased with the amount of POEM grafting, as characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and contact angle measurement, respectively. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis revealed the microphase-separated structure of PVC-g-POEM and the domain spacing increased from 59.3 to 86.1 nm with increasing grafting degree. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used for the direct visualization of the mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell and bacteria adhesion on the membrane surface. Protein adsorption and eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell adhesion tests showed that the bioinert properties of membranes were significantly increased with POEM content.
TI  - Anti-biofilm forming and anti-quorum sensing activity of selected essential oils  and their main components on food-related micro-organisms.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of clary sage, juniper, lemon and marjoram essential oils (EOs) and their major components on the formation of bacterial and yeast biofilms and on the inhibition of AHL-mediated quorum sensing (QS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Biofilm formation was measured by crystal violet and resazurin staining, and QS inhibition was detected by paper disc diffusion assay. Marjoram EO inhibited Bacillus cereus, Pichia anomala, Pseudomonas putida and mixed-culture biofilm formation of Ps. putida and Escherichia coli and showed the best QS inhibitor effect on Chromobacterium violaceum. For B. cereus, all components showed better antibiofilm capacity than the parent EOs. Lemon EO inhibited E. coli and mixed-culture biofilms, and cinnamon was effective against the mixed forms. Scanning electron microscopy showed the loss of three-dimensional structures of biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: The EOs and components used seem to be good candidates for prevention of biofilm formation and inhibition of the AHL-mediated QS mechanism. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Biofilm formation on foods and food industrial equipment is a serious problem causing food spoilage and emergence of foodborne diseases. This article highlights the importance of studying EOs as potential disinfectants and food preservatives.
TI  - Growth-inhibitory activity of natural and synthetic isothiocyanates against representative human microbial pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to test the growth inhibition activity of isothiocyanates (ITCs), defence compounds of plants, against common human microbial pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we have tested the growth-inhibitory activity of a diverse collection of new and previously known representative ITCs of various structural classes against pathogenic bacteria, fungi and moulds by a serial dilution method. Generally, the compounds were more active against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi exhibiting species-specific bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect. The most active compounds inhibited the growth of both drug-susceptible and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens at micromolar concentrations. In the case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, some compounds were more active against MDR, rather than against susceptible strains. The average antimicrobial activity for some of the new derivatives was significantly higher than that previously reported for the most active ITC compounds. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) established for various classes of ITC with Bacillus cereus (model organism for B. anthracis) followed a distinct pattern, thereby enabling prediction of new more efficient inhibitors. Remarkably, tested bacteria failed to develop resistance to ITC. While effectively inhibiting microbial growth, ITCs displayed moderate toxicity towards eukaryotic cells. CONCLUSIONS: High antimicrobial activity coupled with moderate toxicity grants further thorough studies of the ITC compounds aimed at elucidation of their cellular targets and inhibitory mechanism. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This systematic study identified new ITC compounds highly active against common human microbial pathogens at the concentrations comparable with those for currently used antimicrobial drugs (e.g. rifampicin and fluconazole). Tested representative pathogens do not develop resistance to the inhibitors. These properties justify further evaluation of ITC compounds as potential antimicrobial agents for medicinal use and for industrial applications.
TI  - Spectroscopic and solvatochromism studies along with antioxidant and antibacterial activities investigation of 2-((2-mercaptophenylimino)methyl)-4-(phenyldiazenyl)phenol.
AB  - The condensation reaction of 2-hydroxy-5-(aryldiazenyl)benzaldehyde (1a-d) with 2-aminothiophenole affored Schiff base compounds 2-((2-mercaptophenylimino)methyl-4-(-aryldiazenyl)phenol (2a-d). The structures of compounds (2a-d) were characterized by elemental analysis, mass, infrared, UV-vis and NMR spectroscopy. The 2a-d shows enol-keto tautomeric and positive solvatochromism. The antibacterial activities of 2a-d were also evaluated by disc diffusion method. Compound 2b displayed activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, 2a and 2c were active against B. cereus but 2d did not exhibit activity against the tested organisms. Among the tested compounds, 2b showed the best antioxidant properties as evaluated by free radical scavenging activity on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl and ferric reducing power determination.
TI  - Microbial toxicity of ethanolamines--multiwalled carbon nanotubes.
AB  - In the present study, antimicrobial activities of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) functionalized with ethanolamine (EA) groups were investigated. Therefore, MWCNT were first functionalized with mono-, di-, and triethanolamine (MEA, DEA, and TEA) under microwave technique. Development of functional groups on the MWCNT surface was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and thermogravimetric analysis. Morphological variation was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Then, antimicrobial activities of pristine and functionalized MWCNT (MWCNT-MEA, -DEA, and -TEA) were tested against different bacteria species. The studies have been done on four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium) as well as four Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Streptococcus pneumonia). The results based on minimal inhibitory concentration and radial diffusion assay were shown that the antimicrobial activity of MWCNT-TEA > MWCNT-DEA > MWCNT-MEA > pristine MWCNT. Based on the results, it seems that EA groups could play an important role in antimicrobial activity of MWCNT.
TI  - Microbiological quality of chicken- and pork-based street-vended foods from Taichung, Taiwan, and Laguna, Philippines.
AB  - The microbiological quality of chicken- and pork-based street-food samples from Taichung, Taiwan's night markets (50) and Laguna, Philippines' public places (69) was evaluated in comparison to a microbiological guideline for ready-to-eat foods. Different bacterial contamination patterns were observed between 'hot-grilled' and 'cold cooked/fried' food types from the two sampling locations with 'hot grilled' foods generally showing better microbiological quality. Several samples were found to be unsatisfactory due to high levels of aerobic plate count, coliform, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. The highest counts obtained were 8.2 log cfu g(-)(1), 5.4 log cfu g(-)(1), 4.4 log cfu g(-)(1), and 3.9 log cfu g(-)(1), respectively, suggesting poor food hygiene practices and poor sanitation. Salmonella was found in 8% and 7% of Taichung and Laguna samples, respectively, which made the samples potentially hazardous. None of the samples was found to be positive for Listeria monocytogenes and E. coli O157, but Bacillus cereus was detected at the unsatisfactory level of 4 log cfu g(-)(1) in one Laguna sample. Antimicrobial resistance was observed for Salmonella, E. coli, and S. aureus isolates. Food preparation, cooking, and food handling practices were considered to be contributors to the unacceptable microbiological quality of the street foods. Hence, providing training on food hygiene for the street vendors should result in the improvement of the microbiological quality of street foods. The data obtained in this study can be used as input to microbial risk assessments and in identifying science-based interventions to control the hazards.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of selected Malaysian honey.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibacterial activity of honey is mainly dependent on a combination  of its peroxide activity and non-peroxide components. This study aims to investigate antibacterial activity of five varieties of Malaysian honey (three monofloral; acacia, gelam and pineapple, and two polyfloral; kelulut and tualang) against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) were performed for semi-quantitative evaluation. Agar well diffusion assay was used to investigate peroxide and non-peroxide activities of honey. RESULTS: The results showed that gelam honey possessed lowest MIC value against S. aureus with 5% (w/v) MIC and MBC of 6.25% (w/v). Highest MIC values were shown by pineapple honey against E. coli and P. aeruginosa as well as acacia honey against E. coli with 25% (w/v) MIC and 50% (w/v) MBC values. Agar inhibition assay showed kelulut honey to possess highest total antibacterial activity against S. aureus with 26.49 equivalent phenol concentrations (EPC) and non-peroxide activity of 25.74 EPC. Lowest antibacterial activity was observed in acacia honey against E. coli with total activity of 7.85 EPC and non-peroxide activity of 7.59 EPC. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the total antibacterial activities and non-peroxide activities of Malaysian honey. The intraspecific correlation between MIC and EPC of E. coli (r = -0.8559) was high while that between MIC and EPC of P. aeruginosa was observed to be moderate (r = -0.6469). S. aureus recorded a smaller correlation towards the opposite direction (r = 0.5045). In contrast, B.cereus showed a very low intraspecific correlation between MIC and EPC (r = -0.1482). CONCLUSIONS: Malaysian honey, namely gelam, kelulut and tualang, have high antibacterial potency derived from total and non-peroxide activities, which implies that both peroxide and other constituents are mutually important as contributing factors to the antibacterial property of honey.
TI  - Bioactive phenylalanine derivatives and cytochalasins from the soft coral-derived fungus, Aspergillus elegans.
AB  - One new phenylalanine derivative 4'-OMe-asperphenamate (1), along with one known  phenylalanine derivative (2) and two new cytochalasins, aspochalasin A1 (3) and cytochalasin Z24 (4), as well as eight known cytochalasin analogues (5-12) were isolated from the fermentation broth of Aspergillus elegans ZJ-2008010, a fungus obtained from a soft coral Sarcophyton sp. collected from the South China Sea. Their structures and the relative configurations were elucidated using comprehensive spectroscopic methods. The absolute configuration of 1 was determined by chemical synthesis and Marfey's method. All isolated metabolites (1-12) were evaluated for their antifouling and antibacterial activities. Cytochalasins 5, 6, 8 and 9 showed strong antifouling activity against the larval settlement of the barnacle Balanus amphitrite, with the EC50 values ranging from 6.2 to 37 muM. This is the first report of antifouling activity for this class of metabolites. Additionally, 8 exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, especially against four pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus albus, S. aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Antibacterial effectiveness of chitosan-propolis coated polypropylene films against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Antibacterial properties of chitosan are well documented in the literature. However its antibacterial effectiveness in the film form is controversial due to the methodological differences in test methods used. In this study, antibacterial effectiveness of chitosan-coated polypropylene films alone and incorporating ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) were evaluated against six foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus) using the ISO 22196 method designed for the antibacterial treated plastic products. The results demonstrated that chitosan coated film exhibited the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Incorporation of EPP to coating at 10% (propolis resin/chitosan) enhanced antibacterial activity against all pathogens tested. Results of this study revealed that chitosan has antibacterial activity in the film form and that propolis is a promising antimicrobial for the food packaging applications.
TI  - Biological activity, design, synthesis and structure activity relationship of some novel derivatives of curcumin containing sulfonamides.
AB  - Five series of curcumin derivatives with sulfonamides 3a-3e, 4a-4e, 5a-5e, 6a-6e  and 7a-7e have been synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against selected medically important gram-(+) and gram-(-) bacterial species viz. Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, and antifungal activity against few pathogenic fungal species viz. Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Trichoderma viride and Curvularia lunata. The cytotoxicity has been determined by measuring IC50 values against human cell lines HeLa, Hep G-2, QG-56 and HCT-116. Among the compounds screened, 3a-3e showed the most potent biological activity against tested bacteria and fungi. Compounds 3a-3e displayed higher cytotoxicity than curcumin. The curcumin derivatives were also evaluated for in vivo anti-inflammatory activity. In contrast, the compounds 6a-6e and 7a-7e showed dramatically decrease in biological activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Two rep genes in small cryptic plasmid pKST21 of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of a small cryptic plasmid pKST21 from Escherichia coli was determined. This plasmid is 1,460 bp long with an overall GC content of 51 %. Based on sequence analysis, the presence of two segments with different average GC density was observed. The segment with higher GC content revealed 98-90 % similarity to several small plasmids of E. coli and to pCR1 from Gram-positive Corynebacterium renale. Plasmid pKST21 possesses two conversely oriented open reading frames encoding proteins with a high degree of amino acid identity to Rep proteins involved in replication. ORF1 encodes replication protein similar to RepA protein of Bartonella tribocorum or Bacillus cereus plasmids or to the putative plasmid Rep protein from ecologically close Selenomonas ruminantium. ORF2 similarly encodes a replication protein, which shares 97 % homology with Rep protein from C. renale. Genetic diversity observed in plasmid pKST21 indicates a mosaic structure of the plasmid with different segments acquired from different sources. Deletion analysis showed that both fragments carrying the repA and repB genes are necessary for the replication of pKST21 in E. coli. The presence of plasmid with the same gene composition was revealed in 14 % of tested E. coli isolates from the rumen of sheep. All these strains produced identical ERIC-PCR profiles indicating isogenic origin of the strain and lack of horizontal gene transfer of pKST21 plasmid.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis as a tool for screening soil metagenomic libraries for antimicrobial activities.
AB  - Finding new antimicrobial activities by functional metagenomics has been shown to depend on the heterologous host used to express the foreign DNA. Therefore, efforts are devoted to developing new tools for constructing metagenomic libraries in shuttle vectors replicatable in phylogenetically distinct hosts. Here we evaluated the use of the Escherichia coli-Bacillus subtilis shuttle vector pHT01 to construct a forest-soil metagenomic library. This library was screened in both hosts for antimicrobial activities against four opportunistic bacteria: Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Micrococcus luteus. A new antibacterial activity against B. cereus was found upon screening in B. subtilis. The new antimicrobial agent, sensitive to proteinase K, was not active when the corresponding DNA fragment was expressed in E. coli. Our results validate the use of pHT01 as a shuttle vector and B. subtilis as a host to isolate new activities by functional metagenomics.
TI  - Synergized antimicrobial activity of eugenol incorporated polyhydroxybutyrate films against food spoilage microorganisms in conjunction with pediocin.
AB  - Biopolymers and biopreservatives produced by microorganisms play an essential role in food technology. Polyhydroxyalkanoates and bacteriocins produced by bacteria are promising components to safeguard the environment and for food preservation applications. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)-based antimicrobial films were prepared incorporating eugenol, from 10 to 200 mug/g of PHB. The films were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, spoilage bacteria, and fungi such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium sp., and Rhizopus sp. The synergistic antimicrobial activity of the films in the presence of crude pediocin was also investigated. The broth system containing pediocin (soluble form) as well as antimicrobial PHB film demonstrated an extended lag phase and a significant growth reduction at the end of 24 h against the bacteria. Crude pediocin alone could not elicit antifungal activity, while inhibition of growth and sporulation were observed in the presence of antimicrobial PHB film containing eugenol (80 mug/g) until 7 days in the case of molds, i.e., A. niger, A. flavus, Penicillium sp., and Rhizopus sp. in potato dextrose broth. In the present study, we identified that use of pediocin containing broth in conjunction with eugenol incorporated PHB film could function in synergized form, providing effective hurdle toward food contaminating microorganisms. Furthermore, tensile strength, percent crystallinity, melting point, percent elongation to break, glass transition temperature, and seal strength of the PHB film with and without eugenol incorporation were investigated. The migration of eugenol on exposure to different liquid food simulants was also analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The study is expected to provide applications for pediocin in conjunction with eugenol containing PHB film to enhance the shelf life of foods in the food industry.
TI  - Design, characterization, teratogenicity testing, antibacterial, antifungal and DNA interaction of few high spin Fe(II) Schiff base amino acid complexes.
AB  - In this study, new Fe(II) Schiff base amino acid chelates derived from the condensation of o-hydroxynaphthaldehyde with L-alanine, L-phenylalanine, L-aspartic acid, L-histidine and L-arginine were synthesized and characterized via elemental, thermogravimetric analysis, molar conductance, IR, electronic, mass spectra and magnetic moment measurements. The stoichiometry and the stability constants of the complexes were determined spectrophotometrically. Correlation of all spectroscopic data suggested that Schiff bases ligands exhibited tridentate with ONO sites coordinating to the metal ions via protonated phenolic-OH, azomethine-N and carboxylate-O with the general formulae [Fe(HL)2].nH2O. But in case of L-histidine, the ligand acts as tetradentate via deprotonated phenolic-OH, azomethine-N, carboxylate-O and N-imidazole ring ([FeL(H2O)2].2H2O), where HL=mono anion and L=dianion of the ligand. The structure of the prepared complexes is suggested to be octahedral. The prepared complexes were tested for their teratogenicity on chick embryos and found to be safe until a concentration of 100 mug/egg with full embryos formation. Moreover, the interaction between CT-DNA and the investigated complexes were followed by spectrophotometric and viscosity measurements. It was found that, the prepared complexes bind to DNA via classical intercalative mode and showed a different DNA activity with the sequence: nhi>nari>nali>nasi>nphali. Furthermore, the free ligands and their complexes are screened for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity against three types of bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus and three types of anti fungal cultures, Penicillium purpurogenium, Aspergillus flavus and Trichotheium rosium in order to assess their antimicrobial potential. The results show that the metal complexes are more reactive with respect to their corresponding Schiff base amino acid ligands.
TI  - Study of the Interference between Plectranthus Species Essential Oils from Brazil and Aminoglycosides.
AB  - Plectranthus is one of the most representative genera of Lamiaceae family. In this study, the essential oils from Plectranthus amboinicus, Plectranthus ornatus, and Plectranthus barbatus were investigated for their chemical composition and antimicrobial and modulatory activities. The major components found were carvacrol (54.4%-P. amboinicus) and eugenol (22.9%-P. ornatus e 25.1%-P. barbatus). In vitro antimicrobial activity was conducted against Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus aureus (multiresistant) using microdilution method. The results of bioassay showed that all strains were sensitive to the oils, except P. aeruginosa that was resistant to P. amboinicus and P. ornatus. A synergistic effect of all essential oils combined with the aminoglycosides was demonstrated. These results show that P. amboinicus, P. ornatus, and P. barbatus inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganism, and besides this they present antibiotic modifying activity, providing a new perspective against the problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics.
TI  - Food safety knowledge and practices of abattoir and butchery shops and the microbial profile of meat in Mekelle City, Ethiopia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the food safety knowledge and practices in meat handling, and to determine microbial load and pathogenic organisms in meat at Mekelle city. METHODS: A descriptive survey design was used to answer questions concerning the current status of food hygiene and sanitation practiced in the abattoir and butcher shops. Workers from the abattoir and butcher shops were interviewed through a structured questionnaire to assess their food safety knowledge. Bacterial load was assessed by serial dilution method and the major bacterial pathogens were isolated by using standard procedures. RESULTS: 15.4% of the abattoir workers had no health certificate and there was no hot water, sterilizer and cooling facility in the abattoir. 11.3% of the butchers didn't use protective clothes. There was a food safety knowledge gap within the abattoir and butcher shop workers. The mean values of bacterial load of abattoir meat, butcher shops and street meat sale was found to be 1.1x10(5), 5.6x10(5) and 4.3x10(6) cfu/g, respectively. The major bacterial pathogens isolated were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that there is a reasonable gap on food safety knowledge by abattoir and butcher shop workers. The microbial profile was also higher compared to standards set by World Health Organization. Due attention should be given by the government to improve the food safety knowledge and the quality standard of meat sold in the city.
TI  - Effect of the temperature of the dipping solution on the antimicrobial effectiveness of various chemical decontaminants against pathogenic and spoilage bacteria on poultry.
AB  - The influence of the temperature of the dipping solution on the antimicrobial effectiveness of several chemical poultry decontaminants was assessed. A total of 765 poultry legs were inoculated with gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, or Brochothrix thermosphacta) or gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, or Pseudomonas fluorescens). Samples were dipped for 15 min in solutions (wt/vol) of trisodium phosphate (12%), acidified sodium chlorite (1,200 ppm), citric acid (2%), peroxyacids (220 ppm), chlorine dioxide (50 ppm), or tap water or were left untreated (control). The temperatures of the dipping solutions were 4, 20, or 50 degrees C. Microbiological analyses and pH determinations were carried out after 0, 1, 3, and 5 days of storage at 4 degrees C. In comparison with the control samples, all chemical solutions were effective for reducing microbial loads. The temperature of treatment affected the microbial reductions caused by all chemicals (P < 0.001). The lowest average bacterial reductions caused by trisodium phosphate, acidified sodium chlorite, citric acid, and peroxyacids were observed at 4 degrees C, all sampling days and microbial groups being considered simultaneously. The highest and the lowest effectiveness for chlorine dioxide were observed at 4 and 50 degrees C, respectively. These results may be of use to meat processors for selecting the best conditions for decontamination treatments and may help the European Regulatory Authorities make their decisions for authorization of poultry decontamination treatments.
TI  - Biochemical composition, antimicrobial activities,and anti-quorum-sensing activities of ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts from Hypericum connatum Lam. (Guttiferae).
AB  - We studied the polyphenol composition and antioxidant activity of the ethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of Hypericum connatum (Guttiferae), in addition to their antimicrobial and antiquorum-sensing (AQS) properties. The extracts exhibited a similar polyphenol content and a notable antioxidant activity, which was stronger in the ethanolic extract (EC50=3.2 mug/mL). Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed different polyphenol profiles, with rutin and apigen being the main components of the ethanolic extract and caffeic acid, (-)-epicatechin and p-coumaric acid being abundant in the ethyl acetate extract. The ethyl acetate extract exhibited a more effective antimicrobial activity than the ethanolic extract against the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For the first time, AQS activity was detected in H. connatum: the ethanolic extract inhibited the production of violacein, a quorum-sensing-regulated pigment, in a Chromobacterium violaceum tester strain, without interfering with its growth.
TI  - Biochemical Activities of Iranian Cymbopogon olivieri (Boiss) Bor. Essential Oil.
AB  - Cymbopogon olivieri essential oil from aerial parts was analyzed by gas chromotography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and led to the identification of 38 compounds. Piperitone (72.8%), 4-carene (11.8%) and beta-himachalene (7.6%) were found as the major components of the oil. The antimicrobial activity was achieved using disc-diffusion and microbroth dilution assays and microbicidal kinetics of oil was screened against different microorganisms. The possible antioxidant activity of oil was evaluated by diphenylpicrylhydrazyl free-radical scavenging system. The oil had excellent antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The oil exhibited inhibitory effect against Bacillus subtilis and fungi. Dvalues of oil were 12.5, 10 and 2.4 min for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, respectively. The IC50 value of Cymbopogon olivieri oil was 35 mg/ml and its antioxidant activity was lower than that of butylated hydroxytoluene. Cymbopogon olivieri oil possesses compounds with antimicrobial properties that can be used as antimicrobial agents.
TI  - A new family of proteins related to the HEAT-like repeat DNA glycosylases with affinity for branched DNA structures.
AB  - The recently discovered HEAT-like repeat (HLR) DNA glycosylase superfamily is widely distributed in all domains of life. The present bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis shows that HLR DNA glycosylase superfamily members in the genus Bacillus form three subfamilies: AlkC, AlkD and AlkF/AlkG. The crystal structure of AlkF shows structural similarity with the DNA glycosylases AlkC and AlkD, however neither AlkF nor AlkG display any DNA glycosylase activity. Instead, both proteins have affinity to branched DNA structures such as three-way and Holliday junctions. A unique beta-hairpin in the AlkF/AlkG subfamily is most likely inserted into the DNA major groove, and could be a structural determinant regulating DNA substrate affinity. We conclude that AlkF and AlkG represent a new family of HLR proteins with affinity for branched DNA structures.
TI  - Volatile constituents of Pinus roxburghii from Nepal.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pinus roxburghii Sarg. Is one of 3 species of pine found in Nepal, the oil of which is traditionally used to treat cuts, wounds, boils, and blisters. OBJECTIVE: To obtain, analyze, and examine the anti-microbial and cytotoxic activities of the essential oils of P. roxburghii. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three plant parts (cone, needle, and bark) of Pinus roxburghii were collected in Biratnagar, Nepal. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation, and the chemical compositions were determined by GC-MS. The needle and cone essential oils were screened for anti-microbial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Aspergillus niger; brine shrimp (Artemia salina) lethality; and in-vitro cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells. RESULTS: GC-MS analysis for the cone oil revealed 81 compounds with 78 components being identified (95.5% of the oil) while 98.3% of needle oil was identified to contain 68 components and 98.6% of the bark oil (38 components) was identified. The 3 essential oils were dominated by sesquiterpenes, particularly (E)-caryophyllene (26.8%-34.5%) and alpha-humulene (5.0%-7.3%) as well as monoterpene alcohols terpinen-4-ol (4.1%-30.1%) and alpha-terpineol(2.8%-5.0%). The monoterpene delta-3-carene was present only in needle and cone essential oils (2.3% and 6.8%, respectively). Bio-activity assays of the cone essential oil of P. roxburghii showed remarkable cytotoxic activity (100% killing of MCF-7 cells at 100 mug/mL) along with notable brine shrimp lethality (LC50 =11.8 mug/mL). The cone essential oil did not show anti-bacterial activity, but it did exhibit anti-fungal activity against Aspergillus niger (MIC=39 mug/mL). CONCLUSION: The bioactivity of P. roxburghii essential oil is consistent with its traditional medicinal use.
TI  - Identification of Tet45, a tetracycline efflux pump, from a poultry-litter-exposed soil isolate and persistence of tet(45) in the soil.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize a tetracycline resistance (Tc(R)) determinant, closely related to the TetL efflux pump, in a Bhargavaea cecembensis strain previously isolated from a poultry-litter-impacted soil. METHODS: Genomic DNA of B. cecembensis DMV42A was shotgun cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and a [(3)H]tetracycline uptake assay were used to confirm the function of the target gene. Transferability of the gene was examined using filter matings and confirmed by PCR and sequencing. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on soil metagenomic DNA to evaluate the prevalence of the gene in the soil from which B. cecembensis DMV42A was isolated and in more pristine local soils. RESULTS: The Tc(R) determinant from B. cecembensis DMV42A, designated Tet45, was identified as a tetracycline efflux pump sharing 78% amino acid identity with certain TetL proteins. In B. cecembensis DMV42A, tet(45) was adjacent to truncated and non-functional arsenic resistance genes with high sequence similarities to genes from staphylococcal plasmids. After filter matings, the tet(45) gene could be found in E. coli transconjugants, although the transfer mechanism was unknown. Tet45 homologues are also present in the genomes of several Bacillus cereus strains and a Bacillus thuringiensis strain. tet(45) was detected in the poultry-litter-impacted soil, and persisted at a similar level 2 years after removal of the chicken waste, although it was not detected in several more pristine soils. CONCLUSIONS: Tet45 is a tetracycline efflux pump closely related to TetL. Horizontal gene transfer may have contributed to the dissemination and persistence of tet(45) in a poultry-litter-impacted soil.
TI  - Evaluation of the HACCP system in a university canteen: microbiological monitoring and internal auditing as verification tools.
AB  - Food safety is essential in mass catering. In Europe, Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 requires food business operators to put in place, implement and maintain permanent procedures based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles. Each HACCP plan is specifically implemented for the processing plant and processing methods and requires a systematic collection of data on the incidence, elimination, prevention, and reduction of risks. In this five-year-study, the effectiveness of the HACCP plan of a University canteen was verified through periodic internal auditing and microbiological monitoring of meals, small equipment, cooking tools, working surfaces, as well as hands and white coats of the canteen staff. The data obtained revealed no safety risks for the consumers, since Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes were never detected; however, a quite discontinuous microbiological quality of meals was revealed. The fluctuations in the microbial loads of mesophilic aerobes, coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and sulphite-reducing clostridia were mainly ascribed to inadequate handling or processing procedures, thus suggesting the need for an enhancement of staff training activities and for a reorganization of tasks. Due to the wide variety of the fields covered by internal auditing, the full conformance to all the requirements was never achieved, though high scores, determined by assigning one point to each answer which matched with the requirements, were achieved in all the years.
TI  - Biogenesis of antibacterial silver nanoparticles using the endophytic bacterium Bacillus cereus isolated from Garcinia xanthochymus.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the ecofriendly nanoparticles, which is viewed as an alternative to the chemical method which initiated the use of microbes like bacteria and fungi in their synthesis. METHODS: The current study uses the endophytic bacterium Bacillus cereus isolated from the Garcinia xanthochymus to synthesize the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The AgNPs were synthesized by reduction of silver nitrate solution by the endophytic bacterium after incubation for 3-5 d at room temperature. The synthesis was initially observed by colour change from pale white to brown which was confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The AgNPs were further characterized using FTIR, SEM-EDX and TEM analyses. RESULTS: The synthesized nanoparticles were found to be spherical with the size in the range of 20-40 nm which showed a slight aggregation. The energy-dispersive spectra of the nanoparticle dispersion confirmed the presence of elemental silver. The AgNPs were found to have antibacterial activity against a few pathogenic bacteria like Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: The endophytic bacteria identified as Bacillus cereus was able to synthesize silver nanoparticles with potential antibacterial activity.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using actinobacterium Streptomyces albogriseolus and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - An eco-friendly approach to the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by extracellular components of Streptomyces albogriseolus has been reported. The isolated actinobacteria were genotypically identified by 16S rRNA sequencing analysis, and the morphology was observed by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. The preliminary characterization of synthesized nanoparticles was carried out using ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. The maximum absorption spectra were found to be 409 nm at the 48th hour of incubation. The yield of AgNPs was found to be 72.64% as quantified by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The average size of AgNPs determined by the dynamic light scattering technique was 16.25 +/- 1.6 nm. The results from transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of spherical shaped and crystalline AgNPs. The interaction of protein with AgNPs was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. The biosynthesized AgNPs inhibited the growth of food pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus). Hence, the synthesis of AgNPs by S. albogriseolus could be employed as a probable antimicrobial agent to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms. This approach employed for the synthesis of nanoparticles paves a path for new biomaterial interfaces, which could be applied in different biomedical fields.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of mangrove plant Sonneratia alba.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial property of mangrove plant Sonneratia alba (S. alba). METHODS: The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using disc diffusion and microdilution methods against six microorganisms. Soxhlet apparatus was used for extraction with a series of solvents, n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol in sequence of increasing polarity. RESULTS: Methanol extract appeared to be the most effective extract while n-hexane extract showed no activity. The antimicrobial activities were observed against the gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Bacillus cereus (B. cereus), the gram negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans appeared to be not sensitive to the concentrations tested since no inhibition zone was observed. E. coli (17.5 mm) appeared to be the most sensitive strain followed by S. aureus (12.5 mm) and B. cereus (12.5 mm). CONCLUSIONS: From this study, it can be concluded that S. alba exhibits antimicrobial activities against certain microorganisms.
TI  - Synthesis of amino acid conjugates of tetrahydrocurcumin and evaluation of their  antibacterial and anti-mutagenic properties.
AB  - Tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), the hydrogenated and stable form of curcumin, exhibits  physiological and pharmacological activities similar to curcumin. A protocol has been developed for the synthesis of novel conjugates of THC with alanine (2a), isoleucine (2b), proline (2c), valine (2d), phenylalanine (2e), glycine (2f) and leucine (2g) in high yields (43-82%). All the derivatives of THC exhibited more potent anti-microbial activity than THC against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica. The MIC values of the derivatives were 24-37% of those for THC in case of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Derivatives 2g and 2d exhibited maximum anti-mutagenicity against Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 1538, respectively at a low concentration of 313 mug/plate, with comparable activity for THC evident only at 3750 mug/plate. These results clearly demonstrated that the conjugation of THC at the phenolic position with amino acids led to significant improvement of its in vitro biological attributes.
TI  - Microbial diversity and prevalence of foodborne pathogens in cheap and junk foods consumed by primary schoolchildren.
AB  - Aerobic plate counts (APC), coliforms, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens were tested in 1008 cheap and junk foods, including candies, dried cakes, chewing gum, chocolate, dried and seasoned seafood, ice cream, and sugary foods. APCs were positive for 342 samples (33.9%), and the majority of the counts were 2-3 log CFU g(-1) or ml(-1) (average: 1.10 log CFU g(-1) or ml(-1) ). Most samples (97.3%) contained no coliforms (average: 0.07 log CFU g(-1) or ml(-1) ). Bacillus cereus was detected in 68 samples (average: 0.14 log CFU g(-1) or ml(-1) ). Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes were detected in 6 and 1 samples, respectively, whereas other foodborne pathogens were not isolated. The highest bacterial counts were associated with dried and seasoned seafood products and dried cakes, suggesting that appropriate regulations of these food types should be considered. Cheap and junk foods were produced mainly in developing countries, but there were no significant differences in the bacterial counts among different countries of origin. The presence of foodborne pathogens may pose a risk for children. These results suggest that there is cause for deeper concern about the safety of these foods and that effective countermeasures should be established to improve their microbiological safety. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Food safety is especially important for children, but only limited information is available about the microbiological quality of cheap and junk foods that are consumed frequently by primary schoolchildren (e.g. dried cakes, candies and chocolates). The present study investigated the microbial quality of cheap and junk foods, and our results indicate that these foods are a potential health risk for children, therefore, deeper concern about the safety of these foods and effective countermeasures should be established to improve their microbiological safety. The present study may contribute to the development of an appropriate child food safety management system.
TI  - Microbiological examination of ready-to-eat foods and ready-to-bake frozen pastries from university canteens.
AB  - During a 10-year inspection survey (2001-2010), a microbiological study of ready-to-eat (RTE) foods and ready-to-bake frozen pastries from 15 canteens of the university campus was undertaken to determine their microbiological quality. The cumulative study revealed that the aerobic colony counts for the RTE product groups were as follows: from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/g for 50% of sandwiches; under the detection limit (<10 CFU/g) for 88.6% of oven baked pastries; <10(5) CFU/g for 86.5% of desserts oven baked; from 10(3) to 10(9) CFU/g for desserts with dairy cream. The highest mean Enterobacteriaceae counts were recorded for desserts with dairy cream. The highest percentages of foodborne pathogens were: 20% Listeria monocytogenes and 12.5% Staphylococcus aureus in desserts with dairy cream; 17.5% Salmonella spp. and 8.5% presumptive Escherichia coli O157 in sandwiches; 14.6% Bacillus cereus in oven baked pastries. Aerobic colony counts were in the range 10(7)-10(8) CFU/g for 48.8% of frozen pastries; whereas Enterobacteriaceae counts between 10(3) and 10(4) CFU/g were detected in 35.3%. Foodborne pathogens prevalences for frozen pastries were as follows: B. cereus, 31.8%; Salmonella spp., 28.6%; presumptive E. coli O157, 25%; S. aureus, 8.7%; L. monocytogenes, 8.7%. Improved sanitary conditions in the processing plants and precautionary measures are necessary for consumer protection.
TI  - In vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of Chinese Crested and Yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. Thirty seven isolates were identified as Lactobacillus or Enterococcus. Out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and belonged to the species Lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), Lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), Lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), Lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other LAB isolates were Enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%). Strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (pH 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. Thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. Seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against Leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. All isolates produced low rates of hydrogen peroxide. Based on these results, two Lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.
TI  - Synthesis of 1-isopropyl-3-acyl-5-methyl-benzimidazolone derivatives and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - A series of N-acylated analogues of 1-isopropyl-3-acyl-5-methyl-benzimidazolone were synthesized. Bioassay results indicated that analogues 5-07 and 5-19 exhibited the most potency against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Analogues 5-02, 5-07, 5-12, 5-15, 5-19, 5-20 and 5-25 could effectively inhibit the spore germination of Botrytis cinerea. The relationship between structure and their antimicrobial activity (SAR) has also been discussed according to aliphatic acids and aromatic acids derivatives, respectively. This implied that the N-acylated derivatives of 5-methyl-benzimidazolone might be potential antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Application of Asian pumpkin (Cucurbita ficifolia) serine proteinase for production of biologically active peptides from casein.
AB  - The main objective of this study was to determine potential application of a serine proteinase derived from Asian pumpkin for obtaining biologically active peptides from casein. The course of casein hydrolysis by three doses of the enzyme (50, 150, 300 U/mg of protein) was monitored for 24 hours by the determinations of: hydrolysis degree DH (%), free amino group content (mumole Gly/g), RP HPLC peptide profiles and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In all hydrolyzates analyzed antioxidant activities were determined using three tests: the ability to reduce iron ions in FRAP test, the ability to scavenge free radicals in DPPH test, and Fe(2+) chelating activity. The antimicrobial activity of obtained peptide fractions was determined as the ability to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas fluorescens in a diffusion plate test. The deepest degradation, expressed as the DH [%] and the free amino group content (67% and 7528 micromole Gly/mg, respectively), was noted in samples hydrolyzed with 300 U/ml of enzyme for 24 hours, while in other samples the determined values were about three and two times lower. The results were in agreement with the peptide profiles obtained by RP HPLC. The highest antioxidative activities determined in all tests were seen for the casein hydrolysate obtained with 300 U/mg protein of serine proteinase after 24 h of reaction (2.15 microM Trolox/mg, 96.15 microg Fe(3+)/mg, 814.97 microg Fe(2+)/mg). Antimicrobial activity was presented in three preparations. In other samples no antimicrobial activity was detected.
TI  - Antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of mycelia of a medicinal mushroom from Taiwan, Taiwanofungus salmoneus (higher Basidiomycetes).
AB  - Taiwanofungus salmoneus (T.T. Chang et W.N. Chou) Sheng H. Wu et al. (shiang-shan-chih), is a medicinal fungus indigenous to Taiwan. The mycelium was prepared from submerged culture and its ethanolic and hot-water extracts were used to study its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. Gram-positive species (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative species (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) of bacteria were used. In addition to the inhibitory zone, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) also were determined. The ethanolic extracts showed higher inhibitory and bactericidal activities (MIC and MBC: 6.25-12.50 mg/ml) than the hot-water extracts (MIC and MBC: 25-50 mg/mL). In the anti-inflammatory test, the extracts were tested on lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor- alpha production in RAW 264.7 cells. The values of the inhibition concentration at 50% of nitric oxide production were 18.2 and 14.2 mug/mL for the hot-water and ethanolic extracts, respectively. The 50% inhibitory concentration values of tumor necrosis factor- alpha production were 4.99 and 7.13 mug/mL for the hot-water and ethanolic extracts, respectively. On the basis of the results obtained, the mycelia could be used as an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory supplement.
TI  - Selection of DNA aptamers for capture and detection of Salmonella Typhimurium using a whole-cell SELEX approach in conjunction with cell sorting.
AB  - Alternative ligands such as nucleic acid aptamers can be used for pathogen capture and detection and offer advantages over antibodies, including reduced cost, ease of production and modification, and improved stability. DNA aptamers demonstrating binding specificity to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were identified by whole-cell-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) beginning with a combinatorial library of biotin-labeled single stranded DNA molecules. Aptamer specificity was achieved using whole-cell counter-SELEX against select non-Salmonella genera. Aptamers binding to Salmonella were sorted, cloned, sequenced, and characterized for binding efficiency. Out of 18 candidate aptamers screened, aptamer S8-7 showed relatively high binding affinity with an apparent dissociation constant (K d value) of 1.73 +/- 0.54 muM and was selected for further characterization. Binding exclusivity analysis of S8-7 showed low apparent cross-reactivity with other foodborne bacteria including Escherichia coli O157: H7 and Citrobacter braakii and moderate cross-reactivity with Bacillus cereus. Aptamer S8-7 was successfully used as a ligand for magnetic capture of serially diluted Salmonella Typhimurium cells, followed by downstream detection using qPCR. The lower limit of detection of the aptamer magnetic capture-qPCR assay was 10(2)-10(3) CFU equivalents of Salmonella Typhimurium in a 290-mul sample volume. Mean capture efficiency ranged from 3.6 to 12.6 %. Unique aspects of the study included (a) the use of SELEX targeting whole cells; (b) the application of flow cytometry for aptamer pool selection, thereby favoring purification of ligands with both high binding affinity and targeting abundant cell surface moieties; and (c) the use of pre-labeled primers that circumvented the need for post-selection ligand labeling. Taken together, this study provides proof-of-concept that biotinylated aptamers selected by whole-cell SELEX can be used in a qPCR-based capture-detection platform for Salmonella Typhimurium.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of polyhalo isophthalonitrile derivatives.
AB  - A series of polyhalo isophthalonitrile derivatives (3 and 4) that incorporate a variety of substituents at the 2-, 4-, 5- and/or 6-positions of the isophthalonitrile moieties have been designed and synthesized. These derivatives were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus (Gram-positive bacteria), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative bacteria); and Candida albicans (Fungi). Compounds 3 and 4 showed stronger inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria and fungi growth, and the antimicrobial ability of compound 3j (a 4-(benzylamino)-5-chloro-2,6-difluoro analog, MIC[SA] = 0.5 mug/mL; MIC[BC] = 0.4 mug/mL; MIC[CA] = 0.5 mug/mL) were close to nofloxacin and fluconazole and identified as the most potent antimicrobial agents in the series. The preliminary analysis of structure-activity relationships is also discussed.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial, antiquorum-sensing, antitumor and cytotoxic activities  of new series of fused [1,3,4]thiadiazoles.
AB  - New series of [1,3,4]thiadiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidines, benzo[h][1,3,4]thiadiazolo[2,3-b]quinazolines, benzothiadiazolotriazocine, and imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazoles have been synthesized and characterized by analytical and spectrometrical methods (IR, MS, (1)H and (13)C NMR). Twenty of the synthesized compounds were screened for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. They were found to be either moderately active, slightly active or inactive against the tested microorganisms. The antifungal activity of these compounds were also tested against Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus 293 and Aspergillus flavus 3375. Compounds 3g, h showed potent antifungal activity against C. albicans. In addition, the same compounds were tested for antiquorum-sensing activity against Chromobacterium violacium ATCC 12472, where compounds 3b,c, 3f-h, 6b-d, 9, 10 and 12 demonstrated acceptable activity. Compounds 3d, 9 and 10 were screened for antitumor activity at National Cancer Institute, USA. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of eighteen of the synthesized compounds was studied by brine shrimp lethality bioassay, and results indicated that compounds 6c, 13, 3h, 6d and 3d have the highest cytotoxic activity.
TI  - Airborne microbial composition in a high-throughput poultry slaughtering facility.
AB  - A high-throughput chicken slaughtering facility in Beijing was systematically investigated for numbers of airborne microorganisms. Samples were assessed for counts of aerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Salmonella. During a 4-month period (September to December 2011), samples were collected for 10 min three times daily (preproduction, production, and postproduction). Samples were collected for three consecutive days of each month with an FA-1 sampler from six sampling sites: receiving-hanging, soaking-scalding and defeathering, evisceration, precooling, subdividing, and packing. Humidity, temperature, wind velocity, and airborne particulates also were recorded at each sampling site and time. The highest counts of microorganisms were recorded in the initial stages of processing, i.e., the receiving-hanging and defeathering areas, with a definite decline toward the evisceration, prechilling, subdividing, and packing areas; the prechilling area had the lowest microbial counts of 2.4 x 10(3) CFU/m(3). Mean total coliforms counts ranged from 8.4 x 10(3) to 140 CFU/m(3). Maximum E. coli counts were 6.1 x 10(3) CFU/m(3) in the soaking-scalding and defeathering area. B. cereus, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus represented only a small proportion of the microbial population (1,900 to 20 CFU/m(3)). L. monocytogenes and Salmonella were rarely detected in evisceration, precooling, subdividing, and packing areas. Our study identified the levels of bioaerosols that may affect chicken product quality. This finding could be useful for improved control of microbial contamination to ensure product quality.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Microbiological quality and risk factors related to sandwiches served in bakeries, cafes, and sandwich bars in South Korea.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the microbiological quality of sandwiches produced on site and served in bakeries, cafes, and sandwich bars in South Korea and to determine the major risk factors affecting the sanitation level in each store (n = 1,120). The microbiological quality of the sandwiches was analyzed, and the sanitation level of each store was evaluated as satisfactory or unsatisfactory based on sanitation guidelines. Total coliforms were detected in 906 samples (80.9%), but only 3 samples (0.3%) contained confirmed Escherichia coli contamination. The detection rate was highest for Bacillus cereus (10.0%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (1.3%) and Salmonella (0.2%). Vibrio parahaemolyticus was not detected in any samples. The microbial contamination level was significantly lower in winter (P < 0.05) and in stores with a higher sanitation grade. Factors related to the microbiological quality of sandwiches were evaluated as the relative risk (RR) of coliform contamination, and the higher risk factors for sandwich contamination were improper holding temperature (RR = 8.75), cross-contamination (RR = 6.30), lack of proper ventilation systems (RR = 6.16), and the absence of clean and/or suitable outer garments (RR = 5.73). Most factors were related to the failure of food handlers to adhere to sanitation guidelines rather than to unsanitary environments. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the microbiological quality of sandwiches served on-site and various risk factors. These results will help researchers establish guidelines for the sanitary management of sandwich shops.
TI  - A nanoporous membrane-based impedimetric immunosensor for label-free detection of pathogenic bacteria in whole milk.
AB  - We introduce a nanoporous membrane based impedimetric immunosensor for the label-free detection of bacterial pathogens in whole milk. A simple and rapid method to modify a commercially available alumina nanoporous membrane with hyaluronic acid (HA) effectively reduced the non-specific binding of biomolecules and other cells, and permitted successful immobilization of antibodies. Escherichia coli O157:H7, one of the most harmful food-borne pathogenic bacteria, was tested as a model pathogen in this study. The ionic impedance of electrolytes through nanopores, due to antibody-pathogen interactions, was monitored by impedance spectra and analyzed by normalized impedance change (NIC). The regression equation for the NIC at 1 kHz versus concentration of E. coli O157:H7 (10-10(5)cfu/ml) was obtained, and the detection limit found to be as low as 10 cfu/ml. In addition, the proposed immunosensor was successfully used for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 in whole milk samples with the detection limit as low as 83.7 cfu/ml with 95% probability. The specificity of the immunosensor was also demonstrated using non-target bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and non pathogenic E. coli DH5alpha. This study shows that a HA-functionalized nanoporous membrane-based impedimetric sensor is capable of detecting pathogenic bacteria in whole milk without any pretreatment. This is a significant step for evaluating the safety of food and environmental samples and other medical diagnostics.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a new preservative for multiuse ophthalmic solutions.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and the  preservative efficacy of a novel preservative solution containing sodium hydroxymethyl glycinate (SHMG) and edetate disodium (EDTA), which is used for preservation of some commercial ophthalmic formulations. METHODS: In vitro susceptibility assays were performed against several gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria representative of the microbial flora of epithelial surfaces or colonizing the conjunctiva, as well as against Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. Using different concentrations of SHMG alone or in combination with EDTA, the minimal inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations against these organisms were assessed. In addition, 8 brands of multidose eye drops containing 0.002% SHMG and 0.1% EDTA as preservative were tested for antimicrobial activity using the antimicrobial effectiveness test recommended by the international pharmacopoeias. RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory and bactericidal/fungicidal concentration values of SHMG ranged from 0.0025% to 0.0125% for bacteria and from 0.125% to 0.50% for mold and yeast. Susceptibility testing demonstrated that the addition of EDTA substantially increased the SHMG activity against all bacterial and fungal strains. The preservative effectiveness test was applied to commercial eye drops. All the drop solutions met the criteria reported by the U.S. Pharmacopeia for parenteral and ophthalmic preparations. All products also satisfied the major acceptance criteria of the European Pharmacopeia with respect to the antifungal activity. With regard to the antibacterial activity, the less-stringent criteria of the European Pharmacopeia were fulfilled. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates the efficacy of a novel preservative for ophthalmic solutions (SHMG/EDTA) and its activity in protecting selected commercial artificial tears against microbial contamination.
TI  - Copper(II) triflate promoted multicomponent catalytic clubbing of piperazinyl-thiazoloquinolines and thiazolocoumarins as antimicrobials.
AB  - Step economical, multicomponent construction of two series based on quinoline and coumarin ring systems was carried out. Annulation towards the 2-piperazinylthiazole system was established in satisfactory yields, using copper(II) triflate. These multicomponent reaction products were examined for their potential inhibitory effect against two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus), three Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and two fungal species (Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans). In vitro pharmacological screening data demonstrated that the majority of the compounds were found to possess a significant broad-spectrum antimicrobial (25-50 microg/mL of MIC) potential and the results were comparable to control drugs. The structural assignments of final products were done on the basis of IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) was explored to facilitate further development of this class of compounds.
TI  - Characterization of an atmospheric pressure plasma jet and its applications for disinfection and cancer treatment.
AB  - In this work an atmospheric pressure non-thermal resistive barrier (RB) plasma jet was constructed, characterized and was applied for biomedical applications. The RB plasma source can operate in both DC (battery) as well as in standard 60/50 Hz low frequency AC excitation, and it functions effectively in both direct and indirect plasma exposure configurations. The characteristics of the RB plasma jet such as electrical properties, plasma gas temperature and nitric oxides concentration were determined using voltage-current characterization, optical emission spectroscopy and gas analyzer diagnostic techniques. Plasma discharge power of 26.33 W was calculated from voltage-current characterization. An optical emission spectroscopy was applied and the gas temperature which is equivalent to the nitrogen rotational (T<inf>rot</inf>) temperatures was measured. The concentrations of the reactive oxygen species at different spatial distances from the tip of the plasma jet were measured and the ppm concentration of NO is at the preferred level for a wide range of standard biomedical treatment applications. The ppm values of nitric oxides after the cooling unit are observed to be of the same order of magnitude as compared to plasma jet. The portable RB plasma source was tested to be very effective for decontamination and disinfection of a wide range of foodborne and opportunistic nosocomial pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus and the preliminary results are presented. The effects of indirect exposure of the portable RBP source on monocytic leukemia cancer cells (THP-1) were also tested and the results demonstrate that a preference for apoptosis in plasma treated THP-1 cells under particular plasma parameters and dosage levels.
TI  - Pathogenic bacteria in Finnish bulk tank milk.
AB  - While the quality of raw cow milk in Finland is known for its high hygienic standard, with the national average total bacterial count being below 10(4) CFU/mL annually, the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in Finnish raw milk is underreported. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of Listeria monocytogenes, thermophilic Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., stx-positive Escherichia coli (STEC), coagulase-positive staphylococci, Yersinia spp., and Bacillus cereus group in raw cow milk samples collected from bulk tanks at 183 Finnish farms. Additionally, the hygienic quality of the milk was studied by determining the total bacterial and E. coli counts. L. monocytogenes was detected in 5.5% of the milk samples, with concentrations varying from <1 to 30 CFU/mL. Thermophilic Campylobacter spp. or Salmonella spp. were not detected in any of the samples. STEC with Shiga toxin-encoding stx2 was detected in 2.7% of the samples. Yersinia enterocolitica was detected in 7.7% of the samples; however, all isolates were negative for ail, suggesting that they were non-pathogenic. Coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected in 34.4% of the samples, with an average concentration of 25 CFU/mL in the positive samples. Members of the B. cereus group were detected in 20.8% of the samples, with an average concentration of 1 CFU/mL in the positive samples. No relationship was detected between E. coli or the total bacterial count and the presence of pathogenic bacteria, which suggests that pathogens can be present also in farms with excellent production hygiene. Although the concentration of pathogenic bacteria in fresh raw milk was mainly relatively low, it should be borne in mind that some of the pathogenic bacteria can survive and multiply at refrigeration temperatures and may cause a disease with a very low infectious dose. Thus, consumption of raw milk and related products poses a potential risk for food poisoning.
TI  - Biofilm inhibitors that target amyloid proteins.
AB  - Bacteria establish stable communities, known as biofilms, that are resistant to antimicrobials. Biofilm robustness is due to the presence of an extracellular matrix, which for several species-among them Bacillus subtilis-includes amyloid-like protein fibers. In this work, we show that B. subtilis biofilms can be a simple and reliable tool for screening of molecules with antiamyloid activity. We identified two molecules, AA-861 and parthenolide, which efficiently inhibited biofilms by preventing the formation of amyloid-like fibers. Parthenolide also disrupted pre-established biofilms. These molecules also impeded the formation of biofilms of other bacterial species that secrete amyloid proteins, such as Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the identified molecules decreased the conversion of the yeast protein New1 to the prion state in a heterologous host, indicating the broad range of activity of the molecules.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of cinnamon powder on pathogen growth in laboratory media and oriental-style rice cakes (sulgidduk).
AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the use of natural plant materials as alternative food preservatives. We examined the antimicrobial effects of natural plant materials used as additives against foodborne pathogens in laboratory media and Sulgidduk, oriental-style rice cakes. Cinnamon, mugwort, and garlic powder solutions (3%) were tested for their antimicrobial activities against pathogens in laboratory media. Sulgidduk prepared with different amounts of cinnamon powder (1, 3, and 6%) was inoculated with a Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus cereus cocktail. The samples were air or vacuum packaged and stored at 22 +/- 1 degrees C for 72 h, and microbial growth was determined. Cinnamon powder showed more inhibitory properties against pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, and B. cereus than did mugwort or garlic powder. The populations of S. aureus and B. cereus in Sulgidduk containing cinnamon powder were significantly lower than in the control during storage time. Different packaging methods did not result in a significant difference in pathogen growth. In a sensory evaluation, Sulgidduk containing 1 and 3% cinnamon powder did not significantly differ from the control sample in any of the attributes tested other than flavor. These results indicate that natural plant materials such as cinnamon powder could be used as food additives to improve the microbiological stability of rice cakes.
TI  - Inactivation of foodborne pathogens in ground beef by cooking with highly controlled radio frequency energy.
AB  - The consumer demand for fresh tasting, high quality, low salt, preservative-free  meals which require minimal preparation time magnifies the safety concern and emphasizes the need to use innovative technologies for food processing. A modern technique to uniformly heat and cook foods is based on a combination of convection and controlled radio frequency (RF) energy. However any advantage conferred on meat cooked by this method would be lost if application of the technology results in decreased safety. Our main goal was to study the inactivation efficacy of this method of cooking against pathogens in ground meat in comparison to standard convection cooking. Meat balls were artificially inoculated with GFP expressing Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes as well as spores of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis and cooked by convection heating (220 degrees C, 40 min), by using energy generated from frequencies in the RF bandwidth (RF cooking, 7.5 min) or by combined heating (5.5 min), until the center temperature of each sample reached 73 degrees C. The mean reductions in total indigenous bacteria obtained by RF and convection were 2.8 and 2.5 log CFU/g, respectively. Cooking of meat balls with convection reduced the E. coli population (8 log CFU/g) by 5.5 log CFU/g, whilst treatment with RF reduced E. coli population to undetectable levels. The mean reductions of S. Typhimurium obtained by RF and convection were 5.7 and 6.5 log CFU/g, respectively. The combined treatment reduced the Salmonella population to undetectable levels. In contrast, L. monocytogenes was poorly affected by RF cooking. The mean reduction of L. monocytogenes obtained by RF energy was 0.4 log CFU/g, while convection cooking resulted in undetectable levels. Interestingly, the combined treatment also resulted with undetectable levels of Listeria although time of cooking was reduced by 86%. One-step cooking had negligible effects on the Bacillus spores and therefore a 2-step treatment of RF or convection was applied. This 2-step treatment proved to be efficient with 4.5 log CFU/g reduction for both RF and convection. In conclusion, here we show that combination of RF with convection cooking resulted in similar or even better effects on selected foodborne pathogens compared to convection only, while the time required for safe cooking is cut down by up to 86%. The equal or better results in the levels of all investigated pathogens using RF with convection compared with convection only suggest that this technology looks promising and safe for ground beef cooking.
TI  - Heterologous expression of CYP102A5 variant from Bacillus cereus CYPPB-1: Validation of model for predicting drug metabolism of human P450 probe substrates.
AB  - CYP102A5 variant (ADL27534) from isolated Bacillus cereus CYPPB-1 was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli Top 10 cells. Comparative sequence analysis of purified CYP102A5 variant with respect to reported CYP102A5 (AAP10153) from Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 revealed amino acid sequence changes at positions P245S and M318I of heme domain. The binding affinities of 15 selected human P450 probe substrates towards isolated CYP102A5 were analyzed in silico using a homology model together with molecular docking techniques to predict the human drug metabolism. In vitro analysis suggested that the purified CYP102A5 metabolizes typical substrates of human CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4, such as coumarin, propranolol, aniline, chlorzoxazone, p-nitrophenol, and nifedipine. The calculated K M values for propranolol, chloroxazone, coumarin, aniline, and 4-nitrophenol were calculated to be 0.962 +/- 0.041, 1.254 +/- 0.057, 2.859 +/- 0.083, 2.732 +/- 0.106, and 2.528 +/- 0.11 mM, respectively. Importantly, taking a ChemScore cutoff value of -31 kJ/mol, substrate binding at active site and in vitro activity as the distinguishing lines between "substrates" and "nonsubstrates" revealed one false-positive and one false-negative results out of the 15 compounds examined. This is the first report on validation of CYP102A family homology model for in silico prediction of human drug metabolism.
TI  - Changes in microbial contamination levels of porcine carcasses and fresh pork in  slaughterhouses, processing lines, retail outlets, and local markets by commercial distribution.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in microbial contamination levels of each porcine carcass and fresh pork in a general distribution process. A total of 100 commercial pigs were sampled (six sampling sites per individual, total 600 samples) at four sequential stages: slaughterhouse (after carcass grading and boning), processing line, retail outlet, and local market. No significant differences were observed in the contaminant percentages among sampling sites and sample collection years (P>0.05) with the exception of Bacillus cereus. The contaminant percentage of B. cereus at 1st collection year was higher than these of 2nd collection year (28.31% vs. 12.26%, P<0.05). B. cereus and Listeria monocytogenes were the most frequently detected pathogenic bacteria in the slaughterhouse and markets, respectively. On the other hand, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Yersinia enterocolitica were not detected in carcasses or pork collected from any carcass sites and pork samples. However, the frequency of pathogenic bacteria in end-products at local markets was not highly related to the initial contamination of porcine carcasses in the slaughterhouse. Thus, the improvement of microbial safety for pork end-products requires hygienic control of porcine carcasses and meat cutting during all operations in the slaughterhouse, processing line, retail outlet, and local market.
TI  - Supramolecular coordination and antimicrobial activities of constructed mixed ligand complexes.
AB  - A novel series of copper(II) and palladium(II) with 4-derivatives benzaldehyde pyrazolone (L(n)) were synthesized. The mixed ligand complexes were prepared by using 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen) as second ligand. The structure of these complexes was identified and confirm by elemental analysis, molar conductivity, UV-Vis, IR and (1)H NMR spectroscopy and magnetic moment measurements as well as thermal analysis. The ligand behaves as a neutral bidentate ligand through ON donor sites. ESR spectra show the simultaneous presence of a planar trans and a nearly planar cis isomers in the 1:2 ratio for all N,O complexes [Cu(L(n))(2)]Cl(2)2H(2)O. Schiff bases (L(n)) were tested against bacterial species; namely two Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and two Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungal species (Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporium, Penicillium italicum and Alternaria alternata). The tested compounds have antibacterial activity against S. aureus, B. cereus and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Synthesis, pharmacological activity evaluation and molecular modeling of new polynuclear heterocyclic compounds containing benzimidazole derivatives.
AB  - Novel heterocyclic compounds containing benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized from 2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl) acetonitrile (1) and arylhydrazononitrile derivative 2 was obtained via coupling of 1 with 4-methyl phenyldiazonium salt, which was then reacted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride to give amidooxime derivative 3. This product was cyclized into the corresponding oxadiazole derivative 4 upon reflux in acetic anhydride. Compound 4 was refluxed in DMF in the presence of triethylamine to give the corresponding 5-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-2-p-tolyl-2H-1,2,3-triazol-4-amine 6. Treatment of compound 6 with ethyl chloroformate afforded 2,6-dihydro-2-(4-methylphenyl)-1,2,3-triazolo[4",5"-4',5']pyrimido[1,6-a]benzimid azole-5(4H)-one (8). 1,2-bis(2-cyanomethyl-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)ethane-1,2-dione (10) was synthesized via the condensation reaction of 2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl) acetonitrile (1) and diethyloxalate. The reactivity of compound 10 towards some diamine reagents was studied. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds was investigated against several pathogenic bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella typhimurium, E. coli O119, S. paratyphi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus. The results of MIC revealed that compounds 12a-c showed the most effective antimicrobial activity against tested strains. On the other hand, compounds 12a, b exhibited high activity against rotavirus Wa strain while compounds 12b, c exhibited high activity against adenovirus type 7. In silico target prediction, docking and validation of the compounds 12a-c were performed. The dialkylglycine decarboxylase bacterial enzyme was predicted as a potential bacterial target receptor using pharmacophore-based correspondence with previous leads; giving the highest normalized scores and a high correlation docking score with mean inhibition concentrations. A novel binding mechanism was predicted after docking using the MOE software and its validation.
TI  - DNA extract characterization process for microbial detection methods development  and validation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays used in pathogen detection require rigorous methods development including characterizing DNA extraction products. A DNA extract characterization process is demonstrated using DNA extracted from five different cells types (two Gram-negatives: Escherichia coli, and Burkholderia thailandensis, spores and vegetative cells from the Gram-positive Bacillus cereus, and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae) with six different methods. RESULTS: DNA extract quantity (concentration and extraction efficiency) and quality (purity and intactness) varied by cell type and extraction method enabling the demonstration of different DNA characterization methods. DNA purity was measured using UV spectroscopy, where the A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios are indicators of different contaminants. Reproducibility of UV spectroscopy measurements decreased for DNA concentrations less than 17.5 ng/muL. Forty-seven extracts had concentrations greater than 17.5 ng/muL, 25 had A260/A280 above 2.0, and 28 had A260/A230 ratios below 1.8 indicating RNA and polysaccharide contamination respectively. Based on a qPCR inhibition assay the contaminants did not inhibit PCR. Extract intactness was evaluated using microfluidic gel electrophoresis. Thirty-five samples had concentrations above the limit of quantification (LOQ, roughly 11 ng/ muL), 93.5% of the DNA was larger than 1kb and 1% was smaller than 300 bp. Extract concentrations ranged from 1502.2 ng/muL to below the LOQ when UV spectroscopy, fluorometry, and qPCR were used. LOQ for UV spectroscopic and fluorometric measurements were 3.5 ng/muL and 0.25 ng/muL respectively. The qPCR LOQ varied by cell type (5.72 x 10-3 ng/muL for E. coli, 2.66 x 10-3 ng/muL, for B. cereus, 3.78 x 10-3 ng/muL for B. thailandensis, and 7.67 x 10-4 ng/muL for S. cerevisiae). A number of samples were below the UV spectroscopy (n = 27), flurometry (n = 15), and qPCR (n = 3) LOQ. CONCLUSION: The presented DNA extract characterization process provides measures of DNA quantity and quality applicable to microbial detection methods development and validation studies. Evaluating DNA quality and quantity results in a better understanding of process LOD and contributing factors to suboptimal assay performance. The samples used demonstrated the use of different DNA characterization methods presented but did not encompass the full range of DNA extract characteristics.
TI  - Production of medium chain saturated fatty acids with enhanced antimicrobial activity from crude coconut fat by solid state cultivation of Yarrowia lipolytica.
AB  - Fatty acids profiles and antimicrobial activity of crude coconut fat hydrolysates obtained in solid-state cultivation system with a selected yeast strain Yarrowia lipolytica RO13 were performed. A preliminary step regarding extracellular lipase production and solid state enzymatic hydrolysis of crude fat at different water activity and time intervals up to 7 days was also applied. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was used for quantification of medium chain saturated fatty acids (MCSFAs) and the results revealed a higher concentration of about 70% lauric acid from total fatty acids. Further, antimicrobial activity of fatty acids against some food-borne pathogens (Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus) was evaluated. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the obtained hydrolysates varied from 12.5 to 1.56 ppm, significantly lower than values reported in literature. The results provide substantial evidence for obtaining biopreservative effects by coconut fat enzymatic hydrolysis.
TI  - [Synthesis and antimicrobial ivestigation of 8-quinolinols glucosaminides].
AB  - In the phase transfer system solid calcium carbonate--acetonitrile per acetylated O-beta-D-glucosaminides of 8-quinolinol, 2-methyl-8-quinolinol and 5-chloro-8-quinolinol were synthesized. Zemplen deacetylation was led to corresponding trioles. Obtained O-beta-D-glucosaminides were identified with 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Antimicrobial activity of deacetylated forms has been studied in a test of inhibition of bioluminescence of marine luminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri F1 and method of the serial breeding on the museum steams of Escherichia coli, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus. It was established that glycosylation decrease antimicrobial activity in comparison with non-glycosilated 8-quinolinols.
TI  - Role of the moth fly Clogmia albipunctata (Diptera: Psychodinae) as a mechanical  vector of bacterial pathogens in German hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The formerly Mediterranean moth fly species Clogmia albipunctata (Diptera: Psychodidae) is now present in Germany, where it has become a common, year-round pest in hospital buildings. AIM: To investigate the potential of C. albipunctata to transport and transmit bacterial pathogens in infested German hospitals. METHODS: From June 2011 to May 2012, 271 adult C. albipunctata were collected from four infested hospitals and analysed qualitatively and, in part, quantitatively, for bacterial colonization. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for selected nosocomial pathogens. FINDINGS: Forty-five bacterial species representing 40 genera were found to be colonizing C. albipunctata. Among the bacteria isolated were Acinetobacter baumannii, Aeromonas hydrophila, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, with colonization rates of 0-17.5%, 0-16.7%, 0-12.5%, 0-62.1%, 0-2.5%, 0-4.1%, 0-12.5%, 0-7.6% and 0-10%, respectively. Additionally, one strain of both Yersinia frederiksenii and Nocardia spp. was detected. Unlike 11 strains of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) S. maltophilia collected from one hospital, no MDR Enterobacteriaceae were isolated. Acinetobacter spp. colonized C. albipunctata at rates from 2.9% to 36.8%, and revealed a high affinity for the exoskeleton, with up to 2080 colony-forming units per moth fly for A. baumannii. CONCLUSION: C. albipunctata is a potential mechanical vector of bacterial pathogens associated with nosocomial infections.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant activities of the ethanol extract of the stem bark of Clausena heptaphylla.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is wide spread interest in drugs derived from plants as green medicine is believed to be safe and dependable, compared with costly synthetic drugs that have adverse effects. METHODS: We have attempted to evaluate the antioxidant, In vitro thrombolytic, antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic effects of Clausena heptaphylla (Rutaceae) stem bark extract ethanol extract. RESULTS: Ethanolic stem bark extract of Clausena heptaphylla (CHET) contains flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins and steroids but it lacks tannins, anthraquinones and resins. Phenol content of the extract was 13.42 mg/g and flavonoid content was 68.9 mg/g. CHET exhibited significant DPPH free radical scavenging activity with IC50 value of 3.11 mug/ml. Reducing power of CHET was also moderately stronger. In the cytotoxicity assay, LC50 and Chi-square value of the ethanolic extract against brine shrimp nauplii were 144.1461 mug/ml and 0.8533 demonstrating potent cytotoxic effect of the extract. In vitro thrombolytic activity of CHET is significant with 45.38% clot lysis capability compared to that of Streptokinase (65.78%). In antibacterial screening, moderate zone of inhibition (6.5-9.0 mm in diameter) was observed against gram-positive Bacillus subtilis ATCC 11774, Bacillus cereus ATCC 10876, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus polymyxa ATCC 842 and Bacillus megaterium ATCC 13578 and less promising zone of inhibition (3.0-4.5 mm in diameter) against gram-negative Salmonella typhi ATCC 65154, Shigella flexneri ATCC 12022, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 13315 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Shigella sonnei ATCC 8992 did not show any sensitivity. The MIC values against these bacteria were ranged from 2,000 to 3,500 mug/ml. The extract showed significant zone of inhibition against Rhizopus oryzae DSM 2200, Aspergillus niger DSM 737 and Aspergillus ochraceus DSM 824 in antifungal assay. CONCLUSIONS: Further advanced research is necessary to isolate and characterize the chemical components responsible for the therapeutic properties of the plant.
TI  - Probiotic potential of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from Brazilian regional ovine  cheese.
AB  - Twelve Lactobacillus isolates from Brazilian starter-free ovine cheeses were evaluated for their probiotic potential. The strains were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Lactobacillus plantarum (7), Lb. brevis (2), Lb. casei (2) and Lb. parabuchneri (1). All strains showed variable resistance to gastric juices and relative tolerance to pancreatin and bile salts. Only five strains of Lb. plantarum could not deconjugate the sodium salt of taurodeoxycholic acid. Autoaggregation ability after 24 h was above 50% and hydrophobicity was higher than 60% for most strains. All lactobacilli could inhibit linolenic acid oxidation, except Lb. parabuchneri strain, whereas none of them could scavenge DPPH radical. beta-Galactosidase activity ranged from 47.7 to 2503 Miller units. Inhibition of food pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium was demonstrated and the production of organic acids could be associated with this effect. The Lactobacillus strains from Brazilian regional ovine cheese showed interesting functional characteristics, mainly the strains Lb. brevis SM-B and Lb. plantarum SM-I. Both presented high acid tolerance. In addition, Lb. brevis SM-B also displayed remarkable antioxidant activity and Lb. plantarum SM-I was the highest beta-galactosidase producer, exhibited high autoaggregation and hydrophobicity properties.
TI  - Complementary screening, identification and application of a novel class II 5-enopyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - A novel aroA gene encoding 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase from Bacillus cereus was identified and overexpressed by genomic library construction and complementary screening. The enzyme was then purified to homogeneity. We also transformed the aroA ( B. cereus ) gene into Arabidopsis thaliana by a floral dip method, and demonstrated that transgenic A. thaliana plants exhibited significant glyphosate resistance compared with the wild type. These results strongly suggested that the strategy was highly efficient and advantageous for rapidly cloning aroA genes from microorganisms in natural environments.
TI  - Design, structural and spectroscopic elucidation, and the in vitro biological activities of new diorganotin dithiocarbamates.
AB  - The reaction of 2,2-dimethoxy-N-methylethyllamine or 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane with  CS(2) in alkaline media produced two novel dithiocarbamate salts. Subsequent reactions with organotin halides yielded six new complexes: [SnMe(2){S(2)CNR(R(1))(2)}(2)] (1), [Sn(n-Bu)(2){S(2)CNR(R(1))(2)}(2)] (2), [SnPh(2){S(2)CNR(R(1))(2)}(2)] (3), [SnMe(2){S(2)CNR(R(2))(2)}(2)] (4), [Sn(n-Bu)(2){S(2)CNR(R(2))(2)}(2)] (5), [SnPh(2){S(2)CNR(R(2))(2)}(2)] (6), where R = methyl, R(1) = CH(2)CH(OMe)(2), and R(2) = 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane. All compounds were identified in terms of infrared, (1)H and (13)C NMR, and the complexes were also characterized using (119)Sn NMR, (119)Sn Mossbauer and X-ray crystallography. The biological activity of all derivatives has been screened in terms of IC(90) and IC(50) against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus parasiticus, Penicillium citrinum, Curvularia senegalensis, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the results correlated well with a performed study of structure-activity relationship (SAR). Complexes (3), (5) and (6) displayed the best IC(90) and IC(50) in the presence of the fungi, greater than that of miconazole, used as control drug.
TI  - Essential oil variation in the populations of Artemisia spicigera from northwest  of Iran: chemical composition and antibacterial activity.
AB  - CONTEXT: Artemisia spicigera C. Koch (Asteraceae) is a perennial shrubby herb and is generally distributed in Armenia, Iran, and Middle Anatolia. This species traditionally has been used in medicines. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research is to study the chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from Artemisia spicigera populations in northwest of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The essential oil of A. spicigera was obtained by hydrodistillation from eight populations collected from different regions of East Azerbaijan and West Azerbaijan provinces (Iran) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antibacterial activity of the oils was investigated against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria using MIC determinations and the agar-gel diffusion method. RESULTS: Fourteen compounds were identified as the main components of the essential oils and the most abundant constituents are 1,8-cineole, camphor, alpha-thujone, camphene, beta-thujone and p-cymene. Essential oil of population No. 1 showed the highest activity against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus but the highest activity against St. saprophyticus, Bacillus megaterium, and B. cereus was found with population No. 6 and for Citrobacter amalonaficus with population No. 5. MIC values of essential oils ranged from 6 microg/mL against Bacillus megaterium to 12 microg/mL against Citrobacter amalonaficus. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the occurrence of 1,8-cineole/camphor/camphene chemotype of A. spicigera but there is also significant chemical variation between the studied populations. The findings showed the studied oils have good antibacterial activity, and thus potential to be used as natural health products.
TI  - Synthesis of quinoline derivatives of tetrahydrocurcumin and zingerone and evaluation of their antioxidant and antibacterial attributes.
AB  - Tetrahydrocurcumin (THC, 1) and zingerone (2) are biologically active molecules originating from the important spices turmeric and ginger, respectively. Novel quinoline derivatives of THC and zingerone have been synthesised by an efficient protocol involving their reaction with substituted 2-aminobenzophenones and 2-aminoacetophenone. Radical-scavenging activities (RSA) of THC, zingerone and their quinoline derivatives were evaluated. The amino-substituted quinoline derivative of THC, 1e, showed antioxidant activity superior to those of 1 and 1a. Derivatives 1b, 1c, 1d and 1f exhibited relatively lower RSA at equimolar concentrations ( approximately 50-55 mumol). A similar trend was also seen in zingerone (2) and its derivatives (2a-2e), with 2e displaying the best RSA. Derivatives of THC (1a-1f) showed stronger antimicrobial activity than THC (1) against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Also, derivatives of zingerone (2b-2e) exhibited lower minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values than zingerone (2) and its derivative, 2a for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The molecules may have potential pharmacological applications.
TI  - Rapid detection and respirometric profiling of aerobic bacteria on panels of selective media.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate high-throughput optical oxygen microrespirometry for selective  detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using GreenLight probe, standard 384-well plates and time-resolved fluorescence reader, a representative panel of 16 partially selective media and 9 aerobic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Listeria innocua) were analysed. For each medium, bacterial strain and dilution, growth profiles were recorded, from which calibrations, doubling/generation times and growth patterns in different media were determined. Analytical performance, selectivity and general usability of the method were assessed, and mixed bacterial cultures were analysed. CONCLUSION: The microrespirometry platform facilitates simple, real-time detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria by looking at the patterns of their growth and respiration in several media and determining their growth and doubling times. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The new screening method can be used for routine microbiological analysis and testing of aerobic bacterial cultures as well as complex food, environmental and clinical samples.
TI  - Chemical composition and antioxidative activity of Echinophora platyloba DC. essential oil, and its interaction with natural antimicrobials against food-borne pathogens and spoilage organisms.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the chemical composition and antioxidative capacity of Echinophora platyloba DC. essential oil, and its antimicrobial potency against Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Rhodotorula rubra, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. The essential oil was analyzed by GC and GC-MS; and evaluated for its antioxidative and antimicrobial (singly or in combination with chitosan, nisin, monolaurin, or amphotericin B) activity. Thirty-three components were characterized representing 95.69% of the total oil composition in which thymol, trans-ocimene, carvacrol, and (E)-sesqui-lavandulol were the major constituents. The oil exhibited high scavenging (IC(50): 49.7 +/- 2.3 mug/mL) and relative antioxidative activity (RAA%: 85.21 +/- 0.4) in 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals and beta-carotene/linoleic acid bleaching assays, respectively. The oil showed antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes, B. cereus, B. subtilis, S. aureus, S. typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7, P. aeruginosa, C. albicans, C. tropicalis, R. Rubra, and R. mucilaginosa. Moreover, R. mucilaginosa and P. aeruginosa were the most susceptible and most resistant organisms, respectively. Regarding the checkerboard data, 47 fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICIs) (</= 0.5) indicated synergistic, whereas 7 FICIs (>0.5 to 1) indicated additive effect. Consequently, E. platyloba DC. essential oil could be used as a recommended natural antioxidant and antimicrobial substance for food preservation.
TI  - Postprocessing microflora of commercial attieke (a fermented cassava product) produced in the south of Cote d'Ivoire.
AB  - The distribution and presence of hygiene indicator and pathogenic micro-organisms in 375 samples of attieke marketed in Cote d'Ivoire, and their roles in the food poisoning were evaluated. Microbiological analyses were carried out, which included the total viable bacteria, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Bacillus spores, fungi and Clostridium perfringens. The results revealed that the viable bacteria counts ranged from 2.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(5) to 3.4 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) CFU g(-1), while the yeasts and the moulds counts ranged, respectively, from 2.4 +/- 0.12 x 10(4) to 9.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(5) CFU g(-1) and 1.3 +/- 0.7 x 10(1) to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(2) CFU g(-1). Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundi, Enterobacter amnigenus, Citrobacter youngae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella oxytoca were the bacteria isolated, and Rhizopus spp., Mucor spp., Thamnidium spp., Fusarium spp., Moniliella spp. the fungi. Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were not found. The occurrence of some bacteria and fungi illustrate that attieke collected in Cote d'Ivoire markets may act as a reservoir of pathogenic micro-organisms for human. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently on attieke and even more the need to apply correct HACCP system during the production. Attieke is especially a well-known product in West Africa; hence, it is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health. Overall, the study highlighted the need for effective communication on microbiological food risks, proper instruction and supervision in food-handling procedures, greater education on food safety risks.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Salvia x jamensis essential oil.
AB  - This is the first report about the composition of the essential oil of Salvia x jamensis. The major compounds identified by GC-MS were beta-caryophyllene (14.8 %), beta-pinene (6.8 %), caryophyllene oxide (6.0 %), delta-cadinene (5.5 %), alpha-pinene (5.2 %) and spatulenol (5.2 %). The oil showed antimicrobial activity against three Gram (+) bacteria: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis, and three Candida strains: C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, while it was inactive against three Gram (-) bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - Changes in microbial contamination levels and prevalence of foodborne pathogens in alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and rapeseed (Brassica napus) during sprout production in manufacturing plants.
AB  - Samples were taken from three sprout processing plants at five different stages of production (a total of 20 investigations). Quantitative analyses comprised aerobic plate counts (APCs) and the measurement of coliforms and Bacillus cereus levels, whereas qualitative analyses involved assessing the levels of Escherichia coli and major foodborne pathogens (E. coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus aureus). The APC for alfalfa seeds (3.71-4.61 log CFU g(-1)) and rapeseed (4.25-5.11 log CFU g(-1)) increased by approximately 3 log CFU g(-1) during sprouting, reaching 7.17-7.61 and 7.33-8.28 log CFU g(-1), respectively, by the final stage of production. Similarly, increasing trends were noted in the level of coliforms (0.58-4.03 log CFU g(-1) at the seed stage, increasing to 5.52-6.99 log CFU g(-1) by the sprout stage). Bacillus cereus was detected in eight alfalfa (40%) and 14 rapeseed (70%) sprouts, and L. monocytogenes was isolated from one pregermination soaked alfalfa seed. A slight reduction in the level of bacterial contamination was noted after washing the sprouts with water prior to storage, indicating that improvements to the current washing protocol, or other efficient intervention methods, may be needed. Taken together, these results suggest that improved hygiene control during production and processing and a more sanitary environment are needed. The present study provides comprehensive information regarding the microbiological safety of seeds and sprouts during manufacturing. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The present study investigated the levels of microbial contamination present in alfalfa and rapeseed sprouts by examining the samples taken at different stages of the manufacturing process in three actual plants. The results provide detailed information regarding the levels of seed and sprout contamination during production. The results may be useful to those involved in the sprout industry and/or academic research in terms of developing hygienic control measures, efficient intervention methods and appropriate guidelines.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and composition profile of grape (Vitis vinifera) pomace extracts obtained by supercritical fluids.
AB  - The possibility of increasing the aggregated value of the huge amount of residues generated by wineries around the world foment studies using the grape pomace - the residue from the wine production, composed by seed, skin and stems - to obtain functional ingredients. Nowadays, consumers in general prefer natural and safe products mainly for food and cosmetic fields, where the supercritical fluid extraction is of great importance due to the purity of the extracts provided. Therefore, the objective of this work is to evaluate the global extraction yield, the antimicrobial activity and the composition profile of Merlot and Syrah grape pomace extracts obtained by supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) and CO2 added with co-solvent at pressures up to 300 bar and temperatures of 50 and 60 degrees C. The results were compared with the ones obtained by Soxhlet and by ultrasound-assisted leaching extraction methods. The main components from the extracts, identified by HPLC, were gallic acid, p-OH-benzoic acid, vanillic acid and epicatechin. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the extracts were evaluated using four strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and three fungi strains (Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei). Despite lower extraction yield results, the supercritical fluid extracts presented the highest antimicrobial effectiveness compared to the other grape pomace extracts due to the presence of antimicrobial active compounds. Syrah extracts were less efficient against the microorganisms tested and Merlot extracts were more active against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - A mimicking-of-DNA-methylation-patterns pipeline for overcoming the restriction barrier of bacteria.
AB  - Genetic transformation of bacteria harboring multiple Restriction-Modification (R-M) systems is often difficult using conventional methods. Here, we describe a mimicking-of-DNA-methylation-patterns (MoDMP) pipeline to address this problem in three difficult-to-transform bacterial strains. Twenty-four putative DNA methyltransferases (MTases) from these difficult-to-transform strains were cloned and expressed in an Escherichia coli strain lacking all of the known R-M systems and orphan MTases. Thirteen of these MTases exhibited DNA modification activity in Southwestern dot blot or Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) assays. The active MTase genes were assembled into three operons using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA assembler and were co-expressed in the E. coli strain lacking known R-M systems and orphan MTases. Thereafter, results from the dot blot and restriction enzyme digestion assays indicated that the DNA methylation patterns of the difficult-to-transform strains are mimicked in these E. coli hosts. The transformation of the Gram-positive Bacillus amyloliquefaciens TA208 and B. cereus ATCC 10987 strains with the shuttle plasmids prepared from MoDMP hosts showed increased efficiencies (up to four orders of magnitude) compared to those using the plasmids prepared from the E. coli strain lacking known R-M systems and orphan MTases or its parental strain. Additionally, the gene coding for uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (upp) was directly inactivated using non-replicative plasmids prepared from the MoDMP host in B. amyloliquefaciens TA208. Moreover, the Gram-negative chemoautotrophic Nitrobacter hamburgensis strain X14 was transformed and expressed Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Finally, the sequence specificities of active MTases were identified by restriction enzyme digestion, making the MoDMP system potentially useful for other strains. The effectiveness of the MoDMP pipeline in different bacterial groups suggests a universal potential. This pipeline could facilitate the functional genomics of the strains that are difficult to transform.
TI  - Bacillus cereus iron uptake protein fishes out an unstable ferric citrate trimer.
AB  - Citrate is a common biomolecule that chelates Fe(III). Many bacteria and plants use ferric citrate to fulfill their nutritional requirement for iron. Only the Escherichia coli ferric citrate outer-membrane transport protein FecA has been characterized; little is known about other ferric citrate-binding proteins. Here we report a unique siderophore-binding protein from the gram-positive pathogenic bacterium Bacillus cereus that binds multinuclear ferric citrate complexes. We have demonstrated that B. cereus ATCC 14579 takes up (55)Fe radiolabeled ferric citrate and that a protein, BC_3466 [renamed FctC (ferric citrate-binding protein C)], binds ferric citrate. The dissociation constant (K(d)) of FctC at pH 7.4 with ferric citrate (molar ratio 1:50) is 2.6 nM. This is the tightest binding observed of any B. cereus siderophore-binding protein. Nano electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (nano ESI-MS) analysis of FctC and ferric citrate complexes or citrate alone show that FctC binds diferric di-citrate, and triferric tricitrate, but does not bind ferric di-citrate, ferric monocitrate, or citrate alone. Significantly, the protein selectively binds triferric tricitrate even though this species is naturally present at very low equilibrium concentrations.
TI  - A piscidin-like antimicrobial peptide from the icefish Chionodraco hamatus (Perciformes: Channichthyidae): molecular characterization, localization and bactericidal activity.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered one of the most ancient components of the innate immune system. They are able to exert their protection activity against a variety of microorganisms, and are widely distributed in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In this paper we focused on an AMP identified in the Antarctic teleost Chionodraco hamatus, an icefish species. The cDNA sequence of the AMP, named chionodracine, is comprised of 515 bp and translates for a putative protein precursor of 80 amino acids, with a signal peptide of 22 amino acids. The structural features evidenced in the primary sequence of chionodracine lead to the inclusion of the peptide in the antimicrobial family of piscidins. The analysis by real-time PCR of the basal gene transcripts of chionodracine in different icefish tissues showed that the highest expression was found in gills, followed by head kidney. The chionodracine expression levels in head kidney leukocytes were up-regulated in vitro both by LPS and poly I:C, and in vivo by LPS. A putative chionodracine mature peptide was synthesized and employed to obtain a polyclonal antiserum, which was used in immunohistochemistry of gills sections and revealed a significant positivity associated with mast cells. The bactericidal activity of the peptide was investigated and found significant against Antarctic psychrophilic bacteria strains (Psychrobacter sp. TAD1 and TA144), the Gram-positive Bacillus cereus, and at a lesser extent against the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Interestingly, the haemolytic activity of chionodracine was tested in vitro on human erythrocytes and no significant lysis occurred until peptide concentration of 50 muM.
TI  - Taiwanofungus camphorata nitroreductase: cDNA cloning and biochemical characterisation.
AB  - Nitroreductases (Nrs) play important roles in redox system via NADPH or NADH as a reductant. A TcNr cDNA encoding a putative Nr was cloned from Taiwanofungus camphorata. A 3-D structural model of the TcNr has been created based on the known structure of BcNr (Bacillus cereus). To characterise the TcNr, the coding region was subcloned into an expression vector and transformed into Escherichia coli. The recombinant His(6)-tagged TcNr was purified by Ni affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme showed a single band at molecular mass of approximately 25 kDa on 12% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme exhibited Nr activity via ferricyanide assay. The Michaelis constant (K(M)) value for ferricyanide was 0.86 mM. The enzyme(')s half-life of deactivation at 45 degrees C was 12.3 min. The enzyme was most active at pH 6. The enzyme's preferred substrate is 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene.
TI  - Comparison of sample preparation methods for the recovery of foodborne pathogens  from fresh produce.
AB  - Sample preparation methods (pummeling, pulsifying, sonication, and shaking by hand) were compared for achieving maximum recovery of foodborne pathogens from iceberg lettuce, perilla leaves, cucumber, green pepper, and cherry tomato. Antimicrobial and dehydration effects also were examined to investigate causes of poor recovery of pathogens. Each produce type was inoculated with Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus at 6.0 log CFU/cm(2), and samples were prepared using the four methods. Bacterial populations recovered from the five types of produce were significantly different (P < 0.05) according to sample preparation methods and produce type. The bacterial populations recovered from pummeled and pulsified samples were higher (P < 0.05) than those recovered from sonicated and hand-shaken samples, except for cherry tomato. The number of bacteria recovered from produce was reduced (P < 0.05) from that of the inoculum by 0.16 to 2.69 log CFU/cm(2). Although extracts of iceberg lettuce, perilla leaves, cucumber, and green pepper had no antimicrobial activity, the populations of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, B. cereus, and L. monocytogenes in cherry tomato extract were slightly reduced after these treatments (P < 0.05). The pathogen populations on perilla leaves and cherry tomatoes decreased by >2 log CFU/cm(2) after exposure to 40% relative humidity for 1 h. No reduction was observed when the five pathogens were exposed to 90% relative humidity. These data suggest that pummeling and pulsifying are optimal sample preparation methods for detection of microorganisms. Acidic produce such as cherry tomato should be treated with a method that does not cause sample breakdown so that acid stress on the bacteria can be minimized. Dehydration stress also affects recovery of pathogens from produce.
TI  - Phytochemical profiles of volatile constituents from Centaurea ragusina leaves and flowers and their antimicrobial effects.
AB  - The volatile oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of the Croatian endemic plant Centaurea ragusina L. were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. The chemical compositions, determined by GC and GC-MS, were complex, with sesquiterpenes the most abundant class of compound. Nonterpene hydrocarbons were also identified in high quantities, while acids and ketones were found in high quantities only in the leaf volatile oil. Aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other compounds were identified in lower quantities. Antimicrobial effects of the volatile samples were investigated by using the disc diffusion and microdilution assays. They were found to inhibit a wide range of bacteria and fungi, causing in vitro growth inhibition at a concentration of 250 microg/mL. The volatile oils displayed great antibacterial potential with MIC values ranging from 16 to 128 microg/mL against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, and lesser activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Cronobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal strains (MIC = 32-128 microg/mL).
TI  - Influence of substituent effects on spectroscopic properties and antimicrobial activity of 5-(4'-substituted phenylazo)-2-thioxothiazolidinone derivatives.
AB  - 5-(4'-substituted phenylazo)-2-thioxothiazolidinone derivatives (HL(n)) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, spectra (IR, electronic and (1)H NMR). The IR spectral data indicate that the compounds can exist in two resonance structures. The synthesized ligands were screened for their antimicrobial activity against four bacterial species, two Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) and two Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) as well as against some species various of fungi; Aspergillus niger, Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium italicum and Fusarium oxysporium. The results showed that most these ligands are good antibacterial agents against B. cereus and S. aureus and antifungal agents against A. niger and F. oxysporium. HL(3) was found to be the most effect compound against all tested microorganisms. The size of clear zone were ordered as follows p-(OCH(3) < CH(3) < H < Cl < NO(2)) as expected from Hammett's constant sigma(R).
TI  - The BioC O-methyltransferase catalyzes methyl esterification of malonyl-acyl carrier protein, an essential step in biotin synthesis.
AB  - Recent work implicated the Escherichia coli BioC protein as the initiator of the  synthetic pathway that forms the pimeloyl moiety of biotin (Lin, S., Hanson, R. E., and Cronan, J. E. (2010) Nat. Chem. Biol. 6, 682-688). BioC was believed to be an O-methyltransferase that methylated the free carboxyl of either malonyl-CoA or malonyl-acyl carrier protein based on the ability of O-methylated (but not unmethylated) precursors to bypass the BioC requirement for biotin synthesis both in vivo and in vitro. However, only indirect proof of the hypothesized enzymatic activity was obtained because the activities of the available BioC preparations were too low for direct enzymatic assay. Because E. coli BioC protein was extremely recalcitrant to purification in an active form, BioC homologues of other bacteria were tested. We report that the native form of Bacillus cereus ATCC10987 BioC functionally replaced E. coli BioC in vivo, and the protein could be expressed in soluble form and purified to homogeneity. In disagreement with prior scenarios that favored malonyl-CoA as the methyl acceptor, malonyl-acyl carrier protein was a far better acceptor of methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine than was malonyl-CoA. BioC was specific for the malonyl moiety and was inhibited by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and sinefungin. High level expression of B. cereus BioC in E. coli blocked cell growth and fatty acid synthesis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  - The biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic LAB from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.LAB were isolated using MRS and M17 media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) producing LAB using Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua as indicator organisms. Out of 138 LAB isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C against L. innocua, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against Penicillium expansum, Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. The effect of selected LAB strains on L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.Twenty percent of our isolates produced BLS inhibiting the growth of L. innocua and/or Lact. sakei. Organic acids and/or H2O2 produced by LAB and not the BLS had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of E. coli. Ent. faecium, Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. Bacteriocinogenic LAB present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
TI  - Bio-based nanoemulsion formulation, characterization and antibacterial activity against food-borne pathogens.
AB  - The current study deals with the formulation and characterization of bio-based oil in water nanoemulsion and its potential antibacterial activity. A typical v/v% of eucalyptus oil (16.66%), Tween 80 (16.66%), and water (68.68%) was prepared by ultrasonication method. The mean droplet size was 17.1 nm as confirmed by dynamic light scattering. Different concentrations of the formulation ranging from undiluted to 10-, 100-, and 1000-fold dilutions were used to check the antibacterial activity in three different microorganisms, namely, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative). All three species showed a 100% bactericidal at the 10-fold dilution of the nanoemulsion formulation in the following order: B. cereus at 0th min, S. aureus at 15 min and E. coli at 1 h, respectively. A 10-fold dilution of the nanoemulsion showed that, the cytoplasmic content leakage from the bacterial species was high for S. aureus when compared to B. cereus and E. coli as determined by UV-Vis spectroscopic method. Fluorescence microscopic technique further confirmed this study.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of the NheA component of the Nhe toxin from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - The nonhaemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) of Bacillus cereus plays a key role in cases  of B. cereus food poisoning. The toxin is comprised of three different proteins: NheA, NheB and NheC. Here, the expression in Escherichia coli, purification and crystallization of the NheA protein are reported. The protein was crystallized by the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method using PEG 3350 as a precipitant. The crystals of NheA diffracted to 2.05 A resolution and belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 308.7, b = 58.2, c = 172.9 A, beta = 110.6 degrees . Calculation of V(M) values suggests that there are approximately eight protein molecules per asymmetric unit.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - [Bacteriological quality and toxigenic Bacillus cereus detection in cooked white  rice sold at the metropolitan area of San Jose, Costa Rica].
AB  - The wide use of rice is one of the factors that favors its implication in food borne diseases, and one of the most important pathogens associated to it is Bacillus cereus. The aim of this work was to evaluate the microbiological quality of 50 samples of white cooked rice sold in restaurants at the Metropolitan Area of San Jose, Costa Rica, including the determination of the total aerobic plate count, the Most Probable Number of total and fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli. MPN of Bacillus cereus and the detection of nheA, nheB and nHeC genes, associated to its toxicity, was also performed. Procedures described in the Compendium of Methods for the Microbiological Examination of Foods were followed for the bacteriological analysis, multiplex PCR was used for the detection of genes following the methodology described by Hansen et al, 2001. 46% of the samples analysed were positive for total coliforms, 34% for fecal coliforms, 16% for E. coli and 10% for B. cereus, being 8% toxigenic. These facts suggest that white cooked rice may represent a risk for Pubic Health and that improvements shall be performed in order to offer a safe and high quality product to consumers.
TI  - Chemical composition, antibacterial and antifungal activities of essential oil from Cordia verbenacea DC leaves.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cordia verbenacea is a Brazilian coastal shrub popularly known as "erva baleeira". The essential oil from fresh leaves was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by CG/MS. The main components were identified as beta-caryophyllene (25.4%), bicyclogermacrene (11.3%), delta-cadinene (9.%) and alpha-pinene (9.5%). In this study, the antimicrobial activity of Cordia verbenacea was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the essential oil was obtained using the broth microdilution assay (from 512 to 8 mug/ml). RESULTS: The results showed that the essential oil presented fungistatic activity against Candida albicans and Candida krusei and antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and against multiresistant Gram-negative (Escherichia coli 27), in all tests the MIC was 64 mug/ml. When the essential oil was associated to aminoglycosides (subinhibitory concentrations, MIC/8), a synergic and antagonic activity was verified. The synergic effect was observed to the amikacin association (MIC reduction from 256 mlto 64 mug/ml) in all strains tested. CONCLUSION: The essential oil of Cordia verbenacea influences the activity of antibiotics and may be used as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy against respiratory tract bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Linum pubescens growing wild in Jordan.
AB  - The volatile constituents of the aerial flowering parts of Linum pubescens were collected by hydro-distillation and analysed by GC and GC/MS. Analysis allowed the identification of 68 components of which, geranyl isovalerate (18.93%), lauric acid (12.07%), germacrene D (10.61%), decanoic acid (8.07%), 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone (5.02%) and 1-hexanol (4.99%) were detected as major constituents. The isolated essential oil of the plant exhibited high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus ATCC11778, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 2923) and showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 13048 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 10031).
TI  - Exposure to Anacardiaceae volatile oils and their constituents induces lipid peroxidation within food-borne bacteria cells.
AB  - The chemical composition of the volatile oils from five Anacardiaceae species and their activities against Gram positive and negative bacteria were assessed. The peroxidative damage within bacterial cell membranes was determined through the breakdown product malondialdehyde (MDA). The major constituents in Anacardium humile leaves oil were (E)-caryophyllene (31.0%) and alpha-pinene (22.0%), and in Anacardium occidentale oil they were (E)-caryophyllene (15.4%) and germacrene-D (11.5%). Volatile oil from Astronium fraxinifolium leaves were dominated by (E)-beta-ocimene (44.1%) and alpha-terpinolene (15.2%), whilst the oil from Myracrodruon urundeuva contained an abundance of delta-3-carene (78.8%). However, Schinus terebinthifolius leaves oil collected in March and July presented different chemical compositions. The oils from all species, except the one from A. occidentale, exhibited varying levels of antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Oil extracted in July from S. terebinthifolius was more active against all bacterial strains than the corresponding oil extracted in March. The high antibacterial activity of the M. urundeuva oil could be ascribed to its high delta-3-carene content. The amounts of MDA generated within bacterial cells indicate that the volatile oils induce lipid peroxidation. The results suggest that one putative mechanism of antibacterial action of these volatile oils is pro-oxidant damage within bacterial cell membrane explaining in part their preservative properties.
TI  - Preparation, stability and antimicrobial activity of cationic cross-linked starch-iodine complexes.
AB  - Cationic cross-linked starch (CCS)-iodine complexes containing different amounts  of quaternary ammonium groups (different degrees of substitution (DS)) and iodine have been obtained by iodine adsorption on CCS from aqueous iodine potassium iodide solution. Equilibrium adsorption studies showed that with an increase of DS the amount of iodine adsorbed on CCS and the affinity of iodine to CCS increased linearly. The influences of the DS of CCS and the amount of adsorbed iodine on the stability of CCS-iodine complexes in a solution of 0.02M sodium acetate and reactivity toward l-tyrosine have been investigated. At the same DS, the stability of CCS-iodine complexes decreased with an increase of the amount of adsorbed iodine. With increasing the DS, the stability of CCS-iodine complexes increased. The iodine consumption in the reaction with l-tyrosine increased significantly with an increase of the amount of adsorbed iodine. The influence of DS on iodine consumption was lower and depended on the amount of adsorbed iodine. The antibacterial activity of CCS-iodine complexes against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli was determined by the broth-dilution and spread-plate methods. The obtained results have demonstrated that an appropriate selection of the CCS-iodine complex composition (the DS of CCS and the amount of adsorbed iodine) could ensure good antimicrobial properties by keeping a low concentration of free iodine in the system. The main advantage of using CCS-iodine complexes as antimicrobial agents is the biodegradability of the polymeric matrix.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bioactive compounds and leaf extracts in Jatropha tanjorensis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Jatropha tanjorensis was investigated scientifically to generate evidence for the efficacies reported in traditional systems and the results are given here. METHODS: Different concentrations of the solvent extracts of leaves and four isolated compounds were tested against human pathogenic microorganisms such as gram-positive bacteria of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, gram-negative bacteria of Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Vibrio alcaligenes, Vibrio cholerae and fungi of Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton rubrum by agar-well diffusion and disk diffusion methods. RESULTS: In agar-well diffusion method, maximum activity was recorded in a concentration-dependent manner. The extracts recorded activity against bacteria such as 17-26, 15-25 and 13-24 mm to methanol extract and 15-24, 14-23 and 12-22 mm to chloroform extract at 50, 25 and 12.5 mg/ml respectively and fungi such as 9-15 mm to A. fumigatus and 5-16 mm to T. rubrum. Maximum activity was 30-46, 27-43 and 17-40 mm to friedelin and 23-46, 28-44 and 18-41 mm to R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone against bacteria and 12-37, 8-34 and 31-33 mm to friedelin and 12-40, 11-35 and 10-33 mm to R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone against fungi at 10, 5 and 2.5mg respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study concludes that friedelin, beta-amyrin, stigmasterol and R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone present in the methanol extract could be responsible for the broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and provide scientific evidence.
TI  - The constituents of essential oil: antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of Micromeria congesta Boiss. & Hausskn. ex Boiss. from East Anatolia.
AB  - The chemical composition, antimicrobial activity, total phenol content, total antioxidant activity, and total oxidant status of the essential oil from Micromeria congesta Boiss. & Hausskn. ex Boiss. were investigated. Steam distillation was used to obtain the essential oil, and the chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antimicrobial activity was tested by an agar disc diffusion method against the tested microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis NRRL B-744, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12598, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 25933, Escherichia coli 0157H7, E. coli ATCC25922, Micrococcus luteus NRLL B-4375, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Proteus vulgaris RSKK 96026, and Yersinia enterecolitica RSKK 1501. The major compounds found in volatiles of M. congesta were piperitone oxide, linalool oxide, veratrole, pulegone, dihydro carvone, naphthalene, iso-menthone, para-menthone, and cyclohexanone. Compared to that of reference antibiotics, the antibacterial activity of the essential oil is considered as significant. Results showed that M. congesta has the potential for being used in food and medicine depending on its antioxidant and antibacterial activity.
TI  - A new sphingolipid and furanocoumarins with antimicrobial activity from Ficus exasperata.
AB  - From the methanol extract of the stem bark of Ficus exasperata, a new sphingolipid named Ficusamide, (2S,3S,4R,11E)-2-[(2',3'-dihydroxyhexacosanoylamino)]-11-octadecene-1,3,4-triol (1), along with three known furanocoumarins, (S)-(-) oxypeucedanin hydrate (2), (R)-(+) oxypeucedanin hydrate (3), bergapten (5-methoxypsoralen) and six other known compounds, were isolated. Their structures were characterized basing on spectroscopic methods and chemical evidence. Compounds (1-3) were analyzed for their antimicrobial activity. Ficusamide (1) showed wick activity (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)=312.5 microg/mL) against Escherichia coli, while the furanocoumarins (2) and (3) showed significant activity (MIC=9.76 microg/mL) against Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans and Microsporum audouinii.
TI  - Manduca sexta gloverin binds microbial components and is active against bacteria  and fungi.
AB  - Hyalophora gloveri gloverin is a glycine-rich and heat stable antimicrobial protein with activity mainly against Escherichia coli. However, Spodoptera exigua gloverin is active against a Gram-positive bacterium but inactive against E. coli. In this study, we investigated expression profile, binding ability and antimicrobial activity of Manduca sexta gloverin (MsGlv). Msglv transcript was detected in several tissues of naive larvae with higher levels in the midgut and testis. Expression of Msglv mRNA in larvae was up-regulated by active Spatzle-C108 and peptidoglycans (PGs) of E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and the activation was blocked by pre-injection of antibody to M. sexta Toll, suggesting that Msglv expression is regulated by the Toll-Spatzle pathway. Recombinant MsGlv bound to the O-specific antigen and outer core carbohydrate of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Gram-positive lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and PG, and laminarin, but not to E. coli PG or mannan. MsGlv was active against Bacillus cereus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cryptococcus neoformans, but was almost inactive against E. coli and S. aureus. Our results suggest that gloverins are active against some bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Modulation of cell surface hydrophobicity and attachment of bacteria to abiotic surfaces and shrimp by Malaysian herb extracts.
AB  - The use of simple crude water extracts of common herbs to reduce bacterial attachment may be a cost-effective way to control bacterial foodborne pathogens, particularly in developing countries. The ability of water extracts of three common Malaysian herbs (Andrographis paniculata, Eurycoma longifolia, and Garcinia atroviridis) to modulate hydrophobicity and attachment to surfaces of five food-related bacterial strains (Bacillus cereus ATCC 14576, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145, Salmonella Enteritidis ATCC 13076, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) were determined. The bacterial attachment to hydrocarbon assay was used to determine bacterial hydrophobicity. Staining and direct microscopic counts were used to determine attachment of bacteria to glass and stainless steel. Plating on selective media was used to determine attachment of bacteria to shrimp. All extracts were capable of either significantly ( P < 0.05) increasing or decreasing bacterial surface hydrophobicity, depending on the herb extract and bacteria combination. Bacterial attachment to all surfaces was either significantly (P < 0.05) increased or decreased, depending on the herb extract and bacteria combination. Overall, hydrophobicity did not show a significant correlation (P > 0.05) to bacterial attachment. For specific combinations of bacteria, surface material, and plant extract, significant correlations (R > 0.80) between hydrophobicity and attachment were observed. The highest of these was observed for S. aureus attachment to stainless steel and glass after treatment with the E. longifolia extract (R = 0.99, P < 0.01). The crude water herb extracts in this study were shown to have the potential to modulate specific bacterial and surface interactions and may, with further work, be useful for the simple and practical control of foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Detection and enumeration of four foodborne pathogens in raw commingled silo milk in the United States.
AB  - A nationwide survey was conducted to obtain qualitative and quantitative data on  bacterial contamination of raw commingled silo milk intended for pasteurization. The levels of total aerobic bacteria, total coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined using the TEMPO system. The prevalence rates and levels of presumptive Bacillus cereus, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella spp. were determined in 214 samples. B. cereus was detected in 8.91% of samples, at 3.0 to 93 CFU/ml. E. coli O157:H7 was detected in 3.79 to 9.05% of samples, at <0.0055 to 1.1 CFU/ml, depending on the assay utilized. Salmonella spp. were recovered from 21.96 to 57.94% of samples, at <0.0055 to 60 CFU/ml. L. monocytogenes was detected in 50.00% of samples, at <0.0055 to 30 CFU/ml. The average log-transformed counts of total viable bacteria were slightly lower in samples containing no pathogens. No correlation was observed between the levels of organisms detected with the TEMPO system and the presence or levels of any pathogen except E. coli O157:H7. A higher average log-transformed count of total viable bacteria was observed in samples positive for this organism. The high prevalence rates of target pathogens may be attributed to a variety of factors, including detection methods, sample size, and commingling of the milk in the silo. The effects of commingling likely contributed to the high prevalence rates and low levels of target pathogens because of the inclusion of milk from multiple bulk tanks. The high prevalence rates also may be the result of analysis of larger sample volumes using more sensitive detection methods. These quantitative data could be utilized to perform more accurate risk assessments and to better estimate the appropriate level of protection for dairy products and processing technologies.
TI  - Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in food samples associated with foodborne illness in Alberta, Canada from 2007 to 2010.
AB  - Consumption of foods containing Staphylococcus aureus can cause severe gastro-intestinal illness. Given the fact that over the past decade, Canada has seen increasing rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) carriage and infection, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA on foodborne illness in Alberta, Canada. Between January 2007 and December 2010, there were 693 food samples associated with foodborne investigations submitted to the Alberta Provincial Laboratory for Public Health (ProvLab). These foods were screened for: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, S. aureus, Aeromonas spp., Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Shigella spp., and Yersinia spp. S. aureus was identified in 10.5% (73/693) of samples, and of these, 59% (43/73) were co-contaminated with at least one other organism on the screening panel. The S. aureus positive samples included 29 meat, 20 prepared foods containing meat, 11 prepared foods not containing meat, 10 dairy, and three produce. Methicillin-resistance was not detected in any isolates tested. These findings indicate that the presence of S. aureus in food associated with foodborne investigations is a cause for concern, and although MRSA was not found, the potential for outbreaks exists, and ongoing surveillance should be sustained.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of dextran stabilized silver nanoparticles in aqueous medium.
AB  - A simple one-step rapid synthetic route is described for the preparation of silver nanoparticles by reduction of silver nitrate (AgNO3) using aqueous dextran solution which acts as both reducing and capping agent. The formation of silver nanoparticles is assured by characterization with UV-vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The absorbance of the silver nanoparticles is observed at 423 nm. The AFM image clearly shows the surface morphology of the well-dispersed silver nanoparticles with size range of 10-60 nm. TEM images show that the nanoparticles are spherical in shape with approximately 5-10 nm dimensions. The crystallinity of Ag nanoparticles is assured by XRD analysis. The antimicrobial activity of as synthesized silver nanoparticles is tested against the bacteria, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacterial growth is inhibited by gradual reduction of the concentration of the silver nanoparticles.
TI  - Microbiological quality of complementary foods and its association with diarrhoeal morbidity and nutritional status of Bangladeshi children.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To examine the bacteriological quality of complementary foods (CF) and to correlate the results with diarrhoeal morbidity and nutritional status of Bangladeshi children aged 6-24 months. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 212 CF samples were tested, of which 72 were collected immediately before the first time of feeding (</= 1 h of food preparation) and 140 were collected at second/third time of feeding from 140 households located in urban and rural areas of Bangladesh. Anthropometry, food frequency data and demographic information of the children were collected. RESULTS: Of the first time feeding samples, 3% from each of urban and rural areas were found to be contaminated with faecal coliforms (FC) at >/= 100 CFU/g. E. coli was isolated from 11% and 6% of samples, and B. cereus from 8% and 6% of samples from urban and rural areas, respectively. In contrast, 33% of the second/third time feeding samples from urban areas and 19% from rural areas were contaminated with FC at >/= 100 CFU/g (P<0.05). E. coli was isolated from 40% and 39% of samples, and B. cereus from 33% and 26% of samples from urban and rural areas, respectively. Significantly high numbers of wasted rural children had CF with a high aerobic plate count, which was also significantly associated with diarrhoeal morbidity in children. CONCLUSIONS: Around 40% of CF samples were contaminated with E. coli, which was mainly attributable to food preparation practices. Consumption of contaminated CF appeared to be associated with a higher frequency of diarrhoea and malnutrition in children.
TI  - [Gene expression and characterisation of three pullulanases from Bacillus cereus  GXBC-3].
AB  - Exploring excellent new pullulanase genes, and enriching pullulanase theory are of great importance to realize the industrialization of pullulanase. Three genes, pulA, pulB and pulC, encoding pullulanases, were cloned from Bacillus cereus GXBC-3 by bioinformatics analyzing the open reading frame in Bacillus cereus, annotated as putative I and II pullulanases in the GenBank database. Characteristics of these recombinant enzymes were inducible intracellular expressed in Escherichia coli, the results showed PulA was typical II pullulanase. Recombinant PulA could hydrolyze alpha-1,4- and alpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds. Its specific activity was 32.89 U/mg with an optimum temperature of 40 degrees C and optimum pH 6.5 using pullulan as substrate. And for soluble starch substrate, its specific activity was 25.71 U/mg with an optimum temperature of 50 degrees C and optimum pH 7.0. PulB and PulC were I pullulanases and only hydrolyzed alpha-1,6-glycosidic bond. The specific activities, optimum temperature and optimum pH of PulB and PulC for pullulan substrate were 228.54 U/mg, 45 degrees C, 7.0 and 229.65 U/mg, 45 degrees C, 6.5, respectively.
TI  - Microbiological analysis of stuffed mussels sold in the streets.
AB  - Stuffed mussel is a traditional food that sold by street venders in various countries. In the present study, samples of stuffed mussels were collected from various places in Ankara. The mussels were analyzed to show the microbiological risks for human health. Thirty samples (600 stuffed mussels in total) were collected periodically and microbiological analyses were performed by standard procedures for Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Clostridium sp. In terms of Salmonella sp., approximately 50% of samples were not suitable for consumption. Besides, in accordance with Turkish Food Codex Microbiological Criteria Announcement in terms of E. coli 30%, in terms of B. cereus 80%, in terms of S. aureus 76.6%, in terms of Clostridium perfringens 13.3% of these samples were not suitable for consumption. The aim of this study is to discuss the microbiological quality of stuffed mussels as a ready-to-eat food according to Turkish Food Codex (TFC). The result of this investigation indicates that stuffed mussels as a street food may constitute a potential health hazard, depending on contamination level and lack of sanitary practices, and therefore, handling practices should require more attention and improvement. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s12088-011-0174-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
TI  - Identification of a new Bacillus licheniformis strain producing a bacteriocin-like substance.
AB  - The emergence of antibiotic resistance has spurred a great number of studies for  development of new antimicrobials in the past decade. The purpose of this study was to screen environmental samples for Bacillus strains producing potent antimicrobial agents. A new strain, which showed strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica ser. Pullorum, was isolated from soil and designated as B116. This new isolate was identified as Bacillus licheniformis by morphological, biochemical and genetic analyses. The production of bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) started at early exponential phase and achieved highest level at early stationary phase. The BLS was precipitated by ammonium sulfate and its molecular mass was determined as approximately 4 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Culture supernatant of the new isolate exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella spp. The BLS was resistant to heat, acid and alkaline treatment. Activity of the BLS was totally lost after digestion by pronase and partially lost after digestion by papain and lipase. The new isolate and relevant BLS are potentially useful in food and feed applications.
TI  - Gegenees: fragmented alignment of multiple genomes for determining phylogenomic distances and genetic signatures unique for specified target groups.
AB  - The rapid development of Next Generation Sequencing technologies leads to the accumulation of huge amounts of sequencing data. The scientific community faces an enormous challenge in how to deal with this explosion. Here we present a software tool, 'Gegenees', that uses a fragmented alignment approach to facilitate the comparative analysis of hundreds of microbial genomes. The genomes are fragmented and compared, all against all, by a multithreaded BLAST control engine. Ready-made alignments can be complemented with new genomes without recalculating the existing data points. Gegenees gives a phylogenomic overview of the genomes and the alignment can then be mined for genomic regions with conservation patterns matching a defined target group and absent from a background group. The genomic regions are given biomarker scores forming a uniqueness signature that can be viewed and explored, graphically and in tabular form. A primer/probe alignment tool is also included for specificity verification of currently used or new primers. We exemplify the use of Gegenees on the Bacillus cereus group, on Foot and Mouth Disease Viruses, and on strains from the 2011 Escherichia coli O104:H4 outbreak. Gegenees contributes towards an increased capacity of fast and efficient data mining as more and more genomes become sequenced.
TI  - The phytochemical content and antimicrobial activities of Malaysian Calophyllum canum (stem bark).
AB  - Recently there was huge increase in using of 'herbal products'. These can be defined as plants, parts of plants or extracts from plants that are used for curing disease. However, Calophyllum species is a tropical plant and it has been used in traditional medicine, the limitation in safety and effectiveness information could lead to serious health problems. Providing information for communities by evaluating the phytochemical contents, antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities will improve the therapeutic values. Three main Calophyllum canum fractions (none - high polar) were tested to find out the phenolic, flavonoid, flavonol content, DPPH radical scavenging, reducing power and chelating iron ions. Also were tested against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Psedomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans. In addition, cytotoxic activity was assayed against lung cancer A549 cell line. The methanol fraction showed no bioactivity but achieved the highest amount of phenolic, flavonol and flavonoid contents, also it showed a significant result as antioxidant, reducing power and chelating agent. The n-hexane fraction achieved the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value 12.5 mug. mL(-1) against B. cereus while the MIC value for DCM fraction was 25 mug. mL(-1). The DCM fraction was more active against S. aureus where the result was 50 mug. mL(-1) while the n-hexane fraction was 100 mug. mL(-1). The three main fractions have shown no activity against gram negative bacterial and fungal. The n-hexane and DCM fractions have shown cytotoxicity against lung cancer cell line; the 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) was 22 +/- 2.64 and 32 +/- 3.78 mug. mL(-1) respectively. The results were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Among the results, C. canum fractions proved to be effective against gram positive bacterial and anti-proliferation activity. Also it showed antioxidant activity as well. The results provided beneficial information for communities as well as can help to search for alternative drugs, and will contribute to establish safe and effective use of phytomedicines in the treatment of diseases.
TI  - Impact of processing method on recovery of bacteria from wipes used in biological surface sampling.
AB  - Environmental sampling for microbiological contaminants is a key component of hygiene monitoring and risk characterization practices utilized across diverse fields of application. However, confidence in surface sampling results, both in the field and in controlled laboratory studies, has been undermined by large variation in sampling performance results. Sources of variation include controlled parameters, such as sampling materials and processing methods, which often differ among studies, as well as random and systematic errors; however, the relative contributions of these factors remain unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the relative impacts of sample processing methods, including extraction solution and physical dissociation method (vortexing and sonication), on recovery of Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Burkholderia thailandensis and Escherichia coli) bacteria from directly inoculated wipes. This work showed that target organism had the largest impact on extraction efficiency and recovery precision, as measured by traditional colony counts. The physical dissociation method (PDM) had negligible impact, while the effect of the extraction solution was organism dependent. Overall, however, extraction of organisms from wipes using phosphate-buffered saline with 0.04% Tween 80 (PBST) resulted in the highest mean recovery across all three organisms. The results from this study contribute to a better understanding of the factors that influence sampling performance, which is critical to the development of efficient and reliable sampling methodologies relevant to public health and biodefense.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antimicrobial activity of 4H-pyrimido[2,1-b]benzothiazole, pyrazole and benzylidene derivatives of curcumin.
AB  - A novel, one-pot, simple, efficient procedure for 4H-pyrimido[2,1-b]benzothiazole (4a-h), pyrazole (6a-d) and benzylidene (7a-d) derivatives of curcumin under solvent and solvent free conditions in microwave with good yield is have been synthesized. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria viz. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Providencia rettgeri and antifungal activity against fungi viz Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigates, Aspergillus flavus. Detailed mechanistic study shows reaction proceeds through Knoevenagel type intermediate 3a which has been suggested as key intermediate for reaction (Fig. 3).
TI  - Synthesis of a new class of antimicrobial agents incorporating the indolin-2-one  moiety.
AB  - New furanone derivatives incorporating the indolin-2-one moiety 3 were prepared via the Perkin reaction of isatins 1 with aroylpropionic acids 2 under conventional conditions or microwave irradiation. A series of functionally heterocyclic derivatives (e.g., pyridazines, pyrroles, and sulfonamides) incorporating the indolin-2-one moiety was achieved via reaction of 3 with different reagents under microwave irradiation conditions. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized on the basis of FTIR, (1)H, (13)C NMR and mass spectral studies. Some of the new synthesized compounds were screened for antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Shigilla flexneri) and antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus and Candida albicans. Compound 8 j was equipotent to chloramphenicol in inhibiting the growth of E. coli minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC 2.5 mug/mL). Compound 8j may possibly be used as a lead compound for developing a new antibacterial agents. The antibacterial activity is expressed as the corresponding MIC (mug/mL) values.
TI  - Preliminary study on the antimicrobial activity of Enicostemma littorale using different solvents.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the antimicrobial activity of Enicostemma littorale (E. littorale) using different solvents. METHODS: Chloroform, methanol and acetone extracts of different parts of E. littorale (leaf, stem and root) were evaluated for antimicrobial activity using disc diffusion method against some gram-negative species such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pnemoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and gram-positive species Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and two fugal species viz., Aspergillus fumigates and Aspergillus flavus. RESULTS: The chloroform extracts showed the highest antibacterial activity. Among leaf, stem and root extracts, the stem extracts showed maximum antibacterial activity. All of the used extracts had no significant antifungal activity against Aspergillus fumigates and Aspergillus flavus. The chloroform stem extract showed highest activity (about 20 mm inhibition zone) against Bacillus subtilis (at 500 mg/mL) followed by the methanolic stem extract which showed highest activity against the same organism. The lowest antibacterial activity was observed by the acetone leaf extract (about 8 mm inhibition zone) against Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study indicate littorale could also be a new source for antibiotics discovery.
TI  - Detection of Foodborne Pathogens and Analysis of Aflatoxin Levels in Home-made Doenjang Samples.
AB  - Doenjang is a traditional Korean fermented soybean product that provides a major  source of protein. In this study, a total of 18 different home-made doenjang samples were examined for the presence of foodborne pathogens and the total aflatoxin levels. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to assess microbial quality and potential public health risk, we showed that total coliform levels in the doenjang samples ranged from 0 to 4.43+/-2.32 x10(6) CFU/g, and the maximum limit of Bacillus cereus was 4.67+/-2.0x10(5) CFU/g. However, other foodborne pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp., were not detected among the tested samples. One of the samples (S3) showed a maximum limit of 42.2+/-9.1 mug/kg for aflatoxin levels, which was above the safety limit allowed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) regulatory agency. Further research is necessary to determine whether and how doenjang safety can be improved via elimination/reduction of microbial contamination during fermentation and storage or using microbial starter cultures for its fermentation.
TI  - Biologically active steroids from the aerial parts of Vernonia anthelmintica Willd.
AB  - A new steroid, vernoanthelsterone A (1), and five known steroids were isolated from the aerial parts of Vernonia anthelmintica Willd. Compound 1 possesses a Delta(8(14))-15-one moiety. To our best knowledge, few steroids with this moiety have been reported before. Compounds 1-6 were tested for their antibacterial activities and their effects on estrogen biosynthesis in human ovarian granulosa-like cells (KGN cells). Compound 2 showed the ability to promote estrogen biosynthesis with EC(50) of 56.95 mug/mL and also exhibited the antibacterial activities against Bacillus cereus, Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli with MICs ranging from 3.15 to 15.5 mug/mL. The structures of 1-6 were determined on the basis of IR, MS, 1D and 2D NMR.
TI  - Synthesis of s-triazine-based thiazolidinones as antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A novel series of thiazolidinone derivatives, namely 4-{4-dimethylamino-6-[4-oxo-2-phenyl-5-(4-pyridin-2-yl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-thia zolidin-3-yl]-[1,3,5]-triazin-2-yloxy}-1-methyl-1H-quinolin-2-ones, have been synthesized from the key intermediate 4-(4-amino-6-dimethylamino-[1,3,5]-triazin-2-yloxy)-1-methyl-1H-quinolin-2-one (5). Compound 5 was condensed with various aldehydes to give Schiff base derivatives, which after cyclization gave thiazolidinones that were linked with 1-pyridin-2-yl-piperazine to obtain the target compounds. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against eight bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneri) and four fungi (Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus).
TI  - Novel polymer anchored Cr(III) Schiff base complexes: synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial properties.
AB  - New polymer-bound Schiff bases and Cr(III) complexes have been synthesized by the reaction of 4-benzyloxybenzaldehyde, polymer-bound with 2-aminophenol, 2-amino-4-chlorophenol and 2-amino-4-methylphenol. The structure of polymeric-Schiff bases and their Cr(III) complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, magnetic measurements, IR, UV-Vis, TG-DTA and (1)H-NMR. All these compounds have also been investigated for antibacterial activity by the well-diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus (RSKK-07035), Shigella dysenteria type 10 (RSKK 1036), Listeria monocytogenes 4b(ATCC 19115, Escherichia coli (ATCC 1230), Salmonella typhi H (NCTC 901.8394), Staphylococcus epidermis (ATCC 12228), Brucella abortus (RSKK-03026), Micrococcs luteus (ATCC 93419, Bacillus cereus sp., Pseudomonas putida sp. and for antifungal activity against Candida albicans (Y-1200-NIH).
TI  - [Analysis of microorganism species diversity in plant intercropping models in a wetland system constructed for treatment of municipal sewage].
AB  - The selective culture method and PCR-DGGE technology were applied to analyze the  number and the biodiversity of microorganism species in cells with plant intercropping models and without plants in different seasons in a wetland system constructed for treatment of municipal sewage. The results showed that the numbers of microorganisms were considerably larger in the cells with plant intercropping models than those without plants, while the number of microorganisms was apparently larger in summer than that in winter in all treatments. Along the three-sequenced treatment cells with plant intercropping models a "low-high-low" changing trend in the numbers of microorganisms in summer. The UPGMA cluster analysis showed that the treatments in the same season were clustered in the same branch except for a few samples in winter and the biodiversity index was consistently higher in summer than that in winter. Five different sequences (DF1-DF5) were obtained through BLAST analysis and retrieval. The closest known origin groups were located as Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Proteus sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, and Burkholderia sp. respectively. The BLASTX comparison test showed that DF1 closely related to the activities of the Mycobacterium bacillus and the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, DF2 functioned as a conservative potential ATP binding protein, DF3 related to the activities of the Bacillus cereus spore, DF4 was involved in catabolism metabolism of microorganism and DF5 played an important role in decomposition of organic matters.
TI  - BC4707 is a major facilitator superfamily multidrug resistance transport protein  from Bacillus cereus implicated in fluoroquinolone tolerance.
AB  - Transcriptional profiling highlighted a subset of genes encoding putative multidrug transporters in the pathogen Bacillus cereus that were up-regulated during stress produced by bile salts. One of these multidrug transporters (BC4707) was selected for investigation. Functional characterization of the BC4707 protein in Escherichia coli revealed a role in the energized efflux of xenobiotics. Phenotypic analyses after inactivation of the gene bc4707 in Bacillus cereus ATCC14579 suggested a more specific, but modest role in the efflux of norfloxacin. In addition to this, transcriptional analyses showed that BC4707 is also expressed during growth of B. cereus under non-stressful conditions where it may have a role in the normal physiology of the bacteria. Altogether, the results indicate that bc4707, which is part of the core genome of the B. cereus group of bacteria, encodes a multidrug resistance efflux protein that is likely involved in maintaining intracellular homeostasis during growth of the bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of 1-alkyl-3-methacryloyl (acryloyl) of benzimidazolone (thione) derivatives.
AB  - A series of (28) 1-alkyl-3-methacryloyl (acryloyl)-benzimidazolone (thione) deriv-atives were synthesized. The structures of the new derivatives were confirmed by (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR and ESI-MS spectral analysis. The antibacterial activities of these compounds against several strains of bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were evaluated by methods of paper disc-diffusion and broth mciro-dilution. Methacryloyl derivatives displayed higher antibacterial activities against tested bacterial strains than those of acryloyl derivatives in in vitro tests. A structure-activity relationship (SAR) study revealed that the presences of the methacryloyl moieties is essential to the antibacterial activities of the compounds.
TI  - Rapid detection of bacterial contamination of platelet-rich plasma-derived platelet concentrates using flow cytometry.
AB  - Flow cytometry can be used to detect bacterial contamination of platelet products. In this study, we investigated whether the incubation of a minimal volume of platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-derived platelet concentrates (PCs) with growth medium improved the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry. Five bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli) were used. Platelets were inoculated with 10, 10(2), and 10(3) CFUs per mL; 0.5 mL, 1.0 mL, and 2.0 mL aliquots of spiked platelets were incubated with growth medium at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. During the incubation period, the numbers of events were analyzed every 4 hours by flow cytometry. We could detect a low concentration (10 CFUs per mL) of bacteria in a small volume (minimum 0.5 mL) of PCs. Irrespective of spiking concentrations and incubation volumes, the detection times of S. aureus and S. epidermidis were 24 hours or less, while those of B. cereus, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli were 16 hours or less. A higher spiking concentration made it possible to shorten the detection time. The numbers of detected bacteria increased during the incubation. However, the graphs corresponding to K. pneumoniae and E. coli showed peak levels and decreasing patterns during the incubation period. The incubation of small volumes of PC with growth medium increased the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry for bacterial detection. Therefore, flow cytometry can serve as a useful method for sterility testing using PRP-derived PCs with only low levels of consequent platelet loss.
TI  - Investigations of antimicrobial activity of some Cameroonian medicinal plant extracts against bacteria and yeast with gastrointestinal relevance.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Resistance against antibiotics of many bacteria is accumulating. Therefore, searches for new substances with antimicrobial activity have become an urgent necessity. Medicinal plants are frequently used in popular medicine as remedies for many infectious diseases (intestinal infection, malaria, tuberculosis, etc.). AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from different parts (leaves, stem bark, entire plant) of five different plant species against bacteria and yeast of gastrointestinal relevance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-one extracts from all the following plants (Albizia gummifera (leaf), Ficus exasperata (leaf and stem bark), Nauclea latifolia (leaf and stem bark), Ricinodendron heudelotii (stem bark), Senna hirsuta (entire plant) have been screened for their antimicrobial activity against eight bacteria species including Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and one yeast species (Candida albicans) using agar disc-diffusion, and microbroth dilution assays. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that F. exasperata and N. latifolia were active against the whole set of tested microorganisms. The methanol extract of N. latifolia (leaf and stem bark) was the most active against against C. albicans, E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2, 32, 64 and 64 mug/ml, respectively. The methanol extract of leaf of F. exasperata was also most active with significant inhibitory activity against E. coli, S. dysenteriae, S. Typhi and P. aeruginosa with MIC values of 128 mug/ml. Only the extract of N. latifolia (stem bark and leaf) showed anticandidal property. CONCLUSION: The results show that these plant extracts exhibit antimicrobial activity and N. latifolia proved to be most effective as an antibacterial and antifungal.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of platelet (PLT)-poor plasma, PLT-rich plasma, PLT gel, and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate biomaterials against wound bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) gels exhibit antimicrobial activity useful for wound healing. The nature of the antibacterial component(s) is unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PLT-poor plasma (PPP), PLT-rich plasma (PRP), PLT gel (PG), and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate (S/D-PL) from two donors were evaluated either native or after complement heat inactivation. Materials were spiked at a 10% ratio (vol/vol) with approximately 10(7-8) colony-forming units/mL with four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria of the wound flora. Bacterial count was determined by plate assays at time of spiking and after 3 and 48 hours at 31 degrees C. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were also performed. RESULTS: There was no viable Escherichia coli colony for 48 hours after spiking to the plasma and PLT materials from both donors, corresponding to greater than 7.51 to greater than 9.05 log inactivation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus were inactivated (approx. 4.7, 7, and 2 log, respectively) 3 hours after spiking to PRP, PPP, or S/D-PL from the first donor but less (1.1, 4.6, and 0.2 log, respectively) in PG, before a regrowth at 48 hours in all materials. Similar data were obtained with the second donor. No plasma and PLT material had antimicrobial activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Complement-inactivated samples had no antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: Plasma complement is mostly responsible for the activity of plasma and PLT biomaterials against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. Activation of the coagulation to prepare PG may reduce antimicrobial activity. These findings may help optimize the control of wound infections by blood biomaterials.
TI  - Antibacterial anthraquinone derivatives from a sea anemone-derived fungus Nigrospora sp.
AB  - Chemical investigation of a marine-derived fungus Nigrospora sp., isolated from an unidentified sea anemone, yielded two new hydroanthraquinone analogues, 4a-epi-9alpha-methoxydihydrodeoxybostrycin (1) and 10-deoxybostrycin (2), together with seven known anthraquinone derivatives (3-9). The structures of the two new compounds were established through extensive NMR spectroscopy as well as a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis using Cu Kalpha radiation. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1-9 and 10 acetyl derivatives (6a, 7a, 8a-8g, 9a) were evaluated in vitro. Compound 6a, the acetylated derivative of 6, exhibited promising activity against Bacillus cereus with an MIC value of 48.8 nM, which was stronger than that of the positive control ciprofloxacin (MIC = 1250 nM). Analysis of the antibacterial screening data for the metabolites and their acetyl derivatives revealed the key structural features required for this activity.
TI  - Development of sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of Cronobacter muytjensii (formerly called Enterobacter sakazakii).
AB  - This study aimed to produce a polyclonal antibody against Cronobacter muytjensii  (C. muytjensii, formerly called Enterobacter sakazakii) and to develop an immunoassay for its detection. The optimum production of rabbit anti-C. muytjensii immunoglobulin G (IgG) and chicken anti-C. muytjensii IgY was reached in weeks 8 and 9, respectively. Purification of rabbit anti-C. muytjensii IgG from immunized rabbit sera was accomplished using the caprylic acid and ammonium sulfate precipitation method. As a result, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis produced two bands around 25 and 50 kDa, corresponding to a light and a heavy chain, respectively. The optimized conditions for sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were using rabbit anti-C. muytjensii IgG (1 mug/mL) as a detection antibody and chicken anti-C. muytjensii IgY (10 mug/mL) as a capture antibody. In this assay, no cross-reactivity was observed with the other genera of pathogenic bacteria tested, which included Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. The developed assay did not show cross-reactivity with other tested species of Cronobacter and Enterobacter genera such as C. turicensis, C. sakazakii, E. aerogenes, E. pulveris and E. helveticus. The detection limit of sandwich ELISA for C. muytjensii was found to be 2.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU)/mL. In addition, detection of C. muytjensii in infant formula powder showed a low matrix effect on the detection curve of sandwich ELISA for C. muytjensii, the detection limit being found to be 6.3 x 10(4) CFU/mL. These findings demonstrate that the developed method is able to detect all strains of C. muytjensii. Hence, this ELISA technique has potent application for the rapid and accurate detection of C. muytjensii in dietary foods.
TI  - Synthesis of benzimidazolyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2ylthio-N-phenyl (benzothiazolyl) acetamides as antibacterial, antifungal and antituberculosis agents.
AB  - To affiliate multiple bioactivities in a compact heteronuclei, two series of benzimidazole based 1,3,4-oxadiazoles were synthesized and assessed in vitro for their efficacy as antimicrobial agents against eight bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneri), four fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus, Candida albicans) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and best results were observed amongst the N-benzothiazolyl aetamide series. The lipophilicity (LogP) influence on the biological profile (MICs) of the prepared products was also discussed. Upon biological screening, it was observed that the majority of the compounds were found to possess a significant broad spectrum antimicrobial (3.12-25 mug/mL of MIC) and antitubercular (6.25-25 mug/mL of MIC) potential. The structural assignments of the new products were done on the basis of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis.
TI  - Foodborne outbreaks surveillance in the Piedmont Region, Italy (2002-2009).
AB  - BACKGROUND: this article summarises the results of eight years (2002-2009) of investigations on food borne disease outbreaks carried out the Regional Agency for Public Health in Piedmont, which is an Italian Region (4,432,571 citizens, 2008). METHODS: the investigations were conducted as cohort studies supported by laboratory analysis of: food and patients. The data were reported by general practitioners and hospital physicians, and were collected, evaluated and recorded in 22 Hospitals. RESULTS: it recorded 803 outbreaks of food borne disease, of which 177 mushroom outbreaks with 318 ill people and 499 outbreaks for all the others agents with 3,381 ill people. The maximum prevalence was 15.7/100,000 (2004). The most important causes for numbers of ill people have been (2002-2009): salmonellosis (34%, 1,250/3,699), mushroom poisoning (9%, 318/3,699), Escherichia coli (8%, 228/3,699), Staphyilococcus (6%, 209/3,699), virus (5%, 198/3,699), Clostridium perfringens (4%, 154/3,699), Bacillus cereus (2.1%, 76/3,699), scombrotoxin (1.8%, 65/3,699). 303 out of 304 mushrooms outbreaks occurred from consumers that picking mushrooms themselves to eat in private homes and for all others agents: 57% of 499 the outbreaks occurred in private homes, 27% in restaurants, 6% in canteens, but 39% of 3,381 ill people had eaten in restaurants and other public food facilities, 32% in private homes and 24% in canteens. After mushrooms the eggs (75 outbreaks) were the most important food recognized. CONCLUSION: the theoretical maximum prevalence which can be hypothesized with this data in Piedmont (2002-2009) is 141/100,000 (sum of the maximum prevalence recorded at least in one Piedmont Hospital district).
TI  - Laccase- and chloroperoxidase-nanotube paint composites with bactericidal and sporicidal activity.
AB  - Laccase and chloroperoxidase (CPO) were separately immobilized onto multi-walled  carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and subsequently mixed with a commercial eco-friendly paint to generate biocatalytic coatings. The laccase-nanotube based paints showed >99% bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (both challenged with 10(6) CFU/mL) within 30 min and >98% sporicidal activity against Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis-DeltaSterne (initially challenged with 10(4) CFU/mL) within 120 min. The CPO-nanotube based paints also showed >99% antimicrobial activity within 30 min against E. coli and S. aureus (both challenged with 10(6) CFU/mL). These enzyme-nanotube based formulations provide an eco-friendly route to generate biocidal compounds, which can prevent the growth of a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens, including spores. These enzyme-containing paints may be envisioned to be applied as self-decontaminating coatings onto a wide range of surfaces, such as hospital infrastructure, medical devices and equipment, food processing and packaging, etc.; in all cases effective killing of a variety of infectious organisms is critical.
TI  - Invariant gly residue is important for alpha-defensin folding, dimerization, and  function: a case study of the human neutrophil alpha-defensin HNP1.
AB  - The human alpha-defensins (HNP) are synthesized in vivo as inactive prodefensins, and contain a conserved glycine, Gly(17), which is part of a beta-bulge structure. It had previously been shown that the glycine main chain torsion angles are in a D-configuration, and that d-amino acids but not L-alanine could be substituted at that position to yield correctly folded peptides without the help of a prodomain. In this study, the glycine to L-alanine mutant defensin was synthesized in the form of a prodefensin using native chemical ligation. The ligation product folded correctly and yielded an active peptide upon CNBr cleavage. The L-Ala(17)-HNP1 crystal structure depicted a beta-bulge identical to wild-type HNP1. However, dimerization was perturbed, causing one monomer to tilt with respect to the other in a dimerization model. Inhibitory activity against the anthrax lethal factor showed a 2-fold reduction relative to wild-type HNP1 as measured by the inhibitory concentration IC(50). Self-association was slightly reduced, as detected by surface plasmon resonance measurements. According to the results of the virtual colony count assay, the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus exhibited a less than 2-fold reduction in virtual lethal dose values. Prodefensins with two other L-amino acid substitutions, Arg and Phe, at the same position did not fold, indicating that only small side chains are tolerable. These results further elucidate the factors governing the region of the beta-bulge structure that includes Gly(17), illuminating why glycine is conserved in all mammalian alpha-defensins.
TI  - Microbiological performance of a food safety management system in a food service  operation.
AB  - The microbiological performance of a food safety management system in a food service operation was measured using a microbiological assessment scheme as a vertical sampling plan throughout the production process, from raw materials to final product. The assessment scheme can give insight into the microbiological contamination and the variability of a production process and pinpoint bottlenecks in the food safety management system. Three production processes were evaluated: a high-risk sandwich production process (involving raw meat preparation), a medium-risk hot meal production process (starting from undercooked raw materials), and a low-risk hot meal production process (reheating in a bag). Microbial quality parameters, hygiene indicators, and relevant pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli O157) were in accordance with legal criteria and/or microbiological guidelines, suggesting that the food safety management system was effective. High levels of total aerobic bacteria (>3.9 log CFU/50 cm(2)) were noted occasionally on gloves of food handlers and on food contact surfaces, especially in high contamination areas (e.g., during handling of raw material, preparation room). Core control activities such as hand hygiene of personnel and cleaning and disinfection (especially in highly contaminated areas) were considered points of attention. The present sampling plan was used to produce an overall microbiological profile (snapshot) to validate the food safety management system in place.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles against bacterial cells adhered to  stainless steel surfaces.
AB  - Given the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the need to synthesize new antimicrobials, silver has attracted interest in the scientific community because of its recognized antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles (NP) obtained by a new method and tested at concentrations of 6 mug/ml and 60 mug/ml against the species Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Salmonella Choleraesuis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus cereus. The ability of these nanoparticles to remove or kill vegetative cells adhered to stainless steel surfaces was also evaluated. We observed that the NP obtained with the new method, concentrated silver nanoparticles (CNP), and silver nanoparticles with added sodium chloride (NPNaCl) had high antimicrobial activities (P < 0.05). We also verified that the most effective condition for the removal of P. aeruginosa cells on stainless steel coupons (10 by 10 mm) was immersion of the surfaces in CNP. The CNP treatment produced a 5-log reduction of the microbial population after 30 to 60 min of immersion. The CNP treatment also performed better than water and sodium carbonate, a compound commonly applied in clean-in-place procedures in the food industry, in removing adherent B. cereus cells from stainless steel cylinders. Therefore, these results suggest that NP synthesized by a new procedure may be used as antimicrobials in the food industry, for example, for the sanitization of utensils that come into contact with foods.
TI  - Phyto-synthesis of silver nanoscale particles using Morinda citrifolia L. and its inhibitory activity against human pathogens.
AB  - Leaf extract of Morinda citrifolia L. was assessed for the synthesis of silver nanoscale particles under different temperature and reaction time. Synthesized nanoscale (MCAgNPs) particles were confirmed by analysing the excitation of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using UV-visible spectrophotometer at 420 nm. Further SEM, HRTEM analysis confirmed the range of particle size between 10 and 60 nm and SEAD pattern authorizes the face centered cubic (fcc) crystalline nature of the MCAgNPs. Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) of synthesized MCAgNPs confirms the presence of high amount of phenolic compounds in the plant extract which may possibly influence the reduction process and stabilization of nanoparticles. Further, inhibitory activity of MCAgNPs and plant extract were tested against human pathogens like Eschericia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus and Enterococci sp. The results indicated that the MCAgNPs showed moderate inhibitory actions against human pathogens than crude plant extract, demonstrating its antimicrobial value against pathogenic diseases.
TI  - A comparative study of the bactericidal activity and daily disinfection housekeeping surfaces by a new portable pulsed UV radiation device.
AB  - Daily cleaning and disinfecting of non-critical surfaces in the patient-care areas are known to reduce the occurrence of health care-associated infections. However, the conventional means for decontamination of housekeeping surfaces of sites of frequent hand contact such as manual disinfection using ethanol wipes are laborious and time-consuming in daily practice. This study evaluated a newly developed portable pulsed ultraviolet (UV) radiation device for its bactericidal activity in comparison with continuous UV-C, and investigated its effect on the labor burden when implemented in a hospital ward. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Amikacin and Ciprofloxacin-resistant A. baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Bacillus cereus were irradiated with pulsed UV or continuous UV-C. Pulsed UV and continuous UV-C required 5 and 30 s of irradiation, respectively, to attain bactericidal activity with more than 2Log growth inhibition of all the species. The use of pulsed UV in daily disinfection of housekeeping surfaces reduced the working hours by half in comparison to manual disinfection using ethanol wipes. The new portable pulsed UV radiation device was proven to have a bactericidal activity against critical nosocomial bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria after short irradiation, and was thus found to be practical as a method for disinfecting housekeeping surfaces and decreasing the labor burden.
TI  - Semisynthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel guttiferone-A derivatives.
AB  - Six derivatives of guttiferone-A (LFQM-79, 80, 81, 82, 113 and 114) were synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic or pathogenic fungi Candida albicans (ATCC 09548), Candida glabrata (ATCC 90030), Candida krusei (ATCC 6258), Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 69548), Candida tropicalis (ATCC 750), Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 90012), Trichophyton tonsurans, Microsporum gypseum and also against the opportunistic and pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 25933). The antimicrobial activities of derivatives were compared with guttiferone-A and they presented to be more potent than the original molecule and sometimes greater than standard drugs established in therapeutics. The current study showed that derivatives of guttiferone-A possess potent antimicrobial activity and are relatively non-cytotoxic, which reveal these new molecules as promising new drug prototype candidates, with innovative structural pattern.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Inhibition of cytotoxicity by the Nhe cytotoxin of Bacillus cereus through the interaction of dodecyl maltoside with the NheB component.
AB  - Nhe ('nonhaemolytic enterotoxin') is a three-component cytotoxin implicated in the pathogenesis of diarrhoea by Bacillus cereus. Nhe forms pores in pure lipid bilayers, but the function of the individual components (NheA, NheB and NheC) remains unclear. NheB and NheC are structural homologues of ClyA, a pore-forming cytotoxin of Escherichia coli. The non-ionic detergent dodecyl maltoside (DDM) has been shown to inhibit haemolysis of ClyA. We used DDM as a probe to examine the response of the Nhe proteins to DDM micelles. At its critical micellar concentration (0.2 mM), DDM inhibited propidium uptake by the native Nhe complex in Vero and HT29 cell suspensions. Pre-incubation of NheC with DDM did not inhibit cytotoxicity. NheB exhibited marked changes in 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulphonic acid (ANS) fluorescence after pre-exposure to DDM. Pre-incubation of NheB with DDM resulted in large molecular weight complexes as detected by size exclusion chromatography and diffusion through sized dialysis membranes and prevented binding of NheB to Vero cell monolayers. These data support a model in which conformational changes and oligomerization of NheB are prerequisite events in the process of pore formation.
TI  - [Investigation of ampicillin effect on morphological and mechanical properties of Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus cells with atomic force microscopy].
AB  - The effect of subbacteriostatic concentrations of ampicillin on morphological and mechanical properties of gramnegative and grampositive cells of Escherichia coli K12 TG1 and Bacillus cereus IP 5832 respectively was studied with atomic force microscopy. Significant heterogeneity of the bacterial populations was shown by the character of the response to the antibiotic effect. The common feature was increase of the cell size likely due to the effect of the inner osmotic pressure on the lowered cell wall strength. In the E. coli population there were besides observed anomalous elongated cells with signs of septation disorder, as well as their structurs, lacking the cytoplasmic liquid fraction. In the B. cereus the inner osmotic pressure mainly enlarged the cell cross section, changing the cell shape from rod to sphere, that was accompanied by significant impairment of the surface structure with liberation of the peptidoglycane fragments to the medium. The particular features of the E. coli K12 TG1 and B. cereus IP 5832 respond to the ampicillin effect were attributed to the differences in the structure of their cell wall, also due to specific properties of the peptidoglycane synthesis and three-dimensional organization.
TI  - Substituted salicylaldehydes as potential antimicrobial drugs: minimal inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations.
AB  - Substituted salicylaldehydes are potent antibacterial and antifungal agents and may have chemotherapeutic potential. In the clinical setting, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) as well as the minimal bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations (MBC and MFC, respectively) are of fundamental interest. Therefore, we have now, using a panel of five microbial species (Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Staphylococcus aureus), determined the MIC and MBC/MFC values of a total of 22 aromatic aldehydes, including 19 substituted salicylaldehydes and the unsubstituted parent compounds benzaldehyde and salicylaldehyde (2-hydroxybenzaldehyde). The results clearly indicate that both of the yeasts studied are remarkably sensitive to various salicylaldehydes and, especially, to halogenated ones. Some congeners clearly merit consideration as potential therapeutic agents for Candida infections. The MIC values of the most potent congeners are of roughly the same magnitude as that of amphotericin B, and the results of the MFC measurements indicate that the compounds are fungicidal. All of the bacteria studied are also sensitive to at least some of the compounds tested but, clearly, this class of antimicrobials has superior activity against yeasts. Structure-activity relationships are discussed for each microbial species and compared with each other. The comparison of the results of MIC and MBC/MFC measurements with those of agar diffusion tests revealed aspects that are of interest concerning the methodology of antimicrobial activity screening. Unexpectedly, it was found that some compounds that are completely devoid of activity in agar diffusion tests had potent activity in MIC tests, indicating that if only agar diffusion methodology is used in drug discovery, some highly active compounds may be missed.
TI  - Volatile organic compounds from Centaurium erythraea Rafn (Croatia) and the antimicrobial potential of its essential oil.
AB  - GC and MS were used for the analysis of Croatian Centaurium erythraea Rafn essential oil (obtained by hydrodistillation) and headspace (applying headspace solid-phase microextraction). The headspace contained numerous monoterpene hydrocarbons (the major ones were terpinene-4-ol, methone, p-cymene, gamma-terpinene and limonene). Oxygenated monoterpenes were present in the headspace and oil, while 1,8-cineole, bornyl acetate and verbenone were present only in the headspace. High headspace percentages of toluene and naphthalene were found, followed by hemimellitene. Lot of similarities were observed with Serbian C. erythraea oil [neophytadiene (1.4%), thymol (2.6%), carvacrol (6.1%) and hexadecanoic acid (5.7%)], but different features were also noted such as the presence of menthol, menthone and phytone. The oil fractionation enabled identification of other minor compounds not found in total oil such as norisoprenoides, alk-1-enes or chromolaenin. The essential oil showed antimicrobial potential on Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. On the other hand, no antibacterial activity of the oil was observed on Pseudomonas fluorescens and Lysteria monocytogenes.
TI  - Structural basis of the substrate specificity of Bacillus cereus adenosine phosphorylase.
AB  - Purine nucleoside phosphorylases catalyze the phosphorolytic cleavage of the glycosidic bond of purine (2'-deoxy)nucleosides, generating the corresponding free base and (2'-deoxy)-ribose 1-phosphate. Two classes of PNPs have been identified: homotrimers specific for 6-oxopurines and homohexamers that accept both 6-oxopurines and 6-aminopurines. Bacillus cereus adenosine phosphorylase (AdoP) is a hexameric PNP; however, it is highly specific for 6-aminopurines. To investigate the structural basis for the unique substrate specificity of AdoP, the active-site mutant D204N was prepared and kinetically characterized and the structures of the wild-type protein and the D204N mutant complexed with adenosine and sulfate or with inosine and sulfate were determined at high resolution (1.2-1.4 A). AdoP interacts directly with the preferred substrate through a hydrogen-bond donation from the catalytically important residue Asp204 to N7 of the purine base. Comparison with Escherichia coli PNP revealed a more optimal orientation of Asp204 towards N7 of adenosine and a more closed active site. When inosine is bound, two water molecules are interposed between Asp204 and the N7 and O6 atoms of the nucleoside, thus allowing the enzyme to find alternative but less efficient ways to stabilize the transition state. The mutation of Asp204 to asparagine led to a significant decrease in catalytic efficiency for adenosine without affecting the efficiency of inosine cleavage.
TI  - Seasonal variations of phenolic compounds and biological properties in sage (Salvia officinalis L.).
AB  - The aim was to investigate the phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and antibacterial activity of Dalmatian sage (Salvia officinalis L.) leaves collected during different vegetation periods. Separation and quantification of the individual phenols were performed by reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC coupled with a PDA (photodiode array) detector and using an internal standard, while the contents of total phenols, flavonoids, flavones, and flavonols were determined spectrophotometrically. The antioxidant properties of the sage leaf extracts were evaluated using five different antioxidant assays (FRAP, DPPH, ABTS, Briggs-Rauscher reaction, and beta-carotene bleaching). The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was tested against two Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) and two Gram-negative (Salmonella Infantis and Escherichia coli) bacterial reference strains. All extracts were extremely rich in phenolic compounds, and provided good antioxidant and antibacterial properties, but the phenophase in which the leaves were collected affected the phenolic composition of the sage extracts and consequently their biological activity. The May Extract, the richest in total flavonoids, showed the best antioxidant properties and the highest antimicrobial activity. Thus, collection of the plants during May seems the best choice for further use of them in the pharmaceutical and food industry.
TI  - Application of atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma for the in vitro eradication of bacterial biofilms.
AB  - The use of atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma represents an interesting and novel approach for the decontamination of surfaces colonized with microbial biofilms that exhibit enhanced tolerance to antimicrobial challenge. In this study, the influence of an atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma jet, operated in a helium and oxygen gas mixture under ambient pressure, was evaluated against biofilms of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Within < 4 min of plasma exposure, complete eradication of the two gram-positive bacterial biofilms was achieved. Although gram-negative biofilms required longer treatment time, their complete eradication was still possible with 10 min of exposure. Whilst this study provides useful proof of concept data on the use of atmospheric pressure plasmas for the eradication of bacterial biofilms in vitro, it also demonstrates the critical need for improved understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics related to such a potentially significant approach.
TI  - New heterocyclic compounds from 1,2,4-triazole and 1,3,4-thiadiazole class bearing diphenylsulfone moieties. Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity evaluation.
AB  - Some new 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-4-(R)-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3(4H)-thiones 4a,b; 5a,b and 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-N-(R)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amines 6a,b; 7a,b were obtained by cyclization of new N(1)-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-N(4)-(R)-thiosemicarbazides 2a,b; 3a,b (X=H, Br). The 1,2,4-triazoles were synthesized by intramolecular cyclization of acylthiosemicarbazides, in basic media. On the other hand, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles were obtained from same acylthiosemicarbazides, in acidic media. These new intermediates from thiosemicarbazide class were afforded by the reaction of 4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoic acids hydrazides (X=H, Br) 1a,b with 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl or 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl isothiocyanate. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. All the new compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activity against some bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 13061, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 49141, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and yeasts (Candida albicans ATCC 90028 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and essential oils of Curcuma aeruginosa, Curcuma mangga,  and Zingiber cassumunar from Malaysia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the chemical composition of the essential oils of Curcuma aeruginosa (C. aeruginosa), Curcuma mangga (C. mangga), and Zingiber cassumunar (Z. cassumunar), and study their antimicrobial activity. METHODS: Essential oils obtained by steam distillation were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils was evaluated against four bacteria: Bacillus cereus (B. cereus), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa); and two fungi: Candida albicans (C. albicans) and Cyptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans), using disc-diffusion and broth microdilution methods. RESULTS: Cycloisolongifolene, 8,9-dehydro formyl (35.29%) and dihydrocostunolide (22.51%) were the major compounds in C. aeruginosa oil; whereas caryophyllene oxide (18.71%) and caryophyllene (12.69%) were the major compounds in C. mangga oil; and 2,6,9,9-tetramethyl-2,6,10-cycloundecatrien-1-one (60.77%) and alpha-caryophyllene (23.92%) were abundant in Z. cassumunar oil. The essential oils displayed varying degrees of antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms. C. mangga oil had the highest and most broad-spectrum activity by inhibiting all microorganisms tested, with C. neoformans being the most sensitive microorganism by having the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values of 0.1 muL/mL. C. aeruginosa oil showed mild antimicrobial activity, whereas Z. cassumunar had very low or weak activity against the tested microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results suggest promising antimicrobial properties of C. mangga and C. aeruginosa, which may be useful for food preservation, pharmaceutical treatment and natural therapies.
TI  - Mechanism and diversity of the erythromycin esterase family of enzymes.
AB  - Macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin and erythromycin are mainstays of modern antibacterial chemotherapy, and like all antibiotics, they are vulnerable to resistance. One mechanism of macrolide resistance is via drug inactivation: enzymatic hydrolysis of the macrolactone ring catalyzed by erythromycin esterases, EreA and EreB. A genomic enzymology approach was taken to gain insight into the catalytic mechanisms and origins of Ere enzymes. Our analysis reveals that erythromycin esterases comprise a separate group in the hydrolase superfamily, which includes homologues of uncharacterized function found on the chromosome of Bacillus cereus, Bcr135 and Bcr136, whose three-dimensional structures have been determined. Biochemical characterization of Bcr136 confirms that it is an esterase that is, however, unable to inactivate macrolides. Using steady-state kinetics, homology-based structure modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, solvent isotope effect studies, pH, and inhibitor profiling performed in various combinations for EreA, EreB, and Bcr136 enzymes, we identified the active site and gained insight into some catalytic features of this novel enzyme superfamily. We rule out the possibility of a Ser/Thr nucleophile and show that one histidine, H46 (EreB numbering), is essential for catalytic function. This residue is proposed to serve as a general base in activation of a water molecule as the reaction nucleophile. Furthermore, we show that EreA, EreB, and Bcr136 are distinct, with only EreA inhibited by chelating agents and hypothesized to contain a noncatalytic metal. Detailed characterization of these esterases allows for a direct comparison of the resistance determinants, EreA and EreB, with their prototype, Bcr136, and for the discussion of their potential connections.
TI  - Iodine-stabilized Cu nanoparticle chitosan composite for antibacterial applications.
AB  - We report herein the synthesis of a new composite consisting of Cu nanoparticles  (NPs) and chitosan (CS), which has been found to be stable in the presence of molecular iodine and has also high antimicrobial activities. The composite could be obtained when aqueous CuSO(4) was treated with hydrazine in the presence of CS. The spherical Cu NPs present in the composite were of average diameters 8+/-4 nm. The NPs were unstable in atmospheric conditions leading to the formation of oxides of Cu. On the other hand, when molecular iodine was added to the medium following synthesis the NPs were rather stable. Studies of antibacterial property were carried out on Gram-negative green fluorescent expressing Escherichia coli bacteria & Gram-positive Bacillus cereus bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the iodinated composite on Escherichia coli was found to be 130.8 mug/mL, which contained 21.5 mug/mL Cu NPs. This determined value of MIC for Cu NPs was much lower than those reported in the literature. Zeta potential (zeta) measurements supported an attractive interaction between iodinated CS-Cu NP composite and bacteria which was further supported by electron microscopic images. Electron microscopic and flow cytometric studies revealed that the iodinated CS-Cu NP composite was attached to the bacterial cell wall, which caused irreversible damage to the membrane, eventually leading to cell death. Mechanism of bactericidal action of the iodinated composite is discussed in light of our findings.
TI  - Assessment of microbial quality of commercial and home-made tiger-nut beverages.
AB  - AIMS: We aimed to assess the microbiological quality of Spanish commercial tiger-nut beverages as well as home-made samples collected from supermarkets, street vendors, juice bars and ice-cream parlours located in Valencia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microbiological analysis of 44 tiger-nut beverages samples were carried out according to International Standard Organization (ISO) norms and published works which included the total viable count, Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Bacillus cereus, yeasts, moulds, Yersinia enterocolitca, Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio spp. and Listeria monocytogenes. The obtained results indicated that all the commercial samples were below the detection limit for the viable microorganisms. Results of analysis of those home-made tiger-nut samples revealed that 67% (16 samples) harboured total plate counts while the rest of samples were free from these microorganisms. Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 62% (15 samples). E. coli were found in only one sample (4%), yeasts and moulds were detected in 62% (15 samples) each, Shigella was found in 21% (five samples); however, all samples were free from S. aureus, Salmonella, Y. enterocolotica, C. perfringens, Vibrio spp. and L. monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: These results reflected that there exists a rather high contamination level in home-made tiger-nut beverages indicating the need to apply correct and strict HACCP system(s) during manufacturing and storage of these food products. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently in these products and even more the need to apply correct HACCP system (s). Tiger-nut beverages are especially well-known products in Spain, hence it is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health.
TI  - Milk microbiome signatures of subclinical mastitis-affected cattle analysed by shotgun sequencing.
AB  - AIMS: Metagenomic analysis of milk samples collected from Kankrej, Gir (Bos indicus) and crossbred (Bos taurus x B. indicus) cattle harbouring subclinical mastitis was carried out by next-generation sequencing 454 GS-FLX technology to elucidate the microbial community structure of cattle milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Milk samples from Kankrej, Gir and crossbred cattle were subjected to metagenomic profiling by pyrosequencing. The Metagenomic analysis produced 63.07, 11.09 and 7.87 million base pairs (Mb) of sequence data, assembled in 264 798, 56 114 and 36 762 sequences with an average read length of 238, 197 and 214 nucleotides in Kankrej, Gir and crossbred cattle, respectively. Phylogenetic and metabolic profiles by the web-based tool MG-RAST revealed that the members of Enterobacteriales were predominant in mastitic milk followed by Pseudomonadales, Bacillales and Lactobacillales. Around 56 different species with varying abundance were detected in the subclinically infected milk. Escherichia coli was found to be the most predominant species in Kankrej and Gir cattle followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas mendocina, Shigella flexneri and Bacillus cereus. In crossbred cattle, Staphylococcus aureus followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and E. coli were detected in descending order. Metabolic profiling indicated fluoroquinolones, methicillin, copper, cobalt-zinc-cadmium as the groups of antibiotics and toxic compounds to which the organisms showed resistance. Sequences indicating potential of organisms exhibiting multidrug resistance against antibiotics and resistance to toxic compounds were also present. Interestingly, presence of bacteriophages against Staph. aureus, E. coli, Enterobacter and Yersinia species was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis identified potential infectious organisms in mastitis, resistance of organisms to antibiotics and chemical compounds and the natural resistance potential of dairy cows. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The findings of this study may help in formulating strategies for the prevention and treatment of mastitis in dairy animals and consequently in reducing economic losses incurred because of it.
TI  - Antimicrobial prenylated acetophenones from berries of Harrisonia abyssinica.
AB  - The ripe berries of Harrisonia abyssinica yielded two new prenylated acetophenones, namely 5-(ethan-1'''-one)-4,6-dihydroxy-7-(3'',3''-dimethylallyl)-2 S-(1' S-hydroxy-1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (1) and 5-(2'''-hydroxyethan-1'''-one)-4,6-dihydroxy-7-(3'',3''-dimethylallyl)-2 S-(1' S-hydroxy-1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (2), herein named harronin I and harronin II, respectively. The compounds were isolated following activity guided fractionation and the structures were determined using 1D, 2D NMR spectroscopic, CD and MS spectrometric techniques. The methanol-dichloromethane mixture (1 : 1 v/v) crude extract exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus casei. Harronin I (1) showed a MIC of 5 microg/mL against C. albicans, 6 microg/mL against B. cereus, and more than 20 microg/mL against other tested microorganisms. Harronin II (2) showed much weaker MIC values (> 100 microg/mL) against all the tested microorganisms.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial properties of green, black, and herbal teas of Camellia sinensis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of non-polymeric phenolic (NP) and polymeric tannin (PT) constituents in the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of six brands of green, black, and herbal teas of Camellia sinensis were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total phenolic content (TPC) and ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC) were assessed using the Folin-Ciocalteu and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays, respectively. Minimum inhibitory dose (MID) against Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, and Gram-negative. Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed using the disc-diffusion method. Teas were extracted with hot water successively three times for one hour each time. The extracts were fractionated using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography to obtain the NP and PT constituents. RESULTS: Extraction yields ranged from 12 to 23%. Yields of NP fractions (70-81%) were much higher than those of PT fractions (1-11%), suggesting that the former are the major tea components. Ranking of antioxidant properties of extracts was green tea>black tea>herbal tea. For all six teas, antioxidant properties of PT fractions were significantly higher than extracts and NP fractions. Extracts and fractions of all six teas showed no activity against the three Gram-negative bacteria. Green teas inhibited all three Gram-positive bacteria with S. aureus being the least susceptible. Black and herbal teas inhibited the growth of M. luteus and B. cereus, but not S. aureus. The most potent were the PT fractions of Boh Cameron Highlands and Ho Yan Hor with MID of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/disc against M. luteus. CONCLUSION: Results suggested that NP constituents are major contributors to the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of teas of C. sinensis. Although PT constituents have stronger antioxidant and antibacterial properties, they constitute only a minor component of the teas.
TI  - Electrochemical biosensor for rapid and sensitive detection of magnetically extracted bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Biological defense and security applications demand rapid, sensitive detection of bacterial pathogens. This work presents a novel qualitative electrochemical detection technique which is applied to two representative bacterial pathogens, Bacillus cereus (as a surrogate for B. anthracis) and Escherichia coli O157:H7, resulting in detection limits of 40 CFU/mL and 6 CFU/mL, respectively, from pure culture. Cyclic voltammetry is combined with immunomagnetic separation in a rapid method requiring approximately 1 h for presumptive positive/negative results. An immunofunctionalized magnetic/polyaniline core/shell nano-particle (c/sNP) is employed to extract target cells from the sample solution and magnetically position them on a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) sensor. The presence of target cells significantly inhibits current flow between the electrically active c/sNPs and SPCE. This method has the potential to be adapted for a wide variety of target organisms and sample matrices, and to become a fully portable system for routine monitoring or emergency detection of bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Synthesis, SAR and antibacterial activity of hybrid chloro, dichloro-phenylthiazolyl-s-triazines.
AB  - A series of hybrid novel chloro (1a-9a) and dichloro (10b-18b) phenylthiazolyl-s-triazine were synthesized and subsequently subjected to their antibacterial activity against three gram positive viz. Lactobacillus casei (NCIM-2651); Bacillus cereus (NCIM-2458); Staphylococcus aureus (NCIM-2120) and three gram negative viz Salmonella typhimurium (NCIM-2501); Escherichia coli (NCIM-2065); Klebsiella aerogenes (NCIM-2098). The SAR studies around the lead compound revealed that introduction of electron withdrawing groups and amino (-NH-) and mercapto (-S-) linker bridge seemed more promising towards antibacterial activity. Moreover, the virtual Molinspiration screenings are in compliance with Ghose's rule.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of some thiazolidinones as antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A novel series of thiazolidinone derivatives namely 4-(4-dimethylamino-6-{4-[5-(4-ethylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-4-oxo-2-phenylthiazolidi n-3-yl]-phenylamino}-[1,3,5]triazin-2-yloxy)-1-methyl-1H-quinolin-2-one have been synthesized from the key intermediate 4-[4-(4-aminophenylamino)-6-dimethylamino-[1,3,5]triazin-2-yloxy]-1-methyl-1H-qui nolin-2-one (7). Condensation reaction of compound 7 with different aldehyde derivatives were performed to obtain Schiff base derivatives, which after cyclization gave thiazolidinones and finally they were reacted with N-ethylpiperazine to get target compounds. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneri) and four fungal strains (Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus).
TI  - Anti-bacterial studies on Hemigraphis colorata (Blume) H.G. Hallier and Elephantopus scaber L.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, Hemigraphis colorata (H. colorata) leaves and stem and Elephantopus scaber (E. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected pathogens. METHODS: The fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. The dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 mL of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. RESULTS: The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root and H. colorata leaves and stem demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of H. colorata leaves and stem. The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). The root ethanolic extracts of E. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (24 mm), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (16 mm) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (13 mm). The chlorofrom extracts of E. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) (12 mm), The leaves ethanolic extracts of E. scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (18 mm), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (17 mm), Salmonella Typhi (S. typhi) (14 mm) and Enterobacter sp. (11 mm) While the benzene extracts of H. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen Acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and S. aureus (12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
TI  - Using a multi-faceted approach to determine the changes in bacterial cell surface properties influenced by a biofilm lifestyle.
AB  - Biofilm formation is a developmental process in which initial reversible adhesion is governed by physico-chemical forces, whilst irreversible adhesion is mediated by biological changes within a cell, such as the production of extracellular polymeric substances. Using two bacteria, E. coli MG1655 and B. cereus ATCC 10987, this study establishes that the surface of the bacterial cell also undergoes specific modifications, which result in biofilm formation and maintenance. Using various surface characterisation techniques and proteomics, an increase in the surface exposed proteins on E. coli cells during biofilm formation was demonstrated, along with an increase in hydrophobicity and a decrease in surface charge. For B. cereus, an increase in the surface polysaccharides during biofilm formation was found as well as a decrease in hydrophobicity and surface charge. This work therefore shows that surface modifications during biofilm formation occur and understanding these specific changes may lead to the formulation of effective biofilm control strategies in the future.
TI  - Chemical, antioxidant and antimicrobial investigations of Pinus cembra L. bark and needles.
AB  - The chemical constituents and biological activity of Pinus cembra L. (Pinaceae),  native to the Central European Alps and the Carpathian Mountains, are not well known. The aim of the present work was to examine the phenolic content, antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of hydromethanolic extracts of Pinus cembra L. bark and needles. Bark extract had higher concentrations of total phenolics (299.3 vs. 78.22 mg gallic acid equivalents/g extract), flavonoids (125.3 vs. 19.84 mg catechin equivalents/g extract) and proanthocyanidins (74.3 vs. 12.7 mg cyanidin equivalents/g extract) than needle extract and was more active as a free radical scavenger, reducing agent and antimicrobial agent. The EC(5)(0) values in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) and reducing power assays were 71.1, 6.3 and 26 mg/mL for bark extract and 186.1, 24 and 104 mg/mL for needle extract, respectively. In addition, needle extract showed ferrous ions chelating effects (EC(5)(0) = 1,755 mug/mL). The antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were assessed by the agar diffusion method. Both extracts (4 mg/well) were active against all the microorganisms tested; bark extract showed higher inhibition on all strains. These results indicate that Pinus cembra L. bark and needles are good sources of phytochemicals with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities.
TI  - A new depsidone and antibacterial activities of compounds from Usnea undulata Stirton.
AB  - Usnea undulata Stirton (Usneaaceae) is a fruticose lichen used locally in ethnoveterinary medicine to treat mammary infections in cattle while human beings use it for the treatment of wounds in Eastern Cape, South Africa. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of its extracts led to the isolation and characterization of a new depsidone, 2'-O-methylhypostictic acid (8), together with seven known compounds, i.e. methyl beta-orsellinate, norstictic acid, menegazziaic acid, (+) usnic acid, hypoconstictic acid, salazinic acid, and galbinic acid. The structures of the compounds were elucidated on the basis of their spectral analysis including homo- and hetero-nuclear correlation NMR experiments (COSY, NOESY, HMQC, and HMBC) and mass spectra as well as by comparison with available data in the literature. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) values of the compounds against six bacteria were determined. Compound 8 showed inhibitory activity against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis with MICs of 31, 62.5, 62.5 mug/ml, respectively. (+) Usnic acid was most active against B. subtilis, B. cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli with MICs of 8, 8, 31, and 31 mug/ml, respectively, while other compounds exhibited moderate activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of water-soluble extract from pine needles of Cedrus deodara.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of water-soluble extract from pine needles of Cedrus deodara (WEC) was evaluated on five food-borne bacteria, and its related mechanism was investigated by transmission electron microscope. In vitro antibacterial assay showed that WEC possesses a remarkable antibacterial activity against tested food-borne bacteria including Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus, with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values in the ranges of 0.78-12.5 mg/ml and 1.56-25mg/ml, respectively. In a food system of fresh-squeezed tomato juice, WEC was observed to possess an effective capacity to control the total counts of viable bacteria. Shikimic acid was isolated from WEC and identified as the main antibacterial compound. All results of our study suggested that WEC might be a new potential source of natural antibacterial agents applicable to food.
TI  - Rapid detection of vip1-type genes from Bacillus cereus and characterization of a novel vip binary toxin gene.
AB  - A PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method for identifying  vegetative insecticidal protein (vip) 1-type genes from Bacillus cereus was developed by designing specific primers based on the conserved regions of the genes to amplify vip1-type gene fragments. PCR products were digested with endonuclease AciI, and four known vip1-type genes were identified. Vip1Ac and vip1Aa-type genes appeared in 17 of 26 B. cereus strains. A novel vip1-type gene, vip1Ac1, was identified from B. cereus strain HL12. The vip1Ac1 and vip2Ae3 genes were co-expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 by vector pCOLADuet-1. The binary toxin showed activity only against Aphis gossypii (Homoptera), but not for Coleptera (Tenebrio molitor, Holotrichia oblita), Lepidoptera (Spodoptera exigua, Helicoverpa armigera, and Chilo suppressalis), Diptera (Culex quinquefasciatus). The LC(50) of this binary toxin for A. gossypii is 87.5 (34.2-145.3) ng mL(-1) . This is probably only the second report that Vip1 and Vip2 binary toxin shows toxicity against homopteran pests. The PCR-RFLP method developed could be very useful for identifying novel Vip1-Vip2-type binary toxins, and the novel binary toxins, Vip1Ac1 and Vip2Ae3, identified in this study may have applications in biological control of insects, thus avoiding potential problems of resistance.
TI  - Impact of solvent/detergent treatment of plasma on transfusion-relevant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment in a medical device has been developed for pathogen reduction of plasma for transfusion. Impact of S/D on bacterial growth and on the capacity of complement to kill bacteria has been investigated in this study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A pool of apheresis plasma from four donors was spiked with eight transfusion-relevant bacteria. Plasma was treated with 1% tri(n-butyl) phosphate and 1% Triton X-45 at 31 degrees C for 90 min and then extracted by oil at 31 degrees C for 70 min. Decomplemented plasma and Phosphate Buffer Saline were used as controls. Bacterial count was determined in samples taken immediately after spiking, or after S/D and oil treatment. Similar experiments were conducted using three individual recovered plasma donations. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were performed using discs soaked with plasma samples whether containing the S/D agents or not. RESULTS: The mean reduction factors of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae due to complement during S/D treatment were >8.75, 4.71, and 4.18 log in pooled plasma and >7.42, 2.24 and >6.08 log in individual plasmas, respectively. Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis were inactivated by S/D (>7.04 and 1.60 log in pooled, and >6.06 and 2.39 in individual plasmas, respectively). Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter cloacae did not multiply during S/D treatment of plasma. Growth inhibition tests revealed an inhibition of three gram-negative bacteria by complement and all gram-positive by S/D. CONCLUSION: The S/D treatment of plasma does not alter the bactericidal activity of complement, and inactivates some gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Metal complexes of diisopropylthiourea: synthesis, characterization and antibacterial studies.
AB  - Co(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and Fe(III) complexes of diisopropylthiourea have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, molar conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, FTIR and electronic spectroscopy. The compounds are non-electrolytes in solution and spectroscopic data of the complexes are consistent with 4-coordinate geometry for the metal(II) complexes and six coordinate octahedral for Fe(III) complex. The complexes were screened for their antibacterial activities against six bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas auriginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus pumilus. The complexes showed varied antibacterial activities and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined.
TI  - Exploration of in vitro time point quantitative evaluation of newly synthesized benzimidazole and benzothiazole derivatives as potential antibacterial agents.
AB  - Present communication deals with the in vitro time point quantitative antibacterial evaluation of newly synthesized 1,2-disubstituted benzimidazoles (3a-p) and 2-substituted benzothiazoles (5a-h) against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio cholerae, Shigella dysenteriae and Escherichia coli. These compounds were synthesized under mild reaction conditions using Al(2)O(3)-Fe(2)O(3) nanocrystals as heterogeneous catalyst. Bio-evaluation studies revealed that, compounds 3a, 5a and 5d exhibited moderate to good antibacterial activity against all the tested bacterial stains. The compounds 3a, 3f and 5a have shown enhanced inhibitory activity compared with standard antibacterial drug ciprofloxacin against V. cholerae, B. cereus, and S. dysenteriae, respectively. Additionally, the compounds 3a, 3e, 3f, 3h and 5b displayed complete bactericidal activity within 24 h, whereas ciprofloxacin took 48 h to kill those bacteria completely.
TI  - Salt sensitivity of minimal twin arginine translocases.
AB  - Bacterial twin arginine translocation (Tat) pathways have evolved to facilitate transport of folded proteins across membranes. Gram-negative bacteria contain a TatABC translocase composed of three subunits named TatA, TatB, and TatC. In contrast, the Tat translocases of most Gram-positive bacteria consist of only TatA and TatC subunits. In these minimal TatAC translocases, a bifunctional TatA subunit fulfils the roles of both TatA and TatB. Here we have probed the importance of conserved residues in the bifunctional TatAy subunit of Bacillus subtilis by site-specific mutagenesis. A set of engineered TatAy proteins with mutations in the cytoplasmic hinge and amphipathic helix regions were found to be inactive in protein translocation under standard growth conditions for B. subtilis or when heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Nevertheless, these mutated TatAy proteins did assemble into TatAy and TatAyCy complexes, and they facilitated membrane association of twin arginine precursor proteins in E. coli. Interestingly, most of the mutated TatAyCy translocases were salt-sensitive in B. subtilis. Similarly, the TatAC translocases of Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus were salt-sensitive when expressed in B. subtilis. Taken together, our present observations imply that salt-sensitive electrostatic interactions have critical roles in the preprotein translocation activity of certain TatAC type translocases from Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Complete genome sequence and characterization of the N-acylhomoserine lactone-degrading gene of the potato leaf-associated Solibacillus silvestris.
AB  - N-Acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) are used as quorum-sensing signal molecules by many gram-negative bacteria. We have reported that Solibacillus silvestris, which was isolated from the potato leaf, has AHL-degrading activity. To identify the AHL-degrading gene, whole genome sequencing of S. silvestris StLB046 was performed by using pyrosequencing technology. As the result of the BLAST search, one predicted ORF (ahlS) showed slight similarity to AiiA-like AHL lactonase from Bacillus cereus group. Escherichia coli harboring the ahlS-expressing plasmid showed high AHL-degrading activity. The ahlS-cording region was also amplified by PCR from the other potato leaf-associated and AHL-degrading S. silvestris strains. Purified AhlS as a maltose binding fusion protein showed high AHL-degrading activity and catalyzes AHL ring opening by hydrolyzing lactones. In addition, expression of ahlS in plant pathogen Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum attenuated maceration of the potato slices. Our results suggest that AHL-degrading activity of ahlS might perform useful functions such as useful biocontrol agents.
TI  - A new sesquiterpene from endophytic fungus Aspergillus sp.
AB  - A fungal strain named YLF-14 was isolated from the leaf of Altingia yunnunensis.  Based on the sequence at the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the strain was identified as an Aspergillus sp.. A new sesquiterpene 5beta,8abeta-dimethyl-3,4,4abeta,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1,2,5alpha-trime thanol (1) and a known compound 12-N-methylcyclo-(L-tryptophyl-L-phenylalanyl) (2) were isolated from the culture of this strain. Bioassay experiments showed that the two compounds had no obvious effect on the growth of tested bacteria and nematodes.
TI  - Bacterial inactivation using silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles as functional antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The ability for silver nanoparticles to function as an antibacterial agent while  being separable from the target fluids is important for bacterial inactivation in biological fluids. This report describes the analysis of the antimicrobial activities of silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles synthesized by wet chemical methods. The bacterial inactivation of several types of bacteria was analyzed, including Gram-positive bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus ) and Gram-negative bacteria ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Enterobacter cloacae , and Escherichia coli ). The results have demonstrated the viability of the silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles for achieving effective bacterial inactivation efficiency comparable to and better than that of silver nanoparticles conventionally used. The bacteria inactivation efficiency of our silver-coated MnZn ferrite (MZF@Ag) nanoparticles was also determined for blood platelets samples, demonstrating the potential of utilization in inactivating bacterial growth in platelets prior to transfusion to ensure blood product safety, which also has important implications for enabling the capability of effective separation, delivery, and targeting of the antibacterial agents.
TI  - Antibacterial characteristics and activity of water-soluble chitosan derivatives  prepared by the Maillard reaction.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of water-soluble chitosan derivatives prepared by Maillard reactions against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, and Salmonella typhimurium was examined. Relatively high antibacterial activity against various microorganisms was noted for the chitosan-glucosamine derivative as compared to the acid-soluble chitosan. In addition, it was found that the susceptibility of the test organisms to the water-soluble chitosan derivative was higher in deionized water than in saline solution. Metal ions were also found to reduce the antibacterial activity of the water-soluble chitosan derivative on S. aureus. The marked increase in glucose level, protein content and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was observed in the cell supernatant of S. aureus exposed to the water-soluble chitosan derivative in deionized water. The results suggest that the water-soluble chitosan produced by Maillard reaction may be a promising commercial substitute for acid-soluble chitosan.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of various leaf extracts of Merremia emarginata.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial activity and phytochemical screening  of the aqueous, methanol and petroleum ether leaf extracts of Merremia emarginata (M. emarginata). METHODS: The antibacterial activity of leaf extracts of M. emarginata were evaluated by agar well diffusion method against four selected bacterial species. RESULTS: The presence of tannins, flavonoids, amino acids, starch, glycosides and carbohydrates in the different leaf extracts was established. The methanol extract was more effective against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli, whereas aqueous extract was more effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: : The results in the present study suggest that M. emarginata leaf can be used in treating diseases caused by the tested organisms.
TI  - Fluorinated s-triazinyl piperazines as antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A series of 1,3,5-triazine derivatives that contain 4-amino-2-trifluoromethyl-benzonitrile, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and different piperazines as substituents at the carbon atoms of the triazine ring have been synthesized by a simple and efficient synthetic protocol. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated with the aid of IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was tested against seven bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96, Bacillus cereus MTCC 619, Escherichia coli MTCC 739, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 741, Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 109, Salmonella typhi MTCC 733, Proteus vulgaris MTCC 1771) and four fungi (Aspergillus niger MTCC 282, Aspergillus fumigatus MTCC 343, Aspergillus clavatus MTCC 1323, Candida albicans MTCC 183). The results indicate that some of the novel s-triazines have noteworthy activity in minimum inhibitory concentration as well as agar diffusion tests.
TI  - Efficacy of intravascular catheter lock solutions containing preservatives in the prevention of microbial colonization.
AB  - There is little published evidence regarding whether heparin lock solutions containing preservatives prevent catheter-related infections. However, adverse effects from preservative-containing flushes have been documented in neonates, leading many hospitals to avoid their use altogether. Infection control records from 1982 to 2008 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) were reviewed regarding the incidence of catheter-related infections and the use of preservative-containing intravenous locks. In addition, the antimicrobial activities of heparin lock solution containing the preservatives parabens (0.165%) or benzyl alcohol (0.9%), and 70% ethanol were examined against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, and compared with preservative-free saline with and without heparin. Growth was assessed after exposure to test solutions for 0, 2, 4 and 24h at 35 degrees C. The activities of preservatives were assessed against both planktonic (free-floating) and sessile (biofilm-embedded) micro-organisms using the MBEC Assay. Infection control records revealed two periods of increased catheter-related infections, corresponding with two intervals when preservative-free heparin was used at SJCRH. Heparin solution containing preservatives demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile forms of all six microbial species. Ethanol demonstrated the greatest antimicrobial activity, especially following short incubation periods. Heparin lock solutions containing the preservatives parabens or benzyl alcohol, and 70% ethanol demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile micro-organisms commonly responsible for catheter-related infections. These findings, together with the authors' historical infection control experience, support the use of preservatives in intravenous lock solutions to reduce catheter related infections in patients beyond the neonatal period.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of hydrogen peroxide and its activation by a novel heterogeneous Fenton's-like modified PAN catalyst.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potential activation of hydrogen peroxide by a novel catalyst, reducing the concentration of hydrogen peroxide required and the time taken for microbial inactivation. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antimicrobial properties of an iron-based novel heterogeneous polyacrylonitrile catalyst in combination with hydrogen peroxide were examined against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus using a modified version of the European suspension test. Antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis endospores was also investigated. Bactericidal activity was significantly increased when the polyacrylonitrile catalyst was combined with hydrogen peroxide. 0.2, 0.5 and 1% w/v hydrogen peroxide resulted in average log reductions of 4.76, 5.59 and 5.37 for E. coli, Ps. aeruginosa and Staph. aureus, respectively, after 60 min exposure at room temperature. The catalyst also significantly increased the activity of hydrogen peroxide against B. subtilis and B. cereus endospores. CONCLUSIONS: These studies have demonstrated the potential biocidal use of the novel polyacrylonitrile catalyst when combined with hydrogen peroxide. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first publication to demonstrate the enhanced activity gained using the novel heterogeneous catalyst to potentiate the activity of hydrogen peroxide as a biocide.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Seseli globiferum essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil from aerial parts of Seseli globiferum Vis. obtained by hydrodistillation with Clevenger-type apparatus was analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty-eight compounds were identified, representing 99.4% of the total oil. The main components of the oil were sabinene (38.0%), alpha-pinene (21.2%) and beta-phellandrene (13.5%). The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oil were determined using the broth microdilution method against seven bacterial species: Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 13311), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Enterobacter cloacae (clinical isolates), Bacillus cereus (clinical isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Micrococcus flavus (ATCC 10240) and three fungal species: Aspergillus niger (ATCC 6275), Aspergillus versicolor (ATCC 11730), Trichoderma viride (IAM 5061) and Penicillium funiculosum (ATCC 36839). The essential oil showed activity against bacteria P. aeruginosa, followed by M flavus, L. monocytigenes and E. coli, and all investigated fungal species.
TI  - Preparation and antimicrobial activity of poly (vinyl chloride)/gelatin/montmorillonite biocomposite films.
AB  - The aim of this study was using a novel antimicrobial thermoplastic plasticizer based on aliphatic anhydride derivative dodecenyl succinic anhydride (DSA) for blending poly (vinyl chloride), PVC, with gelatin in presence of montmorillonite (MMT) using Brabender via polymer melting technique. This anhydride-based plasticizer blended the membrane ingredients homogenously under melting process. The used plasticizer exhibited high performance antimicrobial potency for some biomedical and industrial applications. The prepared biocomposite films were evaluated for antimicrobial activity using agar disc diffusion method against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia), Bacillus cereus (B. cereus), Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). The majority of these biocomposites, except the plasticized PVC with DOP, have shown inhibitory effect at different concentrations (1.0-20) mg/ml against all above mentioned bacteria. However, C. albicans and A. niger were the most resistant strains.
TI  - Protection activity of a novel probiotic strain of Bacillus subtilis against Salmonella Enteritidis infection.
AB  - The activity of 240 bacterial isolates screened from the gastrointestinal tracts  of native chickens were evaluated for use as a potential probiotic in food animal production in order to protect against animal diseases and reduce pathogenic contamination of human food products. In observing the antagonistic activity of 117 bacilli isolates, 10 of these isolates exhibited higher growth inhibition of seven foodborne pathogens, including Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Vibrio cholerae. Beneficial probiotic criteria from these isolates - which included non-pathogenicity, acid and bile salt tolerance, hydrophobicity, and adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells - exhibited that one isolate of NC11 had the most potential as a probiotic. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that this NC11 isolate was Bacillus subtilis. This B. subtilis NC11 was sensitive to all antibiotics and was not cytotoxic to intestinal epithelial cells. Reduction of S. Enteritidis attachment to the surfaces of intestinal epithelial cells via action of a cultured medium from B. subtilis NC11 was observed by scanning electron microscopy. B. subtilis NC11 cells, as well as the bacterial cultured medium or the cultured medium adjusted to pH 7, significantly inhibited S. Enteritidis invasion (P<0.01) of intestinal epithelial cells. This study indicates that B. subtilis NC11 has characteristics of a potential probiotic, and exhibits strong inhibition activity against S. Enteritidis infection to intestinal epithelial cells.
TI  - Chitosan and silver nanoparticles as pudding with raisins with antimicrobial properties.
AB  - Chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NP) containing small silver nanoparticles are reported (Ag@CS-NP). CS-NP was synthesized using tripolyphosphate (TPP) as a polyanionic template. TPP also served to electrostatically attract Ag(+) inside CS-NP, where it was reduced by the terminal glucosamine units of the biopolymer. This procedure is environmental friendly, inexpensive, and permits the synthesis of very small AgNP (0.93-1.7 nm), with only a discrete dependence from the amount of silver nitrate used (5-200mg). The obtained hybrid nanocomposites Ag@CS-NP were characterized by DLS, HRTEM, and HAADF-STEM presenting a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 78 nm. The antimicrobial activity of Ag@CS-NP against Candida glabrata, Sacharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus corresponded to MIC values lower than for AgNO(3).
TI  - Microbial examination of nonheated foods served in feeding programs of elementary schools, Iksan City, Jeonbuk Province, Korea.
AB  - More than 90% of elementary school students in Korea have lunch provided by a school feeding program. This study examined nonheated foods, foods in which final ingredients were added after cooking ("heated/nonheated foods"), and desserts for microbial contamination levels and the presence of foodborne pathogens. We obtained a total of 77 food samples belonging to the above three groups from four elementary schools located in Iksan, Jeonbuk, Korea, from June to July 2010. Among the samples, 15% of nonheated foods and 9% of heated/nonheated foods contained > 6 log CFU of aerobic bacteria per g. Unacceptable coliform counts according to Korean national standards (3 log CFU/g) were also observed in 30, 4.5, and 26% of nonheated foods, heated/nonheated foods, and desserts, respectively. The foodborne pathogens Escherichia coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, and Cronobacter sakazakii were found in two, one, and two of the total samples, respectively. Detection of E. coli O157:H7 indicates a low level of safety in the school lunches served in Korean elementary schools. To improve food safety, hazard analysis critical control point guidelines should be applied to school food service establishments to lower the microbial risks in foods served to children.
TI  - A novel pathogen-binding gC1qR homolog, FcgC1qR, in the Chinese white shrimp, Fenneropenaeus chinensis.
AB  - In vertebrates, the globular "head" of complement component C1q receptor (gC1qR)  is a versatile, multiligand binding protein. However, research on its function in invertebrates is limited. In the present study, a full-length cDNA sequence of a novel gC1qR homolog, FcgC1qR, from the Chinese white shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis was cloned. Semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected FcgC1qR in all examined tissues, with the highest level detected in the intestine. Western blot assay further revealed that the FcgC1qR protein was distributed in all tested tissues except the cell-free hemolymph of normal Chinese white shrimp. In the expression pattern study, quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that the transcripts of FcgC1qR were up-regulated when challenged with bacteria (Vibrio anguillarum or Staphylococcus aureus) and white spot syndrome virus. Subsequently, FcgC1qR was over-expressed in Escherichia coli, and the polyclonal antibody was prepared with the purified recombinant protein. Microorganism binding was examined using Western blot assay, and revealed that FcgC1qR could bind to Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, S. aureus, V. anguillarum, Vibrioharveyi, and Candida albicans. FcgC1qR was also proven able to bind to S. aureus in a concentration-dependent manner, and this binding activity was partly inhibited by the polyclonal antibody. These results suggest that FcgC1qR may be involved in defending against bacterial infections in the Chinese white shrimp.
TI  - The potential for reductive mobilization of arsenic [As(V) to As(III)] by OSBH(2) (Pseudomonas stutzeri) and OSBH(5) (Bacillus cereus) in an oil-contaminated site.
AB  - Microbial reduction of arsenate [As(V)] plays an important role in arsenic (As) mobilization in aqueous environments. In this study, we investigated reduction of arsenate by different bacterial isolates such as OSBH(1) (GU329913), OSBH(2) (GU329914), OSBH(3) (GU329915), OSBH(4) (GU329916) and OSBH(5) (GU329917), isolated from the oil sludge of a sewage treatment plant operated by the China Petroleum Refinery Company in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan. Bacterial strains of pure culture were identified by 16S rRNA analysis (>/=99 % nucleotide similarity). Morphological and 16S rRNA analysis show that the isolate OSBH(1) is similar to E. coli, OSBH(2) is similar to P. stutzeri, OSBH(3) is similar to P. putida, OSBH(4) is similar to P. aeruginosa, and OSBH(5) is similar to B. Cereus. The As(V) was transformed to As(III) in the presence of isolates OSBH(2) and OSBH(5) by a detoxification process. The potential reduction rates of As(V) were higher in the presence of isolate OSBH(5) compared to the isolate OSBH(2). The microbial growth (cell/mL) of isolate OSBH(5) was significantly higher in culture medium compared to OSBH(2). The bacterial isolates such as OSBH(1), OSBH(3) and OSBH(4) were found to be incapable of transforming the As(V). It is concluded that the activity of the oil-degrading bacterial isolates described in this work contributes to the mobilization of As in the more toxic As(III) form that affects biotic life.
TI  - Chemical and microbiological hazards associated with recycling of anaerobic digested residue intended for agricultural use.
AB  - In the present study, three full-scale biogas plants (BGP) were investigated for  the concentration of heavy metals, organic pollutants, pesticides and the pathogenic bacteria Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli in the anaerobically digested residues (ADR). The BGPs mainly utilize source-separated organic wastes and industrial food waste as energy sources and separate the ADR into an ADR-liquid and an ADR-solid fraction by centrifugation at the BGP. According to the Norwegian standard for organic fertilizers, the ADR were classified as quality 1 mainly because of high zinc (132-422 mg kg(-1) DM) and copper (23-93 mg kg(-1) DM) concentrations, but also because of high cadmium (0.21-0.60 mg kg(-1) DM) concentrations in the liquid-ADR. In the screening of organic pollutants, only DEHP (9.7-62.1 mg kg(-1)) and summation operator PAH 16 (0.2-1.98 mg kg(-1) DM) were detected in high concentrations according to international regulations. Of the 250 pesticides analyzed, 11 were detected, but only imazalil (<0.30-5.77 mg kg(-1) DM) and thiabendazol (<0.14-0.73 mg kg(-1) DM) were frequently detected in the ADR-fiber. Concentrations of imazalil and thiabendazol were highest during the winter months, due to a high consumption of citrus fruits in Norway in this period. Ten percent of the ADR-liquid samples contained cereulide-producing B. cereus, whereas no verotoxigenic E. coli was detected. The authors conclude that the risk of chemical and bacterial contamination of the food chain or the environment from agricultural use of ADR seems low.
TI  - Biochemical characteristics and biological properties of Annurca apple cider.
AB  - Our work aimed to investigate the phenolic composition and antioxidant capacity of the de-alcoholized extract of cider obtained from the Annurca apple (Malus domestica var. Annurca). The antimicrobial effect of the extract against different pathogens, including Chronobacter sakazakii, was also examined. The extract's potential anti-quorum-sensing (AQS) activity was assessed using the test microorganism Chromobacterium violaceum. Biochemical analysis of the extract using ultra-performance liquid chromatography revealed catechin and caffeic acid as the most abundant polyphenols present, which represented about 35.5% and 36.6% of the total phenolics identified, respectively. An antioxidant capacity was also found (50% effective concentraiton=10 muL). The extract exhibited clear antimicrobial activity against all strains used in the experiments. Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus were the most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity. The extract also inhibited the growth of the emergent pathogen strain C. sakazakii. The AQS activity of apple cider is reported here for the first time. In conclusion, our results demonstrate some biological properties of the apple cider and contribute to reinforcing the potential of the apple and its derivatives as functional components of the diet.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from Nunavik collections of the macroalgae Fucus evanescens C. Agardh (Fucaceae).
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga Fucus evanescens in cell culture. Accessions were collected on the Arctic coast of Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec. The crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against Hemophilus influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC and clinical isolate), and Streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/mL. This algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , whereas Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. Further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against Propionibacterium acnes showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/mL. The main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl O-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/mL. Therefore, the semipurified F. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different degree of hydrolysis of palm kernel expeller  peptides against spore-forming and non-spore-forming bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to determine inhibitory effect of palm kernel expeller (PKE) peptides of different degree of hydrolysis (DH %) against spore-forming bacteria Bacillus cereus, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus stearothermophillus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Clostridium perfringens; and non-spore-forming bacteria Escherichia coli, Lisinibacillus sphaericus, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS AND RESULTS: A range of DH % (50-100) of PKE peptides was prepared using alcalase, and hydrolysis conditions were determined using response surface methodology (RSM). The influence of pH (6.5-10.5), temperature (35-65 degrees C), enzyme/substrate ratio (1-5%) and substrate concentration (1-2%) were studied on the response of the DH. The antibacterial activity of different DH % of PKE peptides was tested by using disc diffusion assay and micro-broth dilution assay. According to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test on each of the PKE peptides of different DH %, the 70 DH % PKE peptide showed greater inhibitory effect compared to the 100 DH % PKE peptide against B. cereus, B. coagulans, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, B. stearothermophillus, B. subtilis, B. thuringiensis, Cl. perfringens, Lisinibacillus sphaericus and L. monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The 70 DH % PKE peptides exhibited greatest overall antibacterial effect of the various peptides of PKE evaluated. Further research is needed to determine the mode of action of PKE peptides. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Palm kernel expeller peptides, a natural plant product, effectively inhibited the growth of spore-forming and non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacteria. Potentially, PKE peptides could be used in food preservation and developed as antibacterial agent in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - Investigation of the antimicrobial activity of Rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.).
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine antimicrobial activity of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil extracts. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Ethanol extract from the leaves of rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) was produced at the Department of Food Technology, Kaunas University of Technology. The antimicrobial activity of the viscous extract or rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil was evaluated using standard microorganism cultures (bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035 and fungi Candida albicans ATCC 60193). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the examined preparations was determined. RESULTS. Both studied preparations - rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) - demonstrated similar antimicrobial activity. The highest sensitivity to the studied preparations was observed in microbes with eukaryotic cell structure: Candida albicans, which is a fungus, and a spore-forming prokaryotic bacterium, Bacillus cereus. The highest resistance was observed in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS. The studied preparations - viscous extracts of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil - are substances with antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria, spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus), and fungi (Candida albicans).
TI  - Exponential ATP amplification through simultaneous regeneration from AMP and pyrophosphate for luminescence detection of bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria monitoring is essential for many industrial manufacturing processes, particularly those involving in food, biopharmaceuticals, and semiconductor production. Firefly luciferase ATP luminescence assay is a rapid and simple bacteria detection method. However, the detection limit of this assay for Escherichia coli is approximately 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU), which is insufficient for many applications. This study aims to improve the assay sensitivity by simultaneous conversion of PP(i) and AMP, two products of the luciferase reaction, back to ATP to form two chain-reaction loops. Because each consumed ATP continuously produces two new ATP molecules, this approach can achieve exponential amplification of ATP. Two consecutive enzyme reactions were employed to regenerate AMP into ATP: adenylate kinase converting AMP into ADP using UTP as the energy source, and acetate kinase catalyzing acetyl phosphate and ADP into ATP. The PP(i)-recycling loop was completed using ATP sulfurylase and adenosine 5' phosphosulfate. The modification maintains good quantification linearity in the ATP luminescence assay and greatly increases its bacteria detection sensitivity. This improved method can detect bacteria concentrations of fewer than 10 CFU. This exponential ATP amplification assay will benefit bacteria monitoring in public health and manufacturing processes that require high-quality water.
TI  - Survival and growth of foodborne bacterial pathogens in fermenting dough of wadi, a legume-based indigenous food.
AB  - Wadi is a hollow, brittle, ball- or cone-shaped popular traditional legume-based  product of many countries in the Indian Subcontinent. To prepare wadi, blackgram (Phaseolus mungo L.) dhal (dehusked split seeds) was soaked, ground to a soft dough, fermented for 10 h in a closed container, moulded into balls or cones and dried for ~60 h (repeating a cycle of 8 h sun-drying at 29-33 degrees C and then 16 h shade-drying at 28-30 degrees C). This study aims at understanding the fate of some selected foodborne bacterial pathogens during a chance contamination of blackgram dough at the time of preparing wadi. Uninoculated dough, during the course of its processing to wadi, remained free from Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, but got contained by Bacillus cereus during the first 10 h of fermentation and also the next 24 h of drying wadi. B. cereus, when spiked into freshly prepared dough at a load of 5.2 log cfu/g, also diminished after 24 h of drying (detection limit (DL), 100 cfu/g). S. aureus (DL, 100 cfu/g) and E. coli (DL, 10 cfu/g) reached below the DL after 36 h of drying. After 10 h of fermentation and 36 h of drying, the moisture content decreased from initial 61.9 to 33.5%, and the pH declined from 6.0 to 4.8.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of acetone and methanol extracts  from Thymus leucotrichius (Lamiaceae).
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Thymus species has been used as tonic and herbal tea,  antiseptic, antitussive, carminative, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. The acetone and methanol extracts of Thymus (T.) leucotrichius (Labiatae/Lamiaceae) was examined for antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antioxidant properties of acetone and methanol extracts of Thymus leucotrichius were investigated using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)/nitric oxide (NO) radical scavenging activity, reducing power and total phenolic substance analysis. Antibacterial, antiyeast and antifungal activity of the plant extracts were tested using the disc diffusion method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Results showed that IC50 of Thymus leucotrichius acetone and methanol extracts that scavenged 50% of the DPPH radical in the medium was found to be 109.72 microg/ml, 43.53 microg/ml, respectively. It was found that IC50 of Thymus leucotrichius acetone and methanol extracts which scavenged 50% of the NO radical in the medium was 180.56 microg/ml, and 67.34 microg/ml, respectively. In the Thymus leucotrichius acetone and methanol extracts (1 mg), 35.64 microg and 51.78 microg pyrocatechol equivalents of phenols were detected, respectively. Neither acetone nor methanol extract possessed activity towards Proteus vulgaris, Rhodotorula rubra, Candida albicans, Aspergillus parasiticus and Aspergillus niger. Acetone extract was the most active on Bacillus cereus and Bacillus megaterium. The sentivity was also observed against towards Escherichia coli H7:O157, Kluvyeromyces fragilis and Fusarium proliferatum when acetone extract used. The methanol extract also displayed more or less similar inhibitory activity towards the test microorganisms. Kluvyeromyces fragilis was resistant to methanol extract of the species unlike acetone extracts of the species. However, the fungus Fusarium proliferatum was markedly inhibited by the methanol extract of test species at 1000 microg and above. Significant inhibitory activities of the two extracts were based upon the increasing dose-dependent level.
TI  - Synthesis and studies of novel 2-(4-cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl amino)-4-(quinoline-4-yloxy)-6-(piperazinyl/piperidinyl)-s-triazines as potential antimicrobial, antimycobacterial and anticancer agents.
AB  - A series of novel s-triazine analogs were synthesized and characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (19)F NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Preliminary screening of target compounds against eight bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneria), four fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus, Candida albicans) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv indicated that 5d, 5h, 5n, 5p, 5q, 5r, 5s, 5t and 5u were the most active compounds among twenty one studied. Thus, they were further subjected to in vitro biological evaluation against human prostate cancer cell line (DU-145) and the results indicate that two compounds 5n and 5s were markedly active.
TI  - Design and synthesis of novel antimicrobial acyclic and heterocyclic dyes and their precursors for dyeing and/or textile finishing based on 2-N-acylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-benzo[b]thiophene systems.
AB  - A series of novel polyfunctionalized acyclic and heterocyclic dye precursors and  their respective azo (hydrazone) counterpart dyes and dye precursors based on conjugate enaminones and/or enaminonitrile moieties were synthesized. The dyes and their precursors are based on 2-cyano-N-(3-cyano-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)-acetamide, 2-ethoxycarbonyl-N-(3-cyano-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)-acetamide or 2-phenylcarbamoyl-N-(3-cyano-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)-acetamide systems as precursors. The latter compounds were used to synthesize polyfunctional thiophene-, thiazole-, pyrazole, pyridine-, pyrimidine-, oxazine-, as well as acyclic moieties. The dyes and dye precursors were characterized by elemental analysis and spectral methods. All dyes and their precursors were screened in vitro and evaluated for both their antibacterial and antifungal activities. MIC data of the novel dye systems and their respective precursors showed significant antimicrobial activity against most tested organisms. Some compounds exhibited comparable or even higher efficiency than selected standards. Dyes were applied at 5% depth for disperse dyeing of nylon, acetate and polyester fabrics. Their spectral characteristics and fastness properties were measured and evaluated.
TI  - Evaluation of four microbial Class II fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase enzymes  for use as biocatalysts.
AB  - Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolase has been used as biocatalyst in the synthesis of several pharmaceutical compounds such as monosaccharides and analogs. Is has been suggested that microbial metal-dependant Class II aldolases could be better industrial catalysts than mammalian Class I enzyme because of their greater stability. The Class II aldolases from four microbes were subcloned into the Escherichia coli vector pT7-7, expressed and purified to near homogeneity. The kinetic parameters, temperature stability, pH profile, and tolerance to organic solvents of the Class II enzymes were determined, and compared with the properties of the Class I aldolase from rabbit muscle. Contrary to results obtained previously with the E. coli Class II aldolase, which was reported to be more stable than the mammalian enzyme, other recombinant Class II aldolases were found to be generally less stable than the Class I enzyme, especially in the presence of organic solvents. Class II aldolase from Bacillus cereus showed higher temperature stability than the other enzymes tested, but only the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Class II aldolase had a stability comparable to the Class I mammalian enzyme under assay conditions. The turnover number of the recombinant M. tuberculosis and Magnaporthe grisea Class II type A aldolases was comparable or higher than that of the Class I enzyme. The recombinant B. cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Class II type B aldolases had very low turnover numbers and low metal content, indicating that the E. coli overexpression system may not be suitable for the Class II type B aldolases from these microorganisms.
TI  - Antioxidant, electrochemical, thermal, antimicrobial and alkane oxidation properties of tridentate Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes.
AB  - In this study, two Schiff base ligands (HL(1) and HL(2)) and their Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Pd(II) and Ru(III) metal complexes were synthesized and characterized by the analytical and spectroscopic methods. Alkane oxidation activities of the metal complexes were studied on cyclohexane as substrate. The ligands and their metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis (as gram-positive bacteria) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella fragilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans (as gram-negative bacteria). The antioxidant properties of the Schiff base ligands were evaluated in a series of in vitro tests: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and reducing power activity of superoxide anion radical generated non-enzymatic systems. Electrochemical and thermal properties of the compounds were investigated.
TI  - A new class of 2-(4-cyanophenyl amino)-4-(6-bromo-4-quinolinyloxy)-6-piperazinyl  (piperidinyl)-1,3,5-triazine analogues with antimicrobial/antimycobacterial activity.
AB  - This study presents the synthesis and in vitro pharmacological evaluations of novel 2-(4-cyanophenyl amino)-4-(6-bromo-4-quinolinyloxy)-6-piperazinyl (piperidinyl)-1,3,5-triazines. The title compounds were assayed for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against eight bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneria) and four fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus, Candida albicans) using paper disc diffusion and agar streak dilution method as well as against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain using BACTEC MGIT and Lowenstein-Jensen MIC method. The bioassay results indicate that nine compounds namely 5d, 5h, 5n, 5p, 5q, 5r, 5s, 5t and 5u could be considered as possible potential agents with dual antimicrobial and antimycobacterial activities. The structures of the compounds were elucidated with the aid of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (19)F NMR spectroscopy and CHN analysis.
TI  - Modulation of virulence and antibiotic susceptibility of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains by Enterococcus faecium probiotic strain culture fractions.
AB  - The increasing rate of antimicrobial resistance drastically reduced the efficiency of conventional antibiotics and led to the reconsideration of the interspecies interactions in influencing bacterial virulence and response to therapy. The aim of the study was the investigation of the influence of the soluble and cellular fractions of Enterococcus (E.) faecium CMGB16 probiotic culture on the virulence and antibiotic resistance markers expression in clinical enteropathogenic Escherichia (E.) coli strains. The 7 clinical enteropathogenic E. coli strains, one standard E. coli ATCC 25,922 and one Bacillus (B.) cereus strains were cultivated in nutrient broth, aerobically at 37 degrees C, for 24 h. The E. faecium CMGB16 probiotic strain was cultivated in anaerobic conditions, at 37 degrees C in MRS (Man Rogosa Sharpe) broth, and co-cultivated with two pathogenic strains (B. cereus and E. coli O28) culture fractions (supernatant, washed sediment and heat-inactivated culture) for 6 h, at 37 degrees C. After co-cultivation, the soluble and cellular fractions of the probiotic strain cultivated in the presence of two pathogenic strains were separated by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 10 min), heat-inactivated (15 min, 100 degrees C) and co-cultivated with the clinical enteropathogenic E. coli strains in McConkey broth, for 24 h, at 37 degrees C, in order to investigate the influence of the probiotic fractions on the adherence capacity and antibiotic susceptibility. All tested probiotic combinations influenced the adherence pattern of E. coli tested strains. The enteropathogenic E. coli strains susceptibility to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and quinolones was increased by all probiotic combinations and decreased for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. This study demonstrates that the plurifactorial anti-infective action of probiotics is also due to the modulation of virulence factors and antibiotic susceptibility expression in E. coli pathogenic strains.
TI  - Hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  - In order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the Greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). In all cold meat preparations Clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other Clostridium sp lec(-), as well as Lactobacillus, Bacillus sp. and Salmonella sp. were recovered. For instance Bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. L. monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter lari were absent. Differences in the occurrence of S. aureus, Salmonella sp., E. coli and spore forms of C. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). Antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. A multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. Albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. Antibiotics commonly used for therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. Systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.
TI  - Detection, cellular localization and antibacterial activity of two lytic enzymes  of Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8042.
AB  - AIM: In Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8042, two activities of peptidoglycan hydrolase (PGH) with lytic effect against Micrococcus lysodeikticus and Staphylococcus aureus have been detected. This work intends to elucidate the growth phase of maximum lytic activity, the localization and the effectiveness of the activity against pathogenic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cells were grown in MRS medium and collected at different growth stages, and the proteins were extracted. The highest PGH activity was found during the logarithmic growth phase in the protein fraction bound to the cell membrane. From this fraction, two distinct proteins bands (110- and 99-kDa) in SDS-PAGE were partially purified with a three-step procedure. Both bands showed lytic activity against M. lysodeikticus. Mass spectrometry analysis (LC/ESI-MS/MS) indicated that the 110-kDa band corresponded to a protein of unknown function. The 99-kDa band corresponded to a N-acetylmuramidase that harboured catalytic sites with N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase and N-acetylglucosaminidase activities. Both proteins are reported in the Ped. acidilactici 7_4 genome. The fraction containing the concentrated proteins (110 and 99 kDa) inhibited the growth of several pathogenic strains as: Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium. The growth of S. aureus was diminished by 3 logarithmic units as early as 0.5 h of growth, while inhibition of Escherichia coli and Ped. acidilactici was observed after 18 and 8 h, respectively (both in one logarithmic unit). The minimum inhibitory concentration against S. aureus was 10 mug ml(-1). CONCLUSION: Pediococcus acidilactici harbours at least two lytic enzymes, one of them recognized as PGH for the first time, which exert antibacterial activity against several bacterial strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Both PGH activities have a broad growth inhibition spectrum and could be used to control pathogenic bacteria. Because this activity comes from a lactic acid bacterium, it could be safely used in manufacturing processes of fermented foods.
TI  - Biochemical and mutational studies of the Bacillus cereus CECT 5050T formamidase  support the existence of a C-E-E-K tetrad in several members of the nitrilase superfamily.
AB  - Formamidases (EC 3.5.1.49) are poorly characterized proteins. In spite of this scarce knowledge, ammonia has been described as playing a central role in the pathogenesis of human pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori, for which formamidase has been shown to participate in the nitrogen metabolic pathway. Sequence analysis has revealed that at least two different groups of formamidases are classified as EC 3.5.1.49: on the one hand, the derivatives of the FmdA-AmdA superfamily, which are the best studied to date, and on the other hand, the derivatives of Helicobacter pylori AmiF. Here we present the cloning, purification, and characterization of a recombinant formamidase from Bacillus cereus CECT 5050T (BceAmiF), the second member of the AmiF subfamily to be characterized, showing new features of the enzyme further supporting its relationship with aliphatic amidases. We also present homology modeling-based mutational studies confirming the importance of the Glu140 and Tyr191 residues in the enzymatic activities of the AmiF family. Moreover, we can conclude that a second glutamate residue is critical in several members of the nitrilase superfamily, meaning that what has consistently been identified as a C-E-K triad is in fact a C-E-E-K tetrad.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Molecular weight change of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) caused by the PhaC subunit  of PHA synthase from Bacillus cereus YB-4 in recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)-producing Bacillus strains possess class IV PHA synthases composed of two subunit types, namely, PhaR and PhaC. In the present study, PHA synthases from Bacillus megaterium NBRC15308(T) (PhaRC(Bm)), B. cereus YB-4 (PhaRC(YB4)), and hybrids (PhaR(Bm)C(YB4) and PhaR(YB4)C(Bm)) were expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 to characterize the molecular weight of the synthesized poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)]. PhaRC(Bm) synthesized P(3HB) with a relatively high molecular weight (M(n) = 890 x 10(3)) during 72 h of cultivation, whereas PhaRC(YB4) synthesized low-molecular-weight P(3HB) (M(n) = 20 x 10(3)). The molecular weight of P(3HB) synthesized by PhaRC(YB4) decreased with increasing culture time and temperature. This time-dependent behavior was observed for hybrid synthase PhaR(Bm)C(YB4), but not for PhaR(YB4)C(Bm). These results suggest that the molecular weight change is caused by the PhaC(YB4) subunit. The homology between PhaCs from B. megaterium and B. cereus YB-4 is 71% (amino acid identity); however, PhaC(YB4) was found to have a previously unknown effect on the molecular weight of the P(3HB) synthesized in E. coli.
TI  - Preparation of mucoadhesive oral patches containing tetracycline hydrochloride and carvacrol for treatment of local mouth bacterial infections and candidiasis.
AB  - The specific aim of this work was to prepare mucoadhesive patches containing tetracycline hydrochloride and carvacrol in an attempt to develop a novel oral drug delivery system for the treatment of mouth infections. The bilayered patches were prepared using ethyl cellulose as a backing layer and carbopol 934 as a matrix mucoadhesive layer. Patches were prepared with different loading amounts of tetracycline hydrochloride and carvacrol. The antimicrobial activity was assessed for the prepared patches using the disc-diffusion method against the yeast Candida albicans and five bacterial strains, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus bronchispti. In this work, we highlighted the possibility of occurrence of a synergistic action between carvacrol and tetracycline. The best formulation was selected based on microbiological tests, drug release, ex-vivo mucoadhesive performance, and swelling index. Physical characteristics of the selected formulations were determined. These included pH, patch thickness, weight uniformity, content uniformity, folding endurance, and patch stability.
TI  - Natural resistance of rose petals to microbial attack.
AB  - Petals of red, yellow and white roses (Rosa damascene Mill.) of the family Rosaceae were extracted with (1:1) methylene chloride/methanol and tested for their antimicrobial activities against four species of Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus), five species of Gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens) and five species of fungi (Penicillium notatum, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus stolonifer, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum). All of the crude extracts showed a wide range of antimicrobial activities according to the tested organism and rose's type. Micrococcus luteus was found to be the most susceptible bacteria to all crude extracts. Red and yellow petal extracts showed much higher antibacterial activity than the white petals extract. Bacillus subtilis was found to be the least susceptible to all extracts. The fungus, Penicillium notatum was found to be the most susceptible with white petal extract being the most effective. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum were the least susceptible to all extracts. White roses extract showed much higher antifungal activities against Penicillium notatum than red or yellow roses, therefore, it was subjected to several bioassay guided chromatographic fractionations and purification to isolate the active chemical(s) responsible for the antifungal activity. Chemical structure of the isolated antifungal compounds were identified by spectroscopy techniques and found to be a gamma-sitosterol and (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid. Antibacterial activity of the various types of rose extracts were due to complex mixtures of organic compounds which are still under chemical investigation and will be published later.
TI  - Bacterial load of fresh vegetables and their resistance to the currently used antibiotics in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - This study was carried out to describe the bacterial load and the occurrence of some disease-causing enteric bacteria on raw vegetables sold in Saudi markets. The study further aimed to analyze antibiotic resistance rates, production of extended-spectrum beta lactamase, and plasmid carriage among bacterial population of raw vegetables. Results revealed that none of them contained Bacillus cereus, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli O157:H7. However, Staphylococcus aureus and Shigella were detected in 11.8% and 4.4% of the samples, respectively. The bacterial loads ranged from 3 to 8 log(10) CFUg(-1) for aerobic bacteria and 1 to 4 log(10) CFUg(-1) for coliforms as well as Enterobacteriaceae. The isolates exhibited resistance in decreasing order for ampicillin (76.5%), cephalothin (69.5%), trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole (36.7%), aminoglycosides (21.9%), tetracycline (17.2%), fluoroquinolones (17.2%), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (13.3%), and chloramphenicol (7.8%). Maximum resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics occurred in 14.8% of isolates and the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was achieved by 2.3% of isolates. Multiple resistances to four or more antimicrobial agents along with plasmid with varied sizes were documented. These investigations indicate the occurrence of antibiotic resistance and plasmid carriage among bacterial isolates populating raw vegetables.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of chemically defined chitosans: influence of molecular weight, degree of acetylation and test organism.
AB  - Chitosans, polysaccharides obtained from the exoskeleton of crustaceans, have been shown to exert antibacterial activity in vitro and their use as a food preservative is of growing interest. However, beyond a consensus that chitosan appears to disrupt the bacterial cell membrane, published data are inconsistent on the chemical characteristics that confer the antibacterial activity of chitosan. While most authors agree that the net charge density of the polymer (reflected in the fraction of positively charged amino groups at the C-2 position of the glucosamine unit) is an important factor in antibacterial activity, conflicting data have been reported on the effect of molecular weight and on the susceptibility among different bacterial species to chitosan. Therefore, we prepared batches of water-soluble hydrochloride salts of chitosans with weight average molecular weights (M(w)) of 2-224kDa and degree of acetylation of 0.16 and 0.48. Their antibacterial activity was evaluated using tube inhibition assays and membrane integrity assays (N-Phenyl-1-naphthylamine fluorescence and potassium release) against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium and three lipopolysaccharide mutants of E. coli and S. Typhimurium. Chitosans with lower degree of acetylation (F(A)=0.16) were more active than the more acetylated chitosans (F(A)=0.48). No trends in antibacterial action related to increasing or decreasing M(w) were observed although one of the chitosans (M(w) 28.4kDa, F(A)=0.16) was more active than the other chitosans, inhibiting growth and permeabilizing the membrane of all the test strains included. The test strains varied in their susceptibility to the different chitosans with wild type S. Typhimurium more resistant than the wild type E. coli. Salmonellae lipopolysaccharide mutants were more susceptible than the matched wild type strain. Our results show that the chitosan preparation details are critically important in identifying the antibacterial features that target different test organisms.
TI  - Screening of Australian plants for antimicrobial activity against Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of acute enteritis in humans, with  symptoms such as diarrhoea, fever and abdominal cramps. In this study, 115 extracts from 109 Australian plant species were investigated for their antimicrobial activities against two C. jejuni strains using an in vitro broth microdilution assay. Among the plants tested, 107 (93%) extracts showed activity at a concentration between 32 and 1024 microg/mL against at least one C. jejuni strain. Seventeen plant extracts were selected for further testing against another six C. jejuni strains, as well as Campylobacter coli, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis. The extract from Eucalyptus occidentalis demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with an inhibitory concentration of 32 microg/mL against C. jejuni and B. cereus. This study has shown that extracts of selected Australian plants possess antimicrobial activity against C. jejuni and thus may have application in the control of this organism in live poultry and retail poultry products.
TI  - Antibacterial peptides derived from caprine whey proteins, by digestion with human gastrointestinal juice.
AB  - Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2.5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37 degrees C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, beta-lactoglobulin f(92-100) and beta-casein f(191-205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14-42) or lactoferrampin C f(268-284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.
TI  - Occurrence of microorganisms of public health and spoilage significance in fruit  juices sold in retail markets in Greece.
AB  - Fruit juices are an important part of the modern diet in many countries. However, few data are available concerning the microbiological quality of the fruit juices sold in Greece. Using standard microbiological procedures, we conducted a bacteriological survey of commercially sold, pasteurized, shelf-stable fruit juices from retail markets. A total of 120 samples of fruit juices sold in various retail markets were examined for their bacteriological quality. The pH of the tested juices was 2.4-4.8. Bacteria were isolated from 51 samples (42.5%) and fungi from 78 samples (65%). Escherichia coli O157:H7 was detected in four of the analyzed samples (3.34%), and Staphylococcus aureus was detected in four different samples (3.34%). In 11 samples (9.1%), the total number of microorganisms detected was as high as 125 colony-forming units (CFU). Acidophilic microorganisms were isolated from 26 samples (21.7%) and Blastomyces was detected in 46 samples (38.3%). All samples were negative for Lactobacillus, Clostridium perfrigens, Salmonella spp., Bacillus cereus, total coliforms, E. coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. Many of the microorganisms detected may cause disease in humans; thus, a number of the tested samples did not meet the Greek guidelines for the microbiological quality of juices. Use of a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system should be generally introduced into the juice industry sector to improve the quality of fruit juices, as well as other manufactured foods.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activities of hexahydroimidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium bromides with varying benzyl substituents.
AB  - Variously substituted benzyl bromides were employed to quaternize hexahydrobenzylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine (A) and the resulting bromides (1-11) were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against 10 pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumonia, Candida albicans and Candida krusei. Antimicrobial activities were surprisingly high (MIC: 0.78-400 mug/mL) and the sensitivity of the salts tested has been found to depend strongly both on the benzyl substituents and the microorganisms used. However, the correlation observed between antimicrobial activity and calculated partition coefficient (ClogP) was poor. Acute toxicity assessment of these salts showed LD(50) of 757-2000 mg/kg, after oral administration in mice in 24h.
TI  - Synthesis, antibacterial activity and quantum-chemical studies of novel 2-arylidenehydrazinyl-4-arylthiazole analogues.
AB  - A new series of 2-arylidenehydrazinyl-4-arylthiazole derivatives (2a-k) was designed and synthesized through a rapid, simple, and efficient methodology in excellent isolated yield. These compounds were screened for in vitro antimicrobial activities against eight bacteria, e.g. Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, and three fungi e.g. Aspergillus oryzae, Candida albicans, and Saccharomyces cerevis. The results indicate that some of the compounds exhibit strong antibacterial activity, depending on the bacterial strain, but show virtually no antifungal activity. The structure-antibacterial activity relationships were studied using some physicochemical and quantum-chemical parameters with the ab initio Hartree-Fock model at the RHF/6-31G level of theory. A good qualitative correlation between predicted lipophilic parameters and antibacterial activity has been found.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different honeys against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - To study the antimicrobial activity of honey, 60 samples of various botanical origin were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against 16 clinical pathogens and their respective reference strains. The microbiological quality of honeys and the antibiotic susceptibility of the various isolates were also examined. The bioassay applied for determining the antimicrobial effect employs the well-agar diffusion method and the estimation of minimum active dilution which produces a 1mm diameter inhibition zone. All honey samples, despite their origin (coniferous, citrus, thyme or polyfloral), showed antibacterial activity against the pathogenic and their respective reference strains at variable levels. Coniferous and thyme honeys showed the highest activity with an average minimum dilution of 17.4 and 19.2% (w/v) followed by citrus and polyfloral honeys with 20.8 and 23.8% respectively. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica subsp. Enterica, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis were proven to be up to 60% more resistant than their equal reference strains thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey and the need for further research.
TI  - Phenolic composition and antimicrobial and antiquorum sensing activity of an ethanolic extract of peels from the apple cultivar Annurca.
AB  - This study investigated the phenolic composition and antioxidant capacity of an ethanolic extract from the peel of the Annurca (Malus domestica var. Annurca), which is widespread in the Campania region of southern Italy. The antimicrobial effect of the extract on different pathogens was also examined. The potential antiquorum sensing activity of the extract was tested by using the microorganism Chromobacterium violaceum. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography revealed that rutin, epicatechin, dicaffeoylquinic acid, and caffeic acid were the most abundant phenolic compounds in the extract; these compounds constituted 27.43%, 24.93%, 16.14%, and 15.3% of the total phenols, respectively. The test for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl free radical-scavenging activity showed that the extract possessed an impressive antioxidant capacity (50% effective concentration of 2.50 mug/g of product). Furthermore, the extract clearly exhibited antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus (11- to 14-mm diameter of inhibition halo, depending on the strain) and Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 (10-mm diameter of inhibition halo). No activity was observed against the probiotic lactobacilli tested or against Staphylococcus aureus. Antiquorum sensing activity was reported for the first time for apple extracts. In conclusion, these results indicate the potential of this extract for treating some microbial infections through cell growth inhibition or quorum sensing antagonism, thereby validating the health benefits of apples.
TI  - Antagonistic bacteria from live corals, Tuticorin coastal waters, Southeastern India.
AB  - The objective of this study is to isolate and production of secondary metabolites with bioactive substances by coral reef (Acropora formosa and Favia palida) associated bacteria was carried out from the Tuticorin coastal waters, Southeastern India. The isolated coral associated bacteria were found to have an antagonistic effect against 10 human pathogens. The pathogens were Escherichia coli, Shigella dysentriae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aerogenosa, Vibrio cholerae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. faecalis and Bacillus cereus. It was observed that, out of the total 689 bacterial strains isolated, 10 and 13% of isolates from A. formosa and Favia palida, respectively were found to have antagonistic activity against the pathogens, A higher percentage of antagonistic strains were conferred from Favia palida with 13%. It was observed that all antagonistic strains were able to inhibit at least two of the human pathogens.
TI  - Identification and safety evaluation of Bacillus species occurring in high numbers during spontaneous fermentations to produce Gergoush, a traditional Sudanese bread snack.
AB  - Gergoush is a naturally fermented Sudanese Bread snack produced in three fermentation steps (primary starter, adapted starter and final dough), followed by three baking steps for a half to one hour at above 200 degrees C. This study examines the microbiota of two sets of fermentations performed at a traditional production site in Khartoum, Sudan in 2006 and 2009, respectively. In 2006 four different milk/legume based primary starters (faba bean, chick pea, lentil and white bean) were sampled in order to enumerate and identify the Bacillus at species or group level. In 2009 specific focus was on the enumeration and safety evaluation of the dominant Bacillus cereus group species occurring during various Gergoush productions (including the three fermentations steps and after baking). In 2006, the primary starters contained Bacillus spp. in the order of between 7.7 and 8.1 log(10) CFU/g. Species identifications were performed by M13-PCR typing using the Escherichia coli phage M13 derived primer PM13 combined with internally transcribed 16-23S rRNA PCR, 16S rRNA gene and gyrA or gyrB gene sequencing, and selected phenotypic tests. Depending on the legume used, 40-68% of the isolates were identified as B. cereus sensu lato, 16-27% as Bacillus licheniformis, 8-32% as Bacillus subtilis and 4-20% as Bacillus sonorensis. During the second set of fermentation trials performed in 2009, the Bacillus spp. and B. cereus occurred in numbers of between 7.7-9.9 and 6.1-7.8 log(10) CFU/g, respectively, while no bacteria were detected after baking. A total of 180 B. cereus sensu lato isolates from four different primary starters, adapted starters and final doughs were further identified as B. cereus sensu stricto (118 isolates) and Bacillus thuringiensis (62 isolates). The safety of Gergoush was evaluated based on the counts and toxin gene profiles of the dominant B. cereus species. Considering that no bacteria survived the baking process, and that the cereulide synthetase gene cesB involved in the production of the heat stable emetic toxin cereulide was not detected in any of the investigated B. cereus isolates, the results indicate, that Gergoush produced at the traditional production site is safe for human consumption. This study is the first to identify the Bacillus of Gergoush to species level, and it is the first to perform a safety evaluation of the product, based on the dominant B. cereus species.
TI  - An eight-year report on the implementation of HACCP in a university canteen: impact on the microbiological quality of meals.
AB  - An investigation aimed at assessing the microbiological quality of meals consumed at a university canteen after implementation of the HACCP system and personnel training was carried out. Cooked and warm-served products (74 samples), cooked and cold-served products (92 samples) and cold gastronomy products (63 samples) sampled from 2000 to 2007 underwent microbiological analyses. All the samples were tested for: Samonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, total mesophilic aerobes, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and sulphite-reducing clostridia. The microbiological contamination of work surfaces (tables, tablewares, cutters, ladles, slicing machines, wash-basins, etc.), hands and white coats of members of the canteen staff was also assessed. The microbiological results clearly demonstrated the success of the HACCP plan implementation, through a general improvement of the hygiene conditions of both meals and work surfaces.
TI  - Improving the ethanol yield by reducing glycerol formation using cofactor regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - To increase ethanol yield and decrease glycerol production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the strategies of direct cofactor-regulation were explored. During anaerobic batch fermentations, the yeast expressing Bacillus cereus gapN gene, encoding non-phosphorylating NADP(+)-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrognease, produced 73.8 g ethanol l(-1), corresponding to 96% of theoretical maximum yield compared to 92% for the wild type. The yeast expressing Escherichia coli frdA gene encoding the NAD(+)-dependent fumarate reductase, exhibited a 22% (relative to the amount of substrate consumed) increase in glycerol yield in medium containing 2 g fumarate l(-1). The yeast expressing mhpF gene, encoding acetylating NAD(+)-dependent acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, produced 74.5 g ethanol l(-1), corresponding to 97.4% of theoretical maximum yield while glycerol decreased by 40% when acetic acid was added before inoculation. This strain represents a promising alternative for ethanol production with lignocellulosic hydrolysates where acetate is available at significant amounts.
TI  - Partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by two Lactobacilus strains with probiotic properties.
AB  - The probiotic characteristics of Lactobacillus brevis BG18 and Lb. plantarum BG33, isolated from traditional Turkish Tulum cheese were assessed. These two bacteriocinproducer strains exhibited good probiotic characteristics such as resistance in media containing 0.3% bile salt, pepsin (3 mg mL(-)(1)), and pancreatine (1 mg mL(-)(1)) as well as acid resistance at pH 2. They were also adhered to Caco-2 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to Escherichia coli LMG3083 (ETEC) and Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344. The strains produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature, and therefore, referred to as bacteriocins. The bacteriocins were able to inhibit growth of a number grampositive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Tricine-SDS-PAGE of the active fraction resulted in single bands with estimated molecular masses of 2.5 kDA and 2.7 kDA for Lb. brevis BG18 and Lb. plantarum BG33 bacteriocins, respectively.
TI  - Substrate specificity of SpoIIGA, a signal-transducing aspartic protease in Bacilli.
AB  - SpoIIGA is a novel type of membrane-associated aspartic protease that responds to a signal from the forespore by cleaving Pro-sigma(E) in the mother cell during sporulation of Bacillus subtilis. Very little is known about how SpoIIGA recognizes Pro-sigma(E). By co-expressing proteins in Escherichia coli, it was shown that charge reversal substitutions for acidic residues 24 and 25 of Pro-sigma(E), and for basic residues 245 and 284 of SpoIIGA, impaired cleavage. These results are consistent with a model predicting possible electrostatic interactions between these residues; however, no charge reversal substitution for residue 245 or residue 284 of SpoIIGA restored cleavage of Pro-sigma(E) with a charge reversal substitution for residue 24 or residue 25. Bacillus subtilis SpoIIGA cleaved Pro-sigma(E) orthologs from Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus halodurans, but not from Bacillus cereus. A triple substitution in the pro-sequence of B. cereus Pro-sigma(E) allowed cleavage by B. subtilis SpoIIGA, indicating that residues distal from the cleavage site contribute to substrate specificity. Co-expression of SpoIIGA and Pro-sigma(E) orthologs in different combinations suggested that B. licheniformis SpoIIGA has a relatively narrow substrate specificity as compared with B. subtilis SpoIIGA, whereas B. cereus SpoIIGA and B. halodurans SpoIIGA appear to have broader substrate specificity.
TI  - Pathogen detection using a liquid array technology.
AB  - Low concentrations of microbial pathogens in pure and mixed samples were detected using a bead-based, liquid array technology. A 20-bp sequence in the 23S rRNA gene, rrl, was amplified in four microorganisms: Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Staphylococcus aureus. PCR products were positively identified with the Luminex((R)) 100 system. The system could detect very low amounts of DNA and the instrument response was proportional to the input concentration. The lower limit of detection (LLD) was determined to be 0.5 ng for B. cereus and E. coli and 2 ng for S. enterica. The LLD for S. aureus was not determined as the instrument response was still above the threshold when quantities of DNA as low as 0.25 ng were used. The platform positively identified organisms present in mixed samples even when the minor component was overshadowed by a 10-fold excess of the major component.
TI  - Hot water surface pasteurisation of lamb carcasses: microbial effects and cost-benefit considerations.
AB  - Although hot water pasteurisation of carcasses is accepted as a general intervention in USA, this is not the case in Europe. The aims of this study were (i) to evaluate the microbiological effects of hot water pasteurisation of lamb carcasses, both after slaughtering and dressing and following subsequent chilling and storage; (ii) to discuss hot water pasteurisation from a public health and cost-benefit perspective; (iii) to discuss the benefits of hot water pasteurisation compared with use of separate meat processing streams for high-risk carcasses; (iv) to evaluate the use of recycled hot water in a hygienic context and in relation to EU regulations; and (v) to consider the technological and sensory aspects of hot water pasteurisation of lamb carcasses. Samples were collected from 420 naturally contaminated lamb carcasses, with 50% of the carcasses (n=210) subject to hot water pasteurisation at 82 degrees C for 8s immediately after slaughter. Surface swab samples from 4500 cm(2) areas on carcasses were collected at slaughter, after chilling for 24 h, and after chilling for five days. The microbial analyses included Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and aerobic plate count (APC). A resuscitation step using Tryptone Soya Agar was included in the microbiological analyses. Hot water pasteurisation significantly reduced the levels of E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae, B. cereus and APC (all P<0.001). E. coli colony forming unit (CFU) reduction was 99.5%, corresponding to a reduction of 1.85 log CFU per carcass. E. coli was isolated from 66% of control carcasses and from 26% of pasteurised carcasses. After 24h storage, the reduction in E. coli was increased to 2.02 log, and after five days E. coli could not be isolated from the pasteurised carcasses. These results suggest that surface pasteurisation could be an important and efficient procedure (critical control point) for reducing generic E. coli and thereby shiga toxin-producing E. coli on carcasses, and thus the risk for disease among consumers. The recycled water had acceptable physical and chemical parameters and no spore-forming bacteria were detected. Although some carcass discolouration was observed, after 24h the colour was acceptable. Our data provide relevant input for some of the data gaps regarding hot water pasteurisation and indicate that replacing the expensive system of separate processing of high-risk carcasses with hot water surface pasteurisation should be considered as a serious option.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of raw and processed honey.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate extracts  of raw and processed honey was tested against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi). Both types of honey showed antibacterial activity against tested organisms with the zone of inhibition (ZOI) ranging from 6.94 to 37.94 mm, while E. coli, S. typhi, and P. aeruginosa showed that sensibility towards all the extracts with ZOI ranges between 13.09 to 37.94 mm. The methanol extract showed more potent activity than other organic extracts. Gram-negative bacteria were found to be more susceptible as compared to Gram-positive bacteria except E. faecalis. The broth microdilution assay gave minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) value of 625 mug/mL, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranges between 625 mug/mL 2500 mug/mL. The study showed that honey has antibacterial activity (bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect), similar to antibiotics, against test organisms and provides alternative therapy against certain bacteria.
TI  - Akara Ogbomoso: microbiological examination and identification of hazards and critical control points.
AB  - Akara Ogbomoso was examined toward the establishment of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP). The akara was produced in residential buildings with the attendant consequence of contamination. There was ample growth of aerobes, coliforms, staphylococci, Shigella and yeast/mold from the samples, water and cowpea pastes. Microbial contaminations occur through the processing, which can be corrected through education by adopting good hygienic and manufacturing practices. The critical control points were identified as frying, storage and refrying. It may be heated in the microwave for 10 s before consumption. Akara, prepared in the laboratory through the implementation of HACCP was not contaminated. Several bacterial isolates, namely; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus sp. and Shigella sp., showed multiple resistance to antibiotics ranging from two to nine. Seven strains were not resistant to the antibiotics, while five were resistant to one type of antibiotic.
TI  - A flagellin-producing Lactococcus strain: interactions with mucin and enteropathogens.
AB  - Bacillus cereus CH is a probiotic strain used in human nutrition whose adhesion to mucin is dependent on its surface-associated flagellin. Flagellins from the surface of several probiotic Bacillus strains were efficiently extracted with 5 M LiCl and identified by peptide fingerprinting. Based on the proteomic analysis, cloning of the gene coding for the flagellin of B. cereus CH was performed in the lactococcal vector pNZ8110 under the control of a nisin-inducible promoter. The resulting strain, Lactococcus lactis CH, produced a surface-associated flagellin after 6 h of induction with nisin. The recombinant Lactococcus strain adhered strongly to mucin-coated polystyrene plates, whilst inhibiting competitively the adhesion of the pathogens Escherichia coli LMG2092 and Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica LMG15860 to the same molecule. Strain CH could be used in further experimentation for the characterization of the molecular mechanism of action of this probiotic B. cereus CH flagellin.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of cold-active family VIII esterases from an arctic soil metagenome.
AB  - Functional screening for lipolytic enzymes at low temperatures resulted in the isolation of the novel cold-active esterases, EstM-N1 and EstM-N2, from a metagenomic DNA library of arctic soil samples. EstM-N1 and EstM-N2 were 395 and 407 amino acids in length, respectively, and showed the highest similarity to class C beta-lactamases. However, they shared a relatively low level of sequence similarity (30%) with each other. Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial lipolytic enzymes confirmed that EstM-N1 and EstM-N2 belonged to family VIII of bacterial esterases/lipases. The (His)(6)-tagged esterases were purified to about 99% homogeneity from the soluble fraction of recombinant Escherichia coli cultures. The purified EstM-N1 and EstM-N2 retained more than 50% of maximal activity in the temperature range of 0-35 degrees C, with optimal temperatures of 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively. Both enzymes preferred the short acyl chains of p-nitrophenyl esters and exhibited very narrow substrate specificity, indicating that they are typical esterases. The beta-lactamase activity of EstM-N1 and EstM-N2 was also detected and reached about 31% and 13% of the positive control enzyme, Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase, respectively. These first cold-active esterases belonging to family VIII are expected to be useful for potential biotechnological applications as interesting biocatalysts.
TI  - Inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (Mangifera indica L.).
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
TI  - The effect of lemongrass oil and its major components on clinical isolate mastitis pathogens and their mechanisms of action on Staphylococcus aureus DMST 4745.
AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the antibacterial activity of lemongrass oil (LG) and its major components which were citral, geraniol and myrcene, against four strains of clinically isolated bovine mastitis pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli by the broth microdilution method, as well as their activity on S. aureus biofilm formation. Attempts to clarify their mechanisms of action by investigation of the effects on intracellular material leakage and morphological changes of S. aureus DMST 4745 were also made. The results demonstrate that S. agalactiae and B. cereus are more susceptible to LG, citral and geraniol than S. aureus and E. coli. Moreover, they also inhibit S. aureus biofilm formation and exhibit effective killing activities on preformed biofilms. The LG appears to have multiple targets in the bacterial cell, depending on concentration used as well as the amount of its components.
TI  - Preparation, characterization and in vitro release study of carvacrol-loaded chitosan nanoparticles.
AB  - The fabrication of carvacrol-loaded chitosan nanoparticles was achieved by a two-step method, i.e., oil-in-water emulsion and ionic gelation of chitosan with pentasodium tripolyphosphate. The obtained particles possessed encapsulation efficiency (EE) and loading capacity (LC) in the ranges of 14-31% and 3-21%, respectively, when the initial carvacrol content was 0.25-1.25 g/g of chitosan. The individual particles exhibited a spherical shape with an average diameter of 40-80 nm, and a positively charged surface with a zeta potential value of 25-29 mV. The increment of initial carvacrol content caused a reduction of surface charge. Carvacrol-loaded chitosan nanoparticles showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli with an MIC of 0.257 mg/mL. The release of carvacrol from chitosan nanoparticles reached plateau level on day 30, with release amounts of 53% in acetate buffer solution with pH of 3, and 23% and 33% in phosphate buffer solutions with pH of 7 and 11, respectively. The release mechanism followed a Fickian behavior. The release rate was superior in an acidic medium to either alkaline or neutral media, respectively.
TI  - Development of oscillation method for reducing foodborne pathogens on lettuce and spinach.
AB  - In this study, the efficacy of an oscillator for reducing the numbers of foodborne pathogens on lettuce and spinach was tested. A cocktail of three strains each of Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes cells and of Bacillus cereus spores was inoculated onto lettuce and spinach leaves and followed by oscillation at 10 Hz and 20 Hz for up to 30s. After treatment of inoculated lettuce leaf with an oscillator at 20 Hz for 30s, 2.58, 2.82, 2.21 and 2.22 Log(10)CFU/g reductions were obtained with the cells of S. typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes and the spores of B. cereus, respectively. In the case of the oscillation treatment of spinach leaf, 2.89, 3.73, 2.46 and 2.25 Log(10)CFU/g reductions of those pathogens were achieved under the same condition. Statistically significant reductions were observed after oscillation treatment at 20 Hz for 5-10s. The oscillation treatment at 10 Hz led to slightly less reductions of the pathogens tested as compared to the treatment at 20 Hz. In conclusion, the oscillation method developed shows to be highly efficacious in reducing foodborne pathogens on lettuce and spinach leaves.
TI  - Carijodienone from the octocoral Carijoa multiflora. A spiropregnane-based steroid.
AB  - Two new steroids (1 and 2) and the known pregna-1,4,20-trien-3-one (3) have been  isolated from the Pacific octocoral Carijoa multiflora. Compound 1 possesses a novel spiropregnane-based steroidal skeleton. The photochemical transformation of 3 into 1 allowed the assignment of the absolute configuration at C-10 of 1. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1 and 3 were evaluated against a panel of bacterial strains.
TI  - The effects of Korean propolis against foodborne pathogens and transmission electron microscopic examination.
AB  - This study was performed to evaluate the effects of Korean propolis against foodborne pathogens and spores of Bacillus cereus and to investigate the antimicrobial activity against B. cereus structure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The antimicrobial effects of the Korean propolis were tested against foodborne pathogens including Gram-positive (B. cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescence) bacteria by agar diffusion assay. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive than were Gram-negative bacteria. The vegetative cells of B. cereus were the most sensitive among the pathogens tested with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.036 mg/mul of propolis on agar medium. Based on MIC, sensitivity of vegetative cells of B. cereus and its spores was tested in a nutrient broth with different concentrations of propolis at 37 degrees C. In liquid broth, treatment with 1.8 mg/ml propolis showed bactericidal effect against B. cereus. B. cereus vegetative cells exposed to 7.2mg/ml of propolis lost their viability within 20 min. Against spores of B. cereus, propolis inhibited germination of spores up to 30 hours, compared to control at higher concentration than vegetative cells yet acted sporostatically. The bactericidal and sporostatic action of propolis were dependent on the concentration of propolis used and treatment time. Electron microscopic investigation of propolis-treated B. cereus revealed substantial structural damage at the cellular level and irreversible cell membrane rupture at a number of locations with the apparent leakage of intracellular contents. The antimicrobial effect of propolis in this study suggests potential use of propolis in foods.
TI  - Isolation and identification of soil bacteria growing at the expense of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.
AB  - Soil-microorganism symbioses are of fundamental importance for plant adaptation to the environment. Research in microbial ecology has revealed that some soil bacteria are associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). However, these interactions may be much more complex than originally thought. To assess the type of bacteria associated with AMF, we initially isolated spores of Glomus irregulare from an Agrostis stolonifera rhizosphere. The spores were washed with sterile water and plated onto G. irregulare mycelium growing in vitro in a root-free compartment of bicompartmented Petri dishes. We hypothesized that this system should select for bacteria closely associated with the fungus because the only nutrients available to the bacteria were those derived from the hyphae. Twenty-nine bacterial colonies growing on the AMF hyphae were subcultured and identified using 16S rRNA gene sequences. All bacterial isolates showed high sequence identity to Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus simplex, Kocuria rhizophila, Microbacterium ginsengisoli, Sphingomonas sp. and Variovorax paradoxus. We also assessed bacterial diversity on the surface of spores by PCR-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis. Finally, we used live cellular imaging to show that the bacteria isolated can grow on the surface of hyphae with different growing patterns in contrast to Escherichia coli as a control.
TI  - Synergistic effects of sodium hypochlorite and ultraviolet radiation in reducing  the levels of selected foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether combined treatment would produce synergistic effects to facilitate the sterilization of food products during production relative to single treatment. To assess this hypothesis, we investigated the bactericidal effects of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and a commercial chemical disinfectant, sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), on Bacillus cereus F4810/72, Cronobacter sakazakii KCTC 2949, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 35556, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, and Salmonella Typhimurium novobiocin/nalidixic acid in vitro. Various concentrations of NaClO (20, 60, 100, and 200 ppm NaClO) were tested along with exposure to UV radiation at various doses (6, 96, 216, 360, and 504 mW s/cm(2)). The combined NaClO/UV treatments resulted in greater reductions in bacterial counts than either treatment alone. The synergy values against B. cereus, C. sakazakii, S. aureus, Salmonella Typhimurium, and E. coli were 0.25-1.17, 0.33-1.97, 0.42-1.72, 0.02-1.44, and 0.01-0.85 log(10) CFU/mL, respectively. The results of this study suggest that a significant synergistic benefit results from combined NaClO/UV processing against food-borne pathogenic bacteria in vitro.
TI  - Bacterial killing by dry metallic copper surfaces.
AB  - Metallic copper surfaces rapidly and efficiently kill bacteria. Cells exposed to  copper surfaces accumulated large amounts of copper ions, and this copper uptake was faster from dry copper than from moist copper. Cells suffered extensive membrane damage within minutes of exposure to dry copper. Further, cells removed from copper showed loss of cell integrity. Acute contact with metallic copper surfaces did not result in increased mutation rates or DNA lesions. These findings are important first steps for revealing the molecular sensitive targets in cells lethally challenged by exposure to copper surfaces and provide a scientific explanation for the use of copper surfaces as antimicrobial agents for supporting public hygiene.
TI  - Microbiological assessment in strawberry production and recommendations to establish a good agricultural practice system.
AB  - This study conducted microbiological assessment in tunnel style strawberry greenhouses and packaging centers and suggested recommendations to establish a good agricultural practice for strawberry production. The samples from irrigation water, workers' gloves, harvest bins, soil, strawberry leaves and strawberries in greenhouses, packers' gloves, conveyor belts, packaging tables, and door knobs of entrances in packaging centers were collected. Bacterial cell counts of aerobic plate counts, coliforms, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus were then enumerated on appropriate selective media. In general, bacterial populations were similar (p >/= 0.05) among strawberry greenhouses but not among packaging houses. E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 were negative in all samples, and low levels of Salmonella and B. cereus were detected. However, high bacterial cell counts of aerobic plate counts, coliforms, and S. aureus were found in most samples. These results suggest that food safety practice in strawberry greenhouses and packaging centers should be improved, and the results may be useful in the establishment of a good agricultural practice system for strawberry production.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Momordica charantia (Curcubitaceae) extracts and fractions.
AB  - Momordica charantia L. belongs to the family Curcubitaceae and it is very common  in many Brazilian regions. The plant is a liana with flowers and yellow fruits that present red seeds when are ripe. Popularly known as "melao-de-saocaetano", "melao amargo" or "cabaco-amargo", it possesses many uses: antidiabetic, antihelmintic, antmicrobial, anticancerigenous and antioxidant. The phytochemical prospection of the fresh and dried leaves extracts showed the presence of different classes of secondary metabolites, as flavonoids, alkaloids and tannins, that have demonstrated antimicrobial action. Fresh and dried leaves presented significantly antimicrobial activity against all bacterial strains tested, specially Escherichia coli. Ethyl acetate fractions were effective against Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus. The modulatory activity was significative too.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LBM 5006 is enhanced in the  presence of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Increased antimicrobial activity was observed when Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LBM 5006 strain was cultivated in the presence of thermally inactivated cells of Escherichia coli, but not with Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, or Bacillus cereus. E. coli also enhanced the antimicrobial activity when it was added to the medium in the form of living cells or as cell debris after cellular fractionation. No inducing activity was observed with addition of cell-free supernatant of E. coli cultures, suggesting that inducing factor is associated to the cells. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that additional peptide bands are secreted when B. amyloliquefaciens was cultivated in the presence of cell debris of E. coli. These results suggest that the presence of intact or inactivated E. coli enhanced the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides by B. amyloliquefaciens LBM 5006.
TI  - Study of peptide fractions from hemolymph of Galleria mellonella.
AB  - Changes in the peptide composition of hemolymph of Galleria mellonella larvae induced by their immunization have been studied, and some new peptides have been found. The composition of fractions exhibiting antibacterial activity was investigated. Known antibacterial peptides have been found in the hemolymph of control larvae and those immunized with bacteria.
TI  - Probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and Taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  - This study assessed potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from Taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. Five Lactobacillus isolates identified as Lactobacillus reuteri F03, Lactobacillus paracasei F08, Lactobacillus rhamnosus F14, Lactobacillus plantarum C06, and Lactobacillus acidophilus C11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. All the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells, particularly, strain L. plantarum C06 and L. reuteri F03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain L. rhamnosus GG. The strains L. paracasei F08 and L. acidophilus C11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. Most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. All the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) pathogens. Moreover, the strains L. reuteri F03, L. paracasei F08, and L. plantarum C06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/mL after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. The viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/mL after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees C. In the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and Clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. Lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. Technologically interesting Lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.
TI  - Characterization and antimicrobial activity of 4-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl-1-->4-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl thiocarboxamide; a novel bioactive compound from Moringa oleifera seed extract.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of crude seed extract of Moringa oleifera was investigated by thin layer chromatography bioassay against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, and Penicillium sclerotigenum; most of them were prominently inhibited by an isolate with R(F) 0.92-0.96. Characterization and identification of the extract revealed the occurrence of three bioactive compounds: 4-(alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)benzyl isothiocyanate, methyl N-4-(alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy) benzyl carbamate (both known compounds), and 4-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl-1-->4-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl thiocarboxamide, existence of which in any Moringa spp. or plant is reported for the first time. The UV spectrum of the novel compound showed maximum absorption at 273 and 225 nm in MeOH while the IR spectrum revealed several characteristic bands at 3100, 2900, 1700, 1500, 1300, 1100 and 1000 cm(-1). The (1)H-NMR showed signals at 1.2 and 3.77 ppm and the (13)C-NMR presented signals at 155, 122, 91.7 and 98.4 ppm. All the compounds at 5 mg/L had very high bactericidal activity against some of test pathogens even at contact period 1-2 h. 4-(beta-D-Glucopyranosyl-1-->4-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)benzyl thiocarboxamide was the most potent, with 99.2 % inhibition toward Shigella dysenteriae and 100 % toward Bacillus cereus, E. coli and Salmonella typhi within 4 h of contact.
TI  - Chemical composition, olfactory evaluation and antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and absolutes from Morocco.
AB  - The chemical compositions of selected essential oils from North Africa, especially Morocco, of geranium, wild Moroccan chamomile and rosemary as well as absolutes of rose and geranium were determined using GC/FID and GC/MS. These oils and absolutes were tested concerning their antimicrobial activity against some food spoilage strains obtained from fresh milk and minced meat products, like sausages and pork fillet, in accordance with ISO testing procedures. Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Salmonella abony and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) strains were used, as well as the yeast Candida albicans. Using a serial broth dilution method, all samples demonstrated weak antimicrobial activity against the Gram-negative bacteria and the yeast, compared with the activity towards the Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Rapid functional definition of extended spectrum beta-lactamase activity in bacterial cultures via competitive inhibition of fluorescent substrate cleavage.
AB  - The functional definition of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) activity is  a clinical challenge. Here we report a rapid and convenient assay of beta-lactamase activity through the competitive inhibition of fluorescent substrate hydrolysis that provides a read-out nearly 40x more rapidly than conventional techniques for functional definition. A panel of beta-lactam antibiotics was used for competition against beta-lactamase enzyme-activated photosensitizer (beta-LEAP) yielding a competitive index (C(i)) in 30 min. Significant differences in the relative C(i) values of the panel of beta-lactams were determined in vitro for Bacillus cereus penicillinase. Additionally, the relative C(i) values for whole bacterial cell suspensions of B. cereus 5/beta were compared with the relative minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and a correlation coefficient of 0.899 was determined. We further demonstrated the ability of beta-LEAP to probe the capacity of ceftazidime to inhibit the enzyme activity of a panel of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli. The bacteria were assayed for susceptibility to ceftazidime and the relative MIC values were compared with the relative C(i) values for ceftazidime yielding a correlation coefficient of 0.984. This work demonstrates for the first time the whole cell assay of the competitive inhibition of beta-lactamase enzyme activity and derivation of associated constants.
TI  - Bacteria adsorption on hydrophilic surfaces for the sensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria using a single tube chamber system.
AB  - Here, we developed a simple and effective bacterial isolation method that can be  directly used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. This approach only requires a single plastic tube chamber that can performing serial processes such as cell gathering, cell lysis, nucleic acid amplification, and signaling without the need to transfer samples from one chamber to another. A TEOS (tetraethoxysilane) surface was selected for this application because of its superior performance in the amplification process as well as the ability of bacteria to adsorb to its surface, which is necessary for all processes to be performed in single chamber. The optimal aquatic buffer conditions for bacteria adsorption on the hydrophilic surface were determined to be 1% polyethylene glycerol (PEG) and 10 mM MgCl(2) in 100 mM phosphate at pH 4 for the gram negative bacteria, Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) and 10 mM Na(2)SO(4) in 100 mM phosphate in 100 mM phosphate at pH 4 for the gram positive bacteria, Bacillus cereus (B. cereus). When these divalent cation and anion (MgSO(4)) containing acidic solutions were used, 40% of both bacteria adsorbed onto the hydrophilic surface at a loading rate of 2 mL/min after introduction of low concentrations of bacteria. This method was directly employed to detect E. coli O157:H7 in beef using a single plastic tube chamber that was partially filled with nickel micro beads coated with TEOS. In this system, E. coli O157:H7 were lysed by induction heating of the nickel micro beads. The extracted mRNA was readily amplified and detected by adding an isothermal amplification mixture (NASBA, nucleic acid sequence based amplification) containing a hair-loop type reporting probe with FAM and DABCYL. As a result, this highly sensitive sensing tool could detect very low concentrations of E. coli [10(0) CFU/1 g of beef].
TI  - Molecular ecology and polyphasic characterization of the microbiota associated with semi-dry processed coffee (Coffea arabica L.).
AB  - This work was aimed at isolating and identifying the microbiota present during the semi-dry method of coffee processing using polyphasic methods and to evaluate microbial diversity with PCR-DGGE. Samples of Coffea arabica L. were collected during different processing stages in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. The bacterial and fungal isolates were phenotypically characterised and grouped according to the ARDRA technique, in which the 16-23S and ITS1-5.8S regions of the rDNA were sequenced for species identification. The bacterial counts varied from 3.7 to 7 log CFU g(-1). The yeast counts ranged from 3.4 to 6.9 log CFU g(-1), and the filamentous fungal population varied from 2 to 3.7 log CFU g(-1). Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter agglomerans, Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the predominant bacteria detected during the processing of the coffee, and Pichia anomala, Torulaspora delbrueckii and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa were the dominant yeasts. All of the yeast and bacterial species detected by PCR-DGGE were isolated using culture-dependent methods, with the exception of one uncultivable bacterial species. Aspergillus was the most common genus among the filamentous fungal isolates. The use of polyphasic methods allowed a better characterization of the microbiota that is naturally present in semi-dry processed coffee.
TI  - An efficient approach for the isolation, identification and evaluation of antimicrobial plant components on an analytical scale, demonstrated by the example of Radix imperatoriae.
AB  - Using Radix imperatoriae (the root of masterwort) as an example, we describe an efficient approach for the isolation, identification and evaluation of bioactive plant components on an analytical scale. The extraction of Radix imperatoriae with ethyl acetate was enhanced by the application of ultrasound oscillations. This rhizome extract was applied to three pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) to determine its antimicrobial activity. Disk diffusion was utilized to determine susceptibility. The extract components were separated using a series of chromatography approaches (semi-preparative RP-HPLC, or RP-HPLC on an analytical scale), followed by testing. All fractions were analyzed by LC-UV-ESI-MS and 600 MHz microcoil (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Among other findings, in the fraction with the highest antibacterial activity we were able to identify oxypeucedanin and oxypeucedanin hydrate. Subsequent analysis revealed that only oxypeucedanin hydrate had antibacterial activity, whereas oxypeucedanin itself was inactive at the concentrations applied. Furthermore, oxypeucedanin hydrate appears to be largely, or exclusively, a by-product of sample preparation, since it is either not synthesized by the plant as a second metabolite or is produced by it in only very small quantities.
TI  - Microbiological quality of wheat grain and flour from two mills in Queensland, Australia.
AB  - A baseline investigation of the microbiological quality of wheat grain and flour  from two mills in Queensland, Australia, was undertaken in order to assess the capacity of these two mills to meet microbiological criteria specified by a customer for raw, non-heat-treated flour. This baseline testing was performed over the 2006 to 2007 wheat season. Three hundred fifty flour samples were monitored for yeast, mold, and Bacillus cereus, 300 for Escherichia coli, 150 for Salmonella, and 100 for aerobic plate count. Fifty grain samples were analyzed for yeast, mold, E. coli, Salmonella, and B. cereus. There was a single isolation of Salmonella Give in unscreened wheat. The yeast, mold, E. coli, and B. cereus prevalences were 56, 40, 2.0, and 4.0% for grain and 71, 17, 0.7, and <0.3% for flour, respectively. Of the positive samples, the means were 3.7, 2.7, 0.6, and 2.1 for grain, and 3.0, 2.8, and 0.8 log CFU/g for flour. The mean of the aerobic plate count was 4.2 log CFU/g with a 95th percentile count of 4.6 log CFU/g. A microbiological quality baseline of wheat grain and flour from these two Queensland mills has been determined. These data in a specific sense assist the two mills to assess their capacity to meet microbiological criteria, and in a general sense provide at least a limited snapshot of Queensland wheat and flour quality for risk assessments being carried out to evaluate the safety of plant and plant products.
TI  - Prevalence of microorganisms of hygienic interest in an organized abattoir in Mumbai, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The magnitude of food-borne illnesses in India is unknown because of  lack of surveillance networks. Monitoring the prevalence of food-borne pathogens and indicators of contamination in primary production at abattoirs is imperative for creating a data bank and for effective control of such pathogens before they enter the food chain. METHODOLOGY: Microorganisms of hygienic interest were screened for their prevalence at Deonar Abattoir, Mumbai. Swab samples from 96 sheep/goat carcass sites were collected and analyzed for Staphylococcus spp., Bacillaceae, Clostridiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. RESULTS: Average Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis counts were 3.15 +/- 0.18 and 3.46 +/- 0.17 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively. Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium spp. counts were 3.10 +/- 0.08, 3.41 +/- 0.19 and 0.76 +/- 0.06 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively. The Escherichia coli count was 3.54 +/- 0.06 and the Klebsiella aerogenes count was 3.22 +/- 0.22 log10 CFU/cm(2). Counts for Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis were 3.44 +/- 0.14 log10 CFU/cm(2) and 3.71 +/- 0.12 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively. S. epidermidis had the highest percentage prevalence at (41.6%), followed by K. aerogenes (31.9%), B. subtilis (28.2%) and P. vulgaris (23.6%). Salmonella spp. were not isolated. CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate high prevalence and diversity of micro flora on carcasses in the primary Indian production facility, which might be attributed to either human handling or improper dressing especially during evisceration process. Appropriate training for personal and production hygiene is essential for workers in Indian meat production facilities.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of 1,4-benzoquinones and wheat germ extract.
AB  - We evaluated the antibacterial activities of selected edible Korean plant seeds against the food-borne pathogens Staphylococcus aureus KCTC1927, Escherichia coli KCTC2593, Salmonella typhimurium KCTC2054, and Bacillus cereus KCTC1014. While screening for antibacterial agents, we discovered that wheat germ extract contains 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (DMBQ) and is highly inhibitory to S. aureus and B. cereus. This is the first report of the antibacterial activity of wheat germ extract. We also investigated the antibacterial activities of the 1,4- benzoquinone standards 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), hydroquinone (HQ), methoxybenzoquinone (MBQ), and 2,6-dimethoxy- 1,4-benzoquinone (DMBQ). DMBQ and BQ were the most highly inhibitory to S. aureus and S. typhimurium, followed by MBQ and HQ. MICs for DMBQ and BQ ranged between 8 and 64 microgram/ml against the four foodborne pathogens tested. DMBQ and BQ showed significant antibacterial activity; the most sensitive organism was S. aureus with an MIC of 8 microgram/ml. BQ exhibited good activity against S. typhimurium (32 microgram/ml) and B. cereus (32 microgram/ml). The results suggest that wheat germ extract has potential for the development of natural antimicrobials and food preservatives for controlling foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Hindering biofilm formation with zosteric acid.
AB  - The antifoulant, zosteric acid, was synthesized using a non-patented process. Zosteric acid at 500 mg l(-1) caused a reduction of bacterial (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus) and fungal (Aspergillus niger, Penicillium citrinum) coverage by 90% and 57%, respectively. Calculated models allowed its antifouling activity to be predicted at different concentrations. Zosteric acid counteracted the effects of some colonization-promoting factors. Bacterial and fungal wettability was not affected, but the agent increased bacterial motility by 40%. A capillary accumulation test showed that zosteric acid did not act as a chemoeffector for E. coli, but stimulated a chemotactic response. Along with enhanced swimming migration of E. coli in the presence of zosteric acid, staining showed an increased production of flagella. Reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed an increased transcriptional level of the fliC gene and isolation and quantification of flagellar proteins demonstrated a higher flagellin amount. Biofilm experiments confirmed that zosteric acid caused a significant decrease in biomass (-92%) and thickness (-54%).
TI  - Lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. However, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. In this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "Bull's heart" and "Cherry" varieties were analyzed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum). Regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis being the most susceptible one (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/mL). Concerning antifungal activity, "Bull's heart" extracts were the most active. In a general way C. albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC: 5-10 mg/mL). The chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.
TI  - [Study of peptide content of antibacterial fractions by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry].
AB  - The fractions containing antimicrobic peptides have been purified from a haemolymph of caterpillars Galleria mellonella by chromatographic methods and studied by mass spectrometry.
TI  - Antibacterial & antiplasmid activities of Helicteres isora L.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The multiple drug resistance (MDR) is a serious health problem and major challenge to the global drug discovery programmes. Most of the genetic determinants that confer resistance to antibiotics are located on R-plasmids in bacteria. The present investigation was undertaken to investigate the ability of organic extract of the fruits of Helicteres isora to cure R-plasmids from certain clinical isolates. METHODS: Active fractions demonstrating antibacterial and antiplasmid activities were isolated from the acetone extracts of shade dried fruits of H. isora by bioassay guided fractionation. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics and organic extracts was determined by agar dilution method. Plasmid curing activity of organic fractions was determined by evaluating the ability of bacterial colonies (pre treated with organic fraction for 18 h) to grow in the presence of antibiotics. The physical loss of plasmid DNA in the cured derivatives was further confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: The active fraction did not inhibit the growth of either the clinical isolates or the strains harbouring reference plasmids even at a concentration of 400 microg/ml. However, the same fraction could cure plasmids from Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and E. coli (RP4) at curing efficiencies of 14, 26, 22 and 2 per cent respectively. The active fraction mediated plasmid curing resulted in the subsequent loss of antibiotic resistance encoded in the plasmids as revealed by antibiotic resistance profile of cured strains. The physical loss of plasmid was also confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The active fraction of acetone extract of H. isora fruits cured R-plasmids from Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates as well as reference strains. Such plasmid loss reversed the multiple antibiotic resistance in cured derivatives making them sensitive to low concentrations of antibiotics. Acetone fractions of H. isora may be a source to develop antiplasmid agents of natural origin to contain the development and spread of plasmid borne multiple antibiotic resistance.
TI  - On-line separation of bacterial cells by carbon-electrode dielectrophoresis.
AB  - Dielectrophoresis (DEP) represents a powerful approach to manipulate and study living cells. Hitherto, several approaches have used 2-D DEP chips. With the aim to increase sample volume, in this study we used a 3-D carbon-electrode DEP chip to trap and release bacterial cells. A continuous flow was used to plug an Escherichia coli cell suspension first, to retain cells by positive DEP, and thereafter to recover them by washing with peptone water washing solution. This approach allows one not only to analyze DEP behavior of living cells within the chip, but also to further recover fractions containing DEP-trapped cells. Bacterial concentration and flow rate appeared as critical parameters influencing the separation capacity of the chip. Evidence is presented demonstrating that the setup developed in this study can be used to separate different types of bacterial cells.
TI  - Inactivation of food-borne spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms on the surface of a photoactive polymer.
AB  - The photodynamic action of a novel photoactive polymer comprising covalently bound anthraquinone (AQ) moieties was evaluated after developing a methodology to reliably immobilize viable micro-organisms onto polymer film surfaces. The survival of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus (vegetative cells and spores), Fusarium oxysporum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae microbes inoculated on the surface of inert polymeric substrates was assessed to determine the effect of inoculum composition, drying rate and exposure to ultraviolet (UV-A) radiation. Their survival was highly dependent on microbial genus, with E. coli consistently displaying markedly shorter survival times than the other microbes, and B. cereus spores being the most resistant. Inoculation of the microbes onto the surface of the photoactive polymer films, followed by exposure to UV-A radiation, dramatically accelerated the inactivation of all microbial types studied compared with their survival on the surface of inert polymer substrates. Simultaneous exposure to both oxygen and UV-A radiation is required to affect cell survival, which is consistent with this effect most likely originating from the photoinduced production of singlet oxygen by the photoactive polymer. These results provide further compelling evidence that singlet oxygen produced exogenously by this photoactive polymeric substrate can successfully inactivate a broad spectrum of microbes on the substrate's surface.
TI  - Spectral, thermal and in vitro antimicrobial studies of cyclohexylamine-N-dithiocarbamate transition metal complexes.
AB  - Transition metal complexes of the type [M(L)(2)] and those containing monodentate phosphines of the type [M(L)(2)(PPh(3))] {M=Ni, Co, Cu and Zn; L=cyclohexylamine-N-dithiocarbamate; PPh(3)=triphenylphosphine} have been synthesized. The complexes were characterized using IR, UV-vis, NMR spectroscopy, and thermal analysis (TGA). The (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and (31)P NMR showed the expected signals for the dithiocarbamate and triphenylphosphine moieties. The spectral studies in all compounds revealed that the coordination of metals occurs via the sulphur atom of the dithiocarbamate ligand in a bidentate fashion. Thermal behavior of the complexes showed that the complexes were more stable than their parent ligands. The ligand moiety is lost in the first step and the rest of the organic moiety decomposes in the subsequent steps. Furthermore, the ligand and their metal complexes were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus and antifungal activities against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus carbonarius, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus. The metal complexes exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than the parent ligands. Generally, the zinc complexes were effective against the growth of bacteria with Zn(L)(2) displaying broad spectrum bacteriocidal activity at concentrations of 50microg/mL; and Ni(L)(2) was more effective against the growth of fungi at concentrations of 100-400microg/mL under laboratory conditions.
TI  - Humidity-dependent bacterial cells functional morphometry investigations using atomic force microscope.
AB  - The effect of a relative humidity (RH) in a range of 93-65% on morphological and  elastic properties of Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli cells was evaluated using atomic force microscopy. It is shown that gradual dehumidification of bacteria environment has no significant effect on cell dimensional features and considerably decreases them only at 65% RH. The increasing of the bacteria cell wall roughness and elasticity occurs at the same time. Observed changes indicate that morphological properties of B. cereus are rather stable in wide range of relative humidity, whereas E. coli are more sensitive to drying, significantly increasing roughness and stiffness parameters at RH </= 84% RH. It is discussed the dependence of the response features on differences in cell wall structure of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial cells.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of essential oils and methanol extracts of sweet basil Ocimum basilicum occurring in Bangladesh.
AB  - The antibacterial potential of essential oils and methanol extracts of sweet basil Ocimum basilicum L. (Lamiaceae) was evaluated for controlling the growth range of food-borne pathogenic bacteria. Essential oils extracted by hydrodistillation from the leaves and stems were analyzed by GC-MS. Fifty-seven compounds representing 94.9 and 96.1% of the total leaf and stem oils, respectively, were identified, of which methyl chavicol (36.7 and 29.9%), gitoxigenin (9.3 and 10.2%), trimethoquinol (10.3 and 8.4%), beta-guaiene (3.7 and 4.1%), aciphyllene (3.4 and 3.0%), alizarin (3.2 and 4.4%), naphthaline (2.2 and 3.8%), (-)-caryophyllene (2.0 and 1.9%), and mequinol (1.6 and 1.8%) were the major compounds. The essential oils (10 microL/disc of 1:5, v/v dilution with methanol) and methanol extracts (300 microg/disc) of O. basilicum displayed a great potential of antibacterial activity against Bacillius cereus, B. subtilis, B. megaterium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Shigella boydii, S. dysenteriae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V. mimicus, and Salmonella typhi with their respective zones of inhibition of 11.2-21.1 mm and MIC values of 62.5-500 microg/mL. The results of this study suggest that the natural products derived from O. basilicum may have potential use in the food and/or pharmaceutical industries as antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Post-antibacterial effect of thymol.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of thymol has been well established and reported in the scientific literature. Continued suppression of bacterial growth following limited exposure to antimicrobial compounds at different concentrations greater than or equal to the minimum inhibitory concentration level (MIC) and at concentrations less than the MIC can be used as an indicator of biological activity, and are respectively referred to as a post-antibacterial effect (PAE) and a post-antibiotic sub-MIC effect (PA-SME). In this study, the PAE and the PA-SME of thymol against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus were investigated. A spectrophotometric method was used to determine the PAE and the PA-SME of thymol against the selected test strains. Thymol exhibited a considerable PAE and PA-SME at MIC and sub-MIC concentrations against test strains. The greatest duration of both the PAE and the PA-SME was observed for thymol against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The PAE and PA-SME times for E. coli were 12 and 8 h, respectively, and for P. aeruginosa were 11 and 7.5 h, respectively. The duration of the PAE and PA-SME observed for S. aureus and B. cereus was shorter than for Gram-negative strains.
TI  - Specific and reversible immobilization of NADH oxidase on functionalized carbon nanotubes.
AB  - Nanotechnology-inspired biocatalyst systems have attracted a lot of attention in  enzyme immobilization recently. Theoretically, nanomaterials are ideal supporting materials because they can provide the upper limits on enzyme-efficiency-determining factors such as surface area/volume ratio, enzyme loading capacity and mass transfer resistance. However, common immobilization methods have limited the applicability of these biocatalysts owing to enzyme leaching, 3D structure loss, and strong diffusion resistance. Expensive enzyme purification step is also required for these methods before immobilization. In this work, we show an efficient immobilization method based on specific interaction between His-tagged NADH oxidase and functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes without requiring enzyme purification for immobilization. We cloned the annotated NADH oxidase gene from Bacillus cereus genome and overexpressed with pET30 vector encoding N-terminal 6x His-tag. The His-tagged NADH oxidase was then immobilized onto single-walled carbon nanotubes functionalized with N(alpha),N(alpha)-bis(carboxymethyl)-L-lysine hydrate. The resulting nanoscale biocatalyst has overcome the foresaid limitations, and demonstrates good loading capacity and stability while maintaining 92% maximum activity of the native enzyme. We further demonstrate that the immobilization is reversible and can retain ca. 92% activity for a couple of loading cycles.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of a phosphopentomutase from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Phosphopentomutases (PPMs) interconvert D-ribose 5-phosphate and alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate to link glucose and nucleotide metabolism. PPM from Bacillus cereus was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity and crystallized. Bacterial PPMs are predicted to contain a di-metal reaction center, but the catalytically relevant metal has not previously been identified. Sparse-matrix crystallization screening was performed in the presence or absence of 50 mM MnCl(2). This strategy resulted in the formation of two crystal forms from two chemically distinct conditions. The crystals that formed with 50 mM MnCl(2) were more easily manipulated and diffracted to higher resolution. These results suggest that even if the catalytically relevant metal is not known, the crystallization of putative metalloproteins may still benefit from supplementation of the crystallization screens with potential catalytic metals.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of novel schiff bases of 3-amino-2-methyl  quinazolin 4-(3H)-one.
AB  - In the present study, novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes. The 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-one was synthesized from anthranilic acid via the 2-methyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by means of Infrared (IR), (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, Mass spectral, and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 11298)) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC 9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 46645) activities, using the paper disk diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by the agar streak dilution method. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited significant anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities. Among the synthesized compounds, 3-(4-hydroxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4g and 4c was found to exhibit the highest anti-bacterial activity and 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4k exhibited the highest anti-fungal activity.
TI  - Antioxidant and Antimicrobial Activity of Alpinia officinarum.
AB  - Alpinia officinarum is a rhizome belonging to the family zingeberaeceae. Hydro alcoholic extract by hot and cold maceration and methanol extract by percolation process Qualitative phytochemical analysis of extract of Alpinia officinarum rhizome showed a majority of the compound including tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids and saponins. Hydroalcoholic extract prepared by hot maceration process was found to contain more phenol and flavonol and it was measured as 50.1 mg/g and 54.02 mg/g, respectively. All the three extracts showed moderate to potent antimicrobial activity against the Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureas, Pseudomonas auroginosa, Escherichia coli. None of the extracts showed antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans. All the three extracts showed a concentration dependent radical scavenging activity by inhibiting diphenylpicrylhydrazyl free radical at the same time hydroalcoholic extract prepared by hot maceration process showed better reducing and total antioxidant activity.
TI  - An independent in vitro comparison of povidone iodine and SteriLid.
AB  - AIM: Povidone iodine (PI) and SteriLid (SL) are biocides used to decrease bacterial load on the eyelid margin. We compared the antibacterial activity of PI and SL to determine the better antiseptic. METHODS: Time-kill studies of PI and SL against a battery of bacteria that included Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis were conducted at time points 1, 2, 10, and 30 min. The comparative outcome measures were based on 90% and 99.9% decreases in bacterial colony counts. RESULTS: PI was more effective at a 90% kill than SL at time points, 1 min (8/9 vs. 7/9), 2 min (9/9 vs. 6/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 8/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 8/9). PI was more effective at a 99.9% kill than SL at time points, 1 min (5/9 vs. 3/9), 2 min (7/9 vs. 4/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 4/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 6/9). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports PI as an effective antiseptic for decreasing the bacterial load that can exist on the eyelid margin. SL appears to be a less effective alternative.
TI  - Generation of chitin-derived oligosaccharides toxic to pathogenic bacteria using  ChiA74, an endochitinase native to Bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  - AIMS: To demonstrate that an endochitinase (ChiA74) native to Bacillus thuringiensis can be used to generate chitin-derived oligosaccharides (OGS) with antibacterial activity against a number of aetiological agents of disease, including bacteria that cause diarrhoeal and emetic syndromes in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: The intact chiA74 with its cis elements was cloned into high and moderately high copy number Escherichia coli expression vectors. Functionally secreted ChiA74 was produced, and the endochitinase cleaved substrate colloidal chitin to produce OGS with 3, 5 and 6 degrees of polymerization. The enzyme was active for an extended period of incubation (24 h), but its activity showed a decrement of 73% and 87%, respectively, after 24 h of incubation at 37 and 55 degrees C. OGS showed inhibitory activity against Bacillus cereus, Listeria inoccua, E. coli, Staphylococcus xylosus, Salmonella species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomona aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, and Proteus vulgaris. CONCLUSIONS: Endochitinase ChiA74 is able to stably maintain hydrolytic activity during prolonged incubation in a mix reaction with chitin to produce bioactive OGS with inhibitory activity against important food-borne pathogenic bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first study showing that an endochitinase (ChiA74) native of the most important bioinsecticide used worldwide (B. thuringiensis), but here produced in E. coli, is able to generate chitin-derived OGS with antibacterial activity against clinically significant food-borne pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Novel family of antimicrobial peptides from the skin of Rana shuchinae.
AB  - So far numerous antimicrobial peptides have been characterized from amphibians. In this work, a new family of antimicrobial peptides, named shuchin, was purified and characterized from skin secretions of the frog, Rana shuchinae that lives in freezing mountains. Totally two members of shuchin (shuchin 1 and 2) were identified with the amino acid sequence of NALSMPRNKCNRALMCFG and NALSSPRNKCDRASSCFG, respectively. cDNAs encoding shuchins were cloned from the skin cDNA library of R. shuchinae. The precursors of shuchin are composed of 62 amino acid residues including the conserved signal peptides, acidic propieces, and mature antimicrobial peptides. Synthetic shuchins showed strong and broad antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus; MICs<12.5 microg/ml), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; most MICs from 3.1 to 12.5 microg/ml), and yeast (Candida albicans; MICs of 6.25 microg/ml), but no hemolytic activity under the effective concentration, thereby provide more leading templates for designing novel anti-infection agents.
TI  - Microbial growth in dry grain food (Sunsik) beverages prepared with water, milk,  soymilk, or honey-water.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the growth of microorganisms, including pathogenic bacteria such as Cronobacter sakazakii and Bacillus cereus, in Sunsik beverages made of water, milk, soymilk, or honey-water during storage at room temperature. Prepared Sunsik beverages were stored at room temperature and the growth of total aerobic counts, Escherichia coli/coliforms, and yeast and mold were measured. Also, samples inoculated with a cocktail of C. sakazakii or B. cereus spores were stored at room temperature and their growths were determined during storage. Populations of total aerobic counts and coliforms significantly increased with increasing storage time at room temperature, which resulted in higher than 8 log and 7 log after 24 h in all samples except for the honey-water sample, respectively. Levels of total aerobic counts and coliforms were significantly lower in the honey-water sample than in the other samples after 6 and 9 h of storage, respectively. Initial populations of C. sakazakii and B. cereus ranged from 0 to 1 log CFU/mL, respectively, and these populations significantly increased with increasing storage time at room temperature. Therefore, populations of C. sakazakii and B. cereus were approximately 7 to 8 log CFU/mL after 24 h of storage. However, after 12 and 9 h of storage, there were significant differences in levels of C. sakazakii and B. cereus between the honey-water sample and the other samples, respectively. Based on these results, the addition of honey can inhibit microbial growth in Sunsik beverages; however, the best way to avoid pathogen infection would be to consume Sunsik beverages as soon as possible after preparation.
TI  - Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of schiff bases of 4-(2-aminophenyl)-morpholines.
AB  - In the present study, a novel series of 4-(2-aminophenyl)morpholines were synthesized and characterized by IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectral analysis. The synthesized compounds were screened for analgesic (100 and 200 mg/kg), antiinflammatory (200 and 400 mg/kg), antibacterial (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and antifungal (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger) activities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the compounds were also ascertained by agar streak dilution method. N-benzylidine-2-morpholoino benzenamine (1) and N-(3-nitro benzylidine)-2-morpholino benzenamine (3) exhibited significant analgesic, antiinflammatory and antimicrobial activities.
TI  - LmbE proteins from Bacillus cereus are de-N-acetylases with broad substrate specificity and are highly similar to proteins in Bacillus anthracis.
AB  - The genomes of Bacillus cereus and its closest relative Bacillus anthracis each contain two LmbE protein family homologs: BC1534 (BA1557) and BC3461 (BA3524). Only a few members of this family have been biochemically characterized including N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidyl inositol (GlcNAc-PI), 1-D-myo-inosityl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (GlcNAc-Ins), N,N'-diacetylchitobiose (GlcNAc(2)) and lipoglycopeptide antibiotic de-N-acetylases. All these enzymes share a common feature in that they de-N-acetylate the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) moiety of their substrates. The bc1534 gene has previously been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was purified and its 3D structure determined. In this study, the bc3461 gene from B. cereus ATCC14579 was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant enzymes BC1534 (EC 3.5.1.-) and BC3461 were biochemically characterized. The enzymes have different molecular masses, pH and temperature optima and broad substrate specificity, de-N-acetylating GlcNAc and N-acetylchito-oligomers (GlcNAc(2), GlcNAc(3) and GlcNAc(4)), as well as GlcNAc-1P, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-1 phosphate; GlcNAc-6P, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-6 phosphate; GalNAc, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine; ManNAc, N-acetyl-D-mannosamine; UDP-GlcNAc, uridine 5'-diphosphate N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. However, the enzymes were not active on radiolabeled glycol chitin, peptidoglycan from B. cereus, N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-(beta-1,4)-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (GMDP) or N-acetyl-D-GlcN-Nalpha1-6-D-myo-inositol-1-HPO(4)-octadecyl (GlcNAc-I-P-C(18)). Kinetic analysis of the activity of BC1534 and BC3461 on GlcNAc and GlcNAc(2) revealed that GlcNAc(2) is the favored substrate for both native enzymes. Based on the recently determined crystal structure of BC1534, a mutational analysis identified functional key residues, highlighting their importance for the catalytic mechanism and the substrate specificity of the enzyme. The catalytic efficiencies of BC1534 variants were significantly decreased compared to the native enzyme. An alignment-based tree places both de-N-acetylases in functional categories that are different from those of other LmbE proteins.
TI  - Cadmium chloride exhibits a profound toxic effect on bacterial microflora of the  mice gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - Cadmium (Cd(2)(+)), a naturally occurring heavy metal, is an important environmental pollutant and a potent toxicant to bacteria. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract microflora has a marked capacity to cope with the increased load of ingested metals. However, heavy metals may have harmful effects on GIT microflora. Under the conditions of experimental exposure to cadmium, changes in the population of intestinal microflora in healthy mice were examined. Five experimental groups received 23 to 50 mg kg(-)(1) cadmium in drinking water and control group was given water free from cadmium for 45 days. Intestinal contents and biopsy samples were aseptically collected and bacterial counts were performed. The microflora of the intestine in control group was represented by bacteria of the genera Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., Enterococcus spp. and Proteus spp. As the result of dysbiosis induced by the introduction of cadmium, a sharp decrease in the population of all microbial species in the intestine was observed. The deleterious effect of cadmium appeared to be less in the large intestine and rectum than that of small intestine, suggesting a site-specific influence of cadmium. The gram-negative bacteria tested were less sensitive to cadmium compared to the gram-positive bacteria because of their possible different ability to uptake the metal ions.
TI  - Antioxidant, antibacterial and antigiardial activities of Walsura robusta Roxb.
AB  - Walsura robusta Roxb. (Family: Meliaceae) is a well-known multi-purpose medicinal plant, and has been employed for a wide range of disease conditions without documented scientific data. In the current study, four pure isolated compounds, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (1), turpinionoside A (2), (+)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4), were isolated from the leaves and twigs of W. robusta. Biological evaluation for free radical scavenging, antibacterial and antigiardial activities was performed. We investigated antioxidant effects of the crude extracts as well as the isolated compounds using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH), hydroxyl radical (OH), and superoxide anion (O(2)) scavenging assays. Three phenolic glucosides (1, 3 and 4) were found to possess strong antioxidant activity. They scavenged DPPH(*) with IC(50) values in the range of 51.5-86.6 microM. We also detected the superoxide dismutase-like activities in compounds 3 and 4 which are lignan glucosides, demonstrating potent superoxide scavenging activity with IC(50) values in the range of 0.8 and 0.7 microM, respectively. Other biological activities including antibacterial and antigiardial assays were carried out. Preliminary results demonstrated that most extracts, except the diethyl ether extract, exhibited inhibition zones against all Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and S. pyogenes. Aqueous extracts of this plant species could inhibit Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Shigella sonnei. However, the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of W. robusta on all tested bacterial strains showed only weak activity, and their MBCs were greater than 25 mg mL(-1). For antigiardial activity, incubation with 2 x 10(5) trophozoites mL(-1) of the culture medium with the crude extracts at concentration ranged from 31.25 to 1000 microg mL(-1) demonstrated no activity (MIC > 1000 microg mL(-1)).
TI  - Novel 6,8-dibromo-4(3H)quinazolinone derivatives of anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities.
AB  - Starting from 4-(6,8-dibromo-2-phenyl-4-oxo-(4H)-quinazolin-3-yl)-benzoic acid ethyl ester (II) and its acid hydrazide III, a new series of Schiff bases IV and their cyclized products, thiazolidinones V, oxadiazole VIII, pyrazoles X-XII, pyrroles XIII-XV and other related products were synthesized. These compounds were screened for their anti-bacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) and anti-fungal activity (Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus) using paper disc diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. Among the synthesized compounds 2-(4-(2-phenyl-6,8-dibromo-4-oxo-(4H)quinazolin-3-yl)-N-ethylamido benzoic acid hydrazide VIIa was found to exhibits the most potent in vitro anti-microbial activity with the MICs of 1.56, 3.125, 1.56, 25, 25 and 25 microg/ml against E. coli, S. typhimurium, L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and B. cereus respectively. Compound 2-(4-(2-phenyl-6,8-dibromo-4-oxo-(4H)quinazolin-3-yl)-N-methyl thioamido benzoic acid hydrazide VIIc was found to exhibit the most potent in vitro anti-fungal activity with MICs 0.78 and 0.097 microg/ml against C. albicans and A. flavus.
TI  - Rapid degradation of N-3-oxo-acylhomoserine lactones by a Bacillus cereus isolate from Malaysian rainforest soil.
AB  - A bacterial strain, KM1S, was isolated from a Malaysian rainforest soil sample by using a defined enrichment medium that specifically facilitates selection of quorum quenching bacteria. KM1S was clustered closely to Bacillus cereus by 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis. It degraded N-3-oxo-hexanoyl homoserine lactone and N-3-oxo-octanoyl homoserine lactone in vitro rapidly at 4.98 and 6.56 microg AHL h(-1) per 10(9) CFU/ml, respectively, as determined by the Rapid Resolution Liquid Chromatography. The aiiA homologue, encoding an autoinducer inactivation enzyme catalyzing the degradation of N-acylhomoserine lactones, of KM1S was amplified and cloned. Sequence analysis indicated the presence of the motif (106)HXDH-59 amino acids-H(169)-21 amino acids-D(191) for N-acylhomoserine lactone lactonases.
TI  - Phytochemical and biological investigations of Elaeodendron schlechteranum.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Elaeodendron schlechteranum (Loes.) Loes. is a shrub or tree belonging to the family Celastraceae. In Tanzania, in addition to ethnopharmacological claims in treating various non-infectious diseases, the root and stem bark powder is applied on septic wounds, and the leaf paste is used for treatment of boils and carbuncles. The aim of this study was to identify the putative active constituents of the plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dried and powdered root bark was extracted and subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation, based on antibacterial, antiparasitic and anti-HIV activity. Isolated compounds were identified by spectroscopic methods, and evaluated for biological activity. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Bioassay-guided isolation led to the identification of tingenin B (22beta-hydroxytingenone) as the main antibacterial constituent. It was active against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (IC(50)<0.25 microg/mL). Furthermore, antiparasitic activity was observed against Trypanosoma cruzi (IC(50)<0.25 microg/mL), Trypanosoma brucei (<0.25 microg/mL), Leishmania infantum (0.51 microg/mL), and Plasmodium falciparum (0.36 microg/mL). Tingenin B was highly cytotoxic to MRC-5 cells (CC(50) 0.45 microg/mL), indicating a poor selectivity. Two inactive triterpenes, 3beta,29-dihydroxyglutin-5-ene and cangoronine methyl ester were also obtained. Phytochemical investigation of the anti-HIV active fractions led to the isolation and identification of three phenolic compounds, namely 4'-O-methylepigallocatechin, 4'-O-methylgallocatechin, and a new procyanidin dimer, i.e. 4',4'''-di-O-methyl-prodelphinidin B(4) or 4'-O-methylgallocatechin-(4alpha-->8)-4'-O-methylepigallocatechin. However, none of these showed anti-HIV activity.
TI  - Insertional mutagenesis reveals genes involved in Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 growth at low temperature.
AB  - Transposon mutagenesis of Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 yielded cold-sensitive mutants. Mutants of genes encoding enzymes of the central metabolism were affected by cold, but also by other stresses, such as pH or salt, whereas a mutant with transposon insertion in the promoter region of BC0259 gene, encoding a putative DEAD-box RNA helicase displaying homology with Escherichia coli CsdA and Bacillus subtilis CshA RNA helicases, was only cold-sensitive. Expression of the BC0259 gene at 10 degrees C is reduced in the mutant. Analysis of the 5' untranslated region revealed the transcriptional start and putative cold shock-responsive elements. The role of this RNA helicase in the cold-adaptive response of B. cereus is discussed.
TI  - [Preparation of a 96-microwell plate DNA diagnostic chip for detection of foodborne bacteria and its application in an incident of food poisoning].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a 96-microwell plate DNA diagnostic chip for simultaneous detection of 9 major foodborne bacteria. METHODS: Type-specific PCR primers labeled with biotin and oligonucleotide probes were designed according to the conservative genes of 9 major foodborne bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7 (Stx1 and Stx2), Shigella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. A one-tube multiplex PCR system for simultaneous amplification of these bacteria was established, and the DNA probes were spotted and immobilized in the wells of the plate in 5x5 array format. Stable hybridization system between PCR products and oligonucleotide probes in the microwell was established after condition optimization. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin and NBT/BCIP were used to detect the hybridized PCR products. RESULTS: Twenty standard bacteria strains were used to validate the 96 microwell plate DNA diagnostic chip and highly specific and stable experiment results were obtained. Using this chip assay, the causal pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was identified within 12 h after the sampling from an incident of food poisoning, and the result was consistent with that obtained using conventional bacterial culture and biochemical identification. CONCLUSION: The novel 96 microwell plate DNA diagnostic chip allows rapid, accurate, automated and high-throughput bacterial detection and is especially valuable for quick response to such public health emergencies as food poisoning.
TI  - An assessment of the antibacterial activity in larval excretion/secretion of four species of insects recorded in association with corpses, using Lucilia sericata Meigen as the marker species.
AB  - The relative antibacterial activities of excretion/secretion (ES) from two carrion-feeding insects, Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy and Dermestes maculatus DeGeer, and a detritivore, Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus, were compared to that of Lucilia sericata Meigen, a species with ES of known antibacterial capacity, in order to explore the antimicrobial potential of other carrion and detritivore species. Viable counts were used to assess time-kill of ES against five bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Antibacterial activity was recorded in all four insect species although T. molitor and D. maculatus were the most effective in controlling growth of P. mirabilis. The blowflies were more effective in controlling a wider range of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The larval ES from all species was shown to reduce bacterial growth rate although differences in antibacterial spectrum were noted and the degree of potency varied between the four species. These differences may be explained ecologically by the different colonisation times of each insect species on the corpse. Overall, this study demonstrates that research into other carrion-feeding insect species has potential to provide an increased source of antimicrobial chemicals to broaden the range of bacterial species beyond that currently controlled using L. sericata.
TI  - Synergistic effects of ethanol and UV radiation to reduce levels of selected foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether combined treatments would produce synergistic disinfection effects on food products during food processing compared with single treatments. We investigated the bactericidal effects of a commercial chemical disinfectant (ethanol) and of UV radiation on Bacillus cereus F4810/72, Cronobacter sakazakii KCTC 2949, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 35556, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium NO/NA in vitro. Various concentrations of ethanol (10, 30, 40, and 50%) were tested with various exposure doses of UV radiation (6, 96, 216, 360, and 504 mWs/cm(2)) with a UV lamp. The combined ethanol-UV treatments resulted in greater reductions in bacterial counts than did either treatment alone. The synergistic effect values for B. cereus, C. sakazakii, S. aureus, S. enterica Typhimurium NO/NA, and E. coli were 0.40 to 1.52, 0.52 to 1.74, 0.20 to 2.32, 0.07 to 1.14, and 0.02 to 1.75 log CFU/ml, respectively. The results of this study suggest that a significant synergistic benefit results from combining ethanol and UV treatments against foodborne pathogens in vitro.
TI  - A new prenylated flavanoid with antibacterial activity from propolis collected in Egypt.
AB  - A novel prenylated flavanoid, isonymphaeol-D (1), together with two known compounds, isonymphaeol-B (2) and nymphaeol-B (3), were isolated from Egyptian propolis. The structures of the isolated compounds were determined by various spectroscopic methods. 1 exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative strains (Serratia sp., Pseudomonos sp., Escherichia coli).
TI  - Bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases are poor suicide genes in mammalian cells.
AB  - Transfer of deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dNKs) into cancer cells increases the activity of cytotoxic nucleoside analogues. It has been shown that bacterial dNKs, when introduced into Escherichia coli, sensitize this bacterium toward nucleoside analogues. We studied the possibility of using bacterial dNKs, for example deoxyadenosine kinases (dAKs), to sensitize human cancer cells to gemcitabine. Stable and transient transfections of bacterial dNKs into human cells showed that these were much less active than human and fruitfly dNKs. The fusion of dAK from Bacillus cereus to the green fluorescent protein induced a modest sensitization. Apparently, bacterial dNKs did not get properly expressed or are unstable in the mammalian cell.
TI  - Synthesis and Antibacterial Assessment of N-[4-(4-substituted phenyl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine.
AB  - In a wide search program towards new and efficient antibacterial agents, we assessed the extent to which physicochemical properties can be exploited to promote antibacterial activity associated with a series of substituted s-triazine. The synthesized compounds (1a-12b) were subsequently screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against three gram positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus) and three Gram-negative microorganism (Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes) by the broth dilution technique, recommended by European Committee for antimicrobial susceptibility testing with reference to streptomycin.
TI  - Evaluation of diffusion and dilution methods to determine the antibacterial activity of plant extracts.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate diffusion and dilution methods for determining the antibacterial activity of plant extracts and their mixtures. Several methods for measurement of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of a plant extract are available, but there is no standard procedure as there is for antibiotics. We tested different plant extracts, their mixtures and phenolic acids on selected gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria monocytogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Infantis, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli) with the disk diffusion, agar dilution, broth microdilution and macrodilution methods. The disk diffusion method was appropriate only as a preliminary screening test prior to quantitative MIC determination with dilution methods. A comparison of the results for MIC obtained by agar dilution and broth microdilution was possible only for gram-positive bacteria, and indicated the latter as the most accurate way of assessing the antimicrobial effect. The microdilution method with TTC (2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) or INT (2-p-iodophenyl-3-p-nitrophenyl-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride) to indicate the viability of aerobic bacteria was found to be the best alternative approach, while only ATP determination was appropriate for microaerophilic Campylobacter spp. Using survival curves the kinetics of bacterial inactivation on plant extract exposure was followed for 24h and in this way the MIC values determined by the microdilution method were confirmed as the concentrations of extracts that inhibited bacterial growth. We suggest evaluation of the antibacterial activity of plant extracts using the broth microdilution method as a fast screening method for MIC determination and the macrodilution method at selected MIC values to confirm bacterial inactivation. Campylobacter spp. showed a similar sensitivity to plant extracts as the tested gram-positive bacteria, but S. Infantis and E. coli O157:H7 were more resistant.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic and biological studies on the new symmetric Schiff base  derived from 2,6-diformyl-4-methylphenol with N-aminopyrimidine.
AB  - A phenol based novel Schiff base polydentate symmetric ligand was prepared. The complexes were prepared by reacting ligand and the metal chlorides of Cu (II), Ni(II), Co(II) and Fe(II) in methanol to get a series of mononuclear complexes. The complexes were characterized by elemental analyses, conductivity measurements, magnetic susceptibility data, IR, UV-Vis, NMR and API-ES mass spectral data. The mononuclear structure of the complexes was confirmed on the basis of elemental analyses, magnetic susceptibility and API-ES mass spectral data. The ligand and all the metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, S. aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 7064 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9345), one Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli ATCC 4230), and three yeast (Candida albicans ATCC 14053, Candida krusei ATCC 6258 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019) strains. Therefore, newly synthesized the ligand and two complexes [(Cu(II) and Co(II)] showed good biological activity against all tested bacteria and yeast strains.
TI  - The swaposin-like domain of potato aspartic protease (StAsp-PSI) exerts antimicrobial activity on plant and human pathogens.
AB  - Plant-specific insert domain (PSI) is a region of approximately 100 amino acid residues present in most plant aspartic protease (AP) precursors. PSI is not a true saposin domain; it is the exchange of the N- and C-terminal portions of the saposin like domain. Hence, PSI is called a swaposin domain. Here, we report the cloned, heterologous expression and purification of PSI from StAsp 1 (Solanum tuberosum aspartic protease 1), called StAsp-PSI. Results obtained here show that StAsp-PSI is able to kill spores of two potato pathogens in a dose-dependent manner without any deleterious effect on plant cells. As reported for StAPs (S. tuberosum aspartic proteases), the StAsp-PSI ability to kill microbial pathogens is dependent on the direct interaction of the protein with the microbial cell wall/or membrane, leading to increased permeability and lysis. Additionally, we demonstrated that, like proteins of the SAPLIP family, StAsp-PSI and StAPs are cytotoxic to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in a dose dependent manner. The amino acid residues conserved in SP_B (pulmonary surfactant protein B) and StAsp-PSI could explain the cytotoxic activity exerted by StAsp-PSI and StAPs against Gram-positive bacteria. These results and data previously reported suggest that the presence of the PSI domain in mature StAPs could be related to their antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of carvacrol and 2-nitro-1-propanol against single and mixed populations of foodborne pathogenic bacteria in corn flour dough.
AB  - Cereal doughs are an important part of human diet, but at the same time can act as vehicles for the transmission of human pathogenic bacteria. In the present study, four pathogenic or toxinogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) were inoculated in a dough made from corn flour in combination with the single antimicrobial compounds carvacrol and 2-Nitro-1-propanol (2NPOH). Survival of single and mixed populations in the treated doughs incubated at 37 degrees C was followed by culture-dependent and independent methods (TTGE). All strains were completely inactivated within 24 h by the tested compounds at 5% final concentration, but showed variable inhibition at lower concentrations of 0.5% and 2%. Sensitivity to antimicrobial compounds was in general modified when strains were tested in cocultures compared with single cultures. B. cereus was more sensitive to carvacrol (minimum bactericidal concentration, MBC, 0.5%) in coculture with S. aureus. It was also more sensitive to 2NPOH in cocultures with S. aureus and with S. enterica (MBC, 2% in both cases). S. aureus was more resistant to carvacrol (MBC, 5%) in cocultures with B. cereus, E. coli, as well as S. enterica. However, sensitivity to 2NPOH was not modified in any of the coculture experiments (MBC, 2%). E. coli was more resistant to carvacrol (MBC, 5%) in cocultures with S. aureus and with S. enterica. Resistance of E. coli to 2NPOH also increased in cocultures with B. cereus (MBC, 5%) and with S. aureus (MBC, 2%), but not with S. enterica (MBC, 0.5%). S. enterica was more resistant to carvacrol (MBC, 5%) in cocultures with E. coli, but it was more sensitive to 2NPOH in cocultures with B. cereus as well as with S. aureus (MBC, 2% in both cases). TTGE analysis of survivors from cocultures treated with 2NPOH or carvacrol allowed a good estimation of the identity of survivors according to their DNA band patterns. Results from this study indicate that the efficacy of antimicrobials such as carvacrol and 2NPOH is greatly influenced by the complexity of the microbial populations under target and the relationships between individual populations.
TI  - Effect of high pressure on the microbiological quality of cooked chicken during storage at normal and abuse refrigeration temperatures.
AB  - Vacuum-packaged cooked poultry meat was treated at a range of pressures (400-600  MPa) and hold times (1, 2 and 10 min), followed by storage at 4 degrees , 8 degrees or 12 degrees C for up to 35 days. Weissella viridescens was found to be the dominant microorganism in the pressure-treated meat, constituting 100% of the microflora identified at 500 and 600 MPa. None of the pressure-treated samples had obvious signs of spoilage during the 35 day storage period, even when the Weissella count was >7 log(10) cfu/g. Studies on a typical W. viridescens isolate showed it to be relatively pressure-resistant in poultry meat, with <1 log reduction in numbers after a treatment of 2 min at 600 MPa. Agar diffusion assays showed that the isolate also caused the inhibition of a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including strains of Clostridium botulinum, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. The selection of a pressure-resistant organism, such as this Weissella sp. could be advantageous in extending the shelf-life, and also microbiological safety, of the cooked meat, as it could give protection in addition to the pressure treatment itself.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of tapioca starch/decolorized hsian-tsao leaf gum coatings containing green tea extracts in fruit-based salads, romaine hearts and pork slices.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of edible coatings based on a tapioca starch/decolorized hsian-tsao leaf gum (dHG) matrix with various green tea extracts (GTEs) were evaluated. Its effect on the shelf-life extension of fruit-based salads, romaine hearts, and pork slices were investigated as well. Three types of GTEs from hot water (80 degrees C) (W), 40% (E4) and 80% (E8) ethanol were prepared. It was found that all GTEs showed pronounced inhibition on Gram positive bacteria in agar media, including Staphylococcus aureus BCRC 10781, Bacillus cereus BCRC 11778 and Listeria monocytogenes BCRC 14848, but not on Gram negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli DH10beta and Salmonella enteria BCRC 10747. The antimicrobial activities increased with increasing GTEs concentration (1, 2 and 5%), but did not differentiate significantly in terms of the effect of extraction solvents. When various GTEs (1%) were added to an edible coating formulation based on 1.35% tapioca starch +0.15% dHG +0.225% glycerol, pronounced antimicrobial activity on Gram positive bacteria was also observed as evaluated by using cylinder diffusion and antimicrobial migration tests. It was believed that the active compounds in green tea extracts could leave the coating matrix and migrate to increase the non-growth area. When being sprayed on various real food models, all tapioca starch/dHG coatings containing GTEs could successfully reduce the aerobic counting and growth of yeasts/molds by 1 to 2 log cycles in fruit-based salads, as compared to the control sample. Furthermore, during refrigerated storage of romaine hearts and pork slices for 48h, tapioca starch/dHG coatings with E4 extracts demonstrated pronounced antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria (4-6 log cycles reduction), followed by W extracts and E8 extracts in a decreasing order. Such results implied the high efficacy of antimicrobial migration of tapioca starch/dHG coatings containing GTEs and their application potentials on foods.
TI  - Chemistry, antioxidant, antibacterial and antifungal activities of volatile oils  and their components.
AB  - The present paper reports the chemical composition, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of several essential oils and their components. Analysis showed that three oils (Carum carvi L., Verbena officinalis L. and Majorana hortensis L.) contained predominantly oxygenated monoterpenes, while others studied (Pimpinella anisum L., Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) mainly contained anethole. C. carvi, V. officinalis and M. hortensis oils exhibited the most potent antioxidant activity, due their contents of carvacrol, anethole and estragol. Antibacterial action was assessed against a range of pathogenic and useful bacteria and fungi of agro-food interest. V. officinalis and C. carvi oils proved the most effective, in particular against Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Carvacrol proved most active against Escherichia coli, and completely inhibited the growth of Penicillium citrinum. The oils proved inactive towards some Lactobacilli strains, whereas single components showed an appreciable activity. These results may be important for use of the essential oils as natural preservatives for food products.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of minerals from ores indigenous to Korea.
AB  - We tested the antibacterial properties of a mix of minerals consisting mainly of  sericite, talc, and halloysite from Korea. The preparation showed clear growth inhibition of the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus, as well as the anaerobic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes. These results indicate that this preparation, made from ore minerals indigenous to Korea, could be used to develop new antibacterial reagents.
TI  - Designed low amphipathic peptides with alpha-helical propensity exhibiting antimicrobial activity via a lipid domain formation mechanism.
AB  - Although several low amphipathic peptides have been known to exhibit antimicrobial activity, their mode of action has not been completely elucidated. In this study, using designed low amphipathic peptides that retain different alpha-helical content and hydrophobicity, we attempted to investigate the mechanism of these properties. Calorimetric and thermodynamic analyses demonstrated that the peptides induce formation of two lipid domains in an anionic liposome at a high peptide-to-lipid ratio. On the other hand, even at a low peptide-to-lipid ratio, they caused minimal membrane damage, such as flip-flop of membrane lipids or leakage of calcein molecules from liposomes, and never translocated across membranes. Interaction energies between the peptides and anionic liposomes showed good correlation with antimicrobial activity for both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. We thus propose that the domain formation mechanism in which antimicrobial peptides exhibit activity solely by forming lipid domains without membrane damage is a major determinant of the antimicrobial activity of low amphipathic peptides. These peptides appear to stiffen the membrane such that it is deprived of the fluidity necessary for biological functions. We also showed that to construct the lipid domains, peptides need not form stable and cooperative structures. Rather, it is essential for peptides to only interact tightly with the membrane interface via strong electrostatic interactions, and slight differences in binding strength are invoked by differences in hydrophobicity. The peptides thus designed might pave the way for "clean" antimicrobial reagents that never cause release of membrane elements and efflux of their inner components.
TI  - Single chain variable fragment antibodies selected by phage display against the sporozoite surface antigen S16 of Cryptosporidium parvum.
AB  - Two human single chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries were used to select clones that bound to the surface glycoprotein S16 of Cryptosporidium parvum. Panning of the Tomlinson libraries I and J resulted in the isolation of nine distinct clones. Of the four clones which had full-length scFv, three contained stop codons. The remaining five clones were truncated, with four missing the heavy chain, and one missing most of the light chain. The full-length clones exhibited better binding to native C. parvum proteins and recombinant S16 than the truncated clones, with the exception of one truncated clone. None of the selected clones cross-reacted with Giardia lamblia, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus or another immunogenic target of C. parvum, P23. Clones expressed as the soluble scFv-gIIIp construct were able to detect C. parvum native proteins and sporozoites. Panning from naive libraries was an useful method for isolation and identification of recombinant antibodies that have the potential for use in pathogen detection and immunotherapy.
TI  - Profile of bacteria and fungi on money coins.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the quantity and quality of bacterial and fungi on money coins and to identify those that could pose a public health risk. DESIGN: Random sampling of coins from subjects within predetermined categories. SETTING: Westlands division of Nairobi Metropolitan province. SUBJECTS: Twenty-shilling coin samples were collected from matatu (a common commuter vehicle in Kenya) taxi conductors, greengrocers, shoe shiners, butchers, food kiosk/restaurant attendants, grocery shops attendants, roast maize vendors and school children. Forty coin samples were analysed for both the total viable content and the types of bacterial and fungal organisms. RESULTS: Average bacterial content on the coins ranged from 2.3 x 10(3) to 25.5 x 10(3) and fungi content from 11 to 377 colony forming units. The following potentially pathogenic bacteria were among those isolated: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Serratia, Enterobacter, Salmonella, Acinetobacter, Enterococci, Staphylococcus and Bacillus cereus. In addition, this is the first report of potentially pathogenic fungal isolation from money coins. Penicillium spp, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium, Rhizopus, Altenaria spp, Candida spp and Cryptococcus were isolated. CONCLUSION: Money coins harbour potentially pathogenic bacteria and fungi that may pose a public health risk. Hand hygiene is therefore strongly recommended, especially for those who simultaneously handle food and money.
TI  - Analysis of the antimicrobial activity of propolis and lysozyme in semisolid emulsion systems.
AB  - Propolis as an active natural substance is attractive due to its antimicrobial and antimycotic properties. Lysozyme was added to semisolid dermatological preparations as a complementary substance capable of potentiating their antimicrobial and antimycotic effect; this substance has been used for several decades as a preservative in food industry. The aim of this study was to model a semisolid emulsion system (o/w) for cutaneous use with moisturizing and antimicrobial properties, where the active substances would be propolis and/or lysozyme. The microbiological examination was performed under aseptic conditions. The microbiological examination was aimed at determining the antimicrobial efficacy of the studied preparation in the solid growth media using the wells technique. The results of the antimicrobial assay showed that the effectiveness of propolis against the growth of S. aureus was intensified by the lysozyme introduced into the emulsion systems. In addition to that, the results of examinations showed that the active substance propolis in emulsion systems more efficiently inhibited spore bacteria (Bacillus cereus) than lysozyme did, yet lysozyme had a more pronounced antimycotic (against Candida albicans) effect, compared to propolis. All studied cream samples inhibited the growth of Gram-negative microorganisms (Escherichia coli). The results of this study suggest that the application of propolis and lysozyme as the active substances may increase the antimycotic and antibacterial effect of the studied preparations.
TI  - Enhancing ATP-based bacteria and biofilm detection by enzymatic pyrophosphate regeneration.
AB  - The manufacturing processes of many electronic and medical products demand the use of high-quality water. Hence the water supply systems for these processes are required to be examined regularly for the presence of microorganisms and microbial biofilms. Among commonly used bacteria detection approaches, the ATP luminescence assay is a rapid, sensitive, and easy to perform method. The aim of this study is to investigate whether ATP regeneration from inorganic pyrophosphate, a product of the ATP luminescence assay, can stabilize the bioluminescence signals in ATP detection. ADPglc pyrophosphorylase (AGPPase), which catalyzes the synthesis of ATP from PP(i) in the presence of ADPglc, was selected because the system yields much lower luminescence background than the commercially available ATP sulfurylase/adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) system which was broadly used in pyrosequencing technology. The AGPPase-based assay could be used to measure both PP(i) and ATP quantitatively and shows 1.5- to 4.0-fold slight increases in a 10-min assay. The method could also be used to stabilize the luminescence signals in detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus in either broth or biofilm. These findings suggest that the AGPPase-based ATP regeneration system will find many practical applications such as detection of bacterial biofilm in water pipelines.
TI  - Photodynamic antimicrobial activity of avian eggshell pigments.
AB  - Pigmentation in avian eggshells appears to be associated with shell strength, temperature regulation, and camouflage. The pigments found in eggshells are mainly porphyrins, which have been utilized therapeutically as photosensitizers. Here, we examined the photoinactivation of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis) by hen eggshells and their pigments. The results indicated that eggshells have a light-dependent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive, but not gram-negative, bacteria. Our results indicate the possibility that the natural pigments used therapeutically have evolved in nature as a defence system.
TI  - A pilot study of the microbiological quality of culturally diverse, ready-to-eat  foods from selected retail establishments in Melbourne, Australia.
AB  - In recent years, there has been an increasing number of foodborne outbreaks linked to the consumption of culturally diverse foods. This appears to be because of the increasing quantity of culturally diverse foods available and a preference to store these foods, some of which are considered potentially hazardous, at ambient temperature. This practice may contravene temperature requirements defined by the Food Standards Code. A lack of understanding of the hazardous nature of some culturally prepared foods also poses difficulties in applying the Australian food safety legislation by regulators. This pilot study examined the normal microbiota of four culturally diverse foods: nem chua, che dau trang, kueh talam, and banh tet nhan man, which are traditionally stored and consumed at ambient temperature. Challenge testing was conducted to investigate the ability of these foods to support the growth of foodborne bacterial pathogens. Two of the products (kueh talam and che dau) were found to be microbiologically unsatisfactory because of the high standard plate counts. Challenge testing indicated that kueh talam, che dau, and banh tet nhan man were able to support the growth of Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella (1-2 log increases over 6 hours at 25 degrees C), suggesting that these foods may require temperature control during storage. However, nem chua was unable to support the growth of test bacteria, probably because of its acidic nature (pH 4.5), suggesting that ambient storage of this food may be safe. This study provided some preliminary evidence to support the need for further sampling and challenge testing of these products.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of the stem bark of Saraca indica (Caesalpiniaceae).
AB  - Chloroform, methanol, aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stem bark of Saraca indica were investigated for their antibacterial and antifungal activity against standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the fungi: Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus. Methanolic and aqueous extract exhibited antimicrobial activity with MIC ranging from 0.5-2% and 1-3% respectively. Methanolic extract exhibited the strongest activity against both bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Examination of genome homogeneity in prokaryotes using genomic signatures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: DNA word frequencies, normalized for genomic AT content, are remarkably stable within prokaryotic genomes and are therefore said to reflect a "genomic signature." The genomic signatures can be used to phylogenetically classify organisms from arbitrary sampled DNA. Genomic signatures can also be used to search for horizontally transferred DNA or DNA regions subjected to special selection forces. Thus, the stability of the genomic signature can be used as a measure of genomic homogeneity. The factors associated with the stability of the genomic signatures are not known, and this motivated us to investigate further. We analyzed the intra-genomic variance of genomic signatures based on AT content normalization (0(th) order Markov model) as well as genomic signatures normalized by smaller DNA words (1(st) and 2(nd) order Markov models) for 636 sequenced prokaryotic genomes. Regression models were fitted, with intra-genomic signature variance as the response variable, to a set of factors representing genomic properties such as genomic AT content, genome size, habitat, phylum, oxygen requirement, optimal growth temperature and oligonucleotide usage variance (OUV, a measure of oligonucleotide usage bias), measured as the variance between genomic tetranucleotide frequencies and Markov chain approximated tetranucleotide frequencies, as predictors. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Regression analysis revealed that OUV was the most important factor (p<0.001) determining intra-genomic homogeneity as measured using genomic signatures. This means that the less random the oligonucleotide usage is in the sense of higher OUV, the more homogeneous the genome is in terms of the genomic signature. The other factors influencing variance in the genomic signature (p<0.001) were genomic AT content, phylum and oxygen requirement. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic homogeneity in prokaryotes is intimately linked to genomic GC content, oligonucleotide usage bias (OUV) and aerobiosis, while oligonucleotide usage bias (OUV) is associated with genomic GC content, aerobiosis and habitat.
TI  - Analysis of the involvement of chitin-binding domain of ChiCW in antifungal activity, and engineering a novel chimeric chitinase with high enzyme and antifungal activities.
AB  - An antifungal chitinase, ChiCW, produced by Bacillus cereus 28-9 is effective against conidial germination of Botrytis elliptica, the causal agent of lily leaf blight. ChiCW as a modular enzyme consists of a signal peptide, a catalytic domain, a fibronectin type-III-like domain, and a chitin-binding domain. When two C-terminal domains of ChiCW were truncated, ChiCWdeltaFC (lacking the chitin-binding domain and fibronectin type III-like domain) lost its antifungal activity. Since ChiCWdeltaAC (lacking the chitin-binding domain) could not be expressed in Escherichia coli as ChiCWdeltaFC did, a different strategy based on protein engineering technology was designed to investigate the involvement of the chitin-binding domain of ChiCW (ChBD(ChiCW)) in antifungal activity in this study. Because ChiA1 of Bacillus circulans WL-12 is a modular enzyme with a higher hydrolytic activity than ChiCW but not inhibitory to conidial germination of Bo. elliptica and the similar domain composition of ChiA1 and ChiCW, the C-terminal truncated derivatives of ChiA1 were generated and used to construct chimeric chitinases with ChBD(ChiCW). When the chitin-binding domain of ChiA1 was replaced with ChBD(ChiCW), the chimeric chitinase named ChiAAAW exhibited both high enzyme activity and antifungal activity. The results indicate that ChBD(ChiCW) may play an important role in the antifungual activity of ChiCW.
TI  - E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and B. cereus bacteria sterilization using afterglow of non-thermal plasma at atmospheric pressure.
AB  - We developed and employed a new geometrical structure of dielectric barrier discharge in atmospheric pressure for bacterial broad spectrum sterilization. We utilized a plasma source having an AC power supply at 50 HZ and 5,400 V (rms value). We prepared suspensions of the Gram-negative bacteria species (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and a Gram-positive of Bacillus cereus with Luria-Bertani broth media up to OD(600 nm) = 0.25 of McFarland standard. Afterglow of non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma treated these suspensions. The influence of the atmospheric plasma afterglow on the species was assayed in different time durations 5, 10, and 15 min. The spectroscopic results of this investigation indicated that the survival reduction of the species can reach to 100% for P. aeruginosa in an exposure time of 10 min, E. coli and B. cereus in an exposure time of 15 min.
TI  - Assessment of microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its public health significance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its impact on public health. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional microbiological testing. METHODS: Ninety-two sachet-packaged water samples were analysed for microbiological and metal qualities. Total bacterial and coliform counts were determined, and the presence of Escherichia coli, an important water quality indicator, was tested. The level of conformity of the water processors with the guidelines of Nigeria's quality regulatory agency was also determined. RESULTS: Varying levels of microbial contamination were recorded in samples from the different sampling locations. The total bacteria count ranged between 2.86 and 3.45log colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. The highest coliform count recorded was 1.62log cfu/ml. Faecal coliform E. coli was detected in one sample from Oke-Iho and one sample from Okaka, representing 2.2% of total samples. Lead and manganese were not found in any of the samples. However, iron was detected and the highest iron concentration (0.10mg/l) was detected in samples from Ikorodu. The bacteria that were identified from the water samples included E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis, Aeromonas sp. and Micrococcus luteum. Many of the water processors did not comply with the guidelines of the quality regulatory agency. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the sachet-packaged samples of drinking water were of poor quality. The results indicate a need for Nigeria's quality regulatory agency to take appropriate measures in safeguarding public health.
TI  - Structure and regulation of the gab gene cluster, involved in the gamma-aminobutyric acid shunt, are controlled by a sigma54 factor in Bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  - The structure and regulation of the gab gene cluster, involved in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt, were studied by characterizing gabT and gabD genes cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis. Deletions of the gabT and gabD genes in B. thuringiensis strain HD-73 did not affect the growth of mutant strains in rich culture media, but the growth of a gabT deletion mutant strain was reduced in basic media (containing 0.2% GABA). Genome analysis indicates that the structure of the gab gene cluster in B. thuringiensis HD-73 is different from that in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis but is common in strains of the Bacillus cereus group. This suggests that the gene cluster involved in GABA shunt is specific to the B. cereus group. Based on reverse transcription-PCR and transcriptional fusion analysis, we confirmed that the gabT and gabD genes belong to different transcriptional units, while the gabD and gabR genes form an operon. We also demonstrated that the gabR gene plays a positive regulatory role in gabD and gabT expression. The GabR protein may be a sigma(54)-dependent transcriptional activator, according to a conserved domain search in the NCBI database, and it is highly conserved in the B. cereus group. The -24/-12 consensus sequence of a promoter upstream from gabT suggests that the promoter can be recognized by a sigma(54) factor. Further analysis of the genetic complementation studies also suggests that the expression of the gabT gene is controlled by a sigma(54) factor. Thus, the expression of the gab cluster is regulated by a sigma(54) factor by way of the transcription activator GabR.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel antibacterial peptide, avian beta-defensin 2 from ducks.
AB  - In this study, a novel avian beta-defensin (AvBD) was isolated from duck pancreas. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene contained an 195 bp open reading frame encoding 64 amino acids. Homology, characterization and comparison of the gene with AvBD from other avian species confirmed that it was duck AvBD2. The mRNA expression of the gene was analyzed in 17 tissues from 21-day-old ducks. AvBD2 was highly expressed in the trachea, crop, heart, bone marrow, and pancreas; moderately expressed in the muscular stomach, small intestine, kidney, spleen, thymus, and bursa of Fabricius; and weakly expressed in skin. We produced and purified recombinant AvBD2 by expressing the gene in Escherichia coli. As expected, the recombinant peptide exhibited strong bactericidal properties against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pasteurella multocida, and weak bactericidal properties against E. coli and Salmonella choleraesuis. In addition, the recombinant protein retained antimicrobial activity against S. aureus under different temperatures (range, -20 degrees C to 100 degrees C) and pH values (range, 3 to 12).
TI  - Microbiological quality of saffron from the main producer countries.
AB  - A microbiological study of saffron spice was undertaken in the context of a European research project (Methodologies for Implementing International Standards for Saffron Purity and Quality, the acronym for which is SAFFIC), analyzing 79 samples obtained from the main producer countries, namely Greece, Iran, Italy, Morocco, and Spain. Current microbiological quality criteria are the same as for other spices, but saffron is added in minute quantities during the cooking process, so the health risk associated with microbial contamination might be lower. We did not detect Salmonella either by culture or by PCR methods in any sample, and Escherichia coli was only found in five samples. Enterobacteriaceae were frequently found (70.9% of the samples), but most of them belonged to species of probable environmental origin. Aerobic sporulated bacteria were also common, but only three samples contained Bacillus cereus at low levels (<200 CFU g(-1)). Clostridium perfringens counts were also very low, with only one sample reaching >100 CFU g(-1), an acceptable value. Overall, microbial contamination in saffron was markedly lower than it was in other spices.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) fruits from different regions.
AB  - Structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) obtained from different regions (Germany, India, and Turkey). The main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. It was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. The highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from Turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from Germany and India was higher than that of Kefe cumin fruits obtained from Turkey. The fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris (FMC 1), Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus (FMC 19), Aeromonas hydrophila (ATCC 7965), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 15753), Klebsiella pneumoniae (FMC 5), Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes (CCM 2531) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.
TI  - In vitro effects on bacterial growth of phenoloxidase reaction products.
AB  - An active phenoloxidase preparation from the freshwater crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus exhibited a strong antibacterial effect in vitro on the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae whereas a weaker but still significant effect against Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. In most cases reduction of bacterial growth was stronger when dopamine was used as substrate as compared to L-dopa. The effect on bacteria was abolished if no substrate was available for the phenoloxidase or in the presence of the phenoloxidase inhibitor phenylthiourea.
TI  - Expression of recombinant antibacterial lactoferricin-related peptides from Pichia pastoris expression system.
AB  - Four recombinant antimicrobial peptide (rAMP) cDNAs, constructed from two goat lactoferricin-related peptide cDNAs (GLFcin and GLFcin II) with/without (His)(6)-Tag, were cloned into pPICZalphaC and transformed into Pichia pastoris SMD1168H. After methanol induction, these rAMPs were expressed and secreted into broth. They were purified after CM-Sepharose (without His-tg), HisTrap (with His-tg) and Sephadex G-25 chromatographies. The yield of purified rAMP was 0.15 mg/mL of broth. These 4 rAMPs were thermal-stable and with high antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli BCRC 11549, Pseudomonas aeruginosa BCRC 12450, Bacillus cereus BCRC 10603, Staphylococcus aureus BCRC 25923, Propioni bacterium acnes BCRC 10723, and Listera monocytogenes BCRC 14845. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of rAMPs against these indicators ranged from 4.07 to 16.00 mg/mL.
TI  - Study on the antibiotic activity of microcapsule curcumin against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Curcumin as an edible natural pigment has several biological activities but its use as a food colorant and preservative is restricted due to low stability and insolubility in water. Stabilizing it with microencapsulation to obtain microcapsule curcumin can improve its stability and solubility. The microcapsule curcumin was studied for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against some foodborne pathogens and spoilage microbe such as Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Aspergillus niger, Penicllium notatum, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It exhibited broad spectrum inhibitory effect against all organisms by Oxford cup methods, and its minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by agar dilution method and ranged from 15.7 to 250 microg/mL. For the selected microorganisms, its antibacterial activity was more pronounced against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, its antifungal activity is much better than antibacterial activity. Microcapsule curcumin remains in antibacterial and antifungal activities after microencapsulation, which can be potential colorant and preservative in food industry.
TI  - Examination of electron stains as a substitute for uranyl acetate for the ultrathin sections of bacterial cells.
AB  - Electron staining reagents were examined to find a possible substitute for uranyl acetate (UA) in electron microscopy of bacterial ultrathin sections. Four kinds of stains, platinum blue (Pt-blue), oolong tea extract (OTE), potassium permanganate (KMnO(4)) and phosphotungstic acid (PTA), were examined in comparison with UA either with or without post-staining with lead citrate (Pb). Electron microscopy was performed on sections from Spurr-embedded cells of a Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus cereus NBRC 13597, and a Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli NBRC 3301. Both Pt-blue and OTE showed staining similar to each other and to that of double staining with UA and Pb in B. cereus, while in E. coli the cytoplasmic membrane appeared less dense when compared with UA and Pb. KMnO(4) stained excessively to some extent, but showed images of the best contrast in the cytoplasmic membrane comparable with UA and Pb among the four reagents. PTA could stain the peptidoglycan layer but gave images of low quality for both bacteria. This study demonstrated that none of the reagents examined showed staining results of the same quality or better than the conventional method with UA and Pb. However, stains of Pt-blue, OTE and KMnO(4) could possibly be an alternative candidate for the UA according to the structure in question.
TI  - Effect of bile salts on the DNA and membrane integrity of enteric bacteria.
AB  - Enteric bacteria are able to resist the high concentrations of bile encountered throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Here we review the current mechanisms identified in the enteric bacteria Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes to resist the dangerous effects of bile. We describe the role of membrane transport systems, and their connection with DNA repair pathways, in conferring bile resistance to these enterics. We discuss the findings from recent investigations that indicate bile tolerance is dependent upon being able to resist the detergent properties of bile at both the membrane and DNA level.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial peptides as novel bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A single cost-effective pathogen inactivation approach would help to  improve the safety of our nation's blood supply. Several methods and technologies are currently being studied to help reduce bacterial contamination of blood components. There is clearly need for simple and easy-to-use pathogen inactivation techniques specific to plasma, platelets (PLTs), and red blood cells. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this report, we introduce a novel proof of concept: using known therapeutic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored PLT concentrates (PCs). Nine synthetic AMPs, four from PLT microbicidal protein-derived peptides (PD1-4) and five Arg-Trp (RW) repeat peptides containing one to five repeats, were tested for bactericidal activity in plasma and PC samples spiked with Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacillus cereus. A 3-log reduction of viable bacteria was considered as the bactericidal activity of a given peptide. RESULTS: In both plasma alone and PCs, RW3 peptide demonstrated bactericidal activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae; PD4 and RW2 against P. aeruginosa; and RW4 against K. pneumoniae. The activity of each of these four peptides against the remaining bacterial species in the test panel resulted in less than a 3-log reduction in the number of viable bacteria and hence considered ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a new approach to improving the safety of blood components, demonstrating the potential usefulness of screening therapeutic AMPs against selected bacteria to identify suitable bactericidal agents for stored plasma, PCs, and other blood products.
TI  - Volatile constituents and antibacterial screening of the essential oil of Chenopodium ambrosioides L. growing in Nigeria.
AB  - The essential oil of the aerial parts of Chenopodium ambrosioides L. has been isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed using GC-MS. The major components were found to be alpha-terpinene (63.1%), p-cymene (26.4%) and ascaridole (3.9%). The oil displayed no antibacterial activity against either Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus or Staphylococcus aureus, or the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli (MIC=1250 microg/mL). A cluster analysis of C. ambrosioides essential oils reveals at least seven distinct chemotypes: ascaridole, alpha-terpinene, alpha-pinene, p-cymene, carvacrol, alpha-terpinyl acetate, and limonene.
TI  - Effect of mixed antimicrobial agents and flavors in active packaging films.
AB  - Active packaging is an emerging food technology to improve the quality and safety of food products. Many works have been developed to study the antimicrobial activity of essential oils. Essential oils have been traditionally used as flavorings in food, so they have an important odor impact but they have as well antimicrobial properties that could be used to protect the food. Recent developments in antimicrobial active packaging showed the efficiency of essential oils versus bread and bakery products among other applications. However, one of the main problems to face is the odor and taste they could provide to the packaged food. Using some aromas to mask the odor could be a good approach. That is why the main objective of this paper is to develop an antimicrobial packaging material based on the combination of the most active compounds of essential oils (hydrocinnamaldehyde, oregano essential oil, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol) together with some aromas commonly used in the food industry. A study of the concentration required to get the antimicrobial properties, the organoleptic compatibility with typical aroma present in many food systems (vanilla, banana, and strawberry), and the right combination of both systems has been carried out. Antimicrobial tests of both the mentioned aromas, the main components of some essential oils, and the combination of both groups were carried out against bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella choleraesuis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli), yeasts (Candida albicans, Debaryomyces hansenii, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii), and molds (Botrytis cinerae, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium roqueforti, Eurotium repens, Penicillium islandicum, Penicillium commune, Penicillium nalgiovensis). The sensory properties of the combinations were evaluated with a triangular test and classification was by an order test; the odor threshold of the aroma compounds was also studied. The results reveal that none of the aromas had antimicrobial properties. The most antimicrobial compounds are thymol, carvacrol, and cinnamaldehyde, but none of them could be combined with banana aroma, whereas only thymol with strawberry aroma gave the right combined organoleptic profile. All of the antimicrobials under study could be combined with vanilla aroma, providing both antimicrobial property and the odor expected.
TI  - Growth and gaseous emissions of pure and mixed small intestinal bacterial cultures: Effects of bile and vancomycin.
AB  - Simultaneous cultivations in anaerobiosis, aerobiosis and with microaerobic gas mixture were used to clarify the bile (oxgall) effects on the pure and mixed cultures of enterobacterial strains in simulations in Portable Microbe Enrichment Unit (PMEU) linked with ChemPro100i((R)) gas detector. The effects of vancomycin were evaluated in aerobic cultures. Growth and metabolic activity of cultures were also followed by measuring sugar consumption, pH alterations, and colony counts on BD CHROMagar Orientation plates. Results showed that the two fermentatively different strains of facultative anaerobes, Escherichia coli E 17 and Klebsiella mobilis ATCC 13048 grew in balance regardless of oxygen level, bile acid concentration or other components of the mixed cultures, Bacillus cereus or Staphylococcus aureus. When the evaporations of the mixed cultures of E. coli, K. mobilis and S. aureus were compared with the emissions of the corresponding pure cultures by ChemPro100i((R)) gas sensing detector, the pure cultures of bile resistant E. coli and K. mobilis produced more gaseous components than the mixed culture indicating that these organisms cooperate and use the substrate more effectively together than separately. A survey of the aseptic bacterial isolations from the bile tract in a big University Hospital, (Salzburg, Austria) during 3 years, showed that these bacterial groups dominated. Only 13.24% of the 287 patient samples were sterile, and around 180 strains of both E. coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter groups were found amongst 973 isolates from 249 patients (together 35.57%). Enterococcus sp. accounted for 246 isolates being the largest group of strains (24.25% of all the isolates). In anaerobiosis it was shown that Klebsiella neutralized the acids produced in the mixed acid fermentation of the E. coli. The ethanol produced from both groups evaporated in the gas stream of the PMEU culturing step and its formation also removes excess acidity from the cultures. The synergistic behaviour and symbiotic function between E. coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter strains is suggested.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts of seaweeds against fish bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Crude extracts were prepared using the solvent ethanol from the seaweeds viz., Gracilaria edulis, Calorpha peltada and Hydroclothres sp. and screening for their antibacterial activity against six bacterial pathogens were also carried out. The test bacterial strains were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus. Ethanol extract of Gracilaria edulis inhibited growth of all the test organisms except Bacillus cereus and Enterobacter aerogenes. Seaweed extract of Calorpha peltada was found effective against a number of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. Hydroclothres sp. extract inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa only out of the six tested pathogens.
TI  - Survey of bacterial populations present in US-produced linerboard with high recycle content.
AB  - AIMS: To survey paperboard products from 17 US mills for bacterial populations and for bacteria potentially harmful to human health. METHODS AND RESULTS: Culturable aerobic bacteria were isolated from paperboard products using selective and nonselective medium. Resulting colonies from samples from three regions of the United States were identified using fatty acid methyl ester analysis. Percentages of bacteria species found were Bacillus megaterium (47), Bacillus licheniformis (15), Bacillus pumilus (12), Paenibacillus macerans (5), Paenibacillus pabuli (3), Bacillus subtilis (2), Bacillus cereus (2), Bacillus coagulans (1), Bacillus circulans (1), Bacillus brevis (1), Bacillus thuringiensis (1), Paenibacillus polymyxa (1), Cellulomonas turbata (1), Cellulomonas flavigena (1), unidentified Bacillus sp. (3) and unidentified bacteria (1). CONCLUSIONS: Recycled paperboard contained high populations of bacteria, and a positive correlation was found between recycle content and bacterial populations. Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella or confirmed coliform bacteria were not found in any product. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Populations of bacteria did not differ significantly from original counts over a 4-month period of dry storage, indicating that bacteria persist in paperboard over long periods and may re-enter the recycling process. The predominance of heat-tolerant endospore-forming bacteria explains the high bacteria counts found in paperboard made from recycled materials.
TI  - Detection of Enterobacter sakazakii and other pathogens associated with infant formula powder by use of a DNA microarray.
AB  - Pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (PIF). An obstacle associated with PIF microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. We have developed a rapid, DNA microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with PIF contamination based on the 16S-23S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences and wzy (O antigen polymerase) gene. Using this procedure, Enterobacter sakazakii, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli O157 were identified. One hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). Twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic DNA or 10(4) CFU/ml). Twenty-one real PIF samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. The data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.
TI  - Mechanisms of catalysis and inhibition operative in the arginine deiminase from the human pathogen Giardia lamblia.
AB  - Giardia lamblia arginine deiminase (GlAD), the topic of this paper, belongs to the hydrolase branch of the guanidine-modifying enzyme superfamily, whose members employ Cys-mediated nucleophilic catalysis to promote deimination of l-arginine and its naturally occurring derivatives. G. lamblia is the causative agent in the human disease giardiasis. The results of RNAi/antisense RNA gene-silencing studies reported herein indicate that GlAD is essential for G. lamblia trophozoite survival and thus, a potential target for the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of giardiasis. The homodimeric recombinant protein was prepared in Escherichia coli for in-depth biochemical characterization. The 2-domain GlAD monomer consists of a N-terminal domain that shares an active site structure (depicted by an insilico model) and kinetic properties (determined by steady-state and transient state kinetic analysis) with its bacterial AD counterparts, and a C-terminal domain of unknown fold and function. GlAD was found to be active over a wide pH range and to accept l-arginine, l-arginine ethyl ester, N(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine, and N(omega)-amino-l-arginine as substrates but not agmatine, l-homoarginine, N(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester or a variety of arginine-containing peptides. The intermediacy of a Cys424-alkylthiouronium ion covalent enzyme adduct was demonstrated and the rate constants for formation (k(1)=80s(-1)) and hydrolysis (k(2)=35s(-1)) of the intermediate were determined. The comparatively lower value of the steady-state rate constant (k(cat)=2.6s(-1)), suggests that a step following citrulline formation is rate-limiting. Inhibition of GlAD using Cys directed agents was briefly explored. S-Nitroso-l-homocysteine was shown to be an active site directed, irreversible inhibitor whereas N(omega)-cyano-l-arginine did not inhibit GlAD but instead proved to be an active site directed, irreversible inhibitor of the Bacillus cereus AD.
TI  - Differentiation of whole bacterial cells based on high-throughput microarray chip printing and infrared microspectroscopic readout.
AB  - Using robotic automation, a microarray printing protocol for whole bacterial cells was developed for subsequent label-free and nondestructive infrared microspectroscopic detection. Using this contact microspotting system, 24 microorganisms were printed on zinc selenide slides; these were 6 species of Listeria, 10 species of Vibrio, 2 strains of Photobacterium damselae, Yersinia enterocolitica 289, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14529, Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 19075 (serotype 104 B), Shigella sonnei 20143, Klebsiella pneumoniae KP73, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii 200, and Escherichia coli. Microarrays consisting of separate spots of bacterial deposits gave consistent and reproducible infrared spectra, which were differentiated by unsupervised pattern recognition algorithms. Two multivariate analysis algorithms, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, successfully separated most, but not all, the bacteria investigated down to the species level.
TI  - Antimicrobial, mechanical, and barrier properties of cassava starch-chitosan films incorporated with oregano essential oil.
AB  - The physicochemical and antimicrobial properties of starch-chitosan films incorporated with oregano essential oil (OEO) have been investigated. The antimicrobial effects of starch-chitosan-OEO films against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined by the disk inhibition zone method. The film mechanical properties, water vapor permeability (WVP), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), and thermograms (TGA) were also determined. Films added with OEO effectively inhibited the four microorganisms tested and demonstrated improved barrier properties. The presence of OEO in starch-chitosan films led to the formation of more flexible films. Chitosan was not effective against the tested organisms, but it decreased film rigidity and WVP. TGA analysis demonstrated that the addition of chitosan and OEO did not affect the thermal stability of the films.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties.
AB  - A series of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties were synthesized starting from 5-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thioles 3a-c, X=H, Cl, Br. Thus, alkylation of 1,2,4-triazoles 3 with phenacyl bromide or 4-bromophenacyl bromide afforded S-substituted 1,2,4-triazoles 4, 5. These new intermediates 4 and 5, in the presence of H(2)SO(4) (c), were cyclized to 2-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-(4-Y-phenyl)[1,3]thiazolo[3,2-b]-[1,2,4]-triaz oles 6, 7 (I) and not to isomeric thiazolo[2,3-c][1,2,4]-triazoles 6, 7 (II). The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H, (13)C NMR and elemental analysis. MS spectra confirmed the formation of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole 6, 7 (forms I) in detriment of [2,3-c] isomeric compounds (forms II). The potential antibacterial effects of the synthesized compounds were investigated using standard bacterial strains: Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, Citrobacter freundii ATCC 8090, Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579.
TI  - Simultaneous identification of seven foodborne pathogens and Escherichia coli (pathogenic and nonpathogenic) using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism coupled with multiplex PCR.
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a novel technique for parallel analysis of eight important foodborne microbes using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (CE-SSCP) coupled with multiplex PCR. Specific primers for multiplex PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene were designed, corresponding to eight species of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, for the species-specific identification and optimal separation of their PCR products in subsequent analysis by CE-SSCP. Multiplex PCR conditions including annealing temperature, extension time, the number of PCR cycles, and primer concentrations were then optimized for simultaneous detection of all target foodborne bacteria. The diagnostic system using CE-SSCP combined with multiplex PCR developed here can be used for rapid investigation of causative agents of foodborne illness. The simplicity and high sensitivity of the method may lead to improved management of safety and illness related to food.
TI  - Broad range evaluation of the matrix solubilization (matrix lysis) strategy for direct enumeration of foodborne pathogens by nucleic acids technologies.
AB  - A previously published rapid (<5 h) proof-of-concept protocol for the concentration of the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes from milk, based on the solubilization of the food matrix, was further evaluated. The original protocol was modified to detect gram-negative and other gram-positive bacteria and to broaden the range of food matrices by using Lutensol instead of sodium dodecyl sulfate as the main detergent in the buffer. A new protocol using a protease and sucrose buffer was established for the analysis of meat and fish. Matrix lysis was used for dairy products, ice cream, milk, fish, meat, eggs, and blood. Solubilization of the foodstuffs resulted in bacterial pellets of reasonable size for further quantification. Using L. monocytogenes, Staphylococccus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella Typhimurium as model organisms, microscopic analysis of the remaining bacterial pellets revealed that the recovered bacteria remained physically intact, albeit their viability was compromised. In model experiments using free DNA, the free target DNA was reduced by 5 log units. The compatibility of matrix lysis with subsequent real-time PCR analysis has been demonstrated with salmon, chicken, egg, ice cream, cheese, and blood samples that were artificially contaminated with L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and Salmonella Typhimurium. These experiments resulted in an average recovery of 48.7% (relative standard error, 83.4%) of the inoculated bacterial cells with the real-time PCR assay. The average detection limit of the method was 7.3 CFU/ml for all examined foodstuffs and bacterial target organisms.
TI  - Pharmacognostic, Phytochemical and Anti-microbial studies of Solanum indicum leaves.
AB  - The leaves of Solanum indicum showed the presence of stellate trichome. Ethanolic extract of leaves Solanum indicum showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli where as chloroform extract, acetone extract and ethanol showed anti bacterial against pseudomonas. The aqueous extract did not show any anti microbial activity towards the tested organism. None of the extract showed anti fungal activity.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of Bacillus P450 monooxygenases and evaluation of their activity towards steroids.
AB  - Cytochrome P450 (P450) open reading frames (ORFs) identified in genome sequences  of Bacillus species are potential resources for new oxidation biocatalysts. Phylogenetic analysis of 29 Bacillus P450 ORFs revealed that the P450s consist of a limited number of P450 families, CYP102, CYP106, CYP107, CYP109, CYP134, CYP152, and CYP197. Previously, we identified the catalytic activities of three P450s of Bacillus subtilis towards steroids by rapid substrate screening using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR/MS). Here, we further applied this method to evaluate the activity of Bacillus cereus P450s towards steroids. Five P450 genes were cloned from B. cereus ATCC 10987 based on its genomic sequence and were expressed in Escherichia coli. These P450s were reacted with a mixture of 30 compounds that mainly included steroids, and the reaction mixtures were analyzed using FT-ICR/MS. We found that BCE_2659 (CYP106) catalyzed the monooxygenation of methyltestosterone, progesterone, 11-ketoprogesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and chlormadinone acetate. BCE_2654 (CYP107) monooxygenated testosterone enanthate, and BCE_3250 (CYP109) monooxygenated testosterone and compactin. Based on the phylogenetic relationship and the known substrate specificities including ones identified in this study, we discuss the catalytic potential of Bacillus P450s towards steroids.
TI  - Infections in patients with aplastic anemia.
AB  - Infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (AA). There  are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with AA and the patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in the infections that they incur. Prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. Recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. The most common invasive mycoses include the Aspergillus species, Zygomycetes, Candida spp., and Fusarium spp. Bacterial infections that are seen in patients with AA include gram-positive coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, Enterococcus, Staphylococus aureus, Clostridium spp., Micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus. Gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumonia, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio vulnificus. Viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the Herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides A, B, and C. Evidence of the parasite Strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. This review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with AA who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. The specific immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, antimicrobial activity and structure-activity relationships of new aryldisulfonamides.
AB  - A series of aromatic disulfonamide (1-8) derivatives and 4-methylbenzenesulfonyl  hydrazide (9) were synthesized and characterized. All compounds were evaluated in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25953, Bacillus cereus ATCC 6633, Bacillus magaterium RSKK 5117, Escherichia coli ATCC 11230, Salmonella enterititis ATCC 13076 by microdilution and disc diffusion methods. Antimicrobial activity of the aromatic disulfonamides decreased as the length of the carbon chain increased. An analysis of the structure- activity relationship (SAR) along with computational studies showed that the most active compound (9) possessed low lipophilicity (AlogP=0.59) and high solubility (logS = -1.33).
TI  - Screening of some Kenyan medicinal plants for antibacterial activity.
AB  - Eleven medicinal plants used by traditional healers in Machakos and Kitui District were screened, namely: Ajuga remota Benth, Aloe secundiflora Engl, Amaranthus hybridus L, Cassia didymobotrya Fes, Croton macrostachyus Del, Entada leptostachya Harms, Erythrina abyssinica DC, Harrisonia abyssinica Oliv, Schkuhria pinnata O. Ktze, Terminalia kilimandscharica Engl and Ziziphus abyssinica Hochst for potential antibacterial activity against four medically important bacterial strains, namely: Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Micrococcus lutea ATCC 9341 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. The antibacterial activity of methanol extracts was determined as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The plant extracts were more active against Gram-positive (G+) than Gram-negative (G-) bacteria. The positive controls were streptomycin and benzylpenicillin for G- and G+ bacteria, respectively, both had a significant MIC at <1 mg/mL. The most susceptible bacteria were B. cereus, followed by M. lutea, while the most resistant bacteria were Ps. aeruginosa, followed by E. coli. The present study supports the use of these plants by the herbalists in the management of bacterial ailments. H. abyssinica and T. kilimandscharica showed the best antibacterial activity; hence these plants can be further subjected to phytochemical and pharmacological evaluation.
TI  - Assessment of the microbiological safety of salad vegetables and sauces from kebab take-away restaurants in the United Kingdom.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish the microbiological safety of salad vegetables and sauces served in kebab take-away restaurants. Comparison with published microbiological guidelines revealed that 4.7% of 1213 salad vegetable samples were of unsatisfactory microbiological quality due to Escherichia coli and/or Staphylococcus aureus levels at > or =10(2) cfu g(-1). Another 0.3% of salad samples were of unacceptable quality due to S. aureus at > or =10(4) cfu g(-1) (2 samples) or the presence of Salmonella Kentucky (1 sample). Cucumber was the most contaminated salad vegetable with regards to unsatisfactory levels of E. coli (6.0%) or S. aureus (4.5%). Five percent of 1208 sauce samples were of unsatisfactory microbiological quality due to E. coli, S. aureus at > or =10(2) cfu g(-1) and/or Bacillus cereus and other Bacillus spp. at > or =10(4) cfu g(-1). A further 0.6% of sauce samples were of unacceptable quality due to Bacillus spp. (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus licheniformis) at > or =10(5) cfu g(-1) or the presence of Salmonella Agbeni (1 sample). More samples of chili sauce (8.7%) were of unsatisfactory or unacceptable microbiological quality than any other sauce types. The results emphasize the need for good hygiene practices in kebab take-away restaurants handling these types of ready-to-eat products.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of commercial green tea and rosemary leaf powders on the growth of foodborne pathogens in laboratory media and oriental-style rice cakes.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of green tea and rosemary added to foods as antagonists to foodborne pathogens were determined in laboratory media and oriental-style rice cakes. The growth of each pathogen (Bacillus cereus, Salmonella Typhimurium, Enterobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes) in tryptic soy broth or rice cake with or without addition of green tea or rosemary leaf powders before autoclaving or cooking, respectively, was investigated after inoculation. The addition of 1% green tea or rosemary produced similar results for inhibiting the growth of pathogens in tryptic soy broth. However, green tea was more effective than rosemary for inhibiting the growth of L. monocytogenes. Both botanicals had inhibitory effects against all pathogens tested in this study. Green tea was particularly effective against B. cereus, S. aureus, and L. monocytogenes, and rosemary was strongly inhibitory against B. cereus and S. aureus. The addition of 1 or 3% green tea or rosemary to rice cakes did not significantly reduce total aerobic counts; however, levels of B. cereus and S. aureus were significantly reduced in rice cakes stored for 3 days at room temperature (22 degrees C). The order of antimicrobial activities against B. cereus in rice cake was 1% rosemary < 1% green tea < 3% rosemary = 3% green tea. These results indicate that the use of natural plant materials such as green tea and rosemary could improve the microbial quality of foods in addition to their functional properties.
TI  - A new minimal replicon of Bacillus anthracis plasmid pXO1.
AB  - An 8,883-bp mini-pXO1 plasmid containing a replicon from Bacillus anthracis pXO1  (181.6 kb) was identified by making large deletions in the original plasmid using a newly developed Cre-loxP system. Portions of the truncated mini-pXO1 were cloned into an Escherichia coli vector unable to replicate in B. anthracis. A 5.95-kb region encompassing three putative genes was identified as the minimal pXO1 fragment required for replication of the resulting recombinant shuttle plasmid (named pMR) in B. anthracis. Deletion analysis showed that the only genes essential for replication were the pXO1-14 and pXO1-16 genes, which are transcribed in opposite directions and encode predicted proteins of 66.5 and 67.1 kDa, respectively. The ORF14 protein contains a helix-turn-helix motif, while the ORF16 upstream region contains attributes of a theta-replicating plasmid origin of replication (Ori), namely, an exclusively A+T-containing segment, five 9-bp direct repeats, an inverted repeat, and a sigma(A)-dependent promoter for the putative replication initiator Rep protein (ORF16). Spontaneous mutations generated in the ORF14, ORF16, and Ori regions of pMR during PCR amplification produced a temperature-sensitive plasmid that is unable to replicate in B. anthracis at 37 degrees C. The efficacy of transformation of plasmid-free B. anthracis Ames and Sterne strains by the original pMR was approximately 10(3) CFU/microg, while Bacillus cereus strains 569 and ATCC 10987 were transformed with efficiencies of 10(4) and 10(2) CFU/microg, respectively. Around 95% of B. anthracis cells retained pMR after one round of sporulation and germination.
TI  - Antiplasmid activity of 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate from Alpinia galanga against multi-drug resistant bacteria.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alpinia galanga (L.) Swartz is traditionally used in the treatment of various ailments across India, China, and Southeast Asian countries. In India it is a reputed drug in indigenous system of medicine and largely used as antibacterial and antiseptic. In southern India the rhizomes has been used as a domestic remedy against bacterial infections. AIM OF THE STUDY: To identify a potential antiplasmid compound from Alpinia galanga against multi-drug resistant bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The crude rhizome extract of Alpinia galanga was prepared in acetone. Antibacterial activity was checked by MIC and antiplasmid activity was checked by SIC. The principal compound responsible for the antiplasmid activity, in the crude extract, was identified by bioassay guided fractionation using hexane-acetone. Antibiotic resistance profile of plasmid harboring strains and plasmid cured strains was determined by disc diffusion method. RESULTS: The crude acetone extract of the rhizomes of Alpinia galanga exhibited antiplasmid activity against Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis with an efficiency of 92%, 82% and 8% respectively at 400 microg/ml SIC. The principal compound responsible for the activity was identified as 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate. 1'-Acetoxychavicol acetate demonstrated the ability to cure plasmid encoded antibiotic resistance in various multi-drug resistant bacterial strains of clinical isolates such as Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus with curing efficiency of 66%, 75%, 70%, 32% and 6% respectively at SIC of 400-800 microg/ml. CONCLUSION: 1'-Acetoxychavicol acetate mediated R-plasmid curing significantly reduced the minimal inhibitory concentration of antibiotics required to inhibit growth of bacteria, thus making the antibiotic treatment more effective.
TI  - Rapid detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples by an improved reverse dot blot method.
AB  - AIM: To develop a new, rapid and accurate reverse dot blot (RDB) method for the detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples. METHODS: The 12 intestinal pathogens tested were Salmonella spp., Brucella spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The two universal primers were designed to amplify two variable regions of bacterial 16S and 23S rDNA genes from all of the 12 bacterial species tested. Five hundred and forty fecal samples from the diarrhea patients were detected using the improved RDB assay. RESULTS: The methods could identify the 12 intestinal pathogens specifically, and the detection limit was as low as 103 CFUs. The consistent detection rate of the improved RDB assay compared with the traditional culture method was up to 88.75%. CONCLUSION: The hybridization results indicated that the improved RDB assay developed was a reliable method for the detection of intestinal pathogen in fecal samples.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a protective bacterial culture isolated from honey active against American Foulbrood disease.
AB  - Bacterial strains isolated from US domestic honey were screened for antibacterial activity against Paenibacillus larvae ssp. larvae, the causative agent of American Foulbrood (AFB) in apiaries. A bacterial isolate (TH13) showing a high level of antimicrobial activity against P. larvae ssp. larvae ATCC 9545 was selected and identified as Paenibacillus polymyxa by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The antimicrobial compound was purified by 80% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by CM-sepharose chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. The molecular mass of the compound was determined to be 1168.78 Da by ESI-qTOF MS, matching that of polymyxin E1. The producer strain showed a broad range of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria including P. larvae ssp. larvae ATCC 25747 and foodborne pathogens such as Bacillus cereus F4552 and Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC 43895. The selection of antibiotic-producing bacterial strains indigenous to honey as protective cultures against AFB may lessen the use of antibiotics in apiaries.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of benzophenones and extracts from the fruits of Garcinia  brasiliensis.
AB  - The pericarp and seeds from fruits of Garcinia brasiliensis were subjected to extraction with hexane and ethanol. The pericarp hexane extract (PHE) and seed ethanol extract (SEE) were purified by silica gel column chromatography, which permitted isolation of the prenylated benzophenones 7-epiclusianone (1) and guttiferone-A (2), respectively. The antimicrobial activity of PHE, SEE, and compounds 1 and 2 were evaluated against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus cereus cultures. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were established. The substances presented activity against S. aureus and B. cereus as follows: PHE, 4.0 microg/mL and 2.4 microg/mL; SEE, 10.0 microg/mL and 12.6 microg/mL; 7-epiclusianone, 1.2 microg/mL and 0.6 microg/mL; and guttiferone-A, 2.4 microg/mL and 2.4 microg/mL, respectively. The direct relationship between the lipophilic character of the structure and activity in Gram-positive bacteria was specifically observed. Therefore these extracts and prenylated benzophenones represent an interesting topic for further studies and open possibilities for an alternative control of diseases associated with Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the methanolic extract and compounds from Morus mesozygia stem bark.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was aimed at investigating the antimicrobial activity of the methanolic extract (MMB) and compounds isolated from the stem bark of Morus mesozygia, namely 3beta-acetoxyurs-12-en-11-one (1), moracin Q (2), moracin T (3), artocarpesin (4), cycloartocarpesin (5), moracin R (6), moracin U (8), moracin C (9), and moracin M (10). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The liquid microdilution assay was used in the determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal microbicidal concentration (MMC), against nine bacterial and two fungal species. RESULTS: The results of the MIC determination showed that the compounds 3, 4, 8 and 9 were able to prevent the growth of all tested microbial species. All other samples showed selective activities. Their inhibitory effects were noted on 90.9% studied organisms for the crude extract, 81.8% for compound 6, 72.7% for compound 10, 63.6% for compound 1, 54.5% for compound 5, and 45.5% for compound 2. The lowest MIC value of 39 microg/ml was obtained with the crude extract against Escherichia coli. The corresponding value for compounds (5 microg/ml) was registered with compound 9 on Shigella dysenteriae and compound 3 on E. coli, S. dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Bacillus cereus. The lowest MIC value (39 microg/ml) observed with the crude extract (on E. coli) was only eightfold greater than that of gentamycin used as reference antibiotic (RA) while the corresponding value (5 microg/ml) recorded with compounds 3 and 9 was equal to that of RA on the corresponding microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results highlighted the interesting antimicrobial potency of M. mesozygia as well as that of the studied compounds, and provided scientific basis for the traditional use of this species.
TI  - Interventions for control of Salmonella: clearance of microbial growth from rubber picker fingers.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine if a surface material with antimicrobial properties combined with an effective disinfectant could achieve total clearance of bacterial contamination. Before beginning the project, new rubber picker fingers collected from 3 processing facilities were tested for endogenous microflora. Five species of bacteria common to soil and human handling were present: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus cereus/thuringiensis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis ssp. novobiosepticus, and Staphylococcus intermedius. In separate experiments, new (unused) rubber picker fingers from 3 manufacturers were exposed to broiler carcass rinses, and the kinetics of bacterial attachment to finger material was determined. Turbidity of the bacterial suspensions at varying dilutions containing picker finger sections was compared hourly with controls to evaluate inhibition. New rubber finger material from the 3 manufacturers significantly inhibited bacterial growth (P < 0.05), without the aid of antibacterial additives. We improved an assay for screening disinfectants against growth of pathogens and determined the activity of 5 disinfectant compounds. Two of the compounds were most effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Escherichia coli, and one of the compounds was selected for further study with Salmonella Enteritidis. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the levels of Salmonella Enteritidis before and after treatment. The most effective compound was nontoxic and completely cleared Salmonella Enteritidis contamination from the rubber picker finger surface.
TI  - Formation of flavone di-O-glucosides using a glycosyltransferase from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Microbial UDP-glycosyltransferases can convert many small lipophilic compounds into glycons using uridinediphosphate- activated sugars. The glycosylation of flavonoids affects solubility, stability, and bioavailability. The gene encoding the UDP-glycosyltransferase from Bacillus cereus, BcGT-3, was cloned by PCR and sequenced. BcGT-3 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) with a glutathione S-transferase tag and purified using a glutathione Stransferase affinity column. BcGT-3 was tested for activity on several substrates including genistein, kaempferol, luteolin, naringenin, and quercetin. Flavonols were the best substrates for BcGT-3. The enzyme dominantly glycosylated the 3-hydroxyl group, but the 7-hydroxyl group was glycosylated when the 3-hydroxyl group was not available. The kaempferol reaction products were identified as kaempferol-3-O-glucoside and kaempferol- 3,7-O-diglucoside. Kaempferol was the most effective substrate tested. Based on HPLC, LC/MS, and NMR analyses of the reaction products, we conclude that BcGT-3 can be used for the synthesis of kaempferol 3,7-O-diglucose.
TI  - Cloning, expression and purification of Bacillus cereus endochitinase in the Escherichia coli AD494(DE3)pLysS expression system.
AB  - A chitinase gene from Bacillus cereus was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant chitinase had much higher (128 fold) specificity to pNP-beta-(GlcNAc)(3) than to pNP-beta-(GlcNAc), suggesting endochitinase. Thirty-three amino acids in the N-terminal were recognized and cut off during expression, which consequently made the M(r) not correspond to that predicted.
TI  - Synthesis, spectral characterization, in-vitro microbiological evaluation and cytotoxic activities of novel macrocyclic bis hydrazone.
AB  - A macrocyclic hydrazone Schiff base was synthesized by reacting 1,4-dicarbonyl phenyl dihydrazide with 2,6-diformyl-4-methyl phenol and a series of metal complexes with this new Schiff base were synthesized by reaction with Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) metal salts. The Schiff base and its complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, IR, (1)H NMR, UV-vis, FAB mass, ESR spectra, fluorescence, thermal, magnetic and molar conductance data. The analytical data reveal that the Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes possess 2:1 metal-ligand ratios. All the complexes are non-electrolytes in DMF and DMSO due to their low molar conductance values. Infrared spectral data suggest that the hydrazone Schiff base behaves as a hexadentate ligand with NON NON donor sequence towards the metal ions. The ESR spectral data shows that the metal-ligand bond has considerable covalent character. The electrochemical behavior of the copper(II) complex was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. The Schiff base and its complexes have also been screened for their antibacterial (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella dysentery, Micrococcus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and antifungal activities (Aspergillus niger, Penicillium and Candida albicans) by MIC method. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties.
TI  - Microbial co-habitation and lateral gene transfer: what transposases can tell us.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Determining the habitat range for various microbes is not a simple, straightforward matter, as habitats interlace, microbes move between habitats, and microbial communities change over time. In this study, we explore an approach using the history of lateral gene transfer recorded in microbial genomes to begin to answer two key questions: where have you been and who have you been with? RESULTS: All currently sequenced microbial genomes were surveyed to identify pairs of taxa that share a transposase that is likely to have been acquired through lateral gene transfer. A microbial interaction network including almost 800 organisms was then derived from these connections. Although the majority of the connections are between closely related organisms with the same or overlapping habitat assignments, numerous examples were found of cross-habitat and cross-phylum connections. CONCLUSIONS: We present a large-scale study of the distributions of transposases across phylogeny and habitat, and find a significant correlation between habitat and transposase connections. We observed cases where phylogenetic boundaries are traversed, especially when organisms share habitats; this suggests that the potential exists for genetic material to move laterally between diverse groups via bridging connections. The results presented here also suggest that the complex dynamics of microbial ecology may be traceable in the microbial genomes.
TI  - Cloning of feather-degrading minor extracellular protease from Bacillus cereus DCUW: dissection of the structural domains.
AB  - Bacterial extracellular proteases play an important role in cell survival and cell-cell communication. A high-molecular-mass minor extracellular protease (Vpr) from a feather-degrading bacterium, Bacillus cereus DCUW, has been reported by our laboratory. In the present study, we cloned and expressed Vpr in Escherichia coli. Complete nucleotide sequencing of this gene predicted that the protease is a member of the serine protease family, and smart domain analysis revealed that the protease consists of an N-terminal signal sequence for secretion, a subtilisin_N sequence that is a signature for N-terminal processing, a catalytic S_8 peptidase domain, and finally a long C-terminal protease-associated (PA) region containing nine intrinsically disordered subdomains. Four truncated constructs of the Vpr protease were cloned and expressed in E. coli. We found that the catalytic domain (amino acid residues 172-583) is sufficient for protease activity. Maturation of the Vpr protease needed both N-terminal and C-terminal processing. We have demonstrated that the oligomerization property is associated with the C-terminal protease-associated domain and also shown that the substrate-binding specificity to raw feather resides in this domain.
TI  - Construction of a recombinant intergenus multidomain chimeric protein for simultaneous expression of haemolysin BL of Bacillus cereus, listeriolysin O of Listeria monocytogenes and enterotoxin B of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Haemolysin BL (HBL) of Bacillus cereus, listeriolysin O (LLO) of Listeria monocytogenes and enterotoxin B (SEB) of Staphylococcus aureus are among the major toxin components contributing to the pathogenicity of these organisms in foodborne illnesses. In this study, an intergenus non-toxic multidomain fusion protein (r-HLE) was generated with specificity for HBL, LLO and SEB. The fusion gene (r-hle) comprising the conserved regions of hblD and the hly and entB genes was codon-optimized for expression in Escherichia coli and encoded a 50 kDa recombinant multidomain chimeric protein (r-HLE). Hyperimmune antiserum raised against r-HLE specifically reacted with the L1 (38 kDa) component of the HBL complex of B. cereus, LLO (58 kDa) of L. monocytogenes and SEB (28 kDa) of S. aureus during Western blot analysis when tested on standard strains. During testing on isolates, the antiserum again identified the appropriate toxin molecules and was highly specific to the relevant bacterial species. The antigenicity of the SEB component of the r-HLE protein was also confirmed using a commercially available TECRA kit. The described procedure of creating a single antigenic molecule carrying components of three different toxins whilst still retaining the original antigenic determinants of individual toxins will be highly advantageous in the development of rapid, reliable and cost-effective immunoassays.
TI  - Copper(II) and uranyl(II) complexes with acylthiosemicarbazide: synthesis, characterization, antibacterial activity and effects on the growth of promyelocytic leukemia cells HL-60.
AB  - New chelates of N(1)-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-N(4)-butyl-thiosemicarbazide (X=H, Cl, Br) with Cu(2+) and UO(2)(2+) have been prepared and characterized by analytical and physico-chemical techniques such as magnetic susceptibility measurements, elemental and thermal analyses, electronic, ESR and IR spectral studies. Room temperature ESR spectra of Cu(II) complexes yield {g} values characteristic of distorted octahedral and pseudo-tetrahedral geometry. Infrared spectra indicate that complexes contain six-coordinate uranium atom with the ligand atoms arranged in an equatorial plane around the linear uranyl group. Effects of these complexes on the growth of human promyelocytic leukemia cells HL-60 and their antibacterial activity (against Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 strains) were studied comparatively with that of free ligands.
TI  - Engineered SERS substrates with multiscale signal enhancement: nanoparticle cluster arrays.
AB  - Defined nanoparticle cluster arrays (NCAs) with total lateral dimensions of up to 25.4 microm x 25.4 microm have been fabricated on top of a 10 nm thin gold film using template-guided self-assembly. This approach provides precise control of the structural parameters in the arrays, allowing a systematic variation of the average number of nanoparticles in the clusters (n) and the edge-to-edge separation (Lambda) between 1 < n < 20 and 50 nm < or = Lambda < or = 1000 nm, respectively. Investigations of the Rayleigh scattering spectra and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signal intensities as a function of n and Lambda reveal direct near-field coupling between the particles within individual clusters, whose strength increases with the cluster size (n) until it saturates at around n = 4. Our analysis shows that strong near-field interactions between individual clusters significantly affect the SERS signal enhancement for edge-to-edge separations Lambda < 200 nm. The observed dependencies of the Raman signals on n and Lambda indicate that NCAs support a multiscale signal enhancement which originates from simultaneous inter- and intracluster coupling and |E|-field enhancement. The NCAs provide strong and reproducible SERS signals not only from small molecules but also from whole bacterial cells, which enabled a rapid spectral discrimination between three tested bacteria species: Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of Dodonaea viscosa using contact bioautography technique.
AB  - The crude ethanolic extract and n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and aqueous fractions of Dodonaea viscosa were analyzed for antibacterial potential against four Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Preliminary screening showed inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The thin layer chromatograms of the fractions were then subjected to contact bioautography, which showed inhibition zone at different R(f) values against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the presence of antibacterial components. The MIC of each fraction was determined through a 96-well micro-titer plate method. The non-viability of the organisms was ascertained by determining the MBC of the fractions.
TI  - Isolation, structure elucidation and antibacterial activities of streptothricin acids.
AB  - Five streptothricin acids (compounds 1-5) were isolated by ion-exchange resin chromatography and preparative RP-HPLC from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces qinlingensis. Their structures were elucidated mainly by analyses of the IR, HR-EIS-MS and NMR spectral data. They were deduced as two known compounds, streptothricin F acid (1) and streptothricin D acid (2), and three new compounds, 12-carbamoylstreptothricin E acid (3), 12-carbamoylstreptothricin D acid (4) and N-acetyl-streptothricin D acid (5), respectively. The antibacterial activities of 1-5 against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were assayed by micro-broth dilution. Comparison of the MICs with streptothricin F and D showed that the antimicrobial activities of 1-5 were decreased significantly but varied with the structures.
TI  - Growth inhibition of pathogenic bacteria and some yeasts by selected essential oils and survival of L. monocytogenes and C. albicans in apple-carrot juice.
AB  - Food safety is a fundamental concern of both consumers and the food industry. The increasing incidence of foodborne diseases increases the demand of using antimicrobials in foods. Spices and plants are rich in essential oils and show inhibition activity against microorganisms, which are composed of many compounds. In this research, effects of garlic, bay, black pepper, origanum, orange, thyme, tea tree, mint, clove, and cumin essential oils on Listeria monocytogenes AUFE 39237, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076, Proteus mirabilis AUFE 43566, Bacillus cereus AUFE 81154, Saccharomyces uvarum UUFE 16732, Kloeckera apiculata UUFE 10628, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Candida oleophila UUPP 94365, and Metschnikowia fructicola UUPP 23067 and effects of thyme oil at a concentration of 0.5% on L. monocytogenes and C. albicans in apple-carrot juice during +4 degrees C storage (first to fifth day) were investigated. Strong antibacterial and antifungal activities of some essential oils were found. Thyme, origanum, clove, and orange essential oils were the most inhibitory against bacteria and yeasts. Cumin, tea tree, and mint oils inhibited the yeasts actively. It is concluded that some essential oils could be used as potential biopreservatives capable of controlling foodborne pathogens and food spoilage yeasts.
TI  - Characterization and identification of a novel marine Streptomyces sp. produced antibacterial substance.
AB  - Strain GB-2 is a marine microbe with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, isolated from soil taken from the coastal city Lianyungang in the JiangSu province of China. Analysis of its morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics as well as chemical components of the cell wall strongly suggested that the strain GB-2 belonged to the Streptomyces sp. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of Streptomyces sp. GB-2 strain showed a strong similarity (98%) with the 16 rRNA gene of Streptomyces fradiae. Application to antibacterial substance of strain Streptomyces sp. GB-2 by various separation steps led to isolation of one active molecule having a retention time of 9.495 min, P(9.495 min), which possessed antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Through analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and mass/mass spectrometry of the peak, the molecular weight of the antibacterial substance (P(9.495 min) sample) was 447.5 Da and it was determined to be sisomicin according to the analysis of ion fragments. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the peak also demonstrated that the antibacterial substance was sisomicin. This study is the first to introduce the finding of sisomicin produced from marine Streptomyces sp. This work provides a preference for the production of sisomicin in pharmaceutical industries and a probability for studying the biodiversity of marine microbe.
TI  - Bacterial communities of tyre monofill sites: growth on tyre shreds and leachate.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate bacterial communities of tyre monofill sites, colonization of tyre material by bacteria and the effect of tyre leachate on bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Culturable bacteria were isolated from buried tyre shreds and identified using fatty acid methyl ester analysis. Isolates belonged to taxonomic groups such as Bacilli, Actinobacteria, Clostridia, Flavobacteria, beta and gamma-proteobacteria. For tyre material colonization experiments, Bacillus megatarium, Bacillus cereus, Hydrogenophaga flava, Janthinobacterium lividum, Cellulosimicrobium cellulans, Arthrobacter globiformis (isolated from tyre shreds or leachate at the study site); Escherichia coli and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans were used. Beakers containing tyre shreds and artificial rain water were inoculated with a given bacterial culture, incubated at room temperature and sampled at regular intervals. 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining followed by epifluorescent microscopy was used to enumerate bacteria in samples. Of the bacteria tested, B. megatarium, J. lividum, E. coli, C. cellulans and A. globiformis exhibited the most extensive colonization of the tyre shreds. However, the extent of colonization varied among bacteria. Response to tyre leachate was also examined using B. cereus and J. lividum. Both bacteria increased in abundance due to the addition of leachate. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria associated with buried tyre shreds were identified and found to include typical soil and freshwater organisms. The majority of indigenous isolates grew on tyre material (or leachate) suggesting that they play an active role in the ecology of these sites and that their potential role in tyre degradation should be explored. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides information on bacterial communities of tyre-waste disposal sites, explores the interaction between tyre material and bacteria and identifies bacteria that could be involved in or employed for recycling tyre-waste.
TI  - The tubulin-like RepX protein encoded by the pXO1 plasmid forms polymers in vivo  in Bacillus anthracis.
AB  - Bacillus anthracis contains two megaplasmids, pXO1 and pXO2, that are critical for its pathogenesis. Stable inheritance of pXO1 in B. anthracis is dependent upon the tubulin/FtsZ-like RepX protein encoded by this plasmid. Previously, we have shown that RepX undergoes GTP-dependent polymerization in vitro. However, the polymerization properties and localization pattern of RepX in vivo are not known. Here, we utilize a RepX-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion to show that RepX forms foci and three distinct forms of polymeric structures in B. anthracis in vivo, namely straight, curved, and helical filaments. Polymerization of RepX-GFP as well as the nature of polymers formed were dependent upon concentration of the protein inside the B. anthracis cells. RepX predominantly localized as polymers that were parallel to the length of the cell. RepX also formed polymers in Escherichia coli in the absence of other pXO1-encoded products, showing that in vivo polymerization is an inherent property of the protein and does not require either the pXO1 plasmid or proteins unique to B. anthracis. Overexpression of RepX did not affect the cell morphology of B. anthracis cells, whereas it drastically distorted the cell morphology of E. coli host cells. We discuss the significance of our observations in view of the plasmid-specific functions that have been proposed for RepX and related proteins encoded by several megaplasmids found in members of the Bacillus cereus group of bacteria.
TI  - Synergy of Astragalus polysaccharides and probiotics (Lactobacillus and Bacillus  cereus) on immunity and intestinal microbiota in chicks.
AB  - Probiotics and Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) can modulate systemic immunity and intestinal microbiota in animals and human beings. It is still unknown if the combined application of probiotics and APS in feed has synergistic effects on immunity and intestinal microbiota. To address this issue, this study was designed to investigate the synergistic effects on immunity and intestinal microbiota in chicks. A total of 240 female Hy-Line chicks were assigned to 4 treatments. Four treatments were fed the same corn-soy meal control diet; however, treatments 2, 3, and 4 were supplemented (per kg of feed) with 220 mg of APS, 4 x 10(10) cfu probiotics, and dual treatment, respectively. Parameters evaluated included serum Newcastle disease antibody titer, peripheral blood acid alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase-positive (ANAE(+)) T-lymphocyte percentage, immune organ relative weights and histological changes, and selected intestinal tract bacteria. Compared with the control, Newcastle disease antibody titer, ANAE(+) T-lymphocyte percentage, immune organ relative weights, histological changes, as well as lactobacilli and Bacillus cereus numbers significantly increased (P <or= 0.05); however, the Escherichia coli numbers in chicks of the treatments decreased (P <or= 0.05). Interestingly, there were significant differences in ANAE(+) T-lymphocyte percentage of dual treatments compared with APS treatment (P <or= 0.05), and also in spleen index, bursa of Fabricius index, immune organ histological changes, and lactobacilli, Bacillus cereus, and E.coli numbers compared with the APS or probiotics treatments (P <or= 0.05). The results showed that probiotics combined with APS administration in feed displayed synergistic modulation effects on immunity and intestinal microbiota, which is very important for the exploration of new prebiotics.
TI  - Microbiological quality of ready-to-eat food served in schools in Wales, United Kingdom.
AB  - A survey of the general microbiological quality of ready-to-eat food served in schools was undertaken across Wales, United Kingdom. Of the 2,351 samples taken, four were identified as containing unsatisfactory counts of Escherichia coli, four contained unsatisfactory counts of Staphylococcus aureus, and one contained an unacceptable count of Bacillus cereus when compared with guidelines for the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat food published by the United Kingdom Public Health Laboratory Service in 2000. No samples contained detectable levels of Salmonella, Listeria species, or Clostridium perfringens. When compared with data on the general microbiological quality of food available in Wales, the food sampled from schools was of relatively better microbiological quality.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some macrophytes from Lake Manzalah (Egypt).
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of aqueous and organic solvents (chloroform, ethanol and methanol) extracts of four plants Ceratophyllum demersum L., Eichhornia crassipes, Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton pectinatus were tested in vitro against seventeen different microorganisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Nine of these identified organisms were obtained from different sources, Bacillus subtilis 1020, Bacillus cereus 1080, Staphylococcus aureus, Erwinia carotovora NCPPB 312, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Penicillium italicum. The other eight organisms were isolated from Manzalah lake water and identified using API 20E strip system (BioMereux). One hundred pathogenic bacterial isolates representing eight genera were identified to species level. These organisms are Escherichia coli (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Salmonella colerasuis (13%), Shigella sp. (11%), Serratia liquefaciens (10%), Proteus vulgaris (9%) and Brenneria nigrifluens (7%). The extracts of all tested plants demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the used organisms. The efficiency of the extracts varied with, solvent used in the extraction as well as plant species and the part of plant used. The aqueous extract appeared to be the highly effective extract against all tested organisms especially Fusarium oxysporum causing inhibition zone 48 +/- 0.01 mm, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 59 +/- 0.02 mm and Salmonella cholerasuis 55 +/- 0.01 mm when using P. crispus, P. pectinatus and C. demersum, respectively. Ethanol extracts of C. demersum, P. crispus and E. crassipes root showed antimicrobial activities against all tested organisms except Aspergillus niger. At the same time the extract of P. pectinatus had no effect also on Fusarium oxysporum and the extract of E. crassipes leaves have no effect on Penicillium italicum. On using chloroform extracts Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium italicum showed resistance. Comparing the effect of different plants extracts C. demersum appeared to be the most effective followed by P. pectinatus. Furthermore, the extracts of E. crassipes leaves being more effective than that, of its roots. Elemental analysis were also takes place in water and plant samples and the results revealed the presence of Mn and Pb in higher concentration in P. pectinatus (Mn 603 +/- 4.243 ppm and Pb 44 +/- 2.828 ppm), at the same time the highest values of Fe 1680 +/- 2.2 ppm, Zn 31.5 +/- 2.1 ppm and Cu 26.5 +/- 2.1 ppm were recorded for C. demersum. Comparing the two parts of E. crassipes (leaves and roots), the roots have the highest values of all studied metals.
TI  - Isolation and identification of antibacterial compounds from Thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and Dianthus caryophyllus flower buds.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The aerial parts of Thymus kotschyanus Boiss. and Hohen. (Lamiaceae) and flower buds of Dianthus caryophyllus L. (Caryophyllaceae) have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of wounds, throat and gum infections and gastro-intestinal disorder by the indigenous people of northern Iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. In this study, antibacterial compounds from both plants were isolated and characterized, and the biological activity of each compound was assessed individually and combined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Compounds were isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oils of both plants using different spectral techniques: TLC, FTIR spectra and HPLC. The minimum inhibitory concentrations MIC values for the compounds were assessed individually and combined based on a microdilution and the checkerboard method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. RESULTS: Two known compounds were isolated from the essential oils of both plants and were identified as thymol and eugenol. The isolated compounds were investigated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against seven selected pathogenic bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thymol MIC values ranged from 15.6 to 250.0 microg/ml and B. cereus was found to be the most sensitive pathogen with a MIC value of 15.6 microg/ml. Eugenol achieved stronger MIC values against most tested pathogens and the best MIC value (15.6 microg/ml) was observed against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes and K. pneumoniae whereas, S. aureus, P. mirabilis and E. coli were inhibited with a MIC value of 31.2 microg/ml. Combination results had antibacterial enhancement against most pathogens and the best synergistic result was seen against P. mirabilis and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of two antibacterial compounds from Thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and Dianthus caryophyllus flower buds validates the use of these species in the treatment of throat and gum infections, wound-healing and gastro-intestinal disorder.
TI  - [Modification of bacterial population structure on anti-lysozyme activity under the influence of hexylresorcinol].
AB  - AIM: To investigate the modifying effect of hexylresorcinol chemical analog on anti-lysozyme activity of bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Influence of hexylresorcinol on anti-lysozyme activity (ALA) of bacteriawas studied on the examples of such strains as Bacillus cereus 279, Klebsiella pneumoniae 278, Escherichia coli 101, which are able to inactivate lysozyme. As a chemical analog of microbial regulators, C6-alkyloxybenzol (C6-AOB) was used, which was introduced in growth medium containing microorganisms, which than were cultivated until entering in the stationary growth phase. Isolation of clones was carried out by seeding the 24-hours broth culture on solid growth medium followed by measurement of ALA with photometric method. RESULTS: Modifying effect of chemical analog of extracellular microbial regulators (C6-AOB) on population structure of bacteria on the sign of anti-lysozyme activity was revealed. Maximal effect was observed at C6-AOB concentrations 1 and 10 mcg/ml. Clonal redistribution on ALA manifested by decrease of proportion of clones with high and intermediate values of ALA and increase of proportion of clones with low ALA or its absence. CONCLUSION: Obtained data are perspective for development of measures for control of persisting pathogenic microorganisms by modification of persistence factors with microbial autoregulators.
TI  - Spontaneous fermentation of traditional sago starch in Papua New Guinea.
AB  - Sago starch is an important dietary carbohydrate in lowland Papua New Guinea (PNG). An investigation was conducted to determine whether microbes play a role in its preservation using traditional methods. In 12 stored sago samples collected from PNG villages, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were present (> or = 3.6 x 10(4)cfu/g) and pH ranged from 6.8 to 4.2. Acetic and propionic acids were detected in all samples, while butyric, lactic and valeric acids were present in six or more. In freshly prepared sago, held in sealed containers in the laboratory at 30 degrees C, spontaneous fermentation by endogenous microflora of sago starch was observed. This was evident by increasing concentrations of acetic, butyric and lactic acids over 4 weeks, and pH reducing from 4.9 to 3.1: both LAB and yeasts were involved. Survival of potential bacterial pathogens was monitored by seeding sago starch with approximately 10(4)/g of selected organisms. Numbers of Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus fell to < 30/g within 7 days. Salmonella sp. was present only in low numbers after 7 days (< 36/g), but Escherichia coli was still detectable after three weeks (> 10(2)/g). Fermentation appeared to increase the storability and safety of the product.
TI  - Construction of an Escherichia coli to Bacillus thuringiensis shuttle vector for  large DNA fragments.
AB  - Shuttle vectors for Bacillus thuringiensis or Bacillus cereus usually cannot hold fragments larger than 20 kb. With the development of genome research, shuttle vectors with higher loading capacity are necessary. We constructed an Escherichia coli to B. thuringiensis shuttle vector, pEMB0557, with a large loading capacity. This vector incorporated the ori60 replicon from B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki YBT-1520, erythromycin resistance (B. thuringiensis), and chloromycetin resistance (E. coli) genes. A bacterial artificial chromosome library of B. thuringiensis strain CT-43 was constructed and pEMB0557 was able to accommodate at least a 70-kb DNA fragment. Simultaneously, the cry1B gene on a 40-kb fragment could express a 140-kDa protein in plasmid-cured B. thuringiensis BMB171. Due to its high capacity and utility in expressing exogenous genes, pEMB0557 will be useful in cloning (especially silencing genes) and expressing large DNA fragments (e.g., gene clusters) in B. thuringiensis. Plasmid pEMB0557 provides a new tool for B. thuringiensis genome or B. cereus group research.
TI  - Gene cloning and characterization of arylamine N-acetyltransferase from Bacillus  cereus strain 10-L-2.
AB  - Bacillus cereus strain 10-L-2 synthesizes two arylamine N-acetyltransferases (Nat-a and Nat-b) with broad substrate specificities toward aniline and its derivatives. In southern blot analysis using probes encoding the NH2-terminus of Nat-b and a conserved region of N-acetyltransferases, digested total DNA of strain 10-L-2 showed one positive band. We cloned and sequenced the gene encoding Nat-b. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence predicted from the open reading frame (768 base pairs) corresponded to that of purified Nat-b. The cloned Nat-b gene was expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed enzyme (BcNAT) from the recombinant strain was partially purified and characterized. Nat-b from strain 10-L-2 and BcNAT from the recombinant strain were slightly different from each others in substrate specificity and thermo-stability. We examined the biotransformations of 2-aminophenols and phenylenediamines by the whole cells of the recombinant strain. The cells converted these compounds into their corresponding acetanilides. Only one amino group of phenylenediamines was acetylated. The cells utilized 4-nitroacetanilide as an acetyl donor instead of acetyl-CoA. 4-Aminoacetanilide was produced and 4-nitroaniline was released almost stoichiometrically.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts. STUDY OBJECT AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts was determined with reference cultures of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035, and fungus Candida albicans ATCC 60193. Microbiological tests were performed under aseptic conditions. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)--the highest dilution of preparation (the lowest concentration of preparation) that suppresses growth of reference microorganisms--was determined. RESULTS: Concentration of phenolic compounds in soft propolis extract that possesses antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) is 0.587+/-0.054 mg and 0.587+/-0.054-0.394+/-0.022 mg (P>0.05) and in purified propolis extract--0.427+/-0.044 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to soft propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.119+/- 0.152 mg and to purified propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.013+/-0.189 mg (P>0.05). Spore-forming Bacillus subtilis bacteria are more sensitive to soft and purified propolis extracts when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 0.134+/-0.002 mg and 0.075+/-0.025 mg, respectively, and Bacillus cereus--when the concentration is 0.394+/-0.022 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Sensitivity of fungus Candida albicans to soft and purified propolis extracts is the same as Bacillus subtilis. Encapsulated bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to antimicrobial action of soft and purified propolis extracts as compared with gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis bacteria (P<0.05), gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis (P<0.05), spore-forming Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus bacteria (P<0.05), and fungus Candida albicans (P<0.05). There is no statistically significant difference between antimicrobial effect of soft propolis extract and purified propolis extract on gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, spore-forming bacteria, encapsulated bacteria, and Candida fungus. CONCLUSIONS: Soft and purified propolis extracts possess antimicrobial activity. They could be recommended as natural preservatives in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.
TI  - Efficiency of KrCl excilamp (222 nm) for inactivation of bacteria in suspension.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the killing efficiency of UV KrCl excilamp against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vegetative cells of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes at initial populations from 10(2) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) ml(-1) were treated by KrCl excilamp in sterile Ringer's solution with and without H(2)O(2). The number of viable cells was determined using spread plating techniques and nutrient agar method with subsequent incubation at 28 degrees C or 37 degrees C for 24 h. At estimated populations of 10(2)-10(5) CFU ml(-1) E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive and showed 100% disinfection within 15 s (29.2 mJ cm(-2)). Bacillus subtilis was more sensitive to UV treatment than B. cereus. The UV/H(2)O(2) inactivation rate coefficients within this population range were two times higher than those observed for UV treatment alone. No effect of H(2)O(2) was observed at 10(7) CFU ml(-1) for Bacillus sp. and Strep. pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The narrow-band UV radiation at 222 nm was effective in the rapid disinfection of bacteria in aqueous suspensions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: KrCl excilamps represent UV sources which can be applied for disinfection of drinking water in advanced oxidation processes.
TI  - The science of salsa: antimicrobial properties of salsa components to learn scientific methodology.
AB  - Most ethnic foods and cooking practices have incorporated the use of spices and other food additives. Many common spices have crossed cultural boundaries and appear in multiple ethnic cuisines. Recent studies have demonstrated that many of these ingredients possess antimicrobial properties against common food spoilage microorganisms. We developed a laboratory exercise that promotes the use of scientific methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of salsa components at inhibiting the growth of undesirable microorganisms. Tomato, onion, garlic, cilantro, and jalapeno were tested for antimicrobial properties against a representative fungus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the common food spoilage bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli. Each component was ethanol extracted and a modification of the Kirby-Bauer method of antimicrobial sensitivity was employed. Garlic demonstrated the greatest inhibitory effects against all organisms tested. Onion demonstrated a slight inhibition of all four organisms, while cilantro showed some inhibition of all three bacteria but no effect against the fungus. Jalapeno may have slightly inhibited E. coli and S. aureus, as evidenced by a consistently measured increase in the zone of inhibition that was not statistically significant when compared to that of the control. Following the initial exercise, students were given the opportunity to repeat the exercise using other spices such as cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and coriander. Student learning outcomes were evaluated using preliminary and secondary surveys, mainly focusing on definitions of science and hypothesis as well as the process of science. Students enjoyed this exercise and met the learning goals of understanding the process and methodology of science, as well as the interdisciplinarity inherent in the sciences. Student learning was evidenced by an increase in the number of correct responses on the secondary survey in comparison to the preliminary.
TI  - [Effect of phytosubstances with antioxidant activity on persistence properties of microorganisms].
AB  - The in vitro effect of phytosubstances containing flavonoids and phenylpropanoids on the antilysozyme activity of varioous groups of microorganisms, such as staphylococci, bacilli, enterobacteria and nonfermenting bacteria was studied. The second fraction of the pink carbonic acid extract showed high antioxidant activity and most efficiently inhibited the ability of various microorganisms to inactivate the host lysozyme. The selected phytosubstance could be useful in clinical practice as an additional antimicrobial agent in etiotropic therapy or prophylaxis of some infections.
TI  - Evaluation of a Microbiological Multi-Residue System on the detection of antibacterial substances in ewe milk.
AB  - To protect both, public health and the dairy industry, from the presence of antibiotic residues in milk, control programmes have been established, which include the needed screening tests. This work focuses on the application of a Microbiological Multi-Residue System in ewe milk, a method based on the use of six different plates, each seeded with one of the following bacteria: Geobacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis (beta-lactams), Bacillus subtilis at pH 8.0 (aminoglycosides), Kocuria rhizophila (macrolides), Escherichia coli (quinolones), B. cereus (tetracyclines) and B. subtilis at pH 7.0 (sulphonamides), respectively. Twenty-three antimicrobial substances were analysed and a logistic regression was established for each substance assayed to relate the antibiotic concentration and the zone of microbial growth inhibition. Great linearity in the response was observed (regression coefficients of over 0.97). This fact suggests the possibility of establishing a decision level of antibiotic concentrations near to the Maximum Residue Limits (MRL). Zones of inhibition were suggested as proposed action levels for the different antimicrobial groups (diameters of inhibition of 18 mm for the aminoglycoside, beta-lactam and sulphonamide plates; 19 mm for the tetracycline plate, 21 mm for the macrolide plate, and 24 mm for the quinolone plate). Specificity and cross-reactivity were also assayed.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of roselle calyx extracts and protocatechuic acid in ground beef and apple juice.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of roselle calyx aqueous and ethanol extracts and protocatechuic acid against food spoilage bacteria Salmonella typhimurium DT104, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus were examined. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of roselle calyx aqueous and ethanol extracts and protocatechuic acid against these bacteria were in the range of 112-144, 72-96, and 24-44 microg/mL, respectively. Protocatechuic acid content in roselle calyx aqueous and ethanol extracts was 2.8 +/- 0.7 and 11.9 +/- 1.2 mg/g, respectively. Antibacterial activity of roselle calyx ethanol extract and protocatechuic acid was not affected by heat treatments from 25 degrees to 75 degrees C and 25 degrees to 100 degrees C, respectively. After 3 days storage at 25 degrees C, the addition of roselle calyx extracts and protocatechuic acid exhibited dose-dependent inhibitory effects against test bacteria in ground beef and apple juice, in which the roselle calyx ethanol extract showed greater antibacterial effects than the aqueous extract. These data suggest that roselle calyx ethanol extract and protocatechuic acid might be potent agents as food additives to prevent contamination from these bacteria.
TI  - Fluorescent-BOX-PCR for resolving bacterial genetic diversity, endemism and biogeography.
AB  - BACKGROUND: BOX-A1R-based repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (BOX-PCR) is one  of the most used techniques in biogeography studies of microbial isolates. However the traditional separation of BOX-PCR patterns by agarose gel electrophoresis suffers many limitations. The aim of this research was to set up a fluorescent BOX-PCR (F-BOX-PCR) assay in which separation of PCR products is automated in a capillary electrophoresis system. F-BOX-PCR was compared with the traditional BOX-PCR using bacterial strains with different G+C content (Bacillus cereus; Escherichia coli; isolates of the family Geodermatophilaceae). Resolution, discriminatory power and reproducibility were evaluated by assaying different electrophoretic runs, PCR reactions and independent DNA extractions. BOX-PCR and F-BOX-PCR were compared for the analysis of 29 strains of Modestobacter multiseptatus isolated from three different microsites in an altered carbonatic wall from Cagliari, Italy, and 45 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus isolated from 34 samples of the hand-made, yogurt-like product Matsoni, collected in different locations in Georgia. RESULTS: Fluorophore 6-FAM proved more informative than HEX and BOX-PCR both in agarose gel electrophoresis (p < 0.004 and p < 0.00003) and in capillary electrophoresis (compared only with HEX, p < 2 x 10(-7)). 6-FAM- and HEX-based F-BOX-PCR respectively detected up to 12.0 and 11.3 times more fragments than BOX-PCR. Replicate separations of F-BOX-PCR showed an accuracy of the size calling of +/- 0.5 bp until 500 bp, constantly decreasing to +/- 10 bp at 2000 bp. Cluster analysis of F-BOX-PCR profiles grouped M. multiseptatus strains according to the microsite of isolation and S. thermophilus strains according to the geographical origin of Matsoni, but resulted intermixed when a BOX-PCR dataset was used. CONCLUSION: F-BOX-PCR represents an improved method for addressing bacterial biogeography studies both in term of sensitivity, reproducibility and data analysis.
TI  - Antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of Kenyan medicinal plants.
AB  - Seven medicinal plant extracts traditionally used in Kenya, mainly for management of infectious conditions, were chosen and screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. Antibacterial activity was tested using the broth dilution method. Harrisonia abyssinica and Terminalia kilimandscharica extracts showed significant activity against Gram+ and Gram- bacteria. The methanolic extracts of T. kilimandscharica bark and H. abyssinica bark and leaves showed minimum inhibitory activity against all tested bacteria, with minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 25-150 mg/mL. Ajuga remota and Amaranthus hybridus, which are lethal to brine shrimp nauplii, showed significantly lower antibacterial activity than those that were relatively non-toxic.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Pentanema divaricatum and its active constituent.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of ethanol and chloroform extracts of Pentanema divaricatum Cass. was studied using the conventional disk diffusion method. The extracts' highest antimicrobial activity was observed against Aspergillus niger. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract by preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC) showed one antimicrobial fraction which was especially effective against Aspergillus niger. By conventional spectroscopy the active fraction was identified as 4alpha,5alpha-epoxy-10alpha,14H-1-epi-inuviscolide. This compound represented the most potent antimicrobial candidate, with MIC values of <25 microg/disk against A. niger strains and 200 microg/disk against Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - One-pot synthesis of 5-phenylimino, 5-thieno or 5-oxo-1,2,3-dithiazoles and evaluation of their antimicrobial and antitumor activity.
AB  - We here report the synthesis and biological evaluation of rare 4-substituted-5-phenylimino, 5-thieno- and 5-oxo-1,2,3-dithiazoles. Dithiazoles were selectively obtained in moderate to high yields (25-73%) via a one-pot reaction from various ethanoneoximes with sulfur monochloride, pyridine in acetonitrile followed by treatment by corresponding nucleophiles (aniline, thioacetamide and formic acid). All the synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial (against bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonellaenterica serovar Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus and Listeria inocua), antifungal (against pathogenic strains Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and Issatchenkia orientalis) and antitumor (on human cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) activity. 4-(2-Pyridinyl)-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole-5-thione and 4-ethylcarboxyl-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole-5-thione (5d, 5h) that are active against Gram-positive bacteria are significantly active against fungi. 4-(2-Benzofuranyl)-5-phenylimino-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole (4e) exerts antiproliferative activity.
TI  - Assessment of the microbiological safety of dried spices and herbs from production and retail premises in the United Kingdom.
AB  - A study of dried spices and herbs from retail and production premises to determine the microbiological status of such products was undertaken in the UK during 2004. According to EC Recommendation 2004/24/EC and European Spice Association specifications, 96% of 2833 retail samples and 92% of 132 production batches were of satisfactory/acceptable quality. Salmonella spp. were detected in 1.5% and 1.1% of dried spices and herbs sampled at production and retail, respectively. Overall, 3.0% of herbs and spices contained high counts of Bacillus cereus (1%, > or =10(5) cfu g(-1)), Clostridium perfringens (0.4%, > or =10(3) cfu g(-1)) and/or Escherichia coli (2.1%, > or =10(2) cfu g(-1)). Ninety percent of samples examined were recorded as being 'ready-to-use', 96% of which were of satisfactory/acceptable quality. The potential public health risk of using spices and herbs as an addition to ready-to-eat foods that potentially undergo no further processing is therefore highlighted in this study. Prevention of microbial contamination in dried herbs and spices lies in the application of good hygiene practices during growing, harvesting and processing from farm to fork, and effective decontamination. In addition, the importance of correct food handling practices and usage of herbs and spices by end users cannot be overemphasised.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Acalypha indica L.
AB  - Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from the leaves of Acalypha indica were tested against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. All the extracts exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) between 0.156 to 2.5 mg/ml. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, only the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was susceptible to the extracts.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in drinking water: a case study in rural areas of northern Rajasthan, India.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial contaminations in drinking water samples collected form some rural habitations of northern Rajasthan, India. A total of ten bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis and Micrococcus luteum were identified form drinking water samples. The bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae (coliforms) showed the maximum occurrences in water samples. The total coliforms count, i.e. TTC(m) (m = MPN index/100 ml) in drinking water samples was in the ranges of 25 TTC(m) (village Naiwala)-41 TTC(m) (village Meharwala). The data suggested that the drinking water quality deterioration in rural habitations of this region was due to poor sanitation and unawareness about personal hygienic practices. The occurrences some pathogenic bacteria in drinking water may increase the risks of water-related diseases and health problems in local residents.
TI  - Using shotgun sequence data to find active restriction enzyme genes.
AB  - Whole genome shotgun sequence analysis has become the standard method for beginning to determine a genome sequence. The preparation of the shotgun sequence clones is, in fact, a biological experiment. It determines which segments of the genome can be cloned into Escherichia coli and which cannot. By analyzing the complete set of sequences from such an experiment, it is possible to identify genes lethal to E. coli. Among this set are genes encoding restriction enzymes which, when active in E. coli, lead to cell death by cleaving the E. coli genome at the restriction enzyme recognition sites. By analyzing shotgun sequence data sets we show that this is a reliable method to detect active restriction enzyme genes in newly sequenced genomes, thereby facilitating functional annotation. Active restriction enzyme genes have been identified, and their activity demonstrated biochemically, in the sequenced genomes of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987 and Methylococcus capsulatus.
TI  - Structure-activity relationship of antibacterial chalcones.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of 31 chalcones was tested against bacterial strains,  Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. Some of the tested chalcones showed fair to significant activity against Gram-positive bacteria. By comparison of the results obtained, the antibacterial activity can be related to features such as the presence of a C-4 hydroxyl group, a C-4' oxygenated substituent or a C-3' isoprenoid side chain, while the C-2' hydroxyl group might have importance for the stability of the molecule. The inhibitory effect of chalcones on human pathogenic microorganisms can be correlated with the substitution patterns of the aromatics rings.
TI  - Rechargeable antimicrobial surface modification of polyethylene.
AB  - Polyethylene films were surface modified, to incorporate amine and amide functionalities, and subsequently were evaluated for their ability to recharge the antimicrobial N-halamine structures after contact with sodium hypochlorite, a common food-approved sanitizer. Surfaces were tested for chlorine retention and release, as well as antimicrobial activity against microorganisms relevant to food quality and food safety, including Escherichia coli K-12, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria monocytogenes. N-Halamine functionalized polyethylene exhibited chlorine rechargeability, maintaining 5 to 7 nmol/cm2 N-halamine structures for six successive charges. The N-halamine functionalized films achieved a 4-log reduction for all organisms tested and maintained a greater than 3-log reduction for four successive uses, suggesting that the modified polyethylene films are capable of providing rechargeable antimicrobial activity. The modified films exhibited antimicrobial activity in aqueous suspensions (P < 0.05) and reduced microbial growth in diluted broth (P < 0.05), suggesting the potential for biocidal action even in the presence of organic matter. Such a rechargeable antimicrobial surface could supplement existing cleaning and sanitation programs in food processing environments to reduce the adhesion, growth, and subsequent cross-contamination of food pathogens, as well as food spoilage organisms.
TI  - Efficacy of plant essential oils against foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria associated with ready-to-eat vegetables: antimicrobial and sensory screening.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of plant essential oils (EOs) against foodborne pathogens and key spoilage bacteria pertinent to ready-to-eat vegetables and to screen the selected EOs for sensory acceptability. The EOs basil, caraway, fennel, lemon balm, marjoram, nutmeg, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, and thyme were evaluated. The bacteria evaluated were Listeria spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus spp., Bacillus cereus, Salmonella, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas spp. Quantitative antimicrobial analyses were performed using an absorbance-based microplate assay. Efficacy was compared using MIC, the half maximum inhibitory concentration, and the increase in lag phase. Generally, gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to EOs than were gram-negative bacteria, and Listeria monocytogenes strains were among the most sensitive. Of the spoilage organisms, Pseudomonas spp. were the most resistant. Oregano and thyme EOs had the highest activity against all the tested bacteria. Marjoram and basil EOs had selectively high activity against B. cereus, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, and Salmonella, and lemon balm and sage EOs had adequate activity against L. monocytogenes and S. aureus. Within bacterial species, EO efficacy was dependent on strain and in some cases the origin of the strain. On a carrot model product, basil, lemon balm, marjoram, oregano, and thyme EOs were deemed organoleptically acceptable, but only oregano and marjoram EOs were deemed acceptable for lettuce. Selected EOs may be useful as natural and safe additives for promoting the safety and quality of ready-to-eat vegetables.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of Turkish propolis, pollen, and laurel on spoilage and pathogenic food-related microorganisms.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of propolis extract, pollen extract, and essential oil of laurel (Laurus nobilis L.) at concentrations from 0.02% to 2.5% (vol/vol) were investigated on bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes), yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida rugosa), and molds (Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus oryzae). Pollen has no antimicrobial effects on the bacteria and fungi tested in the concentrations used. Propolis showed a bactericidal effect at 0.02% on B. cereus and B. subtilis, at 1.0% on S. aureus and E. faecalis, and at 0.2% on L. monocytogenes. The minimum inhibitory concentration of propolis for fungi was 2.5%. Propolis and laurel were ineffective against E. coli and S. typhimurium at the concentrations tested. The results showed that the antimicrobial activity were concentration dependent. Propolis and essential oil of laurel may be used as biopreservative agents in food processing and preservation.
TI  - Wound healing, anti-microbial and antioxidant potential of Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh.
AB  - Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh (Loranthaceae) of the order Santalales, is used ethnomedicinally for treating ulcers, asthma, impotence, paralysis, skin diseases, and wounds. In this context, validations of the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in wound healing activity was studied, besides anti-microbial activity and antioxidant activity were performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. The ethanolic extract of aerial parts of Dendrophthoe falcata ethanolic extract (DFEE) was investigated for the evaluation of its healing efficiency on excision and incision wound models in rats. The results showed that Dendrophthoe falcata extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expressions were also well correlative with the healing pattern observed. Three of the fractions A-C (petroleum ether, chloroform and ethanol, respectively) obtained from the extract exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Serratia marcescens, and five fungi Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis: dimorphic fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger: systemic fungi, and some infectious bacteria Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi. The results also indicated that DFEE possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase levels and increased the catalase activity.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of Datura innoxia (thorn-apple) for potential antibacterial activity.
AB  - Various parts of Datura innoxia were examined for potential antibacterial activity by preparing their crude aqueous and organic extracts against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus). The results of agar well diffusion assay indicated that the pattern of inhibition depends largely upon the plant part, solvent used for extraction and the organism tested. Extracts prepared from leaves were shown to have better efficacy than stem and root extracts. Organic extracts provided potent antibacterial activity as compared to aqueous extracts. Among all the extracts, methanolic extract was found most active against almost all the bacterial species tested. Gram-positive bacteria were found most sensitive as compared to Gram-negative bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus was signifi cantly inhibited by almost all the extracts even at very low MIC followed by other Gram-positives. For Escherichia coli (a Gram-negative bacterium), the end point was not reached for ethyl acetate extract while it was very high for other extracts. The study promises an interesting future for designing a potentially active antibacterial agent from Datura innoxia.
TI  - Effects of pulsed electric fields on pathogenic microorganisms of major concern in fluid foods: a review.
AB  - Pathogenic microorganisms such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni have been implicated in foodborne diseases and outbreaks worldwide. These bacteria have been associated with the consumption of fresh fruit juices, milk, and dairy products, which are foodstuff, highly demanded by consumers in retails and supermarkets. Nowadays, consumers require high quality, fresh-like, and safe foods. Pulsed electric field (PEF) is a non-thermal preservation method, able to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms without significant loss of the organoleptic and nutritional properties of food. The PEF treatment effectiveness to destroy bacteria such as Listeria innocua, E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli 8739 at pasteurization levels (> or = 5.0 log(10) cycles) in some fluid foods was reported. However, data on the inactivation of some microorganisms such as Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni in fluid foods by PEF processing is very limited. Therefore, future works should be focused toward the inactivation of these pathogenic bacteria in real foods.
TI  - Fluorescence microscopy as a tool for in situ life detection.
AB  - The identification of extant and, in some cases, extinct bacterial life is most convincingly and efficiently performed with modern high-resolution microscopy. Epifluorescence microscopy of microbial autofluorescence or in conjunction with fluorescent dyes is among the most useful of these techniques. We explored fluorescent labeling and imaging of bacteria in rock and soil in the context of in situ life detection for planetary exploration. The goals were two-fold: to target non-Earth-centric biosignatures with the greatest possible sensitivity and to develop labeling procedures amenable to robotic implementation with technologies that are currently space qualified. A wide panel of commercially available dyes that target specific biosignature molecules was screened, and those with desirable properties (i.e., minimal binding to minerals, strong autofluorescence contrast, no need for wash steps) were identified. We also explored the potential of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) as bacterial and space probes. A specific instrument for space implementation is suggested and discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of edible wild and cultivated mushrooms against foodborne bacterial strains.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of aqueous, methanol, hexane, and ethyl acetate extracts from edible wild and cultivated mushrooms against nine foodborne pathogenic bacterial strains (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Enteritidis, Shigella sonnei, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) was screened with a disk diffusion assay. Twenty-nine of the 48 species tested had antimicrobial activity. Methanol, ethyl acetate, and aqueous extracts accounted for 92.8% of the positive assays, whereas the hexane extracts accounted for only 7.2%. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive than gram-negative bacteria to fungal extracts, and C. perfringens was the most sensitive microorganism. Aqueous extracts from Clitocybe geotropa and Lentinula edodes had the highest antimicrobial activity against all the bacterial strains tested.
TI  - Construction of a non toxic chimeric protein (L1-L2-B) of Haemolysin BL from Bacillus cereus and its application in HBL toxin detection.
AB  - Among the many potential virulence factors of B. cereus, Haemolysin BL is a unique and potent three component pore forming toxin composed of a binding component, B, and two lytic components, L(1) and L(2). Heterogeneity in nucleic acid and protein sequences of HBL components and problems during expression of L(1) and L(2) proteins in recombinant host due to their toxicity causes problems for development of specific detection systems based on PCR and Immunoassay, respectively. Commercially available kit (BCET RPLA, Oxoid) is useful for detection of L(2) component of HBL, but detection of only one component is insufficient to give comprehensive view on HBL toxin producing strains as some strains produced only one or two of the three HBL components. To address above mentioned problems, in this study, we cloned conserved domains of B, L(1) and L(2) components together as single fusion gene and expressed as recombinant multidomain chimeric protein in E. coli. The resultant protein having L(1), B and L(2) components in the form of single protein had no toxicity towards E. coli as we followed truncated protein approach. The hyperimmune antisera raised in mice against r-chimeric protein reacted with all the three components of HBL toxin of B. cereus (ATCC 14579) and provided three reaction bands at ~40 kDa to ~50 kDa regions during Western blot analysis. The hyperimmune sera of r-chimeric protein also notably neutralized the hemolytic activity of native HBL toxin. These results demonstrated that the obtained chimeric protein is correct and retained the antigenicity of native HBL toxin components. Therefore, it has better application in the development of a comprehensive HBL detection immunoassay and may also be a potential candidate molecule for vaccine studies.
TI  - Antibacterial iridoid glucosides from Eremostachys laciniata.
AB  - Eremostachys laciniata (L) Bunge (family: Lamiaceae alt. Labiatae; subfamily: Lamioideae) is one of the 15 endemic Iranian herbs of the genus Eremostachys. A decoction of the roots and flowers of E. laciniata has traditionally been taken orally for the treatment of allergies, headache and liver diseases. Three antibacterial iridoid glucosides, phloyoside I (1), phlomiol (2) and pulchelloside I (3) have been isolated from the rhizomes of this plant. The structures of these compounds were elucidated unequivocally by a series of 1D and 2D NMR analyses. The antibacterial activity and brine shrimp toxicity of these compounds were assessed using the resazurin microtitre assay and the brine shrimp lethality assay, respectively. All three iridoid glycosides 1-3 exhibited from low to moderate levels (MIC = 0.05-0.50 mg/mL) of antibacterial activity. Of these compounds, compound 3 was the most active, and displayed antibacterial activity against 9 of 12 different strains tested. The most noteworthy activity of 3 was against Bacillus cereus, penicillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus with an MIC value of 0.05 mg/mL.
TI  - Neonatal meningoencephalitis caused by Bacillus cereus.
AB  - The classic organisms associated with central nervous system infection in the neonate are herpes simplex, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae; we describe an unusual case of neonatal meningoencephalitis caused by Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Towards on-site pathogen detection using antibody-based sensors.
AB  - In this paper, the recent progress within biosensors for plant pathogen detection will be reviewed. Bio-recognition layers on sensors can be designed in various ways, however the most popular approach is to immobilise antibodies for specific capture of analytes. Focus will be put on antibody surface-immobilisation strategies as well as the use of antibodies in the widely used sensors, quartz crystal microbalance, surface plasmon resonance and cantilevers. We will describe the available data on antibody-based plant pathogen detection and furthermore use examples from detection of the pathogens Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus anthracis, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli. We will touch upon optimal assay design and further discuss the strengths and limitations of current sensor technologies for detection of viruses, bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a Congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  - Thirty one bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the Congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. Using species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as L. plantarum and L. fermentum, respectively. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR fingerprints revealed two main groups (G1 and G2) plus the L. fermentum isolate C4-13. Group G1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (G1-1, G1-2) each with several branches, plus the L. plantarum isolate C11. Group G2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. Using PCR amplification with specific primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in L. plantarum C11 were identified in the isolates. The number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. The L. fermentum isolate EC11 also contained the plnDEFG genes. PCR amplification of DNA from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with DNA from the control strain L. plantarum WCFS1. Amplification products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with HindIII, EcoRI and KpnI in separate reactions. Cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for EcoRI and HindII digest profiles, and an identical profile for all KpnI digests. The L. fermentum EC11 isolate clustered with L. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. The results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. However, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. Because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial studies of novel 1-benzhydryl-piperazine sulfonamide  and carboxamide derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel substituted 1-benzhydryl-piperazine sulfonamide 8(a-f) and benzamides 9(a-h) were synthesized and their antimicrobial activities evaluated in vitro by paper disc diffusion and micro dilution method against standard strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25953, Staphylococcus epidermis 25212, Bacillus cereus 11778, Bacillus substilis 6051) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 2853 and Salmonella typhi ATCC 9484) bacteria. Among the synthesized new compounds 8d, 8e, 9c, 9e, 9f and 9 h showed potent antimicrobial activities compared to the standard drug streptomycin.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic studies of a PduO-type ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Cobalamin adenosyltransferases transfer a 5'-deoxyadenosyl moiety from ATP and covalently attach it to the cobalt(I) ion of the corrin ring of cobalamin to generate adenosylcobalamin. The PduO-type adenosyltransferase from Bacillus cereus was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized as the apoenzyme as well as in complex with Mg(2+) and ATP (MgATP). Diffraction data were collected to 1.9 A resolution for the native crystals and 2.0 A resolution for the complexed crystals. Both crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group C222(1); the native crystals have unit-cell parameters a = 64.93, b = 137.08, c = 158.55 A. The asymmetric unit contained one trimer, with a corresponding V(M) of 2.69 A(3) Da(-1).
TI  - Enteric bacteria isolated from acute diarrheal patients in the Republic of Korea  between the year 2004 and 2006.
AB  - In an epidemiological survey of human enterobacterial infections in the Republic  of Korea during three years from 2004 to 2006, we isolated 1,784 (6.2%, isolation rate of enteropathogens from stool samples) in 2004, 2,547 (9.5%) in 2005 and 3,506 bacteria (12.3%) from people who visited clinics. Among the isolated bacteria, pathogenic Escherichia coli, especially, EAEC was the most frequently identified pathogen in both urban and rural regions followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella species, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, and Shigella species. Distinct seasonality was found in V. parahaemolyticus species, while this pathogen showed no age-specific patterns. However, other bacteria, i.e., pathogenic E. coli, S. aureus, Salmonella spp., and B. cereus showed similar seasonality throughout the year, showing a slight increase in the infection rate during the summer months and high prevalence among children under 10 years of age and elder-age people. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella spp., and S. aureus showed high resistance to penicillins. However, both pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella spp. were susceptible to several cephems, imipenem, and amikacin. Moreover, S. aureus strains resistant to vancomycin were not found. In conclusion, these surveillances can play an important role for the control and prevention to the diseases originated by enteritis bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of some Schiff bases of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones.
AB  - In the present study, a series of novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes via cyclized intermediate 6,8-dibromo-2-phenyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures were confirmed by means of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, Mass spectral and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC-9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC-155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC-4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC-11778, Escherichia coli ATCC-25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC-11298) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC-9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC-46645) activities by paper disc diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. Among the synthesized compounds 3-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylideneamino)-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one 10 was found to be the most potent anti-microbial activity with MICs of 18.9, 19.1, 18.8, 21.7, 18.2, 19.3, 16.7, 8.6 and 10.1 microg/ml against above mentioned respective strains. Compounds were found to exhibit more anti-fungal than anti-bacterial activity.
TI  - Risk profiles of pork and poultry meat and risk ratings of various pathogen/product combinations.
AB  - Risk profiles of pork and poultry meat were carried out using an Excel-based software program, Risk Ranger. It is a semi-quantitative risk estimator answering various questions relating to the probability of exposure to a hazard, susceptibility of the population of interest, severity of the illness caused by the hazard if present and probability of food containing an infectious dose. Therefore, qualitative and quantitative inputs were used to estimate and rank the risk of various hazards/food combinations. Risk scores provided by the tool were characterized as low, medium and high. Also, health risk was estimated separately, where needed, for low and high risk populations. Low risk scores were obtained for Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) for low risk population. High risk scores were obtained for hepatitis E virus (HEV) in raw pork products (both low and high risk populations). Moderate risk scores for Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes in processed pork or poultry-meat products (ready-to-eat or to be reheated) and partially cooked pork products were also obtained (low risk population). Scores for Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus and various product types were mostly in the "medium" risk category, except for S. aureus/ready-to-eat pork products able to support growth of the organism, which fell into the high risk category. Campylobacter spp. gave moderate risk scores with one exception (raw poultry products), whereas Y. enterocolitica showed combinations of low risk and few of medium risk. High risk pathogen/product combinations identified were: 1) temperature abused, ready-to-eat pork and/or poultry-meat products with extended shelf life and cross-contaminated by L. monocytogenes (high risk population), EHEC (high risk population) or S. aureus (all population), 2) partially cooked or processed intended to be reheated pork products cross-contaminated by L. monocytogenes, served undercooked and receiving improper cooling or reheating (high risk population), and 3) all people consuming undercooked meals cross-contaminated with Campylobacter spp. (e.g. from raw poultry and raw poultry-meat products) and HEV (e.g. from raw pork and raw pork-meat products). Salmonellae gave high risk scores in all food categories (except preserved meat products) for high risk population. Preserved meats (mainly pork) such as dry fermented sausages gave low risk scores. Only Salmonella spp., L. monocytogenes and E. coli EHEC gave moderate risk ratings in case of ingredients likely to be contaminated at an early stage of processing (e.g. animal at slaughter) and inadequate fermentation process. These results may constitute a source of information for hazard assessment during application of a Food Safety Management System.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oil of  Foeniculum vulgare Mill.
AB  - In our study, four samples of volatile oil from Foeniculum vulgare, cultivated in different pedoclimatic conditions, were investigated for their antimicrobial activity and chemical composition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Organisms. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Candida albicans were included in the report. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests. The comparative inhibitory activity of volatile oil samples with other antimicrobial agents was quantitative determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Oil samples are the volatile oils extracted by steam distillation, from two ecological vegetative populations of Foeniculum vulgare. Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to determine the chemical composition of the essential oils. RESULTS: All oil samples have a good activity against E. coli and S. aureus at low concentrations. Against B. cereus and P. aeruginosa these oil samples are less active. The oil samples were generally bactericidal at a concentration up to twofold or fourfold higher than the MIC value. Significantly synergic activity with amoxicillin or tetracycline showed all fennel samples against E. coli, Sarcina lutea and B. subtilis strains. Fennel oil samples have shown high activity against Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: No significant antimicrobial activity variations were observed for Foeniculum vulgare volatile oil samples obtained after two or three years cultivation period. The most important identified compounds in all samples of fennel volatile oils were trans-anethole, estragole, fenchone, limonene, alpha-pinene and gamma-terpinene.
TI  - Screening of some Tanzanian medicinal plants from Bunda district for antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  - Extracts from 50 plant parts obtained from 39 different plants belonging to 22 families used to treat infectious diseases in Bunda district, Tanzania, were screened against twelve microorganisms, including the bacteria Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium, the fungi Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, and the viruses Herpes Simplex Virus type 1, Vesicular Stomatitis Virus T2, Coxsackie B2 and Semliki Forest A7. The highest activity was obtained for the n-hexane extract of Elaeodendron schlechteranum root bark against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus (MIC 0.97 microg/ml and MBC 1.95 microg/ml) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 3.90 microg/ml and MBC 31.25 microg/ml). Gram-negative bacteria were less sensitive. Only Balanites aegyptiaca stem bark exhibited a high antifungal activity against Candida albicans (MIC 125 microg/ml and MFC 250 microg/ml). Extracts from four plants; Lannea schweinfurthii, Combretum adenogonium, Ficus sycomorus and Terminalia mollis showed strong antiviral activity with RF values of 10(3) and 10(4) against Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 at various concentrations. Our results support, at least in part, the use of most plants as claimed by traditional healers/informants especially against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Single-chain variable fragment antibodies selected by phage display against the sporozoite surface antigen P23 Of Cryptosporidium parvum.
AB  - Cryptosporidium parvum, an apicomplexan parasite transmitted via animal fecal wastes, is the causative agent of cryptosporidiosis. Clones were selected from 2 synthetic naive human single-chain variable fragment (scFv) phagemid libraries that bound to the recombinant P23 protein of C. parvum. Panning the Tomlinson I and J phagemid libraries resulted in 6 distinct clones. Two clones had full-length scFv sequences, while the remaining clones were either truncated or missing a section of the heavy chain. Despite these differences, all clones were able to detect both native C. parvum proteins and recombinant P23. None of the selected clones cross-reacted with Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Giardia lamblia (cysts or trophozoites), or with S16, another dominant surface antigen on C. parvum sporozoites. Clones expressed as the scFv-gIIIp fusion construct in soluble form detected C. parvum. Panning from naive libraries is a useful method for isolation and identification of recombinant antibodies that have the potential for use in pathogen detection and immunotherapy.
TI  - PAH-degrading microbial consortium and its pyrene-degrading plasmids from mangrove sediment samples in Huian, China.
AB  - PAH-degrading microbial consortium and its pyrene-degrading plasmids were enriched from the sediment samples of Huian mangroves. The consortium YL showed degrading abilities of 92.1%, 87.6%, 92.3%, and 95.8% for pyrene, fluoranthene, phenanthrene, and fluoene at 50 mg l(-1) after 21 days incubation, respectively. The dynamics of pH changes in the cultures was consistent with that of PAH concentration change. Bacillus cereus Py5 and Bacillus megaterium Py6 were isolated from the consortium and observed consuming 65.8% and 33.7% of pyrene (50 mg l(-1)) within three weeks, respectively. The enriched Escherichia coli DH5alpha cells containing the plasmids of YL were demonstrated to degrade 85.7% of the original pyrene concentration at the 21st day.
TI  - Method for evaluation of the efficacy of antimicrobial preservatives in cosmetic  wet wipes.
AB  - Many cosmetic formulations are now available in the form of wet wipes packaged in sealed sachets or packets. Like the majority of cosmetic products having an aqueous phase, wipes are susceptible to microbial contamination and require the addition of preservatives. The efficacy of such preservatives can be evaluated using a standard challenge test performed on the wetting liquid but this test cannot be regarded as representative for this new type of formulation. The method presented here evaluates the efficacy of preservatives used in wet wipes kept in their original packaging. Dried inoculums were prepared by membrane filtration followed by drying in an incubator. The method is applicable to bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis), Bacillus cereus spores and fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger). These inoculated carriers were inserted between two wipes in the original package, which was then re-sealed immediately. The test requires one dry inoculum per packet and one packet for each control or test. After incubation at 22.5 degrees C for 1, 2, 7, 14 or 28 days and, for the control, immediately after insertion of the membrane (time 0), microorganism counts were performed on the germ-carrier membranes as well as on adjacent wipes, after transfer into a suitable neutralizing agent. The membranes were shaken in the presence of glass beads and microorganisms were dissociated from the wipes by means of a Stomacher. The supernatants recovered after being left to stand for 20 min are counted by pour plate method or membrane filtration. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated for each of the seven above-mentioned strains. The repeatability and reproducibility of the results obtained is similar to that obtained for preservative efficacy tests in the Pharmacopoeias. The lethal rate of microorganisms during the preparation of dry inoculums ranges from 50 to 90% depending on the strain and the test (generally, a spontaneous reduction of about 1 log up to a maximum of 2 log). The recovery rate for microorganisms from dry inoculums (on membranes) at time 0 (control = T(0)) is around 90%, regardless of the strain or the test. The number of microorganisms recovered from the wipes (W(0)) is between 2 and 10% of the number recovered from membranes (T(0)) and may be considered negligible. Application of this method to different types of wipes demonstrates that the efficacy of preservatives, expressed as the logarithmic reduction in the number of microorganisms at each time point, depends on the type of wipe and on the strain tested. The results obtained are considerably different from those found with the standard challenge tests applied to wetting liquids for wipes. The differences found confirm the need for a specific method applicable to wipes.
TI  - Structure-Activity Relationships for Some Diamine, Triamine and Schiff Base Derivatives and Their Copper(II) Complexes.
AB  - Ethylenediamine (en), putrescine (pu), diethylenetriamine (dien), dipropylenetriamine (dpta), spermidine (spmd) and their Cu(II) compounds as well as the Schiff bases with 2-furaldehyde (dienOO), 2- thiophenecarboxaldehyde (dienSS) and pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde (dienNN) of dien and that of dpta with 2- thiophenecarboxaldehyde (dptaSS), were prepared and characterised. They were tested against Bacillus substilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Xanthomonas campestris as antibacterial reagents, the highest activity being exhibited by Cu(dptaSS)(NO(3))(2) complex, which acts as antibiotic. In the antiproliferative tests (vs. T(47)D,L(929) and BHK(21/c13) cell lines) the best results were obtained with Cu(dptaSS)(2+) and Cu(dienSS)(2+). Electronic structure calculations gave for dptaSS and dienSS the higher negative charges on the N atoms. The counter-ions (Br(-), NO(3) (-) and SO(4) (2-)) play an important role by modulating the reagent's selectivity versus the bacteria [Gram(+) or Gram(-)], but they have no effect on the antiproliferative activity.
TI  - Biosynthesis of enantiopure (S)-3-hydroxybutyric acid in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli.
AB  - A biosynthetic pathway for the production of (S)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (S3HB) from glucose was established in recombinant Escherichia coli by introducing the beta-ketothiolase gene from Ralstonia eutropha H16, the (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase gene from R. eutropha H16, or Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC824, and the 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase gene from Bacillus cereus ATCC14579. Artificial operon consisting of these genes was constructed and was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) codon plus under T7 promoter by isopropyl beta-D: -thiogalactoside (IPTG) induction. Recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3) codon plus expressing the beta-ketothiolase gene, the (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase gene, and the 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase gene could synthesize enantiomerically pure S3HB to the concentration of 0.61 g l(-1) from 20 g l(-1) of glucose in Luria-Bertani medium. Fed-batch cultures of recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3) codon plus were carried out to achieve higher titer of S3HB with varying induction time and glucose concentration during fermentation. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG when cell concentration reached 10 and 20 g l(-1) (OD(600) = 30 and 60), respectively. When protein expression was induced at 60 of OD(600) and glucose was fed to the concentration of 15 g l(-1), 10.3 g l(-1) of S3HB was obtained in 38 h with the S3HB productivity of 0.21 g l(-1)h(-1). Lowering glucose concentration to 5 g l(-1) and induction of protein expression at 30 of OD(600) significantly reduced final S3HB concentration to 3.7 g l(-1), which also resulted in the decrease of the S3HB productivity to 0.05 g l(-1)h(-1).
TI  - Identification of a non-pathogenic surrogate organism for chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas treatment.
AB  - The identification of non-pathogenic surrogate microorganisms is beneficial for determining and validating the efficacy of antimicrobial treatments in food manufacturing environments. A surrogate organism was identified to aid in the decontamination process of fresh produce when treated with chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) gas. Thirty-two known strains of pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms and seven unknown microbial isolates from mushroom, tomatoes, and strawberries were evaluated. The primary goal was to find alternative non-pathogenic organisms that had an equal or higher resistance compared to Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes. Among the strains tested, MR1 (mushroom isolate), E. coli O157:H7 C7927, E. coli O157:H7 204P, STB2 (strawberry isolate), and vegetative cells of Bacillus cereus 232 in wet inoculum were found to be the most resistant to gaseous ClO(2) treatment at 0.3 mg/l for 1 min and D-values at 0.3 mg/l ClO(2) were 3.53, 1.95, 1.72, 1.68, and 1.57 min, respectively. For identification, the MR1 and STB2 strains were identified using a Ribotyper with the EcoRI restriction enzyme of 16S rDNA sequence. MR1 was identified as Hafnia alvei with a similarity value of 94% using the ribotype pattern and with a 93.6% similarity using an API 20E strip, and with a 99% similarity using 16S rDNA analysis. The Ped-2E9-based cytotoxicity assay was conducted for the MRI strain extracellular toxin and whole cell toxicity and did not show cytotoxicity. Analysis, using multiplex PCR, was performed to verify absence of the eaeA gene. H. alvei is a suitable non-pathogenic surrogate, with higher resistance to ClO(2) gas compared to pathogens studied, that may be useful to establish optimum conditions of ClO(2) gas decontamination systems.
TI  - From soil to gut: Bacillus cereus and its food poisoning toxins.
AB  - Bacillus cereus is widespread in nature and frequently isolated from soil and growing plants, but it is also well adapted for growth in the intestinal tract of insects and mammals. From these habitats it is easily spread to foods, where it may cause an emetic or a diarrhoeal type of food-associated illness that is becoming increasingly important in the industrialized world. The emetic disease is a food intoxication caused by cereulide, a small ring-formed dodecadepsipeptide. Similar to the virulence determinants that distinguish Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus anthracis from B. cereus, the genetic determinants of cereulide are plasmid-borne. The diarrhoeal syndrome of B. cereus is an infection caused by vegetative cells, ingested as viable cells or spores, thought to produce protein enterotoxins in the small intestine. Three pore-forming cytotoxins have been associated with diarrhoeal disease: haemolysin BL (Hbl), nonhaemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) and cytotoxin K. Hbl and Nhe are homologous three-component toxins, which appear to be related to the monooligomeric toxin cytolysin A found in Escherichia coli. This review will focus on the toxins associated with foodborne diseases frequently caused by B. cereus. The disease characteristics are described, and recent findings regarding the associated toxins are discussed, as well as the present knowledge on virulence regulation.
TI  - Oleanane-type triterpenes from the flowers and roots of Saussurea muliensis.
AB  - Six new oleanane-type triterpenes (1- 6), along with five known compounds, were isolated from the flowers and roots of Saussurea muliensis. On the basis of spectroscopic methods, with special emphasis on 1D and 2D NMR techniques, the structures of the new compounds were characterized as 3beta,22alpha-dihydroxyolean-12-en-30-oic acid (1), 3alpha-(E)-caffeoyloxyolean-12-en-30-oic acid (2), 3alpha-(E)-coumaroyloxyolean-12-en-30-oic acid (3), 3alpha,22alpha-diacetoxy-20beta,21alpha,29-trihydroxy-30-norolean-12-ene (4), 3alpha,22alpha-diacetoxy-21alpha,29-dihydroxy-20beta-methoxy-30-norolean-12-ene (5), and 3alpha,22alpha-diacetoxy-20beta,21alpha-dihydroxy-29-palmityloxy-30-norolean-12-e ne (6). The isolated compounds (1- 6) were not active against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans.
TI  - Two new antibacterial norabietane diterpenoids from cyanobacteria, Microcoleous lacustris.
AB  - Two abietane diterpenes were isolated from cyanobacteria Microcoleous lacustris,  20-nor-3alpha-acetoxyabieta-5,7,9,11,13-pentaene and 20-nor-3alpha-acetoxy-12-hydroxy-abieta-5,7,9,11,13-pentaene. These compounds were assayed against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both compounds showed activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. typhi, and V. cholerae, but not against the other bacteria.
TI  - The antibacterial activity against MRSA strains and other bacteria of a <500Da fraction from maggot excretions/secretions of Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae).
AB  - The application of Lucilia sericata larvae to chronic, infected wounds results in the rapid elimination of infecting microorganisms, including MRSA. Previously, we demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activity of native excretions/secretions (nES) from L. sericata and partially purified two low mass antibacterial compounds with masses of 0.5-10kDa and <500Da. The present study reports the antibacterial effects of the <500Da fraction (ES<500) on the growth and morphology of a range of bacteria, including 12 MRSA strains. Distinct morphological changes were observed in Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli following exposure to ES<500. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy analyses, in conjunction with turbidometric and CFU assays, revealed bacteriostatic activity of nES against S. aureus and E. coli. ES<500 also demonstrated bacteriostatic activity against S. aureus, however, bactericidal activity and the induction of a viable but non-culturable state were observed with ES<500-treated E. coli.
TI  - Interactions of some common pathogenic bacteria with Acanthamoeba polyphaga.
AB  - Protozoan grazing is a major trophic pathway whereby the biomass re-enters the food web. Nonetheless, not all bacteria are digested by protozoa and the number known to evade digestion, resulting in their environmental augmentation, is increasing. We investigated the interactions of Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with the amoeba, Acanthamoeba polyphaga. There was evidence of predation of all bacterial species except L. monocytogenes and S. aureus, where extracellular numbers were significantly higher when cultured with amoebae compared with growth in the absence of amoebae. Intracellular growth kinetic experiments and fluorescent confocal microscopy suggest that S. aureus survived and may even multiply within A. polyphaga, whereas there was no apparent intra-amoebal replication of L. monocytogenes and higher numbers were likely sustained on metabolic waste products released during coculture.
TI  - Potential sources of microbial contamination of satsuma mandarin fruit in Japan,  from production through packing shed.
AB  - Potential sources of microbial contamination of satsuma mandarin fruit were investigated from production through the packing shed in the 2005 season. Microbial counts in the peel and flesh during the fruit development stage were below 2.4 log CFU/g for bacteria and 3 log CFU/g for fungi, except for the peel in August and September. In the field environment, the highest microbial counts were found in fallen leaves on the ground, followed by soil, organic fertilizer, and agricultural water. Only the pesticide solution collected in July was positive for Salmonella, while no verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli was detected from any of the samples. The bacterial and mold flora in the peel comprised phytopathogenic organisms such as bacteria genus Pantoea and mold genus Mycosphaerella and soilborne organisms such as bacteria genus Bacillus and mold genus Cladosporium, which were found in soil, fallen leaves, agricultural water, and cloth mulch throughout the production season. After fruit harvest and sorting, microbial counts of the peel increased, while those of the flesh remained below the lower limit of detection. Although some of the preharvest sources could also be postharvest sources, some packing shed equipment was assumed to be postharvest sources, because Bacillus cereus was not identified from the fruit in the production field but was detected on the peel after sorting and on equipment such as gloves, plastic harvest basket, and size sorter. These results suggest that using sanitizers for agricultural water and packing sheds to prevent cross-contamination would be useful in a good agricultural practices program of the satsuma mandarin in Japan.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of plant essential oil combinations and interactions with food ingredients.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of plant essential oils  (EOs) in combination and to investigate the effect of food ingredients on their efficacy. The EOs assessed in combination included basil, lemon balm, marjoram, oregano, rosemary, sage and thyme. Combinations of EOs were initially screened against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the spot-on-agar test. The influence of varying concentrations of EO combinations on efficacy was also monitored using E. coli. These preliminary studies showed promising results for oregano in combination with basil, thyme or marjoram. The checkerboard method was then used to quantify the efficacy of oregano, marjoram or thyme in combination with the remainder of selected EOs. Fractional inhibitory concentrations (FIC) were calculated and interpreted as synergy, addition, indifference or antagonism. All the oregano combinations showed additive efficacy against B. cereus, and oregano combined with marjoram, thyme or basil also had an additive effect against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The mixtures of marjoram or thyme also displayed additive effects in combination with basil, rosemary or sage against L. monocytogenes. The effect of food ingredients and pH on the antimicrobial efficacy of oregano and thyme was assessed by monitoring the lag phase and the maximum specific growth rate of L. monocytogenes grown in model media. The model media included potato starch (0, 1, 5 or 10%), beef extract (1.5, 3, 6 or 12%), sunflower oil (0, 1, 5 or 10%) and TSB at pH levels of 4, 5, 6 or 7. The antimicrobial efficacy of EOs was found to be a function of ingredient manipulation. Starch and oils concentrations of 5% and 10% had a negative impact on the EO efficacy. On the contrary, the EOs were more effective at high concentrations of protein, and at pH 5, by comparison with pH 6 or 7. This study suggests that combinations of EOs could minimize application concentrations and consequently reduce any adverse sensory impact in food. However, their application for microbial control might be affected by food composition, therefore, careful selection of EOs appropriate to the sensory and compositional status of the food system is required. This work shows that EOs might be more effective against food-borne pathogens and spoilage bacteria when applied to ready to use foods containing a high protein level at acidic pH, as well as lower levels of fats or carbohydrates.
TI  - Iron(III) complexes: preparation, characterization, antibacterial activity and DNA-binding.
AB  - Iron(III) have been combined to well known quinolones (ciprofloxacin) and some Schiff bases with the help of coordination approach. Characterization of these compounds have been done using elemental analysis, magnetic measurements, thermogravimetric analysis, IR, UV-VIS, (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR spectral investigation. Analytical studies suggest that the iron(III)-quinolone complexes assume a six-coordinated dimeric distorted octahedral geometry. All the compounds show a good antibacterial activity against broad range of bacteria like Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhi and Serratia marcescens, whereas no significant inhibition towards growth of fungal strains like Aspergillus Niger, Aspergillus flavus and Lasiodiplodia theobromae. Analyses of all these compounds show effective sperm herring DNA inhibition.
TI  - Qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the role of Qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins (PRPs) from several gram-positive species with quinolone resistance in vitro. METHODS: A PCR-based strategy was used to clone and express genes coding for Qnr-like PRPs in Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis in Escherichia coli DH10B. MIC values of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones were determined for reference strains and E. coli DH10B harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for PRPs. RESULTS: Amino acid identity of Qnr-like PRPs in gram-positive strains compared with that of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants QnrA1, QnrB1 and QnrS1 was in the range of 16% to 22%. Recombinant plasmids coding for Qnr-like PRPs conferred reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (in the range of 0.016 to 0.064 mg/L for ciprofloxacin) and nalidixic acid (from 6 to 12 mg/L), depending on the antimicrobial agent and PRP. The PRP from B. subtilis showed no protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: The PRPs analysed conferred a reduced susceptibility phenotype in E. coli; the data provide further evidence of the possible roles in quinolone resistance of PRPs from different gram-positive species. These gram-positive species may constitute a reservoir for Qnr-like quinolone resistance proteins.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and biological aspects of novel five-coordinated dimeric-Cu(II) systems.
AB  - The structural and spectroscopic properties of novel five-coordinated dimeric-Cu(II) system have been investigated. The biocidal activities of all eight compounds, ligands, cupric nitrate and standard drugs against six bacteria and three fungi were determined. The DNA interaction activity of complexes was studied using spectrophotometry and electrophoresis. The superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity of the complexes was compared with previously reported monomeric- and dimeric copper complexes. The results support the five-coordinated dimeric square pyramidal geometry for the quinolone-Cu(II) system.
TI  - Bioactive properties and chemical composition of six walnut (Juglans regia L.) cultivars.
AB  - The chemical composition, antioxidant potential and antimicrobial activity were studied in six walnuts (Juglans regia L.) cultivars (cv. Franquette, Lara, Marbot, Mayette, Mellanaise and Parisienne) produced in Portugal. Concerning their chemical composition the main constituent of fruits was fat ranging from 78.83% to 82.14%, being the nutritional value around 720kcal per 100g of fruits. Linoleic acid was the major fatty acid reaching the maximum value of 60.30% (cv. Lara) followed by oleic, linolenic and palmitic acids. The aqueous extracts of walnut cultivars were investigated by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals and beta-carotene linoleate model system. All the walnut extracts exhibited antioxidant capacity in a concentration-dependent manner being the lowest EC(50) values obtained with extracts of cv. Parisienne. Their antimicrobial capacity was also checked against gram positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans), revealing activity against the different tested microorganisms.
TI  - Effects of Rosa rugosa petals on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The effects of pulverized petal of Rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. Growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. However, the growth of Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. In liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of Bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus salivarius. But the growth of E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, and Salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. Hydrolyzable tannins isolated from R. rugosa, rugosin D, and tellimagradin II showed antibacterial activities against E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, and Salmonella sp., but little or no effect against Bif. breve and L. salivarius. R. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. Hydrolyzable tannins in R. rugosa, such as rugosin D and tellimagradin II, must be active constituents.
TI  - Chemical composition, and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of three hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) cultivars.
AB  - Hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) is a very popular dry fruit in the world being consumed in different form and presentations. In the present work, three hazelnut cultivars (cv. Daviana, Fertille de Coutard and M. Bollwiller) produced in Portugal, were characterized in respect to their chemical composition, antioxidant potential and antimicrobial activity. The samples were analysed for proximate constituents (moisture, fat, crude protein, ash), nutritional value and fatty acids profile by GC/FID. Antioxidant potential was accessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals and beta-carotene linoleate model system. Their antimicrobial capacity was also checked against Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). Results showed that the main constituent of fruits was fat ranging from 56% to 61%, being the nutritional value around 650 kcal per 100 g of fruits. Oleic was the major fatty acid varying between 80.67% in cv. F. Coutard and 82.63% in cv. Daviana, followed by linoleic, palmitic, and stearic acids. Aqueous hazelnut extract presented antioxidant activity in a concentration-dependent way, in general with similar behaviour for all cultivars. Hazelnut extracts revealed a high antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria (MIC 0.1 mg/mL) showing a good bioactivity of these fruits.
TI  - Biosorption of nickel, chromium and zinc by MerP-expressing recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli hosts able to over-express metal-binding proteins (MerP) originating from Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus RC607) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas sp. K-62) bacterial strains were used to adsorb Ni(2+), Zn(2+) and Cr(3+) in aqueous solutions. The initial adsorption rate and adsorption capacity were determined to evaluate the performance of the biosorbents. With the expression of MerP protein, the metal adsorption capacity of the recombinant strains for Ni(2+), Zn(2+) and Cr(3+) significantly improved. The cells carrying Gram-positive merP gene (GB) adsorbed Zn(2+) and Cr(3+) at a capacity of 22.3 and 0.98 mmol/g biomass, which is 121% and 72% higher, respectively, over that of the MerP-free host cells. Adsorption capacity of the cells carrying Gram-negative merP gene (GP) also increased 144% and 126% for Zn(2+) and Cr(3+), respectively. Both recombinant strains also exhibited 24% and 5% enhancement in adsorption of Ni(2+) for GB and GP, respectively. The initial adsorption rate of the recombinant biosorbents was also higher than that of the MerP-free host, suggesting an increased metal-binding affinity with MerP expression. Severe cell damage on GB biosorbent was observed after Cr(3+) adsorption, probably due to the metal toxicity effect on the cells.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of diversely substituted indolin-2-ones.
AB  - The synthesis of indolin-2-one derivatives substituted in the 3-position by an aminomethylene group bearing either an ornithine or a lysine residue is described. The inhibitory activities of these compounds toward a panel of eight kinases were examined. Furthermore, the antibacterial activities of the prepared compounds were tested against two Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis, a Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and a yeast Candida albicans.
TI  - Antimicrobial triterpenoids from Vladimiria muliensis.
AB  - A new triterpenoid with a rearranged ursane skeleton, 3beta-acetoxyl-11alpha-methoxybauer-8-en-7alpha-ol ( 1), two new ursane triterpenoids, 1alpha,5alpha-dioxy-11alpha-hydroxyurs-12-en-3-one ( 2) and urs-3beta,13alpha,18beta-triol ( 3), together with three known ursane triterpenoids ( 4- 6) were isolated from the rhizome of Vladimiria muliensis. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic methods (IR, EIMS, HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR, and X-ray crystallography diffraction). Compounds 2 and 4 exhibited modest antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [Influence of chemical analogue of extracellular microbial autoregulators on antilysozyme activity of bacteria].
AB  - Modifying action of C7-alkyloxybenzol (methylresorcin) on the antilysozyme activity (ALA) of opportunistic microorganisms (Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli) was studied. C7-alkyloxybenzol (C7-AOB, methylrezorcin), which was used as chemical analogue of microbial autoregulators, was added to growth medium containing microorganisms, which were cultivated until entered stationary phase. Isolation of clones was performed by seeding of 24-hours broth culture on solid growth medium, and then ALA was measured using photometric method. Modifying action of C7-AOB on ALA characteristic-based population structure of B.cereus, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli was revealed. Maximal effect was detected when the concentration of C7-AOB was in range 1-10 mcg/ml. Decrease of mean ALA level caused by C7-AOB was linked to decrease of proportion of clones with high and intermediate ALA level, increase of proportion of clones with low level of lysozyme inhibitor, and emergence of clones lacking ALA in the population.
TI  - Two new members of streptothricin class antibiotics from Streptomyces qinlingensis sp. nov.
AB  - Four streptothricin-group antibiotics (1~4) were isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces qinlingensis sp. nov. Along with the known antibiotics streptothricins F (1) and D (3), two new members of this class (2, 4) were identified as 12-carbamoyl derivatives of 1 and 3, respectively, mainly by analysis of the IR, HR-MS and NMR spectral data. The antibacterial activities of 1~4 against Escherichia coli (MICs 3.1, 25.0, 3.1 and 12.5 microg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (MICs 6.3, 25.0, 3.1 and 50 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 12.5, >100.0, 6.3, >100.0 microg/ml), Bacillus cereus (MICs 25.0, 50.0, 25.0 and 50.0 microg/ml) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs 50.0, >100.0, 50.0, >100.0 microg/ml) were assayed by micro-broth dilution. The results based on MIC data indicated that 2 and 4 exhibited significantly less potent antibacterial activities when compared to that of 1 and 3.
TI  - Expression and characterization of aiiA gene from Bacillus subtilis BS-1.
AB  - AHL-lactonase (AiiA), a metallo-beta-lactamase produced by Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis, specifically hydrolyzes N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) secreted by Gram-negative bacteria and thereby attenuates the symptoms caused by plant pathogens. In this study, an aiiA gene was cloned from Bacillus subtilis BS-1 by PCR with a pair of degenerate primers. The deduced 250 amino acid sequence contained two small conserved regions, 103SHLHFDH109 and 166TPGHTPGH173, which are characteristic of the metallo-beta-lactamase family. Homology comparison revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence had a high degree of similarity with those of the known AiiA proteins in the B. cereus group. Additionally, the aiiA gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS and the expressed AiiA protein could attenuate the soft rot symptoms caused by Erwinia carotovora var. carotovora.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of different parts of Tribulus terrestris L. growing in Iraq.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of organic and aqueous extracts from fruits, leaves and roots of Tribulus terrestris L., an Iraqi medicinal plant used as urinary anti-infective in folk medicine, was examined against 11 species of pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans using microdilution method in 96 multiwell microtiter plates. All the extracts from the different parts of the plant showed antimicrobial activity against most tested microorganisms. The most active extract against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria was ethanol extract from the fruits with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 0.15 mg/ml against B. subtilis, B. cereus, P. vulgaris and C. diphtheriae. In addition, the same extract from the same plant part demonstrated the strongest antifungal activity against C. albicans with an MIC value of 0.15 mg/ml.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of milkfat globule membrane fractions.
AB  - Milkfat globule membranes (MFGMs) were prepared from bovine cream according to standard procedures. These membranes and peptide hydrolysates, which were generated by proteolysis with immobilized digestive enzymes, were screened for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus gasseri. Assays were first performed on beef heart infusion (BHI) plates spotted with test protein-peptide fractions and then seeded with lawns of indicator cells to monitor the zone of growth inhibition. Under these experimental conditions, MFGMs were most active against Salmonella Typhimurium and P. fluorescens. However, antibacterial activity was not seen after plating on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. We determined that the antimicrobial effects observed on BHI plates were due to the generation of H2O2 by xanthine oxidase, a major protein constituent of the MFGMs, as a result of purine catalysis. This substrate is present in BHI but lacking in LB medium. Evaluation of purified xanthine oxidase alone resulted in analogous data trends. The growth of probiotic Lactobacillus strains were affected only marginally when grown on lactobacilli deMan Rogosa Sharpe plates, suggesting the decreased sensitivity of these bacteria to H2O2. In this study, several MFGM hydrolysates exhibited variable antibacterial activity against test food pathogens on agar plates prepared with M9 minimal media, and this variation was not attributable to xanthine oxidase enzymatic activity. The probiotic microorganisms were mostly resilient to these antibacterial fractions. Bovine MFGM fractions may represent an excellent resource material from which to generate native, naturally occurring biodefensive proteins and/or peptides.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial activity between Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum  essential oils and methanol extracts.
AB  - Essential oils (EOs) and methanol extracts obtained from aerial parts of Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum seeds were evaluated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against nine Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The essential oils and methanol extracts revealed promising antibacterial activities against most pathogens using broth microdilution method. Maximum activity of Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum essential oils and methanol extracts (MIC 15.6 and 62.5mug/ml) were observed against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Proteus vulgaris. Combinations of essential oils and methanol extracts showed an additive action against most tested pathogens especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - A single amino acid change is responsible for evolution of acyltransferase specificity in bacterial methionine biosynthesis.
AB  - Bacteria and yeast rely on either homoserine transsuccinylase (HTS, metA) or homoserine transacetylase (HTA; met2) for the biosynthesis of methionine. Although HTS and HTA catalyze similar chemical reactions, these proteins are typically unrelated in both sequence and three-dimensional structure. Here we present the 2.0 A resolution x-ray crystal structure of the Bacillus cereus metA protein in complex with homoserine, which provides the first view of a ligand bound to either HTA or HTS. Surprisingly, functional analysis of the B. cereus metA protein shows that it does not use succinyl-CoA as a substrate. Instead, the protein catalyzes the transacetylation of homoserine using acetyl-CoA. Therefore, the B. cereus metA protein functions as an HTA despite greater than 50% sequence identity with bona fide HTS proteins. This result emphasizes the need for functional confirmation of annotations of enzyme function based on either sequence or structural comparisons. Kinetic analysis of site-directed mutants reveals that the B. cereus metA protein and the E. coli HTS share a common catalytic mechanism. Structural and functional examination of the B. cereus metA protein reveals that a single amino acid in the active site determines acetyl-CoA (Glu-111) versus succinyl-CoA (Gly-111) specificity in the metA-like of acyltransferases. Switching of this residue provides a mechanism for evolving substrate specificity in bacterial methionine biosynthesis. Within this enzyme family, HTS and HTA activity likely arises from divergent evolution in a common structural scaffold with conserved catalytic machinery and homoserine binding sites.
TI  - Application of gaseous ozone to control populations of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus cereus spores in dried figs.
AB  - The effect of ozonation as a method to reduce Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus cereus spores in dried figs was investigated. Dried figs were sprinkle inoculated with E. coli, B. cereus and B. cereus spores in sterile bags at a level of 10(7)microorganism g(-1), mixed and allowed to dry for 1h at 25 degrees C prior to ozonation. Inoculated samples were exposed to gaseous ozone in a chamber at 20 degrees C and 70% relative humidity. Ozone concentrations of 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 ppm up to 360 min were used to inactivate E. coli and B. cereus while 1.0, 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0 ppm ozone concentrations for 360 min were used to treat B. cereus spores. E. coli and B. cereus counts were decreased by 3.5 log numbers at 1.0 ppm ozone concentration for 360 min ozone treatment. Up to 2 log reductions in the number of B. cereus spores were observed above 1.0 ppm ozone concentration at the end of 360 min of ozonation. No significant changes in color, pH and moisture content values of dried figs were observed after the ozonation treatments. No significant changes were found between sweetness, rancidity, flavor, appearance and overall palatability of ozonated and non-ozonated dried figs. Ozonation was found to be effective especially in reduction of vegetative cells in dried figs and a promising method for the decontamination of dried figs.
TI  - Succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a PCR-based approach.
AB  - The goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using PCR. In a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, PCR enabled detection of Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. Subsequently, Lactobacillus and Pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. Nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of Pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. PCR also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin A producers and accounted for the LAB succession in the fermenting samples. A total of 328 LAB isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which PCR could identify an overwhelming 186 Lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 Pediococcus and 29 Leuconostoc isolates, respectively. Based on antimicrobial assay against target strain Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B640, 28% of the LAB were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin A and mesentericin producers. The bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of Gram-positive target LAB strains and pathogenic bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Inactivation of microbial arginine deiminases by L-canavanine.
AB  - Arginine deiminase (ADI) catalyzes the hydrolytic conversion of L-arginine to ammonia and L-citrulline as part of the energy-producing L-arginine degradation pathway. The chemical mechanism for ADI catalysis involves initial formation and subsequent hydrolysis of a Cys-alkylthiouronium ion intermediate. The structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa ADI-(L-arginine) complex guided the design of arginine analogs that might react with the ADIs to form inactive covalent adducts during catalytic turnover. One such candidate is L-canavanine, in which an N-methylene of L-arginine is replaced by an N-O. This substance was shown to be a slow substrate-producing O-ureido-L-homoserine. An in depth kinetic and mass spectrometric analysis of P. aeruginosa ADI inhibition by L-canavanine showed that two competing pathways are followed that branch at the Cys-alkylthiouronium ion intermediate. One pathway leads to direct formation of O-ureido-L-homoserine via a reactive thiouronium intermediate. The other pathway leads to an inactive form of the enzyme, which was shown by chemical model and mass spectrometric studies to be a Cys-alkylisothiourea adduct. This adduct undergoes slow hydrolysis to form O-ureido-L-homoserine and regenerated enzyme. In contrast, kinetic and mass spectrometric investigations demonstrate that the Cys-alkylthiouronium ion intermediate formed in the reaction of L-canavanine with Bacillus cereus ADI partitions between the product forming pathway (O-ureido-L-homoserine and free enzyme) and an inactivation pathway that leads to a stable Cys-alkylthiocarbamate adduct. The ADIs from Escherichia coli, Burkholderia mallei, and Giardia intestinalis were examined in order to demonstrate the generality of the L-canavanine slow substrate inhibition and to distinguish the kinetic behavior that defines the irreversible inhibition observed with the B. cereus ADI from the time controlled inhibition observed with the P. aeruginosa, E. coli, B. mallei, and G. intestinalis ADIs.
TI  - Lactobacillus isolates from weaned piglets' mucosa with inhibitory activity against common porcine pathogens.
AB  - Twelve lactobacilli isolates from mucosa of 3-5-week-old weaned pigs were found to exert good antimicrobial activity against common porcine pathogens (S. aureus, B. cereus, E. coli, C. perfringens). Two of them produced in addition to lactic acid also considerable amounts of acetic acid, and 6 of them produced hydrogen peroxide and metabolites other than organic acids. Isolates 4/26 and 2/25 (identified as L. crispatus or L. amylovorus) were inhibitory against most strains of S. aureus, B. cereus and E. coli, and especially the strain 4/26 survived well in simulated gastric and intestinal juice. Diarrhea-causing E. coli O8K88H9 Ent(+) was successfully inhibited by the growing culture as well as by the catalase-treated and neutralized supernatant of L. reuteri 12/26. Mucin degradation and multiple resistance to antibiotics were not observed.
TI  - Expression of functional Bacillus SpoIISAB toxin-antitoxin modules in Escherichia coli.
AB  - SpoIISA and SpoIISB proteins from Bacillus subtilis belong to a recently described bacterial programmed-cell death system. The current work demonstrates that the toxin-antitoxin module is also functional in Escherichia coli cells, where the expression of SpoIISA toxin leads to transient growth arrest coupled with cell lysis, and SpoIISA-induced death can be prevented by coexpression of its cognate antitoxin, SpoIISB. Escherichia coli cells appear to be able to escape the SpoIISA killing by activation of a specific, as yet unidentified protease that cleaves out the cytosolic part of the protein. Analysis of the toxic effects of the transmembrane and cytosolic portions of SpoIISA showed that neither of them separately can function as a toxin; therefore, both parts of the protein have to act in concert to exert the killing. This work also identifies genes encoding putative homologues of SpoIISA and SpoIISB proteins on chromosomes of other Bacilli species. The SpoIISA-like proteins from Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus cereus were shown to manifest the same effect on the viability of E. coli as their homologue from B. subtilis. Moreover, expression of the proposed spoIISB-like gene rescues E. coli cells from death induced by the SpoIISA homologue.
TI  - Cleaning and handling implements as potential reservoirs for bacterial contamination of some ready-to-eat foods in retail delicatessen environments.
AB  - This study assessed the association of bacteria with cleaning tools, such as floor mops (n = 25) and cleaning cloths (n = 39), and handling devices, such as disposable plastic gloves (n = 20), used during filled baguette and assorted salad preparation in four selected retail delicatessens in Johannesburg, South Africa. Samples of each cleaning or handling tool were prepared for aerobic (APC), coliform (CC), Escherichia coli (EC), Bacillus cereus (BCC), and Staphylococcus aureus (SAC) counts, as well as tested for the incidence of Listeria monocytogenes (LM) and Salmonella (SALM) by standard plating methods. Bacterial populations attached to the cleaning and handling tools were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Ten selected gram-positive isolates were further analyzed by 16S rRNA sequence analysis and compared with isolates from filled baguettes and assorted salads. The floor mops consistently yielded the highest APCs, CCs, and ECs (5.7, 4.1, and 3.0 log CFU/g, respectively), while gloves had the lowest corresponding counts (3.6, 2.0, and 1.0 log CFU/g, respectively). Low BCCs and SACs were recorded in this study (ca. 1.2 log CFU/g), while SALM and LM were each detected in five cleaning tool samples. SEM showed rods and cocci attached to handling and cleaning tools. Furthermore, results of 16S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that several gram-positive isolates were identified as S. aureus, Staphylococcus pasteuri, Staphylococcus sciuri, and Enterococcus faecalis. Genetically similar strains (100% similarity) were isolated from cleaning and handling tools and associated ready-to-eat (RTE) foods. Cleaning and handling tools may act as reservoirs of contamination for RTE foods during preparation in retail delicatessens in South Africa. The transfer of potential pathogens, such as S. aureus, to foods from cleaning and handling tools may hold food safety implications.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of CAD-1, a chromosomally encoded new class A penicillinase from Carnobacterium divergens.
AB  - Carnobacterium divergens clinical isolates BM4489 and BM4490 were resistant to penicillins but remained susceptible to combinations of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin-tazobactam. Cloning and sequencing of the responsible determinant from BM4489 revealed a coding sequence of 912 bp encoding a class A beta-lactamase named CAD-1. The bla(CAD-1) gene was assigned to a chromosomal location in the two strains that had distinct pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. CAD-1 shared 53% and 42% identity with beta-lactamases from Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. Alignment of CAD-1 with other class A beta-lactamases indicated the presence of 25 out of the 26 isofunctional amino acids in class A beta-lactamases. Escherichia coli harboring bla(CAD-1) exhibited resistance to penams (benzylpenicillin and amoxicillin) and remained susceptible to amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid. Mature CAD-1 consisted of a 34.4-kDa polypeptide. Kinetic analysis indicated that CAD-1 exhibited a narrow substrate profile, hydrolyzing benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and piperacillin with catalytic efficiencies of 6,600, 3,200, and 2,900 mM(-1) s(-1), respectively. The enzyme did not interact with oxyiminocephalosporins, imipenem, or aztreonam. CAD-1 was inhibited by tazobactam (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 0.27 microM), clavulanic acid (IC(50) = 4.7 microM), and sulbactam (IC(50) = 43.5 microM). The bla(CAD-1) gene is likely to have been acquired by BM4489 and BM4490 as part of a mobile genetic element, since it was not found in the susceptible type strain CIP 101029 and was adjacent to a gene for a resolvase.
TI  - Human chitotriosidase is expressed in the eye and lacrimal gland and has an antimicrobial spectrum different from lysozyme.
AB  - Chitotriosidase is a chitinolytic enzyme expressed by maturing macrophages and preformed in neutrophil granules, suggesting a role in antimicrobial defence. Although available evidence supports a role in anti-fungal immunity, there is a lack of an obvious phenotype in humans homozygous for a mutation which renders chitotriosidase inactive. This may be explained by compensatory effects of enzymes co-expressed with chitotriosidase, such as lysozyme. We have found that chitinase is highly expressed in mouse and human eye, particularly in lacrimal glands. Chitotriosidase is the only member of the chitinase/chilectin gene cluster expressed in the murine eye. As lacrimal glands also produce lysozyme, we have asked whether chitotriosidase, in addition to its documented anti-fungal effects, has synergistic anti-bacterial properties with lysozyme. The effect of recombinant chitotriosidase on the growth of five Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus aureus OatA(+/-)) and two Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), were tested in a luminometric assay. Recombinant chitotriosidase did not inhibit bacterial growth and did not synergize with lysozyme. Though the expression of chitotriosidase in the eye supports a role in innate immunity, the antimicrobial spectrum appears to be complementary to lysozyme and may indeed be limited to fungi.
TI  - Biological activity of phenylpropionic acid isolated from a terrestrial Streptomycetes.
AB  - The strain ANU 6277 was isolated from laterite soil and identified as Streptomyces sp. closely related to Streptomyces albidoflavus cluster by 16S rRNA analysis. The cultural, morphological and physiological characters of the strain were recorded. The strain exhibited resistance to chloramphenicol, penicillin and streptomycin. It had the ability to produce enzymes such as amylase and chitinase. A bioactive compound was isolated from the strain at stationary phase of culture and identified as 3-phenylpropionic acid (3-PPA) by FT-IR, EI-MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral studies. It exhibited antimicrobial activity against different bacteria like Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. flourescens, Staphylococcus aureus and some fungi including Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium oxysporum, F. udum and Penicillium citrinum. The antifungal activity of 3-PPA of the strain was evaluated in in vivo and in vitro conditions against Fusarium udum causing wilt disease in pigeon pea. The compound 3-PPA is an effective antifungal agent when compared to tricyclozole (fungicide) to control wilt caused by F. udum, but it exhibited less antifungal activity than carbendazim.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of guava (Psidium guajava L.) and Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.) extracts against foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of guava (Psidium guajava) and neem (Azadirachta indica) extracts against 21 strains of foodborne pathogens were determined--Listeria monocytogenes (five strains), Staphylococcus aureus (four strains), Escherichia coli O157:H7 (six strains), Salmonella Enteritidis (four strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Bacillus cereus, and five food spoilage bacteria: Pseudomonas aeroginosa, P. putida, Alcaligenes faecalis, and Aeromonas hydrophila (two strains). Guava and neem extracts showed higher antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria compared to Gram-negative bacteria except for V. parahaemolyticus, P. aeroginosa, and A. hydrophila. None of the extracts showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Enteritidis. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ethanol extracts of guava showed the highest inhibition for L. monocytogenes JCM 7676 (0.1 mg/mL), S. aureus JCM 2151 (0.1 mg/mL), S. aureus JCM 2179 (0.1 mg/mL), and V. parahaemolyticus IFO 12711 (0.1 mg/mL) and the lowest inhibition for Alcaligenes faecalis IFO 12669, Aeromonas hydrophila NFRI 8282 (4.0 mg/mL), and A. hydrophila NFRI 8283 (4.0 mg/mL). The MIC of chloroform extracts of neem showed similar inhibition for L. monocytogenes ATCC 43256 (4.0 mg/mL) and L. monocytogenes ATCC 49594 (5.0 mg/mL). However, ethanol extracts of neem showed higher inhibition for S. aureus JCM 2151 (4.5 mg/mL) and S. aureus IFO 13276 (4.5 mg/mL) and the lower inhibition for other microorganisms (6.5 mg/mL). No significant effects of temperature and pH were found on guava and neem extracts against cocktails of L. monocytogenes and S. aureus. The results of the present study suggest that guava and neem extracts possess compounds containing antibacterial properties that can potentially be useful to control foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms.
TI  - Identification and expression of GH-8 family chitosanases from several Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies.
AB  - The Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, a member of the Bacillus cereus group, produces chitosanases that catalyze the hydrolysis of chitosan to chitosan-oligosaccharides (COS). Although fungal and bacterial chitosanases belonging to other glycoside hydrolase (GH) families have been characterized in a variety of microorganisms, knowledge on the genetics and phylogeny of the GH-8 chitosanases remains limited. Nine genes encoding chitosanases were cloned from 29 different serovar strains of B. thuringiensis and they were expressed in Escherichia coli. The ORFs of the chitosanases contained 1,359 nucleotides and the protein products had high levels of sequence identity (>96%) to other Bacillus species GH-8 chitosanases. Thin-layer chromatography and HPLC analyses demonstrated that these enzymes hydrolyzed chitosan to a chitosan-trimer and a chitosan-tetramer as major products, and this could be useful in the production of COS. In addition, a simple plate assay was developed, involving a soluble chitosan, for high-throughput screening of chitosanases. This system allowed screening for mutant enzymes with higher enzyme activity generated by error-prone PCR, indicating that it can be used for directed chitosanase evolution.
TI  - Potential and limitation of UVC irradiation for the inactivation of pathogens in  platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathogen contamination, causing transfusion-transmitted diseases, is  an ongoing concern in transfusion of cellular blood products. In this explorative study, the pathogen-inactivating capacity of UVC irradiation in platelet (PLT) concentrates was investigated. The dose dependencies of inactivation of several viruses and bacteria were compared with the effect on PLT quality. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The potential of UVC irradiation was studied with a range of lipid-enveloped (LE) and non-lipid-enveloped viruses (NLE) and bacteria. LE viruses were bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). NLE viruses were canine parvovirus (CPV) and simian virus 40 (SV40). Bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus cereus. After spiking and irradiation, samples were tested for residual infectivity and reduction factors (RFs) were calculated. Furthermore, the effect of UVC irradiation on PLT quality was determined by measuring in vitro quality variables. RESULTS: A UVC dose of 500 J per m(2) resulted in acceptable PLT quality (as measured by pH, lactate production, CD62P expression, and exposure of phosphatidylserine) and high RFs (>4 log) for CPV, TGEV, VSV, S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and E. coli. Intermediate RFs (approx. 3 log) were observed for BVDV, PRV, and B. cereus. Low RFs (approx. 1 log) were found for HIV and SV40. No differences in virus reduction were observed between cell-free and cell-associated virus. CONCLUSION: UVC irradiation is a promising pathogen-reducing technique in PLT concentrates, inactivating bacteria, and a broad range of viruses (with the exception of HIV) under conditions that have limited effects on PLT quality. Further optimization of the UVC procedure, however, is necessary to deal with blood-borne viruses like HIV.
TI  - [Investigation of a foodborne intoxication in a high-density penitentiary center].
AB  - BACKGROUND: On September 25 2005, more than 100 inmates (almost 5% of the 1,800 prison population) experienced sudden onset gastroenteritis. This outbreak was the largest foodborne outbreak described in a prison population in Spain. Our objective was to confirm the outbreak, identify risk factors, implement control measures, and provide recommendations. METHODS: We conducted a cohort analysis of a stratified random sample of all the inmates, a cohort analysis of the one of the prison blocks, and an environmental investigation. RESULTS: A total of 221 inmates were selected, of which 196 were interviewed. Twenty-eight percent had gastroenteritis and the main symptoms were abdominal pain (85%) and diarrhea (71%). All foods consumed caused similar attack rates. Factors associated with the risk of illness were eating the entire portion of seafood cocktail at lunch or all of the fried shrimp at dinner on September 24 (RR = 2; 95% CI, 1.1-3.8, and RR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1). Analysis of one of the prison blocks yielded results similar to those of the random sample. Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli were isolated from a sample of the seafood cocktail. CONCLUSION: A gastroenteritis outbreak caused by several pa-thogens was confirmed. Both the reported symptoms and the calculated incubation periods corresponded to the pathogens isolated. Preparation of food in prison facilities should meet minimum safety standards, including refrigeration and training of food handlers.
TI  - Bioactivity and chemical composition of the leaf essential oils of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium and Zanthoxylum setulosum from Monteverde, Costa Rica.
AB  - The leaf essential oils of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium and Zanthoxylum setulosum (Rutaceae) from Monteverde, Costa Rica have been obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The principal constituents of Z. rhoifolium leaf oil were germacrene D (14.6%), limonene (12.5%), trans-2-hexenal (11.3%), beta-elemene (9.2%), 2-undecanone (9.2%), myrcene (7.9%), bicyclogermacrene (7.5%), and germacrene A (5.2%). The leaf oil of Z. setulosum was composed largely of beta-phellandrene (37.5%), beta-caryophyllene (13.7%), alpha-pinene (11.9%), germacrene D (10.9%), myrcene (5.9%), and nerolidol (5.4%). The essential oils were screened for in-vitro cytotoxic activity against Hep G2, MCF-7, and PC-3 human tumor cell lines; antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli; and for Artemia salina (brine shrimp) lethality. Neither Z. rhoifolium nor Z. setulosum leaf oils exhibited cytotoxicity or antibacterial activity. Both oils showed activity against A. salina.
TI  - Recipes for antimicrobial wine marinades against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica.
AB  - We have evaluated bactericidal activities against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica of several antimicrobial wine recipes, each consisting of red or white wine extracts of oregano leaves with added garlic juice and oregano oil. Dose-response plots were used to determine the percentage of the recipes that resulted in a 50% decrease in colony-forming units (CFU) at 60 min (BA(50)). Studies designed to optimize antibacterial activities of the recipes demonstrated that several combinations of the naturally occurring plant-derived ingredients rapidly inactivated the above mentioned 4 foodborne pathogens. We also showed that (a) incubation temperature affected activities in the following order: 37 degrees C > 21 degrees C > 4 degrees C; (b) varying the initial bacterial concentrations from 10(3) to 10(4) to 10(5) CFU/well did not significantly affect BA(50) values; (c) storage of 3 marinades up to 2 mo did not change their effectiveness against Salmonella enterica; and (d) polyphenolic compounds isolated by chromatography from red wine exhibited exceptional activity at nanogram levels against 2 strains of Bacillus cereus. These observations suggest that antimicrobial wine formulations have the potential to improve the microbiological safety of foods.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of five Zingiberaceae essential oils.
AB  - Essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation and two different solvent extractions (petroleum ether and ethanol) from five Zingiberaceae species: ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe.), galanga (Alpinia galanga Sw.), turmeric (Curcuma longa L.), kaempferia (Boesenbergia pandurata Holtt.) and bastard cardamom (Amomum xanthioides Wall.) was characterized. Volatile components of all extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major components of ginger, turmeric, galangal, bastard cardamom and kaempferia were zingiberene, turmerone, methyl chavicol, and gamma-terpinene, respectively. Their antibacterial effects towards Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes were tested by a disc diffusion assay. Essential oil of kaempferia and bastard cardamom obtained by hydrodistillation extraction could inhibit growth of all tested bacteria. Essential oil of ginger extracted by hydrodistillation had the highest efficiency against three positive strains of bacteria (S. aureus, B. cereus and L. monocytogenes), with a minimum concentration to inhibit B. cereus and L. monocytogenes of 6.25 mg/mL.
TI  - Effects of low electric current (LEC) treatment on pure bacterial cultures.
AB  - AIMS: This research focused on the effects of low electric current (LEC) on the cell viability and metabolic activity of Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Different LEC intensities at fixed amperage were applied, employing either graphite or copper electrode pairs, and the effects were determined by conventional cultural methods and bioindicators. On E. coli, the LEC with graphite electrodes at 5 and 10 mA led to no significant variation, but at 20 and 40 mA there was increasing inhibition of both the enzymatic activities and growth, and a reduction in ATP content. On B. cereus, similar experiments at the lower amperages did not have any inhibitor effects, however, the 40 mA current stimulated growth, ATP content and some enzymatic activities. The LEC treatment using copper electrodes caused, already at 5 mA, inhibition of bacterial growth and metabolic and enzymatic activities in both E. coli and B. cereus. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the obtained results using different amperages and electrodes, we can conclude that E. coli seem to be more sensitive compared with B. cereus. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study increases the knowledge on LEC treatment effects on the pure bacterial cultures.
TI  - Cloning, expression and characterization of a fast self-sufficient P450: CYP102A5 from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - CYP102s represent a family of natural self-sufficient fusions of cytochrome P450  and cytochrome P450 reductase found in some bacteria. One member of this family, named CYP102A1 or more traditionally P450BM-3, has been widely studied as a model of human P450 cytochromes. Remarkable detail of P450 structure and function has been revealed using this highly efficient enzyme. The recent rapid expansion of microbial genome sequences has revealed many relatives of CYP102A1, but to date only two from Bacillus subtilis have been characterized. We report here the cloning and expression of CYP102A5, a new member of this family that is very closely related to CYP102A4 from Bacillus anthracis. Characterization of the substrate specificity of CYP102A5 shows that it, like the other CYP102s, will metabolize saturated and unsaturated fatty acids as well as N-acylamino acids. CYP102A5 catalyzes very fast substrate oxidation, showing one of the highest turnover rates for any P450 monooxygenase studied so far. It does so with more specificity than other CYP102s, yielding primarily omega-1 and omega-2 hydroxylated products. Measurement of the rate of electron transfer through the reductase domain reveals that it is significantly faster in CYP102A5 than in CYP102A1, providing a likely explanation for the increased monooxygenation rate. The availability of this new, very fast fusion P450 will provide a great tool for comparative structure-function studies between CYP102A5 and the other characterized CYP102s.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(II) chelate.
AB  - Some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. Yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. Copper(II) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-N-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. Both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. Some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. I report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(II) chelate. They were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus lactis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (Aspergillus niger). Two clinical isolates of Bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. Both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. The ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except for S. lactis, and its activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. It was highly active against A. niger and moderately active against C. albicans. The chelate was highly active against S. epidermidis and S. cerevisiae. Both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. Since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and related compounds.
AB  - A systematic survey of the antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and some related aromatic aldehydes is reported. A total of 23 different compounds, each at four different concentrations, were studied using a panel of seven microbes (Aspergillus niger, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and employing the paper disc agar diffusion method. Several aldehydes, most notably halogenated, nitro-substituted and hydroxylated salicylaldehydes, displayed highly potent activity against the microbes studied, giving inhibitory zones up to 49 mm in diameter (paper disc diameter 6 mm), while unsubstituted benzaldehyde and salicylaldehyde had minimal activity. Further, 4,6-dimethoxysalicylaldehyde had considerable activity against C albicans and slight activity against S. cerevisiae, while displaying minimal activity against bacteria. Also two aromatic dialdehydes had interesting activity. In general, P. aeruginosa was the least sensitive microbe, a result that is in line with observations from a large screening project, in which this microbe was the one against which the least number of active substances was found. Interestingly, the structure-activity relationships of the aldehydes studied were clearly different for different microbes. Many of the aldehydes tested had such high antimicrobial activity that they are noteworthy candidates for practical applications as well as interesting lead compounds for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs and disinfectants. The structure-activity relationships are discussed in detail. For high activity, substituents are required in benzaldehyde as well as in its 2-hydroxy derivative salicylaldehyde. One hydroxy group alone (at the 2-position) is not enough, but further hydroxylation may produce high activity. The effects of substituents are in some cases dramatic. Halogenation, hydroxylation and nitro substitution may produce highly active compounds, but the effects are not easily predicted nor can they be extrapolated from one microbe to another.
TI  - Carbohydrazones of substituted salicylaldehydes as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum antimicrobials.
AB  - Certain substituted salicylaldehydes are known to have highly potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, but the mechanism underlying this remarkable activity is not known, and almost nothing has been reported on the effects of further modification of the structures, such as the formation of hydrazone-type derivatives. We report now a study on the antimicrobial properties of the carbohydrazone derivatives of several substituted salicylaldehydes. The compounds studied were synthesized from ring-substituted salicylaldehydes and carbohydrazide in the mole ratio 2:1. They were tested against Aspergillus niger, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Staphylococcus epidermidis using the agar diffusion method. The carbohydrazone derived from 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde had distinctly higher activity than the parent aldehyde in the same molar concentration. This activity was limited to one test organism (S. epidermidis), while the free aldehyde had at least some (in some cases even high) activity against all of the microbes studied. All other ones of the effective carbohydrazone compounds were distinctly less active than the parent salicylaldehydes as such. The hydrazones studied had in general a narrower antimicrobial spectrum than the free aldehydes and are thus of interest as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum anti-microbial drugs. The mechanism of action of the aldehydes as well as that of the carbohydrazones is discussed.
TI  - Effect of heat-generated product from uronic acids on the physiological activities of microbial cells and its application.
AB  - Filtered samples of monogalacturonic (GA) and monoglucuronic acids (GL) that were prepared using millipore filter (pore size=0.2 microm) slightly inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli while the autoclaved (at 121 degrees C for 20 min) samples of GA and GL completely inhibited the growth of E. coli. The most effective substance generated upon autoclave treatment was isolated and characterized as trans-4,5-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one (DHCP). The optimal conditions for DHCP generation were also established by autoclaving GA (pH 2.3) at 121 degrees C for 3h. DHCP completely inhibited the growth of E. coli. However, the growth of E. coli was restored when superoxide dismutase and catalase were added to the culture broth that contained DHCP. It was thought that DHCP might have induced the release of active oxygen, which resulted in the inhibition of microbial growth. In the case of gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida brassicae), DHCP inhibited the cell growth. Based on our results, methods for preparation of food preservatives that contained pectin degraded products (oligo-galacturonic acid and monogalacturonic acid) and DHCP were developed. The preservatives were very effective in inhibiting the growth of E. coli and S. cerevisiae.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of a bacteriocin-like substance produced by Bacillus sp. P34 that targets the bacterial cell envelope.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the mode of action of BLS P34, a bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) produced by a novel Bacillus sp. strain P34 isolated from the Amazon basin. The effect of the BLS was tested against Listeria monocytogenes, showing a bactericidal effect at 200 AU (activity units) ml(-1), while no inhibition of spore outgrowth of Bacillus cereus was observed with a dose of 1,600 AU ml(-1). Growth of Escherichia coli and Salmonella Enteritidis was inhibited, but only when the chelating agent EDTA was co-added with the BLS. The effect of BLS P34 on L. monocytogenes was also investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Treated cells showed an important frequency increase in 1,452 and 1,397 cm(-1) and decrease in 1,217 and 1,058 cm(-1), corresponding assignments of fatty acids and phospholipids. Transmission electron microscopy showed damaged cell envelope and loss of protoplasmic material. BLS P34 was bactericidal to Gram-positive, and also showed inhibitory effect against Gram-negative bacteria. There is evidence that its mode of action corresponds to that of a membrane-active substance. The knowledge about the mode of action of this BLS is essential to determine its effective application as an antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Cr(III), Fe(III) and Co(III) complexes of tetradentate (ONNO) Schiff base ligands: synthesis, characterization, properties and biological activity.
AB  - A series of metal complexes were synthesized from equimolar amounts of Schiff bases: 1,4-bis[3-(2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldimine)propyl]piperazine (bappnaf) and 1,8-bis[3-(2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldimine)-p-menthane (damnaf) with metal chlorides. All of synthesized compounds were characterized by elemental analyses, spectral (UV-vis, IR, (1)H-(13)C NMR, LC-MS) and thermal (TGA-DTA) methods, magnetic and conductance measurements. Schiff base complexes supposed in tetragonal geometry have the general formula [M(bappnaf or damnaf)]Cl.nH(2)O, where M=Cr(III), Co(III) and n=2, 3. But also Fe(III) complexes have octahedral geometry by the coordination of two water molecules and the formula is [Fe(bappnaf or damnaf)(H(2)O)(2)]Cl. The changes in the selected vibration bands in FT-IR indicate that Schiff bases behave as (ONNO) tetradentate ligands and coordinate to metal ions from two phenolic oxygen atoms and two azomethine nitrogen atoms. Conductance measurements suggest 1:1 electrolytic nature of the metal complexes. The synthesized compounds except bappnaf ligand have the antimicrobial activity against the bacteria: Escherichia coli (ATCC 11230), Yersinia enterocolitica (ATCC 1501), Bacillus magaterium (RSKK 5117), Bacillus subtilis (RSKK 244), Bacillus cereus (RSKK 863) and the fungi: Candida albicans (ATCC 10239). These results have been considerably interest in piperazine derivatives due to their significant applications in antimicrobial studies.
TI  - Effectiveness of trisodium phosphate, acidified sodium chlorite, citric acid, and peroxyacids against pathogenic bacteria on poultry during refrigerated storage.
AB  - The effects of dipping treatments (15 min) in potable water or in solutions (wt/vol) of 12% trisodium phosphate (TSP), 1,200 ppm acidified sodium chlorite (ASC), 2% citric acid (CA), and 220 ppm peroxyacids (PA) on inoculated pathogenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, and Yersinia enterocolitica) and skin pH were investigated throughout storage of chicken legs (days 0, 1, 3, and 5) at 3 +/- 1 degrees C. All chemical solutions reduced microbial populations (P < 0.001) as compared with the control (untreated) samples. Similar bacterial loads (P > 0.05) were observed on water-dipped and control legs. Type of treatment, microbial group, and sampling day influenced microbial counts (P < 0.001). Average reductions with regard to control samples were 0.28 to 2.41 log CFU/g with TSP, 0.33 to 3.15 log CFU/g with ASC, 0.82 to 1.97 log CFU/g with CA, and 0.07 to 0.96 log CFU/g with PA. Average reductions were lower (P < 0.001) for gram-positive (0.96 log CFU/g) than for gram-negative (1.33 log CFU/g) bacteria. CA and ASC were the most effective antimicrobial compounds against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. TSP was the second most effective compound for both bacterial groups. Average microbial reductions per gram of skin were 0.87 log CFU/g with TSP, 0.86 log CFU/g with ASC, 1.39 log CFU/g with CA, and 0.74 log CFU/g with PA for gram-positive bacteria, and 1.28 log CFU/g with TSP, 2.03 log CFU/g with ASC, 1.23 log CFU/g with CA, and 0.78 log CFU/g with PA for gram-negative bacteria. With only a few exceptions, microbial reductions in TSP- and ASC-treated samples decreased and those in samples treated with CA increased throughout storage. Samples treated with TSP and samples dipped in CA and ASC had the highest and lowest pH values, respectively, after treatment. The pH of the treated legs tended to return to normal (6.3 to 6.6) during storage. However, at the end of storage, the pH of legs treated with TSP remained higher and that of legs treated with CA remained lower than normal.
TI  - Development of flexible antimicrobial films using essential oils as active agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity in the vapor-phase of laboratory-made flexible films of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (PE/EVOH) incorporating essential oil of cinnamon ( Cinnamomum zeylanicum), oregano ( Origanum vulgare), clove ( Syzygium aromaticum), or cinnamon fortified with cinnamaldehyde was evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms: the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis; the Gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis; the molds Penicillium islandicum, Penicillium roqueforti, Penicillium nalgiovense, Eurotium repens, and A spergillus flavus and the yeasts Candida albicans, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Zigosaccharomyces rouxii. Films with a nominal concentration of 4% (w/w) of fortified cinnamon or oregano essential oil completely inhibited the growth of the fungi; higher concentrations were required to inhibit the Gram-positive bacteria (8 and 10%, respectively), and higher concentrations still were necessary to inhibit the Gram-negative bacteria. PP films were more effective than PE/EVOH films. The atmospheres generated by the antimicrobial films inside Petri dishes were quantitatively analyzed using headspace-single drop microextraction (HS-SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The analyses showed that the oregano-fortified PP films released higher levels of carvacrol and thymol, and the cinnamon-fortified PP films released higher levels of cinnamaldehyde, during the first 3-6 h of incubation, than the corresponding PE/EVOH films. Shelf-life tests were also performed, demonstrating that the antifungal activities of the films persisted for more than two months after their manufacture. In addition, migration tests (overall and specific) were performed, using both aqueous and fatty simulants, to ensure that the films meet EU regulations regarding food contact materials. Following contact with the tested films, the substances that had migrated into the aqueous simulants were recovered by direct immersion-single drop extraction (DI-SDME) and then analyzed by GC-MS. The fatty stimulant (isooctane) was directly injected into the chromatographic system.
TI  - Construction, crystal structure and application of a recombinant protein that lacks the collagen-like region of BclA from Bacillus anthracis spores.
AB  - Spores of Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, are enclosed by an  exosporium, which consists of a basal layer surrounded by a nap of hair-like filaments. The major structural component of the filaments is called BclA, which comprises a central collagen-like region (CLR) and a globular C-terminal domain. Here, the entire CLR coding sequence of BclA was removed, and the resulting protein (tBclA) produced in Escherichia coli. The crystallographic structure of tBclA was determined to 1.35 A resolution, and consists of an all-beta structure with a TNF-like jelly fold topology (12 beta-strands which form 2 beta-sheets of five strands each) consistent with previous studies on wild-type BclA. These globular domains are tightly packed into trimeric structures (surface shape complementarity; S (c) = 0.83), demonstrating that formation of the core structure of BclA is independent of the anchoring collagen-like region. A polyclonal antibody raised against tBclA recognized B. anthracis spores directly, and showed little cross-reactivity (<10%) with the spores of the closely related species Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis, when compared to two other polyclonal antibodies raised against B. anthracis spore extracts and inactivated spores. The tBclA protein was used to purify a pool of specific antibodies from bovine colostrum whey samples from cows inoculated with the Sterne strain anthrax vaccine, which also showed reactivity with B. anthracis spores. Together, these results demonstrate that tBclA provides a safer and more effective way to the production and purification of antibodies with high binding affinity for B. anthracis spores. Biotechnol.

TI  - Phenolic compounds and antimicrobial activity of olive (Olea europaea L. Cv. Cobrancosa) leaves.
AB  - We report the determination of phenolic compounds in olive leaves by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, and the evaluation of their in vitro activity against several microorganisms that may be causal agents of human intestinal and respiratory tract infections, namely gram positive (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). Seven phenolic compounds were identified and quantified: caffeic acid, verbascoside, oleuropein, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, rutin, apigenin 7-O-glucoside and luteolin 4'-O-glucoside. At low concentrations olive leaves extracts showed an unusual combined antibacterial and antifungal action, which suggest their great potential as nutraceuticals, particularly as a source of phenolic compounds.
TI  - Structure and biological activities of beta toxin from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Beta toxin is a neutral sphingomyelinase secreted by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus. This virulence factor lyses erythrocytes in order to evade the host immune system as well as scavenge nutrients. The structure of beta toxin was determined at 2.4-A resolution using crystals that were merohedrally twinned. This structure is similar to that of the sphingomyelinases of Listeria ivanovii and Bacillus cereus. Beta toxin belongs to the DNase I folding superfamily; in addition to sphingomyelinases, the proteins most structurally related to beta toxin include human endonuclease HAP1, Escherichia coli endonuclease III, bovine pancreatic DNase I, and the endonuclease domain of TRAS1 from Bombyx mori. Our biological assays demonstrated for the first time that beta toxin kills proliferating human lymphocytes. Structure-directed active site mutations show that biological activities, including hemolysis and lymphotoxicity, are due to the sphingomyelinase activity of the enzyme.
TI  - Food-poisoning and commercial air travel.
AB  - With the introduction of budget airlines and greater competitiveness amongst all  airlines, air travel has now become an extremely popular form of travel, presenting its own unique set of risks from food poisoning. Foodborne illness associated with air travel is quite uncommon in the modern era. However, when it occurs, it may have serious implications for passengers and when crew are affected, has the potential to threaten safety. Quality, safe, in-flight catering relies on high standards of food preparation and storage; this applies at the airport kitchens (or at subcontractors' facilities), on the aircraft and in the transportation vehicles which carry the food from the ground source to the aircraft. This is especially challenging in certain countries. Several foodborne outbreaks have been recorded by the airline industry as a result of a number of different failures of these systems. These have provided an opportunity to learn from past mistakes and current practice has, therefore, reached such a standard so as to minimise risk of failures of this kind. This review examines: (i) the origin of food safety in modern commercial aviation; (ii) outbreaks which have occurred previously relating to aviation travel; (iii) the microbiological quality of food and water on board commercial aircraft; and (iv) how Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points may be employed to maintain food safety in aviation travel.
TI  - Influence of the probiotic Bacillus cereus var. toyoi on the intestinal immunity  of piglets.
AB  - In a feeding trial, sows and piglets were fed with the probiotic bacterium Bacillus cereus var. toyoi as a feed additive, and the effects on immune cell populations were examined. The development of the gut immune system was determined for piglets at the ages of 14, 28, 35 and 56 days post partum. Tissue samples of the Jejunum and the continuous Peyer's patch were used for enumeration of intraepithelial lymphocyte populations by fluorescence activated flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Both independent methods of investigation led to similar results: the population of intraepithelial CD8+ T cells was significantly enhanced in the probiotic group piglets (p< or =0.05), and the numbers of gammadelta T cells tended to be higher in the intestinal epithelium (p<0.1) at the time of weaning (day 28). Lamina propria lymphocytes were also influenced by the treatment. Application of B. cereus var. toyoi resulted in significantly more CD25+ lymphocytes and gammadelta T cells in the probiotic group post-weaning. The occurrence of pathogenic Escherichia coli serogroups was also less frequent in the feces of piglets from the probiotic group. The finding that the CD8+ T cell population in the intestinal mucosa showed changes on day 28 indicated that the influence of B. cereus var. toyoi supplementation on the intestinal immune system started before weaning, an observation supported by changes in the intestinal microflora observed during the suckling-period. The results suggest that feeding of B. cereus var. toyoi to sows may result in beneficial effects on piglet health status independent of their feed supplementation.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic and biological aspects of iron(II) complexes.
AB  - Five novel coordinated complexes of iron(II) with ciprofloxacin and neutral bidentate ligands have been prepared and characterized using elemental analyses, magnetic measurements, IR spectra, UV-VIS spectral, thermogravimetric analyses, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR. The antimicrobial activity of the individual ligands, metal salt and metal complexes with respect to Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus and Lasiodiplodia theobromae were evaluated by the agar-plate technique in comparison to reference standard drugs (ofloxacin, levofloxacin and fluconozole). Binding of the complexes to DNA was studied and is discussed.
TI  - Maintenance of sterility in 1-mL polypropylene syringes.
AB  - PURPOSE: The sterility of syringes filled with a growth-promoting broth when stored under various temperature conditions was studied. METHODS: Samples of tryptic soy broth (TSB) were injected into 150 1-mL polypropylene syringes and incubated at 33-37 degrees C for 14 days, after which time they were visually inspected for microbial contamination. In addition to visual inspection, the sterility of all syringes was tested by inoculating samples into 10-mL tubes of thioglycollate broth, incubating at 35 degrees C, and observing for growth for 5 days. After the 14-day incubation period, 30 syringes were removed for sterility validation and microbial growth promotion. TSB from 15 syringes was transferred into sterile culture tubes and challenged with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. The remaining 120 syringes were repackaged and stored at room temperature (22 degrees C), in a refrigerator (5 degrees C), or in a freezer (-20 degrees C). The sterility of the samples was evaluated at 30 days, 45 days, three months, and six months. RESULTS: No microbial growth was detected by visual inspection in any of the 15 syringes examined for turbidity during validation testing. All study syringes (n = 120) remained sterile throughout the respective evaluation periods, regardless of storage condition. CONCLUSION: Growth-promoting broth stored in 1-mL polypropylene syringes remained sterile when stored at room temperature, in a refrigerator, or in a freezer for six months.
TI  - A systematic review of the clinical, public health and cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests for the detection and identification of bacterial intestinal pathogens in faeces and food.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of tests for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning in clinical and public health practice and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these assays in a hypothetical population in order to inform policy on the use of these tests. DATA SOURCES: Studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests were retrieved using electronic databases and handsearching reference lists and key journals. Hospital laboratories and test manufacturers were contacted for cost data, and clinicians involved in the care of patients with food poisoning were invited to discuss the conclusions of this review using the nominal group technique. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of the current medical literature on assays used for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning was carried out. Specific organisms under review were Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus. Data extraction was undertaken using standardised data extraction forms. Where a sufficient number of studies evaluating comparable tests were identified, meta-analysis was performed. A decision analytic model was developed, using effectiveness data from the review and cost data from hospitals and manufacturers, which contributed to an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of rapid tests in a hypothetical UK population. Finally, diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness results were presented to a focus group of GPs, microbiologists and consultants in communicable disease control, to assess professional opinion on the use of rapid tests in the diagnosis of food poisoning. RESULTS: Good test performance levels were observed with rapid test methods, especially for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. The estimated levels of diagnostic accuracy using the area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was very high. Indeed, although traditional culture is the natural reference test to use for comparative statistical analysis, on many occasions the rapid test outperforms culture, detecting additional 'truly' positive cases of food-borne illness. The significance of these additional positives requires further investigation. Economic modelling suggests that adoption of rapid tests in combination with routine culture is unlikely to be cost-effective, however, as the cost of rapid technologies decreases; total replacement with rapid technologies may be feasible. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively poor quality of reporting of studies evaluating rapid detection methods, the reviewed evidence shows that PCR for Campylobacter, Salmonella and E. coli O157 is potentially very successful in identifying pathogens, possibly detecting more than the number currently reported using culture. Less is known about the benefits of testing for B. cereus, C. perfringens and S. aureus. Further investigation is needed on how clinical outcomes may be altered if test results are available more quickly and at a greater precision than in the current practice of bacterial culture.
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some new 1,3,4-thiadiazole and 1,2,4-triazole compounds having a D,L-methionine moiety.
AB  - New 1,3,4-thiadiazole, 5a-e, and 1,2,4-triazolecompounds 6a-c, containing a D,L-methionine moiety were synthesized by intramolecular cyclization of 1,4-disubstituted thiosemicarbazides 4a-e in acid and alkaline media, respectively. The potential antimicrobial effects of the synthesized compounds were investigated using the Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus antracis ATCC 8705, Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987, Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 strains. The newly synthesized compounds exhibited promising activities against Bacillus antracis and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Synthesis, structure and antimicrobial activity of manganese(II) and cobalt(II) complexes of the polyether ionophore antibiotic Sodium Monensin A.
AB  - Mononuclear neutral manganese(II) and cobalt(II) complexes with the antibiotic Sodium Monensin A (Mon-Na, 1b) were synthesized and characterized. The crystal structures of M(Mon-Na)2Cl2.H2O (M=Mn, 2; M=Co, 3) were determined by X-ray crystallography. The complexes crystallize in monoclinic space group C2 with a tetrahedrally coordinated transition metal attached to oxygen atoms of deprotonated carboxyl groups of two Sodium Monensin molecules and two chloride ions. The sodium ion remains in the cavity of the ligand and cannot be replaced by Mn(II) or Co(II). The complexes were additionally characterized by different spectroscopic techniques (UV-Visible, EPR, FAB-MS). A preferable octahedral environment around the transition metal centers is observed in polar solvents while the complexes retain their tetrahedral structure in non-polar media. The antimicrobial activity of 1b, 2 and 3 was tested against Gram(+) and Gram(-) bacteria.
TI  - Broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by Manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
AB  - Although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. Here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. After being treated with Manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of Pichia pastoris was slightly affected. Microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and loss of cell mobility. Viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed E. coli and B. subtilis cells. Under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) were killed. In the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than L-dopa, N-acetyldopamine (NADA) or N-beta-alanyldopamine (NBAD) did, suggesting that DHI and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. The antifungal activity of DHI was detected using P. pastoris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Beauveria bassiana. These results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (DCE)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial cell division protein FtsZ by cinnamaldehyde.
AB  - Cinnamaldehyde is a natural product from spices that inhibits cell separation in  Bacillus cereus. Cell division is regulated by FtsZ, a prokaryotic homolog of tubulin. FtsZ assembles into the Z-ring at the site of cell division. Here, we report the effect of cinnamaldehyde on FtsZ and hence on the cell division apparatus. Cinnamaldehyde decreases the in vitro assembly reaction and bundling of FtsZ. It is found that cinnamaldehyde perturbs the Z-ring morphology in vivo and reduces the frequency of the Z ring per unit cell length of Escherichia coli. In addition, GTP dependent FtsZ polymerization is inhibited by cinnamaldehyde. Cinnamaldehyde inhibits the rate of GTP hydrolysis and binds FtsZ with an affinity constant of 1.0+/-0.2 microM(-1). Isothermal titration calorimetry reveals that binding of cinnamaldehyde to FtsZ is driven by favorable enthalpic interactions. Further, we map the cinnamaldehyde binding region of FtsZ, using the saturation transfer difference-nuclear magnetic resonance and an in silico docking model. Both predict the cinnamaldehyde binding pocket at the C terminal region involving the T7 loop of FtsZ. Our results show that cinnamaldehyde binds FtsZ, perturbs the cytokinetic Z-ring formation and inhibits its assembly dynamics. This suggests that cinnamaldehyde, a small molecule of plant origin, is a potential lead compound that can be developed as an anti-FtsZ agent towards drug design.
TI  - Substrate analysis of homoserine acyltransferase from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Substrate specificity within the family of enzymes designated as homoserine transsuccinylases is variable, with some organisms utilizing succinyl-CoA and other organisms utilizing acetyl-CoA. In this study it is shown that the enzyme from Bacillus cereus uses acetyl-CoA as its acyl donor, but its catalytic rate is significantly lower than other HTS family members. BcHTS is inactivated by both iodoacetamide and diethyl pyrocarbonate and the enzyme can be partially protected from inactivation by the presence of succinyl-CoA. This leads to the conclusion that BcHTS can bind both acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA and suggests that it may represent an intermediate between the succinate-transferring HTS family members and the acetate-transferring HTS family members. The B. cereus enzyme was unable to rescue growth of an Escherichia coli strain lacking a functional transsuccinylase, however.
TI  - Walnut (Juglans regia L.) leaves: phenolic compounds, antibacterial activity and  antioxidant potential of different cultivars.
AB  - Different cultivars of walnut (Juglans regia L.) leaves (Cv. Lara, Franquette, Mayette, Marbot, Mellanaise and Parisienne) grown in Portugal, were investigated in what concerns phenolic compounds and antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Phenolics analysis was performed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD and 10 compounds were identified and quantified: 3- and 5-caffeoylquinic acids, 3- and 4-p-coumaroylquinic acids, p-coumaric acid, quercetin 3-galactoside, quercetin 3-pentoside derivative, quercetin 3-arabinoside, quercetin 3-xyloside and quercetin 3-rhamnoside. The antimicrobial capacity was screened against Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). Walnut leaves selectively inhibited the growth of Gram positive bacteria, being B. cereus the most susceptible one (MIC 0.1mg/mL). Gram negative bacteria and fungi were resistant to the extracts at 100mg/mL. Lara walnut leaves were also submitted to antibacterial assays using 18 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus sp. Antioxidant activity was accessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals and beta-carotene linoleate model system. In a general way, all of the studied walnut leaves cultivars presented high antioxidant activity (EC(50) values lower than 1mg/mL), being Cv. Lara the most effective one.
TI  - Nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dNKs). METHODS: Several FDA-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. We identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Listeria monocytogenes. These genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dNK-deficient E. coli strain to various analogues. We overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from S. enterica and B. cereus. RESULTS: The tested Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microM except for a single E. coli isolate and two Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested AZT concentrations. Purified recombinant S. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated AZT efficiently with a Km of 73.3 microM and k(cat)/Km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) M(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-Difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against Gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microM. The B. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a Km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microM and k(cat)/Km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) M(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. S. enterica and B. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dNK enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial dNKs efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. Therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.
TI  - Prediction and assignment of function for a divergent N-succinyl amino acid racemase.
AB  - The protein databases contain many proteins with unknown function. A computational approach for predicting ligand specificity that requires only the sequence of the unknown protein would be valuable for directing experiment-based assignment of function. We focused on a family of unknown proteins in the mechanistically diverse enolase superfamily and used two approaches to assign function: (i) enzymatic assays using libraries of potential substrates, and (ii) in silico docking of the same libraries using a homology model based on the most similar (35% sequence identity) characterized protein. The results matched closely; an experimentally determined structure confirmed the predicted structure of the substrate-liganded complex. We assigned the N-succinyl arginine/lysine racemase function to the family, correcting the annotation (L-Ala-D/L-Glu epimerase) based on the function of the most similar characterized homolog. These studies establish that ligand docking to a homology model can facilitate functional assignment of unknown proteins by restricting the identities of the possible substrates that must be experimentally tested.
TI  - Microbial production of 4-hydroxybenzylidene acetone, the direct precursor of raspberry ketone.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the enzymatic aldol reaction between acetone as a donor and  4-hydroxybenzaldehyde as a receptor to generate 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-but-3-ene-2-one or 4-hydroxybenzylidene acetone, the direct precursor of 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-butan-2-one or raspberry ketone, using different species of filamentous fungi and bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Different classes of micro-organisms were tested in a medium containing mainly acetone and 4-hydoxybenzaldehyde. Of the micro-organisms tested, only bacteria were able to synthesize significant amounts of 4-hydroxybenzylidene acetone, ranging from 15 to 160 mg l(-1) after 21 h of bioconversion, as a function of the bacteria tested. CONCLUSIONS: The biological production of 4-hydroxybenzylidene acetone has been described with bacteria possessing 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA, EC 4.1.2.4). This result suggests that DERA is involved in the catalytic aldolization of precursors for the production of 4-hydroxybenzylidene acetone. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Raspberry ketone or frambinone represents a total market value of between euro6 million and euro10 million. The possibility of producing its direct precursor through a simple process using bacteria is of considerable interest to the flavour market and the food industry as a whole. This paper broadens the spectrum for the use of aldolase to achieve the biological synthesis of compounds of interest.
TI  - Epsilon-poly-L-lysine and nisin A act synergistically against Gram-positive food-borne pathogens Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - AIMS: To test epsilon-poly-L-lysine and nisin A for possible synergistic activity against selected food-borne pathogens and food spoilage organisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Synergistic activity was observed against Gram-positive Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus cells and spores of B. cereus in 96 well plate assays. However, nisin A had no effect alone or in combination with epsilon-poly-L-lysine against Gram-negative Escherichia coli cells. In addition, when tested against yeast Zygosaccharomyces bailii, nisin A and partially inhibitory concentrations of epsilon-poly-L-lysine antagonized each other. CONCLUSIONS: Nisin A and epsilon-poly-L-lysine showed synergistic activity against B. cereus and L. monocytogenes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The application of nisin A and epsilon-poly-L-lysine is a promising all-natural method of controlling Gram-positive food-borne pathogens, spores and spoilage organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of Indian Berberis species.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of hydroalcoholic extracts of four Berberis species viz. Berberis aristata, Berberis asiatica, Berberis chitria and Berberis lycium were tested against eleven bacterial and eight fungal strains. B. aristata root extract gave low MICs values against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus flavus while stem extract against B. cereus and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Flagellin (FliC) protein sequence diversity among Bacillus thuringiensis does not correlate with H serotype diversity.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the fliC gene encodes flagellin, the protein responsible for eliciting the immunological reaction in H serotyping. Here, the presence of the flagellin fliC gene was studied in 86 Bacillus thuringiensis strains encompassing 67 H serotypes. Nineteen strains from four additional species in the B. cereus sensu lato group, B. cereus, B. anthracis, B. mycoides, and B. weihenstephanensis, were added for comparison purposes. The fliC genes were amplified, cloned and their nucleotide sequences determined and translated into amino acid sequences. A bootstrapped neighbor-joining tree was generated from the alignment of the translated amino acid sequences of the amplicons. Although most B. thuringiensis H serotypes had different flagellin amino acid sequences, some different B. thuringiensis serovars shared identical flagellin amino acid sequences. In addition, although serovars from the same H serotype were sometimes found clustered together, several serovars from the same H serotype carried flagellins with sufficiently different amino acid sequences as to be located on distant clusters. No correlations could be established between flagellin (FliC) protein sequence diversity among B. thuringiensis H serotypes and H serotype diversity. These suggest that the B. thuringiensis fliC gene does not code for the flagellin copy responsible for eliciting the immunological reaction in H serotyping. In a previous study, the authors have shown that the B. thuringiensis hag gene codes for the flagellin copy responsible for eliciting the immunological reaction in H serotyping. It is proposed that the B. thuringiensis fliC gene studied here be renamed and that the so-called hag gene studied before be renamed fliC, both in accordance with the E. coli nomenclature.
TI  - Antibacterial properties and major bioactive components of cinnamon stick (Cinnamomum burmannii): activity against foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Cinnamomum burmannii Blume (cinnamon stick) from Indonesia is a little-investigated spice. In this study, the antibacterial activity, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of cinnamon stick extract were evaluated against five common foodborne pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella anatum). Cinnamon stick extract exhibited significant antibacterial properties. Major compounds in cinnamon stick were tentatively identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography (LC-MS) as a predominant volatile oil component ((E)-cinnamaldehyde) and several polyphenols (mainly proanthocyanidins and (epi)catechins). Both (E)-cinnamaldehyde and proanthocyanidins significantly contributed to the antibacterial properties. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe morphological changes of bacteria treated with the crude extract of cinnamon stick and its major components. This study suggests that cinnamon stick and its bioactive components have potential for application as natural food preservatives.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of tert-butyl [1-benzyl-2[(4-aryl-2-thiazolyl)hydrazono]ethyl]carbamate derivatives.
AB  - The increasing clinical importance of drug-resistant fungal and bacterial pathogens has lent additional urgency to microbiological research and new antibacterial compound development. For this purpose, new tert-butyl[1-benzyl-2[(4-aryl-2-thiazolyl)hydrazono]ethyl]carbamate derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity. The reaction of Boc-L-phenylalaninal with thiosemicarbazide gave the thiosemicarbazone which furnished the title compounds by reaction with phenacyl bromides. The newly synthesized compounds were screened for antibacterial activity and toxicity. While microdilution broth susceptibility assay was used for the antibacterial activity evaluation of the compounds against the strains E. coli (NRRL B-3704), M. luteus (NRRL B-4375), B. cereus (NRRL B-3711), P. aeruginosa (NRRL B-23), and S. fecalis (NRRL B-14617), the Artemia salina 96-well assay was used to determine cytotoxicities of the compounds. Observations obtained from the bioassays showed that some of the compounds are highly active against E. coli, M. luteus, and B. cereus when compared with the control agent and showed low toxicity.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of new aliphatic sulfonamide.
AB  - A series of novel aliphatic sulfonamide derivatives (1-7) were synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, FT-IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and LC-MS techniques. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated in vitro as antimicrobial agents against representative strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25953, Bacillus cereus ATCC 6633 and Listeria monocytogenes ATCC Li6 (isolate), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 11230) and antifungal agent against Candida albicans (clinical isolate) by both disc diffusion and minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) methods. All these bacteria and fungus studied were screened against some antibiotics to compare with our chemicals' zone diameters. Our aliphatic sulfonamides have highest powerful antibacterial activity for Gram-negative bacteria than Gram-positive bacteria and antibacterial activity decreases as the length of the carbon chain increases.
TI  - New triazole and triazolothiadiazine derivatives as possible antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Triazole and triazoles fused with six-membered ring systems are found to possess  diverse applications in the fields of medicine, agriculture and industry. The new 1,2,4-triazole and 1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazine derivatives were synthesized as novel antimicrobial agents. The reaction of 1H-indol-3-acetic acid with thiocarbohydrazide gave the 4-amino-3-mercapto-5-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole. The reaction of triazole with arylaldehydes in ethanol gave the 4-arylideneamino-3-mercapto-5-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazoles (I). The 3-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]-6-aryl-7H-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazines (II) were obtained by condensing triazole with phenacyl bromides in absolute ethanol . The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, (1)H NMR and FAB(+)-MS spectral data. Their antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus (NRLL B-4375), Bacillus cereus (NRRL B-3711), Proteus vulgaris (NRRL B-123), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Staphylococcus aureus (NRRL B-767), Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Candida albicans and Candida glabrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi University, Faculty of Medicine) were investigated and significant activity was obtained.
TI  - A functional homing endonuclease in the Bacillus anthracis nrdE group I intron.
AB  - The essential Bacillus anthracis nrdE gene carries a self-splicing group I intron with a putative homing endonuclease belonging to the GIY-YIG family. Here, we show that the nrdE pre-mRNA is spliced and that the homing endonuclease cleaves an intronless nrdE gene 5 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the intron insertion site, producing 2-nt 3' extensions. We also show that the sequence required for efficient cleavage spans at least 4 bp upstream and 31 bp downstream of the cleaved coding strand. The position of the recognition sequence in relation to the cleavage position is as expected for a GIY-YIG homing endonuclease. Interestingly, nrdE genes from several other Bacillaceae were also susceptible to cleavage, with those of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis (nrdE1), B. anthracis, and Bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian being better substrates than those of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus lichenformis, and S. epidermidis (nrdE2). On the other hand, nrdE genes from Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Corynebacterium ammoniagenes were not cleaved. Intervening sequences (IVSs) residing in protein-coding genes are often found in enzymes involved in DNA metabolism, and the ribonucleotide reductase nrdE gene is a frequent target for self-splicing IVSs. A comparison of nrdE genes from seven gram-positive low-G+C bacteria, two bacteriophages, and Nocardia farcinica showed five different insertion sites for self-splicing IVSs within the coding region of the nrdE gene.
TI  - Vapor-phase activities of cinnamon, thyme, and oregano essential oils and key constituents against foodborne microorganisms.
AB  - The aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. In a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (EOs)-cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and oregano (Origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms, including Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis), molds (Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (Candida albicans). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were generally lower for oregano EO than for the thyme and cinnamon EOs, especially against the relatively resistant Gram-negative. The persistence of the EOs' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (PCA). More relevant chemicals were selected. In addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative Gram-positive (L. monocytogenes) and Gram-negative (S. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (A. flavus), and a yeast (C. albicans). Of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their MICs, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. To check for possible interactions between components present in the EOs, cinnamon EO was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme EO with thymol, and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified EOs using fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. Synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on A. flavus and for thymol on L. monocytogenes, S. choleraesuis, and A. flavus. In all other cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against S. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. Finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the EOs (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon EO.
TI  - Biomedical evaluation of black lemurs (Eulemur macaco macaco) in Lokobe Reserve,  Madagascar.
AB  - Complete medical evaluations were performed on 25 wild black lemurs (Eulemur macaco macaco) in Lokobe Reserve, northwestern Madagascar. Each animal received a complete physical examination. Weight, body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were recorded. Blood samples were collected for complete blood cell count, differential white blood cell count, hemoparasite examination, serum biochemical profile, fat-soluble vitamin analysis, trace mineral analysis, and Toxoplasma gondii and viral serology. Fecal samples were collected for bacterial culture and endoparasite examination. Ectoparasites were collected and identified. Values were compared to established ranges from captive black lemurs in North American zoos. Significant differences exist between captive and wild animals for total white blood cell count, segmented neutrophil count, band neutrophil count, eosinophil count, monocyte count, and basophil count, and for serum biochemistry values of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, serum alkaline phosphatase, total protein, creatinine, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, potassium, and creatine phosphokinase. One animal had a positive Toxoplasma titer. Detected endoparasites were identified as Lemuricola and Callistroura. Two ectoparasite mites were identified, one within the Psoroptes genus and one within the Laelapidae family. Enteric bacterial flora included Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Klebsiella ozaenae and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Application of real-time quantitative PCR for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  - Bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using TaqMan(R) real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic DNA (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using A. hydrophila purified DNA. Samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. In duplicate samples, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. perfringens and E. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. This qPCR method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the Environment Canada guidelines.
TI  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of dietary spice and medicinal herb extracts.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of a total of 46 extracts from dietary spices and medicinal herbs were investigated by agar-well diffusion method against five foodborne bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella anatum). Their total phenolic contents were also evaluated. Many herb and spice extracts contained high levels of phenolics and exhibited antibacterial activity against foodborne pathogens. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more sensitive to the tested extracts than Gram-negative ones. S. aureus was the most sensitive, while E. coli was the most resistant. There were highly positive relationships (R(2)=0.73-0.93) between antibacterial activities and phenolic content of the tested extracts against each bacterium. This suggested that the antibacterial activity of the tested extracts was closely associated with their phenolic constituents.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Asp-120 locates Zn2 for optimal metallo-beta-lactamase activity.
AB  - Metallo-beta-lactamases are zinc-dependent hydrolases that inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics, rendering bacteria resistant to them. Asp-120 is fully conserved in all metallo-beta-lactamases and is central to catalysis. Several roles have been proposed for Asp-120, but so far there is no agreed consensus. We generated four site-specifically substituted variants of the enzyme BcII from Bacillus cereus as follows: D120N, D120E, D120Q, and D120S. Replacement of Asp-120 by other residues with very different metal ligating capabilities severely impairs the lactamase activity without abolishing metal binding to the mutated site. A kinetic study of these mutants indicates that Asp-120 is not the proton donor, nor does it play an essential role in nucleophilic activation. Spectroscopic and crystallographic analysis of D120S BcII, the least active mutant bearing the weakest metal ligand in the series, reveals that this enzyme is able to accommodate a dinuclear center and that perturbations in the active site are limited to the Zn2 site. It is proposed that the role of Asp-120 is to act as a strong Zn2 ligand, locating this ion optimally for substrate binding, stabilization of the development of a partial negative charge in the beta-lactam nitrogen, and protonation of this atom by a zinc-bound water molecule.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus pumilus during the fermentation of African locust bean (Parkia biglobosa) for Soumbala production.
AB  - AIMS: To examine predominant isolates of Bacillus subtilis and B. pumilus isolated from Soumbala for their antimicrobial activity against indicator microorganisms as Micrococcus luteus, Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococus facium, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aspergillus ochraceus and Penicillium roqueforti. METHODS AND RESULTS: Growth inhibition of indicator microorganisms by cells and supernatants of three B. subtilis and two B. pumilus strains was investigated using agar diffusion tests. Inactivation of indicator microorganisms was investigated in laboratory broth and during the fermentation of African locust bean for Soumbala production. The Bacillus isolates showed variable ability of inhibition and inactivation according to the indicator microorganism. The supernatants of pure cultures of B. subtilis inhibited one strain of B. cereus, one of Staph. aureus and E. coli and caused abnormal germination of Aspergillus ochraceus. The supernatant of mixed cultures of B. subtilis and indicators inhibited all the indicators. A treatment with protease eliminated the inhibitions. Isolates of B. subtilis inactivated all the indicators organisms during the fermentation of African locust bean as well as in laboratory broth with about five to eight decimal reduction. CONCLUSION: Bacillus isolates from Soumbala inhibit and inactivate Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as ochratoxin A producing fungi during both laboratory cultivation and natural fermentation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Selection of starter cultures of Bacillus spp. for controlled production of Soumbala.
TI  - Inactivation of foodborne pathogens using a one atmosphere uniform glow discharge plasma.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of a one atmosphere uniform glow discharge plasma (OAUGDP) for inactivation of foodborne pathogens and to evaluate the influence of growth temperature, pH, and culture age on their inactivation. Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella Enteritidis, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Shigella flexneri were evaluated. Three-strain mixtures of each bacterium were inoculated (6-7 log CFU/cm(2)) onto microscope slides containing nonselective agar media adjusted to pH 5 or 7. Samples were exposed to plasma for 0-240 sec immediately, or after incubation for 24 h at 10 degrees C or 35 degrees C. After exposure, the agar was removed from the slides and pummeled in 0.1% peptone water with a stomacher, serially diluted, surface plated onto nonselective media, and incubated at 35 degrees C. Exposure time, pH, incubation temperature, and culture age affected survival of all pathogens exposed to plasma (P < 0.05). The greatest reduction of pathogens generally occurred during the initial exposure time of 30 or 90 sec. Pathogens incubated for 24 h before exposure were more resistant than those exposed immediately after inoculation. Incubation at 35 degrees C before exposure resulted in greater resistance to plasma inactivation than incubation at 10 degrees C. No appreciable differences between gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens were observed, although the spore-forming B. cereus was more resistant to plasma than non-spore-formers. These findings support the potential for plasma treatment of foods or surfaces for pathogen reduction. Increased sensitivity of pathogens to plasma at reduced pH and temperature is encouraging, since these conditions are applicable to many foods during processing, handling, and storage.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and pollen composition of honey samples collected from different provinces in Turkey.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples from different sources were collected and investigated against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 27736, Morganella morganii, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4375, Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, and Candida albicans. Pathogens exhibited different sensitivities towards the honey samples. The results showed that majority of the honey samples (75%) generally inhibitied the bacteria tested. The honey samples which were obtained from Izmir (samples 1 and 2) proved more effective as inhibitors against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus. The honey which was obtained from Mugla (sample 5) exhibited high anticandidal activity on C. albicans. A comparison of the honey samples on the basis of pollen content revealed that they were heterofloral, and samples which had highest antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus were dominated by pollen from Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae (sample 1), and Trifolium, Trigonella, Cyperaceae, Zea mays and Anthemis taxa (sample 2). The honey proved more effective on bacteria than antibiotics.
TI  - Microbiological detection of 10 quinolone antibiotic residues and its application to artificially contaminated poultry samples.
AB  - To assess if microbiological inhibition tests for detection of antibiotic residues are suitable for routine screening for quinolone residues, the limit of detection (LOD) of 10 different quinolones and fluoroquinolones was determined. Two media were tested, one at pH 6 and the other at pH 8, each seeded with one of the following test strains: Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli or Bacillus cereus. LODs of the 10 substances were highest on plates seeded with B. cereus, intended for selective detection of tetracycline residues. The pattern of zones on the other four plates differed for the targeted quinolones: flumequine and oxolinic acid were detected at lower concentrations at pH 6, while the LODs of ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, danofloxacin, marbofloxacin, sarafloxacin and norfloxacin were lower at pH 8. Nine of the 10 quinolones were detected more easily with E. coli, but the LOD of difloxacin was lower with B. subtilis. Finally, the three most sensitive media were selected and fluid from chicken meat, spiked with eight quinolones near maximum residue limits (MRL), analysed on each plate. The plate seeded with E. coli at pH 8 detected five of eight quinolones at levels of interest, but an additional E. coli plate at pH 6 was necessary for detection of flumequine in species other than poultry and fish. None of the plates detected oxolinic acid and difloxacin at MRLs in muscle tissue.
TI  - Biomedical evaluation of two sympatric lemur species (Propithecus verreauxi deckeni and Eulemur fulvus rufus) in Tsiombokibo Classified Forest, Madagascar.
AB  - Complete medical examinations were performed on 20 wild Decken's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi deckeni) and 20 wild red-fronted brown lemurs (Eulemurfulvus rufus) from western Madagascar. Each animal received a complete physical examination, and weight, body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were recorded and ectoparasites collected. Blood samples were collected for complete blood cell count, differential white blood cell count, hemoparasite examination, serum biochemical profile, fat-soluble vitamin analysis, trace mineral analysis, and toxoplasmosis and viral serology. Fecal samples were collected for bacterial culture and endoparasite examination. Significant differences exist between the species for serum chemistry values for creatine phosphokinase, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, phosphorus, potassium, and chloride; for fat-soluble vitamins 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, retinol, retinyl palmitate, gamma-tocopherol, alpha-tocopherol, and lutein + zeaxanthin; and serum copper. Parasites detected include Lemurostrongylus spp., Lemuricola spp., Trichurus spp., and ectoparasites Haemaphysalis lemuris, Psoroptes, and mites identified to the family Laelapidae. Enteric bacterial flora included Escherichia coli, Citrobacter ssp., Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella ozaenae, Acinetobacter lwofii, and Enterobacter amnigenus.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of some essential oils administered alone or in combination  with Norfloxacin.
AB  - The objective of the present study was that of verifying a possible synergistic antibacterial effect between Pelargonium graveolens [Lis-Balchin, M., Deans, S.G., Hart, S., 1996. Bioactive Geranium oils from different commercial sources. J. Essential Oil Res. 8, 281-290.] essential oil (and its main components) and Norfloxacin antibiotic. As a first step growth inhibition by some types of essential oils was assessed in five microbial species. The antimicrobial effects of P. graveolens oil, as well as those of its components, were evaluated by means of the agar dilution method (ADM) against Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and S. aureus ATCC 29213. The results obtained highlighted the occurrence of a pronounced synergism between P. graveolens essential oil and Norfloxacin against three of the five bacterial species under study with a FIC index in the 0.37-0.50 range. Such antibacterial effects were also shown to increase, although to a lesser extent, when Norfloxacin was given with the main components of P. graveolens essential oil. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The combination of Norfloxacin with either P. graveolens essential oil, or with some of the main components of this latter, in the treatment of infections caused by some bacterial species is likely to reduce the minimum effective dose of Norfloxacin thus minimizing the side effects of the antibiotic.
TI  - Titanium dioxide/UV photocatalytic disinfection in fresh carrots.
AB  - Increased occurrences of fresh produce-related outbreaks of foodborne illness have focused attention on effective washing processes for fruits and vegetables. A titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalytic reaction under UV radiation provides a high rate of disinfection. The photo-killing effects of TiO2 on bacteria in liquid cultures under experimental conditions have been widely studied. However, the disinfection effects of the TiO2 photocatalytic reaction on fresh vegetables during a washing process have not been evaluated. Our objectives were to design a pilot-scale TiO2/UV photocatalytic reactor for fresh carrots and to compare the bactericidal effects of the TiO2/UV reaction against bacteria in liquid media and on carrots. TiO2/UV photocatalytic reactions for 40, 60, and 30 s were required for the complete killing of Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Bacillus cereus (initial counts of approximately 6.7 log CFU/ml), respectively. The counts of total aerobic bacteria in fresh carrots and foodborne pathogenic bacteria in inoculated carrots were also measured. Counts of total aerobic bacteria were reduced by 1.8 log CFU/g after TiO2/UV photocatalytic disinfection for 20 min compared with a 1.1-log CFU/g reduction by UV alone. E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and B. cereus (8 log CFU/ml) were inoculated onto carrots, and the number of surviving bacteria in carrots was determined after treatment. The TiO2/UV treatment exhibited 2.1-, 2.3-, and 1.8-log CFU/g reductions in the counts of E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and B. cereus, respectively, compared with 1.3-, 1.2-, and 1.2-log CFU/g reductions by UV alone. The TiO2/UV photocatalyst reaction showed significant bactericidal effects, indicating that this process is applicable to nonthermal disinfection of fresh vegetables.
TI  - Low molecular weight chitosan--preparation with the aid of pepsin, characterization, and its bactericidal activity.
AB  - Pepsin (EC 3.4.4.1) from porcine stomach mucosa caused depolymerization of a chitosan sample (a copolymer of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine linked by beta-1-4-glycosidic bonds). N-terminal sequence and zymogram analyses confirmed dual (proteolytic and chitosanolytic) activities of pepsin. Optimum depolymerization occurred at pH 5.0 and 45 degrees C with an activity of 4.98 U. Low molecular weight chitosan (LMWC), the major depolymerization product, was obtained in a yield of 75-82%, the degree of polymerization of which depended on reaction time. The LMWC showed a nearly 10-14-fold decrease in the molecular mass as compared to native chitosan, which was also confirmed by GPC and HPLC analyses. IR and 13C NMR spectra indicated a decrease in the degree of acetylation (DA, approximately 13.4-18.8%) as compared to native chitosan (approximately 25.7%), which was in accordance with the CD analysis. Native chitosan had a crystallinity index (CrI) of approximately 70%, whereas there was a decrease in the CrI of LMWC (approximately 61%). The latter showed a better bactericidal activity toward both Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli, which was more toward the former. The bactericidal activity was essentially due to the lytic and not static effect of LMWC, as evidenced by the pore formation on the bacterial cell surface when observed under SEM. This study suggests the possible use of pepsin in place of chitosanase, which is expensive and unavailable in bulk quantities for the production of LMWC of desired molecular mass that has diversified applications in various fields.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic diversity of Lactococcus lactis isolates from Batzos, a  Greek PDO raw goat milk cheese.
AB  - The genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 Lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of Batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. According to PFGE data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of approximately 50%) with the L. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2-8 strains each were distinguished. Plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. Twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. There was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to PFGE. Clustering of strains according to RAPD-PCR was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and PFGE for the majority of the strains. In addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the season of cheese production. All strains inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7. Their ability to affect the growth of Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis was strain dependent. In 42.5% of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. The 75% of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher Lys- than Leu-aminopeptidase activity while the approximately 67% of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher Leu- than Lys-aminopeptidase activity. Their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for alpha(s)-casein degradation. The majority (90%) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. These results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from Batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry.
TI  - Low molecular weight chitosans--preparation with the aid of pronase, characterization and their bactericidal activity towards Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The homogeneous low molecular weight chitosans (LMWC) of molecular weight 9.5-8.5 kDa, obtained by pronase catalyzed non-specific depolymerization (at pH 3.5, 37 degrees C) of chitosan showed lyses of Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli more efficiently (100%) than native chitosan (<50%). IR and (1)H-NMR data showed decrease in the degree of acetylation (14-19%) in LMWC compared to native chitosan ( approximately 26%). Minimum inhibitory concentration of LMWC towards 10(6) CFU ml(-1) of B. cereus was 0.01% (w/v) compared to 0.03% for 10(4) CFU ml(-1) of E. coli. SEM revealed pore formation as well as permeabilization of the bacterial cells, as also evidenced by increased carbohydrate and protein contents as well as the cytoplasmic enzymes in the cell-free supernatants. N-terminal sequence analyses of the released proteins revealed them to be cytoplasmic/membrane proteins. Upon GLC, the supernatant showed characteristic fatty acid profiles in E. coli, thus subscribing to detachment of lipopolysaccharides into the medium, whereas that of B. cereus indicated release of surface lipids. The mechanism for the observed bactericidal activity of LMWC towards both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria has been discussed.
TI  - Detection of Vibrio cholerae by real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification.
AB  - A multitarget molecular beacon-based real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay for the specific detection of Vibrio cholerae has been developed. The genes encoding the cholera toxin (ctxA), the toxin-coregulated pilus (tcpA; colonization factor), the ctxA toxin regulator (toxR), hemolysin (hlyA), and the 60-kDa chaperonin product (groEL) were selected as target sequences for detection. The beacons for the five different genetic targets were evaluated by serial dilution of RNA from V. cholerae cells. RNase treatment of the nucleic acids eliminated all NASBA, whereas DNase treatment had no effect, showing that RNA and not DNA was amplified. The specificity of the assay was investigated by testing several isolates of V. cholerae, other Vibrio species, and Bacillus cereus, Salmonella enterica, and Escherichia coli strains. The toxR, groEL, and hlyA beacons identified all V. cholerae isolates, whereas the ctxA and tcpA beacons identified the O1 toxigenic clinical isolates. The NASBA assay detected V. cholerae at 50 CFU/ml by using the general marker groEL and tcpA that specifically indicates toxigenic strains. A correlation between cell viability and NASBA was demonstrated for the ctxA, toxR, and hlyA targets. RNA isolated from different environmental water samples spiked with V. cholerae was specifically detected by NASBA. These results indicate that NASBA can be used in the rapid detection of V. cholerae from various environmental water samples. This method has a strong potential for detecting toxigenic strains by using the tcpA and ctxA markers. The entire assay including RNA extraction and NASBA was completed within 3 h.
TI  - Four new compounds from the leaves of Acer truncatum.
AB  - Four new compounds, 3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)propyl formate (1), 2,6-dimethoxy-4-[(1S)-3-methoxypropyl]phenol (2), (1R,2R)-4-[(3R)-3-hydroxybutyl]-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohex-4-ene-1,2-diol (3), and (1S,3R,3aR,6S,7S,9aR)-decahydro-1-(hydroxymethyl)-1,7-dimethyl-3a,7-methano-3aH-c yclopentacyclooctene (4) were isolated from the leaves of Acer truncatum, together with twelve known compounds. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic techniques. The absolute configuration of compound 3 was established by the modified Mosher's method. All compounds were evaluated for antibacterial activities.
TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic knotwood extracts and related pure compounds and their effects on food-associated microorganisms.
AB  - Knotwood or bark extracts prepared from 30 species of hard and soft wood trees as well as selected pure compounds (lignans, stilbenes and flavonoids) were assayed for their antimicrobial activity against a battery of both gram positive and negative bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus plantarum, Escherichia coli, Salmonella infantis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium brevicompactum). By far the most consistent antibacterial and antifungal properties were associated with extracts of Pinus species. These extracts showed also cytotoxicity against a mouse hepatoma cell line. Both antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties correlated with the stilbene content of the extracts. Purified stilbenes showed the most consistent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, while purified lignans had marginal effects, only. The results suggest that stilbenes account both for the antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties of Pinus knotwood extracts.
TI  - Survival and growth of foodborne pathogens during cooking and storage of oriental-style rice cakes.
AB  - Fresh cooked rice cakes for retail sale are typically held at room temperature because refrigeration dramatically reduces their quality. Room temperature, high water activity, and a pH of > 4.6 provided an environment conducive to pathogen growth. To date, no studies have been published regarding survival and growth of foodborne pathogens in fresh cooked rice cakes. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of steam cooking on foodborne pathogens and their subsequent growth in five varieties of rice cakes made from flours of regular rice, sweet rice, white rice, tapioca, and mung bean. Bacillus cereus spores were detected in white rice, tapioca, and mung bean samples. The rice cake flours were inoculated with non-spore-forming foodborne pathogens (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) or spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus cereus) and steam cooked (100 degrees C) for 30 min. Steam cooking significantly reduced (> 6 log CFU/g) non-spore-forming foodborne pathogens in all samples and inactivated spores of B. cereus by 1 to 2 log CFU/g. Although spores of B. cereus survived steam cooking and germinated during 3 days of storage at room temperature, populations in most rice cakes remained below 106 CFU/g, which is the threshold for producing toxin. Rice cakes made from mung bean flour supported growth and germination of B. cereus spores above that critical level. In mung bean rice cakes, enterotoxin production was detected by the second day, when B cereus cell populations reached about 6.9 log CFU/g. The toxin concentration increased with storage time. However, our results suggest that rapid growth of total mesophilic microorganisms by more than 7 to 8 log CFU/ml during the first day of storage produced off flavors and spoilage before B. cereus was able to grow enough to produce toxins. Therefore, steam-cooked rice cakes made from a variety of flours including mung bean flour are safe for sale for up to 1 day after storage at room temperature and are free of B. cereus toxins.
TI  - The microbiological quality of hot water-washed broccoli florets and cut green beans.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effect of hot water washing on the microbiological quality of cut broccoli florets and trimmed green beans. METHODS AND RESULTS: Broccoli florets and trimmed beans were washed for 90 s in tap water at either 20 degrees C or 52 degrees C and stored at 7 and 10 degrees C. The numbers of naturally occurring aerobic mesophilic organisms, Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacteriaceae, yeast and moulds and lactobacilli or lactic acid bacteria were enumerated at intervals for up to 2 weeks. The ability of Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli O157:H7 inoculated onto the tissue post heat treatment to survive or grow was also measured to mimic the effect of postprocess contamination. Using a hot wash treatment improved the initial appearance of the vegetables and resulted in a small, but significant, reduction in populations of all groups of endogenous flora measured. The number of yeast and moulds on the vegetables washed at 52 degrees C remained below the levels observed on the 20 degrees C washed vegetables throughout the observation period, but Pseudomonas spp., lactobacilli and Enterobacteriaceae were better able to grow on the hot-washed vegetables such that the counts at the end of storage were greater on hot-washed than ambient-washed vegetables. All three of the pathogens tested were better able to grow on hot-washed broccoli and beans than on equivalent product washed at 20 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: Hot water washing can be used to control enzymic browning or yeast and moulds growth but it can also allow more rapid and extensive growth by pathogens and spoilage organisms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Reduced protection against growth by pathogens means that the hot wash treatment of vegetables should be used with caution and requires careful assessment of risk.
TI  - Microbial composition in bioaerosols of a high-throughput chicken-slaughtering facility.
AB  - The microbial composition of the air in various areas of a high-throughput chicken-slaughtering facility was investigated. Over a 4-mo period, 6 processing areas were sampled, and the influence of environmental factors was monitored. The highest counts of microorganisms were recorded in the initial stages of processing, comprising the receiving-killing and defeathering areas, whereas counts decreased toward the evisceration, air-chilling, packaging, and dispatch areas. Maximum microbial counts were as follows: coliforms, 4.9 x 10(3) cfu/m(3); Escherichia coli 3.4 x 10(3) cfu/m(3); Bacillus cereus, 5.0 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); Staphylococcus aureus, 1.6 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 7.0 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); presumptive Salmonella spp., 1.5 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); Listeria monocytogenes, 1.6 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); and fungi, 1.4 x 10(4) cfu/m(3). Higher counts of airborne microorganisms found in the receiving-killing and defeathering areas indicate the importance of controlling microbial levels before processing to prevent the spread of organisms downstream. This should limit the risk of carrying over contaminants from areas known to generate high counts to areas where the final food product is exposed to air and surface contamination.
TI  - Microflora of minimally processed frozen vegetables sold in Gaborone, Botswana.
AB  - Two hundred samples of minimally processed, frozen, and prepacked potato chips, peas, corn, and a variety of combined vegetables from supermarkets in Gaborone, Botswana, were examined microbiologically. Determination of aerobic mesophilic plate count, aerobic psychrotrophic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and molds, coliforms, Listeria spp., and Staphylococcus aureus were done. Chips had the lowest mean log values for all of the microorganisms enumerated except yeasts and molds. The mean log values for single vegetables ranged from 3.6 to 9.1, 3.4 to 8.9, 2.9 to 5.6, and 2.1 to 6.5 log CFU/ g aerobic mesophilic plate count, aerobic psychrotrophic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts and molds, respectively. The microbial profiles of peas and corn were almost similar (P < 0.001). The mean values for combined vegetables were clustered within 4.6 and 5.4 and 4.2 and 5.2 log CFU/g aerobic mesophilic plate count and aerobic psychrotrophic plate count, respectively. All of the vegetables had a coliform population distribution ranging from 0 to < 10(4) most probable number per g. The predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated included members of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae (86.2%). Escherichia coli was not detected in all of the samples. The organisms isolated included those responsible for spoilage in frozen vegetables, namely Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Corynebacterium, lactic acid bacteria, and Flavobacterium. The predominant lactic acid bacteria were Lactobacillus spp. (55.9%). Other spoilage organisms were yeasts, and Cryptococcus spp. (55.4%) was predominant. Pathogens, namely Listeria monocytogenes, were also isolated at a rate of 2 to 10%, of which 4% was from corn, 2% each from peas and country crop, and 10% from stir-fry. Bacillus cereus was also isolated and accounted for 7.7% of the microorganisms from corn. S. aureus was isolated from all of the vegetables. Enterotoxigenic strains were from corn, peas, mixed vegetables, and stir-fry, and all of them produced enterotoxin A. In addition, the isolates from stir-fry vegetables also produced enterotoxins B and C. The study reveals the presence of pathogens and emerging opportunistic pathogens in the ready-to-use or ready-to-eat vegetables. If E. coli is the only indicator for safety and acceptability, consumers may be exposed to foodborne diseases. Inclusion of other groups as indicator organisms is suggested. Retailers are urged to invest in standby generators to maintain the cold chain.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 1-(4-aryl-2-thiazolyl)-3-(2-thienyl)-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline derivatives.
AB  - Several 1-(4-aryl-2-thiazolyl)-3-(2-thienyl)-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline derivatives were synthesized by reacting substituted 3-(2-thienyl)-5-aryl-1-thiocarbamoyl-2-pyrazolines with phenacyl bromides in ethanol. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, and EIMS spectral data. Their antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Staphylococcus aureus (NRLL B-767), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Bacillus cereus (NRRL B-3711), Streptococcus faecalis (NRRL B-14617), Aeromonas hydrophila (Ankara Uni. Fac. of Veterinary), Candida albicans and Candida glabrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi Uni. Fac. of Medicine) were investigated. A significant level of activity was observed.
TI  - Involvement of cytoplasmic membrane damage in the copper (II)-dependent cytotoxicity of a novel naturally occurring tripyrrole.
AB  - In the presence of a nonlethal concentration of Cu(II), washed Escherichia coli ATCC8739 cells were killed by a novel tripyrrole 1, isolated as a red pigment from the Serratia sp. Cell killing was accompanied by a depletion in the potassium pools of the cells due to the damage to the cytoplasmic membrane, without any detectable DNA damage as revealed by the transformed plasmid DNA and phage induction assay. This revealed that the bactericidal activity of compound 1 in the presence of Cu(II) results from membrane damage. Induction of endogenous catalase in the E. coli cells increased their resistance against the combination of compound 1 and Cu(II). Although compound 1 alone generated large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), it did not show any cell killing against E. coli in the absence of Cu(II). The Cu(II)-dependent bactericidal activity of compound 1 was suppressed by ethylenediaminetetraacetate, bathocuproine, catalase and superoxide disumutase (SOD), but not by dimethyl sulfoxide. These findings suggest that recycling redox reactions between Cu(II) and Cu(I), involving compound 1 and hydrogen peroxide on the cell surface, must be important in the mechanism of the killing. Compound 1 alone showed selective bactericidal activity against the gram positive bacterium, Bacillus cereus ATCC 6630, possibly due to its differential cellular transport.
TI  - The effect of lemon, orange and bergamot essential oils and their components on the survival of Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus in vitro and in food systems.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effectiveness of oils and vapours of lemon (Citrus limon), sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and bergamot (Citrus bergamia) and their components against a number of common foodborne pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: The disc diffusion method was used to screen the oils and vapours against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157 and Campylobacter jejuni. The survival of each species, demonstrated to be susceptible in the in vitro studies, was tested on cabbage leaf for 60 s by direct contact and on chicken skin for 10 min by direct contact and 24 h by vapour. The results indicate that bergamot was the most inhibitory essential oil (EO) and citral and linalool mimicked its effect (P > 0.001). Citral and linalool vapours produced 6 log reductions in L. monocytogenes, Staph. aureus and B. cereus populations on cabbage leaf after 8-10 h exposure but bergamot vapour exposure, while producing a similar reduction in L. monocytogenes and B. cereus populations, had no effect on Staph. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Bergamot was the most effective of the oils tested and linalool the most effective anti-bacterial component. Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible than Gram-negative bacteria in vitro, although Camp. jejuni and E. coli O157 were inhibited by bergamot and linalool oils and by linalool vapour. All bacteria tested were less susceptible in food systems than in vitro. Of the Gram-positive bacteria tested Staph. aureus was the least susceptible to both the oils and the components tested. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results suggest the possibility that citrus EOs, particularly bergamot, could be used as a way of combating the growth of common causes of food poisoning.
TI  - Partial purification and characterization of protease of Bacillus proteolyticus CFR3001 isolated from fish processing waste and its antibacterial activities.
AB  - Bacillus proteolyticus CFR3001 isolated from fish processing wastes (both fresh water and marine) produced an alkaline protease. The optimum conditions for cell growth and protease production were 37 degrees C, 96 h, agitation speed of 100 rpm and medium pH 9. The partially purified protease obtained from had specific activity of 22.05 at 37 degrees C was active between 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C and lost >20% of its activity around 60 degrees C. Its molecular weight was approximately 29 kDa and it inhibited the growth of several pathogenic organisms such as Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Yersinia enterocolytica. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed that the protease produced by B. proteolyticus CFR3001 lysed the cells of these pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Table olives from Portugal: phenolic compounds, antioxidant potential, and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The phenolic compounds composition, antioxidant potential, and antimicrobial activity of different table olives from Portugal, namely, natural black olives "Galega", black ripe olive "Negrinha de Freixo", Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) "Azeitona de Conserva Negrinha de Freixo" olives, and "Azeitona de Conserva de Elvas e Campo Maior" Designation of Origin (DO) olives, were investigated. The analysis of phenolic compounds was performed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, and seven compounds were identified and quantified: hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, 5-O-caffeoilquinic acid, verbascoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, rutin, and luteolin. The antioxidant activity was assessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals, and the beta-carotene linoleate model system. The antioxidant activity was correlated with the amount of phenolics found in each sample. The antimicrobial activity was screened using Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). PDO and DO table olives revealed a wide range of antimicrobial activity. C. albicans was resistant to all the analyzed extracts.
TI  - Metalloantibiotics: synthesis, characterization and in-vitro antibacterial studies on cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes with cloxacillin.
AB  - The synthesis and characterization of cloxacillin (clox) complexes with divalent  metal ions [Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II)] is described. The nature of bonding of the chelated cloxacillin and the structures of the metal complexes have been elucidated on the basis of their physical and spectroscopic data. In all the complexes, the cloxacillin acts as a uninegatively charged bidentate ligand with coordination involving the carboxylate-O and endocyclic-N of the beta-lactam ring. The new compounds have been screened for in-vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (a), Klebsiella pneumonae (b), Proteus mirabilis (c), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (d), Salmonella typhi (e), Shigella dysentriae (f), Bacillus cereus (g), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (h), Staphylococcus aureus (j) and Streptococcus pyogenes (k) bacterial strains. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties. All compounds, respectively, showed a promising activity (90%) against five bacterial species at 10 microg/ml concentration and a significant activity (52%) against the same test bacteria at 25 microg/ml concentration.
TI  - Rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time PCR.
AB  - Buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as PCR, and to prevent false-positive results due to DNA originating from dead cells. Applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae O139, Vibrio parahaemolyticus O3K6, Vibrio vulnificus, Providencia alcalifaciens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. This method can be used prior to real-time quantitative PCR (RTi-qPCR) and viable-cell counting. Using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations as low as 10(1) to 10(3) CFU/g using the RTi-qPCR assay, and amounts as small as 10(0) to 10(1) CFU/g could be isolated using plate counting. The combined separation and concentration methods and RTi-qPCR confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) CFU/g of Salmonella and C. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of S. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. These results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.
TI  - Bacteriocin-like inhibitor substances produced by Mexican strains of Bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  - Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides synthesized and secreted by bacteria and  could potentially be used as natural food preservatives. Here, we report the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitor substances (Bt-BLIS) by five Mexican strains of Bacillus thuringiensis. Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. morrisoni (LBIT 269), B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (LBIT 287), B. thuringiensis subsp kenyae (LBIT 404), B. thuringiensis subsp. entomocidus (LBIT 420) and B. thuringiensis subsp. tolworthi (LBIT 524) produced proteinaceous Bt-BLIS with high levels of activity against Bacillus cereus and other gram-positive bacteria. Although none was active against the gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli, Shigella species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the five Bt-BLIS demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Vibrio cholerae, the etiologic agent of cholera. Biochemical and biophysical studies demonstrated that the five Bt-BLIS could be categorized into two groups, those produced by LBIT 269 and 287 (Group A) and LBIT 404, 420, 524 (Group B), based on relative time of peptide synthesis, distinctive bacterial target specificity and stability in a wide range of temperatures and pH. Because of their stability and bactericidal activities against B. cereus and V. cholerae agents of emetic, diarrheal and lethal syndromes in humans, these Bt-BLIS could potentially be used as biodegradable preservatives in the food industry.
TI  - Application of high-throughput technologies to a structural proteomics-type analysis of Bacillus anthracis.
AB  - A collaborative project between two Structural Proteomics In Europe (SPINE) partner laboratories, York and Oxford, aimed at high-throughput (HTP) structure determination of proteins from Bacillus anthracis, the aetiological agent of anthrax and a biomedically important target, is described. Based upon a target-selection strategy combining ;low-hanging fruit' and more challenging targets, this work has contributed to the body of knowledge of B. anthracis, established and developed HTP cloning and expression technologies and tested HTP pipelines. Both centres developed ligation-independent cloning (LIC) and expression systems, employing custom LIC-PCR, Gateway and In-Fusion technologies, used in combination with parallel protein purification and robotic nanolitre crystallization screening. Overall, 42 structures have been solved by X-ray crystallography, plus two by NMR through collaboration between York and the SPINE partner in Utrecht. Three biologically important protein structures, BA4899, BA1655 and BA3998, involved in tRNA modification, sporulation control and carbohydrate metabolism, respectively, are highlighted. Target analysis by biophysical clustering based on pI and hydropathy has provided useful information for future target-selection strategies. The technological developments and lessons learned from this project are discussed. The success rate of protein expression and structure solution is at least in keeping with that achieved in structural genomics programs.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of chemical races of the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and the MIC values of the ethanol, chloroform, diethyl ether, and acetone extracts of the chemical races of Pseudevernia furfuracea (var. furfuracea and var. ceratea) and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents have been investigated against some microorganisms. Nearly all extracts of both chemical races showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Alternaria alternata, Ascochyta rabiei, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, and Penicillium notatum. There was no antimicrobial activity of the extracts against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, Salmonella typhimurium, Alternaria citri, Alternaria tenuissima, and Gaeumannomyces graminis. Chloroatranorin and olivetoric acid were active against the same microorganisms with few exceptions. Physodic acid was active against about the same bacteria and yeasts and inactive against all of the filamentous fungi tested. Also no activity of atranorin against the filamentous fungi was observed.
TI  - Evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the Dar es Salaam region, Tanzania.
AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (MSPs) in Dar es Salaam region. Total bacterial count (TBC) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the California mastitis test (CMT) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. Moreover, a water sample at each MSP was taken for bacteriological culturing. Finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the MSPs to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. A total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in Dar es Salaam region. The mean TBC was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were Escherichia coli (6.3%), Bacillus cereus (6.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), Enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). In most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. Of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the CMT and 7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. TBC was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of TBC were identified by fitting two linear regression models. In a random effect model, water microbial quality, frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log TBC. In a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log TBC. It was concluded that the milk sold in Dar es Salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.
TI  - Detection and phylogenic analysis of one anthrax virulence plasmid pXO1 conservative open reading frame ubiquitous presented within Bacillus cereus group strains.
AB  - The presence of one of the anthrax virulence plasmid pXO1 conserved fragments was analyzed in 24 Bacillus cereus and B. thuringiensis strains, including 6 B. thuringiensis subspecies, by polymerase chain reactions. Twelve out of 24 strains showed PCR-positive for an ORF101 homologous sequence. Two pXO1-ORF101-like fragments from a B. cereus B-4ac and a commercial B. thuringiensis kurstaki HD1 were cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. Toxicity assays revealed that the product encoded by the pXO1-ORF101-like fragment had no impact on either Vero cells or Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, suggesting that this fragment probably not contribute to enterotoxic activity. Sequence alignment of the pXO1-ORF101 from three Bacillus anthracis and ORF101-like fragments from other 12 B. cereus group isolates indicated high identity (more than 90%) and the presence of subgroup- and strain-specific SNPs among these fragments.
TI  - Identification of the critical role of Tyr-194 in the catalytic activity of a novel N-acyl-homoserine lactonase from marine Bacillus cereus strain Y2.
AB  - Enzymatic disruption of quorum-sensing (QS) pathways in pathogenic organisms is a promising anti-infection therapeutic strategy. AHL-lactonase, a potent tool for biocontrol, can hydrolyze QS signal molecule N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) into inactive products, thereby blocking the QS systems. A marine bacterial isolate Y2, identified as a Bacillus cereus subsp., was found capable of inactivating AHLs. The aiiA gene encoding the AHL-degrading enzyme from bacterial strain Y2 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The 28-kDa recombinant Y2-AiiA protein was purified and showed strong AHL-degrading activity. Sequence comparisons of Y2-aiiA with known AHL-lactonases revealed high identities in the deduced amino-acid sequences. Functional determination of a potential catalytic residue Tyr-194 of AHL-lactonases was performed by site-directed mutagenesis. As judged by AHL-degrading bioassay, substitution of Tyr-194 with Ala resulted in a dramatic decrease of activity compared with wild-type (WT) recombinant Y2-AiiA, although the expression level of the mutated Y2-AiiA protein was equivalent to that of WT Y2-AiiA. These results suggested that the conserved residue Tyr-194 is critical for catalytic function of the novel AHL-lactonase.
TI  - Phenolics and antimicrobial activity of traditional stoned table olives 'alcaparra'.
AB  - In the present work, we report the determination of phenolic compounds in 'alcaparra' table olives by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, and the evaluation of their extract in vitro activity against several microorganisms that may be causal agents of human intestinal and respiratory tract infections, namely Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus), Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). Three flavonoidic compounds were identified and quantified: luteolin 7-O-glucoside, apigenin 7-O-glucoside, and luteolin. At low concentrations (0.05mg/mL) 'alcaparra' extract revealed significant inhibition of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria growth, with exception of P. aeruginosa. Nevertheless, no antifungal activity was observed at the tested concentrations.
TI  - The use of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to differentiate Escherichia coli O157:H7 from other bacteria inoculated into apple juice.
AB  - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) can discriminate Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC 35150 from other bacteria: E. coli ATCC 25522, Bacillus cereus ATCC 10876, and Listeria innocua ATCC 51742 inoculated in to apple juice. Spectra of bacterial suspensions (ca. 10(9) cfu/ml in 0.9% NaCl) on Anodisc (aluminum oxide) filters were tested. Unique FT-IR vibrational combination bands from mid-IR active components of bacterial cells are present in the "fingerprint region" at wavenumbers between 1500 and 800 cm(-1). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed clear segregations between different bacterial strains. Also, soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) correctly classified E. coli O157:H7 ATCC 35150 from E. coli ATCC 25522 at an 82% confidence level; whereas a 77% confidence level was obtained when using SIMCA to classify E. coli O157:H7 from three other bacterial strains.
TI  - A comparison of three rapid bacterial detection methods under simulated real-life conditions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial screening of all produced platelet concentrates (PCs) is implemented in many countries to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted sepsis. This study compares three rapid bacterial detection methods by imitating real-life conditions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The sensitivity of a solid-phase scanning cytometer (optimized Scansystem, Hemosystem), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, and 16S RNA in-house nucleic acid testing (NAT) was evaluated by spiking PCs with four transfusion relevant bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli ). Two different inocula (10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL and 10 CFUs/bag) were used to simulate real-life conditions. Samples were taken at 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours after spiking. RESULTS: With the high inoculum, NAT had a 100 percent rate of positive testing for all four types of bacteria (10/10 replicates) at each time point. With the exception of E. coli, the sensitivity of FACS and optimized Scansystem was comparable for the high inoculum. With the low inoculum, 60 percent of E. coli, 80 percent of B. cereus, 90 percent of K. pneumoniae, and 100 percent of S. aureus were NAT-positive 12 hours after spiking. In contrast, only 20 percent of E. coli, 10 percent of B. cereus, and 70 percent of K. pneumoniae were FACS-positive with the low inoculum 12 hours after spiking. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the preliminary data revealed a higher sensitivity for NAT in comparison to FACS and optimized Scansystem under the defined study conditions. To imitate real-life conditions, further spiking studies with a low inoculum (10 CFUs/bag) and slower growing organisms should be conducted to examine the sensitivity of available detection systems.
TI  - In vitro studies of the digestion of caprine whey proteins by human gastric and duodenal juice and the effects on selected microorganisms.
AB  - The in vitro digestion of caprine whey proteins was investigated by a two-step degradation assay, using human gastric juice (HGJ) at pH 2.5 and human duodenal juice (HDJ) at pH 7.5. Different protein and peptide profiles were observed after the first (HGJ) and second (HDJ) enzymatic degradation. The minor whey proteins serum albumin, lactoferrin and Ig were rapidly degraded by HGJ, while alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG) were more resistant and survived both 30 and 45 min of the enzymatic treatment. Further digestion with HDJ still showed intact beta-LG, and the main part of alpha-LA also remained unchanged. The protein degradation by HGJ and HDJ was also compared with treatment by commercial enzymes, by using pepsin at pH 2.5, and a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin at pH 7.5. The two methods resulted in different caprine protein and peptide profiles. The digests after treatment with HGJ and HDJ were screened for antibacterial effects on some selected microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Streptococcus mutans. Active growing cells of E. coli were inhibited by the digestion products from caprine whey obtained after treatment with HGJ and HDJ. Cells of B. cereus were inhibited only by whey proteins obtained after reaction with HGJ, while the products after further degradation with HDJ demonstrated no significant effect. Screenings performed on cells of Lb. rhamnosus GG and S. mutans all showed no signs of inhibition.
TI  - Bacillus spp. among hospitalized patients with haematological malignancies: clinical features, epidemics and outcomes.
AB  - Between April 2000 and May 2005, 350 bacteraemic episodes occurred among patients treated in our haematology unit. Two hundred and twenty-eight of these episodes were caused by Gram-positive pathogens, most commonly coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus. One hundred and twenty-two episodes were due to Gram-negative pathogens, with a predominance of Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacillus bacteraemias constituted 12 of these episodes occurring in 12 patients, and accounted for 3.4% of all bacteraemic episodes. Of the 12 strains evaluated, seven were Bacillus licheniformis, three were Bacillus cereus and two were Bacillus pumilus. Seven episodes presented with bloodstream infection, three with pneumonia, one with severe abdominal pain and deterioration of liver function, and one with a catheter-related bloodstream infection. B. licheniformis was isolated from five patients who had been hospitalized at the same time. This outbreak was related to non-sterile cotton wool used during skin disinfection. B. cereus and B. licheniformis isolates were susceptible to cefepime, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and vancomycin, but B. pumilus isolates were resistant to all antibiotics except for quinolones and vancomycin. Two deaths were observed. In conclusion, Bacillus spp. may cause serious infections, diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas, and high morbidity and mortality in patients with haematological malignancies. Both B. cereus and B. licheniformis may be among the 'new' Gram-positive pathogens to cause serious infection in patients with neutropenia.
TI  - Isolation of bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus plantarum strains from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso.
AB  - A collection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso, was screened for bacteriocin production. Seven isolates were selected for their broad antimicrobial spectra, which overall included strains of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed that six of the isolates represent different strains. The six selected strains were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum by 16S rDNA sequencing, species-specific PCR and multiplex PCR of the recA gene. PCR amplification revealed the presence of genes of the plantaricin cluster described in L. plantarum C11. Among them, strain 5.2.2 carried the largest number of genes from this cluster.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity studies of ortho-chlorodiarylamines and heteroaromatic tetracyclic systems in the benzo[b]thiophene series.
AB  - ortho-Chlorodiarylamines in the 2,3,7-trimethylbenzo[b]thiophene series were prepared in high yields (70-85%) by C-N palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling using P(t-Bu)(3) as ligand and NaOt-Bu as base. A palladium-assisted C-C intramolecular cyclization of the coupling products gave thienocarbazoles and the dechlorinated diarylamines. Studies of antimicrobial activity of the compounds obtained, against representative species of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis) and fungi (Candida albicans), were performed. We have also included in the biological assays some pyridine derivatives previously prepared by us, and it was possible to establish some structure-activity relationships (SARs).
TI  - Microbiological transformation of two labdane diterpenes, the main constituents of Madia species, by two fungi.
AB  - Microbial transformation of 13R,14R,15-trihydroxylabd-7-ene (5) and 13R,14R,15-trihydroxylabd-8(17)-ene (6) by the fungus Debaryomyces hansenii gave 1 (13R,14R,15-trihydroxy-6-oxolabd-8-ene) and 3 (7alpha,13R,14R,15-tetrahydroxy-labd-8(17)-ene), respectively. While, microbial transformation of 5 by Aspergillus niger afforded 2 (3beta,13R,14R,15-tetrahydroxy-labd-7-ene), and 13R,14R,15-trihydroxylabd-8,17-ene (6) gave 3 and 4 (3R,14R,15-3-oxotetrahydroxy-labd-7-ene). The structures of the new compounds, 1 and 2, were assigned by 1D and 2D high-field NMR spectroscopic methods. Antimicrobial activity of these compounds were tested and their MIC were determined.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of silver-doped phosphate-based glasses.
AB  - In this study a range of phosphate-based glasses (PBG) doped with silver have been investigated for their antimicrobial activities. In disk diffusion assays, these compositions demonstrated microbistatic effects against a range of organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. The data obtained from the above studies allowed for an additional range of PBG containing lower amounts of silver to be studied for their effects on the growth and viability of S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans. PBG containing 3 and 5 mol % Ag were bactericidal for S. aureus and E. coli and significantly decreased the growth rate of C. albicans. A decrease in the dissolution rates of the glasses was seen with increasing Ag content over the range of concentrations investigated. Overall, 3 mol % Ag incorporated into the PBG investigated was sufficient to mount a potent antibacterial effect against the test organisms, and these compositions also gave excellent long-term release of Ag ions into the medium.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of Varthemia iphionoides Boiss. extracts.
AB  - The hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, ethanol and water extracts of aerial parts of Varthemia, Varthemia iphionoides, were investigated for cytotoxic activity against human myelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells; DPPH radical-scavenging activity; antioxidative activity in the linoleic acid system; reducing power; antibacterial activity; the contents of phenolic compounds. A pronounced cytotoxic effect on human leukemia (HL-60) cells was shown in the hexane, chloroform and ethanol extracts, with inhibition of 89.0, 68.4 and 62.3%, respectively, at a concentration of 200 microg extract/ml. High DPPH radical-scavenging activity, antioxidative activity in the linoleic acid system and reducing power were found in the water and ethanol extracts, and were correlated to the contents of phenolic compounds. Antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enteritides was shown in the ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts. A compound responsible for the antibacterial activity was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract, and identified as 3-oxocostusic acid.
TI  - Berry phenolics: antimicrobial properties and mechanisms of action against severe human pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of phenolic extracts of 12 Nordic berries were studied against selected human pathogenic microbes. The most sensitive bacteria on berry phenolics were Helicobacter pylori and Bacillus cereus. Campylobacter jejuni and Candida albicans were inhibited only with phenolic extracts of cloudberry, raspberry, and strawberry, which all were rich in ellagitannins. Cloudberry extract gave strong microbicidic effects on the basis of plate count with all studied strains. However, fluorescence staining of liquid cultures of virulent Salmonella showed viable cells not detectable by plate count adhering to cloudberry extract, whereas Staphylococcus aureus cells adhered to berry extracts were dead on the basis of their fluorescence and plate count. Phenolic extracts of cloudberry and raspberry disintegrated the outer membrane of examined Salmonella strains as indicated by 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) uptake increase and analysis of liberation of [14C]galactose- lipopolysaccharide. Gallic acid effectively permeabilized the tested Salmonella strains, and significant increase in the NPN uptake was recorded. The stability of berry phenolics and their antimicrobial activity in berries stored frozen for a year were examined using Escherichia coli and nonvirulent Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium. The amount of phenolic compounds decreased in all berries, but their antimicrobial activity was not influenced accordingly. Cloudberry, in particular, showed constantly strong antimicrobial activity during the storage.
TI  - Bioassay-guided purification and identification of antimicrobial components in Chinese green tea extract.
AB  - The Chinese green tea extract was found to strongly inhibit the growth of major food-borne pathogens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium DT104, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and a diarrhoea food-poisoning pathogen Bacillus cereus, by 44-100% with the highest activity found against S. aureus and lowest against E. coli O157:H7. A bioassay-guided fractionation technique was used for identifying the principal active component. A simple and efficient reversed-phase high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) method was developed for the separation and purification of four bioactive polyphenol compounds, epicatechin gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin (EC), and caffeine (CN). The structures of these polyphenols were confirmed with mass spectrometry. Among the four compounds, ECG and EGCG were the most active, particularly EGCG against S. aureus. EGCG had the lowest MIC90 values against S. aureus (MSSA) (58 mg/L) and its methicilin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (37 mg/L). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies showed that these two compounds altered bacterial cell morphology, which might have resulted from disturbed cell division. This study demonstrated a direct link between the antimicrobial activity of tea and its specific polyphenolic compositions. The activity of tea polyphenols, particularly EGCG on antibiotics-resistant strains of S. aureus, suggests that these compounds are potential natural alternatives for the control of bovine mastitis and food poisoning caused by S. aureus.
TI  - Burkholderia cenocepacia ZmpB is a broad-specificity zinc metalloprotease involved in virulence.
AB  - In previous studies we characterized the Burkholderia cenocepacia ZmpA zinc metalloprotease. In this study, we determined that B. cenocepacia has an additional metalloprotease, which we designated ZmpB. The zmpB gene is present in the same species as zmpA and was detected in B. cepacia, B. cenocepacia, B. stabilis, B. ambifaria, and B. pyrrocinia but was absent from B. multivorans, B. vietnamiensis, B. dolosa, and B. anthina. The zmpB gene was expressed, and ZmpB was purified from Escherichia coli by using the pPROEXHTa His(6) Tag expression system. ZmpB has a predicted preproenzyme structure typical of thermolysin-like proteases and is distantly related to Bacillus cereus bacillolysin. ZmpB was expressed as a 63-kDa preproenzyme precursor that was autocatalytically cleaved into mature ZmpB (35 kDa) and a 27-kDa prepropeptide. EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline, and Zn(2+) cations inhibited ZmpB enzyme activity, indicating that it is a metalloprotease. ZmpB had proteolytic activity against alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, alpha(2)-macrogobulin, type IV collagen, fibronectin, lactoferrin, transferrin, and immunoglobulins. B. cenocepacia zmpB and zmpA zmpB mutants had no proteolytic activity against casein and were less virulent in a rat agar bead chronic infection model, indicating that zmpB is involved in B. cenocepacia virulence. Expression of zmpB was regulated by both the CepIR and CciIR quorum-sensing systems.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial studies of medicinally important novel N-alkyl and N-sulfonyl derivatives of 1-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)-methyl]piperazine.
AB  - A series of novel substituted 1-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)-methyl]piperazine derivatives (4a-g) and (5h-m) have been synthesized. The synthesized compounds were characterized by IR and 1H NMR. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated in vitro for their efficacy as antimicrobial agents against representative strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25953, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Bacillus cereus 11778, and Bacillus subtilis 6051) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 2853, and Salmonella typhi ATCC 9484) by paper disc diffusion and microdilution methods. Among the newly synthesized compounds 4e, 5l, and 5m showed potent antimicrobial activities, when compared to the standard drug.
TI  - A primary sodium pump gene of the moderate halophile Halobacillus dabanensis exhibits secondary antiporter properties.
AB  - The primary sodium pump has been proved to be involved in Na(+) extrusion of bacteria. In our present study, a novel gene encoding a putative primary sodium pump was cloned from chromosomal DNA of moderate halophile Halobacillus dabanensis D-8 by functional complementation, which expression resulted in the growth of antiporter-deficient Escherichia coli strain KNabc in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl. The gene was sequenced and designated nap. The deduced amino acid sequence of Nap has 56% identity to NADH dehydrogenase of Bacillus cereus and 55% to NADH oxidase of Bacillus halodurans C-125. E. coli KNabc carrying nap exhibited resistance to uncoupler CCCP (carbonyl-cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone). Everted membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli KNabc carrying nap exhibited secondary Na(+)/H(+) antiporter activity, and nap also supported the growth of respiratory-deficient E. coli ANN0222 lacking NADH dehydrogenase. Based on these results, we proposed that Nap possessed both characteristics of secondary Na(+)/H(+) antiporter and primary sodium pump.
TI  - Biochemical characteristics of chitosanase from the Indonesian Bacillus licheniformis MB-2.
AB  - Bacillus licheniformis MB-2, isolated from a hot spring water in Manado, Indonesia, secreted a unique chitosanase. Media consisted of 0.24% chitosan, 0.25% casiton, 1% MgSO4, 1.4% K2HPO4, 0.02% CaCl2 x 2H2O, 0.002% FeSO4 x 7H2O (w/v) was used for enzyme production. Purification of the enzyme through the hydrophobic interaction chromatography system (butyl Sepharose 4 FF) resulted in two major active fractions; the F2 fraction was shown as a single band at both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and zymogram analysis with apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa. The enzyme worked best at 70 degrees C and pH between 6.0 and 7.0. When incubated at 70, 80, and 90 degrees , the t(1/2) values were 26.56, 18.44, and 16.74 min, respectively with the k constant being at 0.026, 0.037, and 0.04/min. When heated at 90 degrees C, the enzyme retained its activity up to 8 h in the presence of 1 mM MnCl2. The enzyme's activity was unaffected by the presence of 1 M NaCl and 6 M urea but was decreased by 2 M of guanidine hydrochloride. Albeit the enzyme did not degrade colloidal and glycol chitin, it hydrolyzed glycol chitosan up to 0.8% and colloidal chitosan up to 11%. The 85% deacetylated (DDA) soluble chitosan was the most susceptible to this enzyme, followed by 90% and 100% DDA chitosan. The K(m app) values of the 85, 90, and 100% DDA soluble chitosans were found as 0.23, 0.24, and 0.58 mg/mL, whereas the Vmax values were 843, 668, and 261 U/mg, respectively. The hydrolysis products of F2 chitosanase at 24 h incubation (70 degrees C) were pentasaccharide (GlcN)5 and hexasaccharide (GlcN)6. The preliminary test showed inhibitory effect of chitooligosaccharides resulted from enzymatic degradation toward Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (PCs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. Which key steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten bacteria species were used. Blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees C for 8 hours. The buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. PCs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. At each preparation step and during PC storage, bacteria contents were measured. In additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees C for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. Titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. Compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the PCs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. With the exception of P. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the PCs. Remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor PCs. Also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for most species. When buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.
TI  - Constituents and biological activities of Schinus polygamus.
AB  - The folk medicine employs Schinus polygamus to treat arthritic pain and cleansing of wounds. As no reports of pharmacological studies supporting its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, extracts of increasing polarity were assayed on the base of fever, pain and inflammation, together with its antimicrobial activity. All the extracts showed pharmacological activities. From the most active extracts different metabolites were isolated that can in part explain the antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic activity: beta-sitosterol, shikimic acid together with quercetin, previously reported. Also, the essential oil of leaves and fruits was obtained and compared with the oil obtained from Schinus polygamus collected in Argentine. Oils differed in composition and in antibacterial activity, where the Chilean species exhibited a wide spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and the most abundant compound found in leaves and fruits was beta-pinene, meanwhile the Argentine species showed high activity against Bacillus cereus, and the main components resulted to be alpha-phellandrene and limonene.
TI  - Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants.
AB  - A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.
TI  - Rapid and simple detection of food poisoning bacteria by bead assay with a microfluidic chip-based system.
AB  - A rapid bead assay for detecting pathogenic bacteria with a simple microfluidic chip-based system was developed. Five oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the 16S rRNA of the targeted bacteria were coupled covalently to fluorescent beads. Four species of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Bacillus cereus) were used as representative food-borne pathogenic bacteria. The RNAs extracted from pure cultures of these microorganisms were fluorescently labeled and hybridized to the oligonucleotide probes-immobilized fluorescent beads (Bead assay). The duplexes of RNAs and the probes-immobilized beads were analyzed with the commercially available microfluidic chip-based system. This bead assay provided results within 3 h following RNA extraction from bacterial cells.
TI  - Glycosylation of flavonoids with a glycosyltransferase from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Microbial glycosyltransferases can convert many small lipophilic compounds such as phenolics, terpenoids, cyanohydrins and alkaloids into glycons using uridine-diphosphate-activated sugars. The main chemical functions of glycosylation processes are stabilization, detoxification and solubilization of the substrates. The gene encoding the UDP-glycosyltransferase from Bacillus cereus, BcGT-1, was cloned by PCR and sequenced. BcGT-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) with a his-tag and purified using a His-tag affinity column. BcGT-1 could use apigenin, genistein, kaempferol, luteolin, naringenin and quercetin as substrates and gave two reaction products. The enzyme preferentially glycosylated at the 3-hydroxyl group, but it could transfer a glucose group onto the 7-hydroxyl group when the 3-hydroxyl group was not available. The reaction products made by biotransformation of flavonoids with E. coli expressing BcGT-1 are similar to those produced with the purified recombinant enzyme. Thus, this work provides a method that might be useful for the biosynthesis of flavonoid glucosides and for the glycosylation of related compounds.
TI  - Fluorescence quencher improves SCANSYSTEM for rapid bacterial detection.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The optimized scansystem could detect contaminated platelet products within 24 h. However, the system's sensitivity was reduced by a high fluorescence background even in sterile samples, which led to the necessity of a well-trained staff for confirmation of microscope results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A new protocol of the optimized scansystem with the addition of a fluorescence quencher was evaluated. Pool platelet concentrates contaminated with five transfusion-relevant bacterial strains were tested in a blind study. RESULTS: In conjunction with new analysis software, the new quenching dye was able to reduce significantly unspecific background fluorescence. Sensitivity was best for Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli (3 CFU/ml). DISCUSSION: The application of a fluorescence quencher enables automated discrimination of positive and negative test results in 60% of all analysed samples.
TI  - Growth of Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris and Bacillus cereus in the presence of the ionic liquids [BMIM][BF4] and [BMIM][PF6] and Organic Solvents.
AB  - The influence of the two most commonly used ionic liquids (1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate, [BMIM][BF(4)], 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium hexafluorophosphate, [BMIM][PF(6)]) and three selected organic solvents (dimethylsulfoxide, ethanol, methanol) on the growth of Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris and Bacillus cereus was investigated. [BMIM][BF(4)] was toxic at 1% (v/v) on all three microorganisms. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of [BMIM][BF(4)] on E. coli growth was between 0.7 and 1% (v/v). In contrast, [BMIM][PF(6)] was less toxic for P. pastoris and B. cereus, whereas E. coli was not able to tolerate [BMIM][PF(6)] (MIC value: 0.3-0.7% v/v). Growth of P. pastoris was unaffected by [BMIM][PF(6)] at 10% (v/v). Similar results were found for dimethylsulfoxide. Thus, ionic liquids (ILs) can have substantial inhibitory effects on the growth of microorganisms, which should be taken into account for environmental reasons as well as for the use of ILs as co-solvents in biotransformations.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - A novel FtsZ-like protein is involved in replication of the anthrax toxin-encoding pXO1 plasmid in Bacillus anthracis.
AB  - Plasmid pXO1 encodes the tripartite anthrax toxin, which is the major virulence factor of Bacillus anthracis. In spite of the important role of pXO1 in anthrax pathogenesis, very little is known about its replication and maintenance in B. anthracis. We cloned a 5-kb region of the pXO1 plasmid into an Escherichia coli vector and showed that this plasmid can replicate when introduced into B. anthracis. Mutational analysis showed that open reading frame 45 (repX) of pXO1 was required for the replication of the miniplasmid in B. anthracis. Interestingly, repX showed limited homology to bacterial FtsZ proteins that are involved in cell division. A mutation in the predicted GTP binding domain of RepX abolished its replication activity. Genes almost identical to repX are contained on several megaplasmids in members of the Bacillus cereus group, including a B. cereus strain that causes an anthrax-like disease. Our results identify a novel group of FtsZ-related initiator proteins that are required for the replication of virulence plasmids in B. anthracis and possibly in related organisms. Such replication proteins may provide novel drug targets for the elimination of plasmids encoding the anthrax toxin and other virulence factors.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial, antifungal & cytotoxic activity of some isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases and their cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes.
AB  - Isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani and Candida glabrata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. The brine shrimp bioassay indicated Schiff's bases, L3 and L6 and, their Cu (II) and Ni (II) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against Artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (LD50 > 1000).
TI  - Characterization of a unique type IA topoisomerase in Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Bacillus cereus topoisomerase IIIbeta (bcTopo IIIbeta) has been cloned, overexpressed and biochemically characterized. This enzyme exhibits 64% and 33% sequence identity to Bacillus subtilis topoisomerase III (bsTopo III) and Escherichia coli topoisomerase III (ecTopo III) respectively. The enzymatic properties of bcTopo IIIbeta differ substantially from other bacterial type IA topoisomerases, including E. coli type IA topoisomerases and B. cereus topoisomerase I (bcTopo I) and IIIalpha (bcTopo IIIalpha). bcTopo IIIbeta only partially relaxes negatively supercoiled DNA and appears incapable of generating fully relaxed topoisomers. In contrast to ecTopo III and bcTopo IIIalpha, bcTopo IIIbeta is not a decatenase. bcTopo IIIbeta is unable to compensate the loss of ecTopo III in vivo. Therefore, bcTopo IIIbeta is a unique prokaryotic type IA topoisomerase that is different from previously characterized topoisomerases.
TI  - A newly developed assay to study the minimum inhibitory concentration of Satureja spinosa essential oil.
AB  - AIMS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Satureja spinosa essential oil against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella serovar Enteritidis PT4 and Bacillus cereus was comparatively assessed with an established optical density method as well as a novel impedimetric method. METHODS AND RESULTS: The impedimetric analysis takes into account information of microbial growth, such as detection time, maximum conductance, and slope of the conductance curve. For each pathogen two levels of inoculation were studied, a high (10(5) CFU ml(-1)) and a low level (10(2) CFU ml(-1)). Non-linear regression analysis was used to fit the data using a modification of a previously published model, from which a more exact value can be obtained for the MIC. Both methods gave similar MICs as shown by t-test statistical analysis. Salm. Enteritidis seems to be the least sensitive to the action of S. spinosa essential oil followed by L. monocytogenes, E. coli, B.cereus and Staph. aureus. The MICs of low inoculum were lower than that of high inoculum. CONCLUSIONS: The new impedimetric assay of MIC of essential oils can be considered a reliable rapid method for screening antimicrobial effectiveness of natural additives. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration of an essential oil with the simple conductance technique and further study of the mode of action of its components is a good combination for obtaining additional knowledge for industrial application of such natural additives.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in Enterococcus isolates from Batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
AB  - This study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of Batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as Enterococcus durans. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Species recognition by means of RAPD-PCR was in agreement with the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. One strain was characterized as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by RAPD-PCR and four strains were grouped with the Enterococcus faecium reference strain. All strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. All strains exhibited antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited Enterococcus faecalis. Isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. However, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of peptide deformylase (PDF) from Bacillus cereus in ligand-free and actinonin-bound forms.
AB  - In bacteria, protein expression initiates with an N-formyl group and this needs to be removed in order to ensure proper bacterial growth. These formylation and deformylation processes are unique to eubacteria; therefore, inhibition of these would provide a novel antibacterial therapy. Deformylation is carried out by peptide deformylase (PDF). PDF from Bacillus cereus, one of the major pathogenic bacteria, was cloned into expression plasmid pET-28a (Novagen), overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified to high quality. Crystals have been obtained of both ligand-free PDF and PDF to which actinonin, a highly potent naturally occurring inhibitor, is bound. Both crystals belong to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 42.72, b = 44.04, c = 85.19 A and a = 41.31, b = 44.56, c = 84.47 A, respectively. Diffraction data were collected to 1.7 A resolution for the inhibitor-free crystals and to 2.0 A resolution for the actinonin-bound crystals.
TI  - Microbiological quality of randomly selected ready-to-eat foods sampled between 2003 and 2005 in Wales, UK.
AB  - Since 1995, the publicly funded ready-to-eat food sampling and examination activities in Wales have been coordinated and structured, using a novel approach for the identification of samples and premises. The latest set of data from this surveillance system reports the results from 3391 ready-to-eat foods sampled between November 2003 and March 2005. During this seventeen-month period all samples were examined for aerobic colony count, Escherichia coli, Listeria spp., Bacillus cereus, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes. The food types with the poorest microbiological quality were cream cakes, custard slices and egg mayonnaise sandwiches. The food type with the best microbiological quality was dried fruit. In conclusion, the results indicate that, in general terms, the ready-to-eat food types sampled and examined in this period posed little bacterial hazard to consumers.
TI  - Screening for antimicrobial activity of ten medicinal plants used in Colombian folkloric medicine: a possible alternative in the treatment of non-nosocomial infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial activity and Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the extracts of Bidens pilosa L., Bixa orellana L., Cecropia peltata L., Cinchona officinalis L., Gliricidia sepium H.B. & K, Jacaranda mimosifolia D.Don, Justicia secunda Vahl., Piper pulchrum C.DC, P. paniculata L. and Spilanthes americana Hieron were evaluated against five bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus beta hemolitic, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli), and one yeast (Candida albicans). These plants are used in Colombian folk medicine to treat infections of microbial origin. METHODS: Plants were collected by farmers and traditional healers. The ethanol, hexane and water extracts were obtained by standard methods. The antimicrobial activity was found by using a modified agar well diffusion method. All microorganisms were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). MIC was determined in the plant extracts that showed some efficacy against the tested microorganisms. Gentamycin sulfate (1.0 microg/ml), clindamycin (0.3 microg/ml) and nystatin (1.0 microg/ml) were used as positive controls. RESULTS: The water extracts of Bidens pilosa L., Jacaranda mimosifolia D.Don, and Piper pulchrum C.DC showed a higher activity against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli than gentamycin sulfate. Similarly, the ethanol extracts of all species were active against Staphylococcus aureus except for Justicia secunda. Furthermore, Bixa orellana L, Justicia secunda Vahl. and Piper pulchrum C.DC presented the lowest MICs against Escherichia coli (0.8, 0.6 and 0.6 microg/ml, respectively) compared to gentamycin sulfate (0.9 8 g/ml). Likewise, Justicia secunda and Piper pulchrum C.DC showed an analogous MIC against Candida albicans (0.5 and 0.6 microg/ml, respectively) compared to nystatin (0.6 microg/ml). Bixa orellana L, exhibited a better MIC against Bacillus cereus (0.2 microg/ml) than gentamycin sulfate (0.5 microg/ml). CONCLUSION: This in vitro study corroborated the antimicrobial activity of the selected plants used in folkloric medicine. All these plants were effective against three or more of the pathogenic microorganisms. However, they were ineffective against Streptococcus beta hemolytic and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Their medicinal use in infections associated with these two species is not recommended. This study also showed that Bixa orellana L, Justicia secunda Vahl. and Piper pulchrum C.DC could be potential sources of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - A novel bacteriocin, thuricin 17, produced by plant growth promoting rhizobacteria strain Bacillus thuringiensis NEB17: isolation and classification.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to identify and characterize a compound produced  by the plant growth promoting bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis non-Bradyrhizobium Endophytic Bacterium 17. METHODS AND RESULTS: The bacterial peptide was analysed and purified via HPLC. Using the disk diffusion assay this peptide inhibited the growth of 16/19 B. thuringiensis strains, 4/4 Bacillus cereus strains, among others, as well as a Gram-negative strain Escherichia coli MM294 (pBS42). Both bactericidal and bacteristatic effects were observed on B. cereus ATCC 14579 and bactericidal effects were observed on B. thuringiensis ssp. thuringiensis Bt1267. The molecular weight of the peptide was estimated via SDS-PAGE and confirmed with Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Quadrapole Time of Flight mass spectrometry; its weight is 3162 Da. The peptide is biologically active after exposure to 100 degrees C for 15 min, and within the pH range 1.00-9.25. Its activity disappeared when treated with proteinase K and protease, but not with alpha-amylase or catalase. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that this is the first report of a bacteriocin produced by a plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (B. thuringiensis) species and have named the bacteriocin thuricin 17. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our work has characterized a bacteriocin produced by a plant growth promoting bacterium. This strain is previously reported to increase soya bean nodulation.
TI  - A new protein superfamily includes two novel 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylases from Bacillus cereus, AlkC and AlkD.
AB  - Soil bacteria are heavily exposed to environmental methylating agents such as methylchloride and may have special requirements for repair of alkylation damage on DNA. We have used functional complementation of an Escherichia coli tag alkA mutant to screen for 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase genes in genomic libraries of the soil bacterium Bacillus cereus. Three genes were recovered: alkC, alkD and alkE. The amino acid sequence of AlkE is homologous to the E. coli AlkA sequence. AlkC and AlkD represent novel proteins without sequence similarity to any protein of known function. However, iterative and indirect sequence similarity searches revealed that AlkC and AlkD are distant homologues of each other within a new protein superfamily that is ubiquitous in the prokaryotic kingdom. Homologues of AlkC and AlkD were also identified in the amoebas Entamoeba histolytica and Dictyostelium discoideum, but no other eukaryotic counterparts of the superfamily were found. The alkC and alkD genes were expressed in E. coli and the proteins were purified to homogeneity. Both proteins were found to be specific for removal of N-alkylated bases, and showed no activity on oxidized or deaminated base lesions in DNA. B. cereus AlkC and AlkD thus define novel families of alkylbase DNA glycosylases within a new protein superfamily.
TI  - Detection and identification of intestinal pathogenic bacteria by hybridization to oligonucleotide microarrays.
AB  - AIM: To detect the common intestinal pathogenic bacteria quickly and accurately.  METHODS: A rapid (<3 h) experimental procedure was set up based upon the gene chip technology. Target genes were amplified and hybridized by oligonucleotide microarrays. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy strains of bacteria in pure culture belonging to 11 genera were successfully discriminated under comparatively same conditions, and a series of specific hybridization maps corresponding to each kind of bacteria were obtained. When this method was applied to 26 divided cultures, 25 (96.2%) were identified. CONCLUSION: Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus sp., Bacillus cereus, Vibrio cholerae, Enterococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni can be detected and identified by our microarrays. The accuracy, range, and discrimination power of this assay can be continually improved by adding further oligonucleotides to the arrays without any significant increase of complexity or cost.
TI  - Exchange of glutamine-217 to glutamate of Clostridium limosum exoenzyme C3 turns  the asparagine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase into an arginine-modifying enzyme.
AB  - C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferaseses are produced by Clostridium species, Bacillus cereus, and various Staphylococcus aureus strains. The exoenzymes modify the low-molecular-mass GTPases RhoA, B, and C. In structural studies of C3-like exoenzymes, an ARTT-motif (ADP-ribosylating turn-turn motif) was identified that appears to be involved in substrate specificity and recognition (Han, S., Arvai, A. S., Clancy, S. B., Tainer, J. A. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 305, 95-107). Exchange of Gln217, which is a key residue of the ARTT-motif, to Glu in C3 from Clostridium limosum results in inhibition of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity toward RhoA. The mutant protein is still capable of NAD-binding and possesses NAD+ glycohydrolase activity. Whereas recombinant wild-type C3 modifies Rho proteins specifically at an asparagine residue (Asn41), Gln217Glu-C3 is capable of ADP-ribosylation of poly-arginine but not poly-asparagine. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, a model substrate for many arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases, is modified by the Gln217Glu-C3 transferase. Also in C3 ADP-ribosyltransferases from Clostridium botulinum and B. cereus, the exchange of the equivalent Gln residue to Glu blocked asparagine modification of RhoA but elicited arginine-specific ADP-ribosylation. Moreover, the Gln217Glu-C3lim transferase was able to ADP-ribosylate recombinant wild-type C3lim at Arg86, resulting in decrease in ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the wild-type enzyme. The data indicate that the exchange of one amino acid residue in the ARTT-motif turns the asparagine-modifying ADP-ribosyltransferases of the C3 family into arginine-ADP-ribosylating transferases.
TI  - Basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry (FACS) is a common technique in blood banking. It is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. It was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees C for various times. The following 10 species were used: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Bacterial DNA was stained with thiazole orange. After the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by FACS. RESULTS: All bacteria species used were detectable by FACS. The lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microL, that is, 10(5) per mL. In general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. In one case (K. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. When PC samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per mL of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees C, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. Exceptions were E. cloacae and P. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. At 20 to 24 degrees C, the detection times were strongly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Sterility testing of PCs by FACS is a feasible approach. The present data suggest incubating PC samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees C before testing. For slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1 to 2 days.
TI  - Combined Plate Microbial Assay (CPMA): a 6-plate-method for simultaneous first and second level screening of antibacterial residues in meat.
AB  - This paper proposes an improved high throughput microbial method for the simultaneous performance of first and second level screening for antibacterial residues in meat. It is based on growth inhibition of B. subtilis on agar medium pH 6, 7.2 and 8, of B. cereus on agar medium pH 5.9, of M. luteus on agar medium pH 8 and of E. coli on agar medium pH 7.2 (research or first level screening) and on the use of confirmatory solutions (Pase, Paba, MgSO4) for the identification or second level screening. In kidney control samples, dialysis membranes were interposed between samples and the agar surface to both prevent the action of lysozyme and reduce false positive results. The proposed method detects beta-lactams, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, macrolides and quinolones at MRL concentrations and reliably indicates the inhibitor family. Results are obtained in 18-24 h.
TI  - Antilisterial activity of grape juice and grape extracts derived from Vitis vinifera variety Ribier.
AB  - Grape juice and skin and seed extracts of Vitis vinifera var. Ribier black table  grapes were found to be highly inhibitory towards Listeria monocytogenes. This grape juice was also active against all other Listeria species tested but not against Bacillus cereus, Salmonella Menston, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Yersinia enterocolitica. Fractionation of the extracts showed that the antilisterial activity was strongest in the polymeric phenolic fractions. Two different types of active compounds were identified: the red-pigmented polymeric phenolics from juice and skin showed pH-dependent antilisterial activity, while the unpigmented polymeric phenolics from the seed showed antilisterial activity which was independent of pH.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis  (Mimosaceae).
AB  - Ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis (CG) was analysed phytochemically and evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against 17 pathogenic species isolated from patient: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus feacalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus T, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Flavonoids, saponins, tannins, polyphenols, coumarins, triterpenes and/or sterols and reducing sugars were detected in the (EA) extract of CG. The best MIC and MBC values for the microorganisms sensitive to the extract were 0.00078 and 0.00315 mg/ml respectively. The greater and remarkable antimicrobial activity of the (EA) extract of CG was recorded with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus cereus T. These results provide a rationalization for the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of infectious diseases.
TI  - Purification and cytotoxic properties of Bacillus cereus hemolysin II.
AB  - The hemolysin II from Bacillus cereus, HlyII, is a member of the beta-barrel pore-forming toxin family of secreted microbial proteins that includes the Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin. Compared with other proteins of the family, hemolysin II has 90 extra amino acids at its C-terminus. To examine more closely the cytotoxic and pore-forming properties of the protein, we have cloned and expressed it in Escherichia coli. We developed a purification procedure for the matured HlyII protein from both culture media and cell extracts using a combination of cation exchange and affinity chromatography together with gel-filtration. In both cases, the fully processed HlyII protein was purified as confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis. The HlyII protein exhibits cytolytic activity of different extent on erythrocytes from various kinds of mammals. The results presented here show for the first time that two types of human cells are sensitive to HlyII action. In view of its broad cytotoxic activity as well as the ability to interact with artificial membranes, we assume that HlyII needs no specific receptor to bind to cell membranes.
TI  - [Symptoms of food-borne diseases and gastroenteritis in Kyushu, Japan].
AB  - In this study we analyzed the symptoms of gastroenteritis or food-borne disease caused by the 10 most prevalent pathogens: Norovirus, Salmonella, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), Shigella sonnei/flexneri (Shigella), Staphylococcus aureus, and emetic-type Bacillus cereus. The symptoms diarrhea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and headache, and the incubation period in 646 cases in 10 districts of Kyushu between January 2000 and December 2004 were recorded. The pathogen with the shortest mean incubation period was B. cereus (0.8 h), and was followed by S. aureus (3.3 h), C. perfringens (10.7 h) and V. parahaemolyticus (16.4 h). All the patients infected with B. cereus and S. aureus developed symptoms within 6 hours, and those infected with V. parahaemolyticus and C. perfringens developed symptoms within 24 hours. Bloody diarrhea was associated with STEC and Shigella, but rare with other pathogens. Vomiting was associated with almost all cases of S. aureus and B. cereus infection, and occurred in 71.5% of the Norovirus cases and 56.1% of the V. parahaemolyticus cases. Vomiting was less common in the C. perfringens (22.0%) and the ETEC and STEC (both about 5%). Bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting were statistically significantly more common with STEC 0157 infection than with STEC non-0157 infection. Since the cases analyzed in this study included all degrees of illness, mild to severe, and a wide range of ages, the information obtained will serve as a good reference material for administrative and laboratory work when an outbreak takes place.
TI  - Determination of the antimicrobial properties of oligo-2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde.
AB  - Oligo-2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde (OHNA) was synthesized by oxidative polycondensation using H2O2 (35%, aqueous solution), air O2 and NaOCl (34%, aqueous solution) by Kaya and Senol and the products were characterized by spectral techniques. Antimicrobial activities of the first and second fractions of OHNA were tested against Corynobacterium xerosis CCM 2824, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 6897, Staphylococcus epidermidis NRRL B-4877, S. aureus ATCC 6538, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048, Salmonella thyphimurium CCM 5445, Pseudomonas aeroginosa ATCC 27853, Escherichia coli ATCC 11230, E. coli ATCC 23998, Bacillus cereus ATCC 7064, B. cereus ATCC 99, B. subtilis ATCC 6633, Yersinia spp., Neisseria canis, Rhodotorula rubra, Kluyveromyces fragilis NRRL 2415, Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 9763, S. ovarum, Debaryomyces hensenii, Hansenula anamola, Candida albicans, C. utilis, Aspergillus niger, A. fumigates, A. versicolor, A. flavus, A. parasiticus, Penicillium granulatum, P. chrysogenum, and P. herque. OHNA demonstrated antimicrobial activity against various bacteria and yeast, but did not affect filamentous fungi.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes of the antibiotic drug cephalothin (Keflin).
AB  - Keflin (kefl) interacts with Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) metal ions leading to complexes of the type M(kefl)2Cl2 and M(kefl)Cl2, which have been characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Magnetic moment, IR, electronic spectral and elemental analyses data suggest that keflin behaves tridentately forming octahedral or trigonal bipyramidal complexes with the metal ions mentioned above. The new compounds have been screened in-vitro for antibacterial and cytotoxic activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysentriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains. Compounds, 4 and 8 showed promising activity (90%) against seven, compound 6 showed significant activity (52%) against four and, compounds 1 and 5 showed activity (40%) against three test bacterial strains at concentration of 10 microM.
TI  - FlhA influences Bacillus thuringiensis PlcR-regulated gene transcription, protein production, and virulence.
AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus cereus are closely related. B. thuringiensis  is well known for its entomopathogenic properties, principally due to the synthesis of plasmid-encoded crystal toxins. B. cereus appears to be an emerging opportunistic human pathogen. B. thuringiensis and B. cereus produce many putative virulence factors which are positively controlled by the pleiotropic transcriptional regulator PlcR. The inactivation of plcR decreases but does not abolish virulence, indicating that additional factors like flagella may contribute to pathogenicity. Therefore, we further analyzed a mutant (B. thuringiensis 407 Cry(-) DeltaflhA) previously described as being defective in flagellar apparatus assembly and in motility as well as in the production of hemolysin BL and phospholipases. A large picture of secreted proteins was obtained by two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis, which revealed that flagellar proteins are not secreted and that production of several virulence-associated factors is reduced in the flhA mutant. Moreover, we quantified the effect of FlhA on plcA and hblC gene transcription. The results show that the flhA mutation results in a significant reduction of plcA and hblC transcription. These results indicate that the transcription of several PlcR-regulated virulence factors is coordinated with the flagellar apparatus. Consistently, the flhA mutant also shows a strong decrease in cytotoxicity towards HeLa cells and in virulence against Galleria mellonella larvae following oral and intrahemocoelic inoculation. The decrease in virulence may be due to both a lack of flagella and a lower production of secreted factors. Hence, FlhA appears to be an essential virulence factor with a pleiotropic role.
TI  - Efficient growth inhibition of Bacillus anthracis by knocking out the ribonucleotide reductase tyrosyl radical.
AB  - Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is a worldwide problem because of the need for effective treatment of respiratory infections shortly after exposure. One potential key enzyme of B. anthracis to be targeted by antiproliferative drugs is ribonucleotide reductase. It provides deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis needed for spore germination and growth of the pathogen. We have cloned, purified, and characterized the tyrosyl radical-carrying NrdF component of B. anthracis class Ib ribonucleotide reductase. Its EPR spectrum points to a hitherto unknown three-dimensional geometry of the radical side chain with a 60 degrees rotational angle of C(alpha)-(C(beta)-C(1))-plane of the aromatic ring. The unusual relaxation behavior of the radical signal and its apparent lack of line broadening at room temperature suggest a weak interaction with the nearby diiron site and the presence of a water molecule plausibly bridging the phenolic oxygen of the radical to a ligand of the diiron site. We show that B. anthracis cells are surprisingly resistant to the radical scavenger hydroxyurea in current use as an antiproliferative drug, even though its NrdF radical is efficiently scavenged in vitro. Importantly, the antioxidants hydroxylamine and N-methyl hydroxylamine scavenge the radical several orders of magnitude faster and prevent B. anthracis growth at several hundred-fold lower concentrations compared with hydroxyurea. Phylogenetically, the B. anthracis NrdF protein clusters together with NrdFs from the pathogens Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. We suggest the potential use of N-hydroxylamines in combination therapies against infections by B. anthracis and closely related pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of coumarins.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of coumarin per se and other 45 coumarin derivatives was tested against strains of Bacillus cereus MIP 96016, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The inhibitory effects of coumarins were affected by their substitution patterns. Osthenol (44) showed the most effective antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria with MIC values ranging between 125 and 62.5 microg/ml. These results suggested that the prenyl chain of 44 at position 8 and the presence of OH at position 7 of the benzenic ring are required for the antibacterial activity against these strains.
TI  - Differential activity of a lectin from Solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A lectin isolated from the red alga Solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). The lectin (500 microg/mL) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species Bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/mL but the lectin (10-1000 microg/mL) had no effect on the growth of the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and B. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. It is possible that the interaction of S. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. Growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium B. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/mL. The stimulation of the growth of B. cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/mL), its hapten. Thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. The present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.
TI  - Use of oligonucleotide array for identification of six foodborne pathogens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown on selective media.
AB  - Identification of presumptive foodborne pathogens grown on selective media may take one to several days and requires a different battery of biochemical tests for each microorganism. A molecular identification method was developed in which universal primers were used to amplify the 16S to 23S rDNA intergenic spacer of target microorganisms, and PCR products were hybridized to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides that were immobilized on a nylon membrane. The seven target microorganisms were Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. After testing a large collection of target bacteria (29 to 51 strains) and nontarget bacteria (> 500 strains), the performances (sensitivity and specificity) of the oligonucleotide array were as follows: B. cereus (100 and 77%), E. coli (100 and 100%), L. monocytogenes (100 and 90%), P. aeruginosa (100 and 100%), Salmonella (100 and 100%), S. aureus (100 and 100%), and V. parahaemolyticus (100 and 94.2%). Other species in the B. cereus group cross-hybridized to the probes used for identification of B. cereus, and positive results should be confirmed by additional morphological observation of colonies. Listeria innocua cross-reacted with probes used to identify L. monocytogenes, but a simple hemolysis test was used to differentiate the two species. Some strains of Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio mimicus cross-hybridized with probes used for identification of V. parahaemolyticus and caused false-positive reactions. The advantage of the array is that a common protocol was used to identify the seven target microorganisms and multiple different microorganisms could be simultaneously identified on a single array.
TI  - Optimal sampling time after preparation of platelet concentrates for detection of bacterial contamination by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A universal quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), based on bacterial 16S rDNA, to detect bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs), was developed previously and compared with automated culturing. In the present study, this real-time PCR method was evaluated to determine the optimal sampling time for screening of bacterial contamination in PCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Routinely prepared PCs were spiked with suspensions of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Propionibacterium acnes to 1, 10 and 100 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml and stored at room temperature for 7 days. The presence of bacteria in these PCs was monitored by quantitative real-time PCR. As a reference method (additional control), BacT/Alert automated culturing was used. For PCR, 1-ml aliquots were drawn from all (spiked) PCs on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of storage. As a control, triplicate samples (10 ml) were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic BacT/Alert culture bottles immediately after spiking (day 0) and after storage for 1, 2, 3, 6 or 7 days. RESULTS: With quantitative real-time PCR, all bacterial species tested were reproducibly detected on day 1 after spiking at original concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU/ml. Bacteria were also detected on day 1 from PCs spiked with an initial concentration of 1 CFU/ml, except for E. coli, which was detected in only one of the three samples and P. aeruginosa, for which analysis was not performed on day 1. With the reference method, bacteria were detected in culture bottles (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 20.1 h, with the exception of P. acnes which was detected at a mean time of 102.3 and 49.3 h (for original spiking concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU/ml respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PCR enables the rapid detection of low initial numbers of bacteria in PCs. For reliable detection, our results support that sampling of PCs for real-time PCR screening should not be carried out earlier than 1 day after preparation (48 h after blood collection). Importantly, the real-time PCR approach has the potential to be used before the release of PCs from the blood centre or shortly before they are transfused in the hospital.
TI  - [Study of real-time PCR assays for rapid detection of food-borne pathogens].
AB  - A duplex real-time SYBR Green LightCycler PCR (LC-PCR) assay with DNA extraction  using QIAamp DNA Stool Minikit was evaluated for detection of 8 of 19 species of food-borne pathogens, including Plesiomonas shigelloides, Providencia alcalifaciens, in five stool specimens. The time frame was within 2h or less. The protocol used the same LC-PCR with 22 pairs of specific primers. The rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes were determined by this LC-PCR assay from 10 cases of food-borne outbreaks in Shimane Prefecture from 2002 to 2005. These cases included Campylobacter jejuni (4), Clostridium perfringens (2), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and astA positive E. coli (1), and astA positive E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli 026, and Bacillus cereus (1 each). Rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of food-or water-borne pathogenic bacteria in fecal samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food-borne outbreaks.
TI  - Isolation of bacterial strains colonizable in mosquito larval guts as novel host  cells for mosquito control.
AB  - We screened for microorganisms that can be utilized as new host cells for mosquito larvicides. As long persistence in the environment is required of host cells, we examined the bacterial populations in the guts of mosquito larvae collected from natural breeding habitats. Larvae of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus were examined, and Bacillus species, particularly Bacillus cereus, were found to be the dominant bacterial species in their guts. To investigate the relationship between these Bacillus strains and the mosquito larvae, we re-introduced the bacteria into larvae of Aedes aegypti, C. quinquefasciatus and another common mosquito strain, Anopheles dirus. The cell numbers of Bacillus cereus strains Ae10 and Cx5 in the guts were consistent throughout a 7-d period without food supplementation, suggesting that these strains were able to colonize in the guts of the larvae. To confirm this, we introduced a plasmid containing a kanamycin resistance marker into Ae10 and Cx5 and fed these recombinant strains to C. quinquefasciatus larvae. Even when food was supplemented for 7 d, the recombinant strains, particularly Ae10, were still found in the guts. Under similar conditions, B. thuringiensis serovar israelensis c4Q2-72 was hardly detectable after 2 d, while Escherichia coli could not be detected at all. Their stable retention in mosquito larvae guts and the feasibility of genetic manipulation indicates these strains possess high potential as novel host cells for application in mosquito control.
TI  - Molecular cloning and structural analysis of the gene encoding Bacillus cereus exochitinase Chi36.
AB  - The chi36 gene encoding exochitinase Chi36 was cloned from a Bacillus cereus 6E1  subgenomic library. The chi36 open reading frame is 1080 bp long encoding a Chi36 precursor protein of 360 amino acids, consisting of a 27 amino acid N-terminal signal peptide and a 333 amino acid sequence found in the mature Chi36 protein of 36.346 kDa. Chi36 shows significant amino acid sequence similarity to many bacterial chitinases, but has highest similarity to B. circulans WL-12 chitinase D. Chi36 belongs to subfamily B of bacterial chitinases in family 18 of glycosyl hydrolases. Chi36 shows a simple and compact structural organization composed of an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal (beta/alpha)8-barrel catalytic domain (CaD). The Chi36 signal peptide is recognized by Escherichia coli, allowing Chi36 secretion. Chi36 is the first one-domain (CaD) bacterial chitinase cloned from B. cereus.
TI  - Characterization of the NADH-linked acetylacetoin reductase/2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase gene from Bacillus cereus YUF-4.
AB  - A 1.4-kbp DNA fragment, including the NADH-linked acetylacetoin reductase/2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (AACRII/BDH) gene from the chromosomal DNA of Bacillus cereus YUF-4, was cloned in Escherichia coli DH5alpha after its insertion into pUC119, and the resulting plasmid was named pAACRII119. The AACRII/BDH gene had an open reading frame consisting of 1047 bp encoding 349 amino acids. The enzyme exhibited not only AACR activity, but also BDH activity. However, the gene was not located in a 2,3-butanediol (BD) operon, as is the case in the BDH gene of Klebsiella pneumoniae and that of K. terrigena. In addition, there was no BD-cycle-related enzyme gene in the region surrounding the AACRII/BDH gene. The AACR and BDH activities in E. coli DH5alpha/pAACRII119 were 200-fold higher than those in the original B. cereus YUF-4. The characteristics of the AACRII/BDH from E. coli DH 5alpha/pAACRII119 are similar to those of the AACRII/BDH from B. cereus YUF-4. The AACRII/BDH was considered to belong to the NAD(P)- and zinc-dependent long-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (group I ADH) family on the basis of the following distinctive characteristics: it possessed 14 strictly conserved residues of microbial group I ADH and consisted of about 350 amino acids. The enzymatic and genetic characteristics of AACRII/BDH were completely different from those of BDHs belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. These findings indicated that the AACRII/BDH could be considered a new type of BDH.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
TI  - Bacillus cereus DNA topoisomerase I and IIIalpha: purification, characterization  and complementation of Escherichia coli TopoIII activity.
AB  - The Bacillus cereus genome possesses three type IA topoisomerase genes. These genes, encoding DNA topoisomerase I and IIIalpha (bcTopo I, bcTopo IIIalpha), have been cloned into T7 RNA polymerase-regulated plasmid expression vectors and the enzymes have been overexpressed, purified and characterized. The proteins exhibit similar biochemical activity to their Escherichia coli counterparts, DNA topoisomerase I and III (ecTopo I, ecTopo III). bcTopo I is capable of efficiently relaxing negatively supercoiled DNA in the presence of Mg2+ but does not possess an efficient DNA decatenation activity. bcTopo IIIalpha is an active topoisomerase that is capable of relaxing supercoiled DNA at a broad range of Mg2+ concentrations; however, its DNA relaxation activity is not as efficient as that of bcTopo I. In addition, bcTopo III is a potent DNA decatenase that resolves oriC-based plasmid replication intermediates in vitro. Interestingly, bcTopo I and bcTopo IIIalpha are both able to compensate for the loss of ecTopo III in E.coli cells that lack ecTopo I. In contrast, ecTopo I cannot substitute for ecTopo III under these conditions.
TI  - [Microbiologic evaluation of enteral diets handled in a hospital].
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the microbiological quality of open enteral feeding system manipulated in a specialized hospital in oncology in the city of Natal-RN. METHODS: 20 samples of industrialized enteral feeding in open system had been analyzed. The searched microrganisms had been: Bacillus cereus, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp, Clostridium sulfite reducer, mesophilic aerobic bacteria and coagulase positive Staphylococci. The methodology used for accomplishment of the microbiological analyses was the praised one for the Food and Drug Administration--FDA. RESULTS: It was evidenced total coliforms, Escherichia coli and mesophilic aerobic bacteria contamination in 25%, 10% and 20% of the analyzed samples, respectively. It was not identified the presence of Bacillus cereus, Salmonella sp, Clostridium sulfite reducer, and coagulase positive Staphylococci in none of the analyzed samples. CONCLUSION: The gotten results show that the enteral feedings are in unsatisfactory hygienic-sanitary conditions, evidencing the necessity of a bigger control in the manipulation of the same ones.
TI  - Characterization of microorganisms in Argentinean honeys from different sources.
AB  - Seventy polyfloral honeys including commercial samples obtained from supermarkets, harvested from apiaries and purchased in bulk were initially examined for total antibacterial activity. From each sample, numbers of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, total coliforms, moulds and yeasts were determined and the presence of Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Clostridium sulfite-reducers, Paenibacillus larvae and Bacillus spp. was investigated. Moisture content, pH and total acidity were also determined for all samples. Any honey diluted to concentrations from 75% to 1% (w/v) of full-strength honey showed total antibacterial activity. The numbers of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, moulds and yeasts were less than 10(3) cfu/g for all 70 samples. Faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and Clostridium sulfite-reducers were not detected but P. larvae subspp. larvae, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus and Bacillus laterosporus were found among samples. For commercial, apiary and bulk honey the mean values for moisture content, pH and acidity, respectively, were 17.50%, 17.40% and 17.50%; 4.60, 4.10 and 4.20; and 18.30, 20.60 and 21 meq NaOH/kg. P. larvae was recovered from 35% of apiaries including hives in which the bees did not display symptoms of American foulbrood disease.
TI  - Investigations on anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, 12 bacterial strains were screened for antifungal activity against Aspergilli. The culture supernatant and lysates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli (BL21, DH5alpha, HB101, XL Blue), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptomyces thermonitrificans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi were examined for antifungal activity in protein concentration ranging from 1000.0 to 7.8 microg ml-1 using microbroth dilution assay. The lysate of Salm. typhi and E. coli BL21 exhibited the maximum activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Their in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were found to be 15.6-31.2 microg ml-1 by microbroth dilution and spore germination inhibition assays. In disc diffusion assay, a concentration of 3.1 microg disc-1 of Salm. typhi lysate showed significant activity against Aspergilli. Escherichia coli BL21 exhibited similar activity at 6.2 microg disc-1. The work on identification of molecule endowed with antimycotic properties is in progress. CONCLUSION: The products of Salm. typhi and E. coli demonstrated significant activity against Aspergillus species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time that E. coli has been reported for anti-Aspergillus activity. It could be an important source of biologically active compounds useful for developing better new antifungal drugs/or probiotics.
TI  - Recombinant expression of indolicidin concatamers in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are part of the innate immune system of vertebrates and invertebrates. They are active against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Currently, most antimicrobial peptides are extracted from host organisms or produced by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli is a tool for greater production yields at a decreased cost and reduces the use of hazardous materials. We have constructed a concatamer of indolicidin and successfully expressed a fusion product with thioredoxin in E. coli BL21DE3. Codons for methionine residues flanking individual indolicidin genes were incorporated for cyanogen bromide cleavage of the fusion protein and liberation of active monomeric indolicidin. Peptide yields of 150 microg/l monomeric indolicidin were achieved in this first report of recombinant production of indolicidin with demonstrated antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Bacillus cereus meningoencephalitis in preterm infants: neuroimaging characteristics.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Meningoencephalitis can severely damage the developing brain. Preterms are more prone for nosocomial infections with pathogens other than Group B streptococci and Escherichia coli. In this report we focus on the deleterious clinical course and imaging characteristics of proven Bacillus cereus meningoencephalitis. METHODS: We collected 3 cases of proven Bacillus cereus meningoencephalitis. In the medical records we focused on prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal risk factors. Imaging data of several brain ultrasounds, MR images, and diffusion-weighted images were reevaluated. RESULTS: The ultrasound and MR images show a typical pattern of mainly hemorrhagic and early cavitating, selective white matter destruction. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of this paradigm of acquired brain injury may help to better understand the natural course of these severe neonatal infections.
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - A study on inhibitory effects of Sigla tree (Liquidambar orientalis Mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
AB  - In this study, Sigla (Liquidambar orientalis Mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. brevis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. Pure ethanol was used for the control. The antibacterial activity of the Sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. The growths of A. hydrophila, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. megaterium, E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of Sigla storax. The results showed that Sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
TI  - Solid- and vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of six essential oils: susceptibility of selected foodborne bacterial and fungal strains.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils (EOs) of cinnamon (Cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (Syzygium aromaticum), basil (Ocimum basillicum), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), dill (Anethum graveolens), and ginger (Zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). The EOs were tested against an array of four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes), four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, Candida albicans, and two molds, Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus). The rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. In the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. The fungi were the most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the Gram-positive bacterial strains. The Gram-negative strain P. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. The composition of the atmosphere generated by the EOs, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. Cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. As a general rule, MIC (fungi) << MIC (bacteria) with no clear differences between Gram-positive or -negative strains except for P. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the EOs in the vapor phase. The atmosphere generated from the EOs was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. Differences among the volatiles in the EOs, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.
TI  - Fluorescein-labeled beta-lactamase mutant for high-throughput screening of bacterial beta-lactamases against beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The increasing emergence of new bacterial beta-lactamases that can efficiently hydrolyze beta-lactam antibiotics to clinically inactive carboxylic acids has created an intractable problem in the treatment of bacterial infections, and it is highly desirable to develop a useful tool that can rapidly screen bacteria for beta-lactamases against a variety of antibiotic candidates in a high-throughput manner. This paper describes the use of a fluorescein-labeled beta-lactamase mutant (E166Cf) as a convenient fluorescent tool to screen beta-lactamases, including the Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase I (PenPC), B. cereus beta-lactamase II, Bacillus licheniformis PenP, Escherichia coli TEM-1, and Enterobacter cloacae P99 against various beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin G, penicillin V, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, moxalactam, cephaloridine), using a 96-well microplate reader. The E166Cf mutant was constructed by replacing Glu166 on the flexible Omega-loop, which is close to the enzyme's active site, with a cysteine residue on a class A beta-lactamase (B. cereus PenPC) and subsequently labeling the mutant with thiol-reactive fluorescein-5-maleimide. Such modifications significantly impaired the hydrolytic activity of the E166Cf mutant compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. The fluorescence intensity of the E166Cf mutant increases in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics. For antibiotics that are resistant to hydrolysis by the E166Cf mutant (cefuroxime, cefoxitin, moxalactam), the fluorescence signal slowly increases until it reaches a plateau. For antibiotics that can be slowly hydrolyzed by the E166Cf mutant (penicillin G, penicillin V, ampicillin), the fluorescence signal rapidly increases to the plateau and then declines after a prolonged incubation. The E166Cf mutant retains its characteristic pattern of fluorescence signals in the presence of both bacterial beta-lactamases and beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics. In contrast, in the presence of both bacterial beta-lactamases and beta-lactamase-sensitive antibiotics, the fluorescence signals of the E166Cf mutant were decreased. The fluorescence signals from the E166Cf mutant allow an unambiguous differentiation of beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics from beta-lactamase-sensitive ones in the screening of bacterial beta-lactamases against a panel of antibiotic candidates. This simple method may provide an alternative tool in choosing potent beta-lactam antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections.
TI  - The assessment of biological activities associated with the major constituents of the methanol extract of 'wild carrot' (Daucus carota L) seeds.
AB  - Daucus carota L. (Family: Apiaceae alt. Umbelliferae), commonly known as 'wild carrot' or 'Queen Anne's-lace,' is an ecologically invasive erect biennial naturalized to Scotland. The ethnobotanical uses of this species include applications in the treatment of cough, diarrhea, dysentery, cancer, malaria and tumors, and as an antiseptic, abortifacient, aphrodisiac, carminative, stimulant, stomachic and tonic. The major constituents isolated from the methanol extract of D. carota seeds by reversed-phase preparative high performance chromatography were luteolin, luteolin 3'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and luteolin 4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, three flavones. The constituents were assessed for their antibacterial and free radical scavenging activities, as well as toxicity towards brine shrimp. Among these three flavones, luteolin showed the highest degree of free radical scavenging activity (RC50 = 4.3 x 10(-4) mg/mL) in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Both luteolin and its 4'-O-glucoside demonstrated bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration [MIC] = 5.0 x 10(-2) - 1.0 x 10(-1) mg/mL). Luteolin also demonstrated antibactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus and Citrobacter freundii (MIC = 5.0 x 10(-2) mg/mL). Luteolin 3'-O-glucoside showed bactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus and Lactobacillus plantarum (MIC = 2.5 x 10(-1) mg/mL and 5 x 10(-1) mg/ mL, respectively). In the brine shrimp lethality assay, the LD50 value of luteolin was 5.3 x 10(-2) mg/mL, and that of its 3'-O-glucoside and 4'-O-glucoside were > 1.0 mg/mL.
TI  - Microbiological quality of ready-to-eat foods: results from a long-term surveillance program (1995 through 2003).
AB  - The coordination of food sampling activities across Wales, a part of the United Kingdom with a population of approximately 3 million, led to the establishment in 1995 of a coordinated food-sampling program designed to monitor on a long-term basis the microbiological quality and safety of specific ready-to-eat products. This surveillance system has been ongoing for 9 years and has generated a database of microbiological and associated demographic results for 15,228 ready-to-eat food samples. The food types that had the poorest overall results were sliced meats, unsliced poultry, sandwiches made without salad, and cakes made without dairy cream. For all food types, the overall unsatisfactory rate was 17% for aerobic colony counts, 1.6% for Escherichia coli, and 0.5% for Listeria spp. Overall unsatisfactory or unacceptable rates for pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus were all below 0.5%. No Campylobacter-positive samples and only one Salmonella-positive sample were found. The analysis of the results show that the ready-to-eat food types sampled over the 9 years of the program were generally of good microbiological quality when compared with current United Kingdom guidelines. The information contained in the database provides a baseline measurement of the microbial quality of a variety of ready-to-eat foods and allows environmental health officers and food microbiologists to generate hypotheses for targeted surveys or research work.
TI  - Microbial profiles of on-line--procured sprouting seeds and potential hazards associated with enterotoxigenic Bacillus spp. in homegrown sprouts.
AB  - We examined the microbiological quality of sprouting seeds sold through the Internet. Overall, five types of seeds each from six organic and six conventional sources were evaluated. The growth and toxin production of naturally occurring Bacillus spp. in sprouts produced using home-scale sprouting devices also were investigated. For alfalfa, broccoli, lentil, mungbean, and radish seeds, the average microbial counts were 3.3, 4.0, 2.8, 3.5, and 3.6 log CFU/g, presumptive B. cereus counts were 0.7, 1.0, 0.8, 1.0, and 0.9 log CFU/g, and total coliform counts were -0.3, -0.4, -0.5, 0.0, and -0.4 log of the most probable number per gram, respectively. No Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157, other fecal coliforms, or Staphylococcus aureus was found on seeds. Compared with conventional seeds, the organic seeds had lower or equivalent counts for total microorganisms, presumptive B. cereus, and total coliforms. When seeds were sprouting using a glass jar, the growth of presumptive B. cereus was significant for radish and broccoli but not for alfalfa, lentil, and mungbean sprouts; the counts exceeded 5.0 log CFU/g in radish sprouts. When sprouts were grown using an automatic sprouting device, presumptive B. cereus showed slight growth (< 3.0 log cycles) in radish, broccoli, and mungbean sprouts but no growth in alfalfa and lentil sprouts. Although the presumptive B. cereus isolates were enterotoxigenic, they did not produce or accumulate detectable levels of diarrheal toxins in freshly produced sprouts.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cerein 8A, a bacteriocin-like peptide produced by Bacillus cereus.
AB  - The mode of action of cerein 8A, a bacteriocin produced by the soil bacterium Bacillus cereus 8A, was investigated. The effect of cerein 8A was tested against Listeria monocytogenes and a bactericidal effect at 400 arbitrary units (AU)/ml was observed. In addition, cerein 8A was bactericidal against Bacillus cereus at 200 AU/ml, and inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and Salmonella Enteritidis. Stronger inhibition of these gram-negative bacteria was achieved when the chelating agent EDTA was added together with bacteriocin. The effect of cerein 8A on B. cereus and L. monocytogenes was also investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Treated cells had an important frequency increase at 2920 cm-1 and a decrease at 1400 cm-1, corresponding to assignments of fatty acids. Transmission electron microscopy showed damaged cell walls and loss of protoplasmic material. These results suggest that the mode of action of cerein 8A is to interfere with cell membranes and the cell wall.
TI  - Isolation of cupanioside, a novel cytotoxic and antibacterial long-chain fatty alcohol glycoside from the bark of Cupania glabra.
AB  - The crude dichloromethane extract from the stem bark of Cupania glabra (Sapindaceae), showed in vitro cytotoxic activity against Hep G2, MDA-MB-231, Hs 578T, MCF-7, and PC-3 cells, and antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Bioactivity-directed fractionation led to isolation of the new 1-O-[2'',3'',4''-tri-O-acetyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta- D-glucopyranosyl]-hexadecanol (cupanioside) as the cytotoxic agent. The structure was elucidated by analysis of 2D-NMR spectra.
TI  - [Expression and bioactive characterization of bacteriophage lysin gene of Bacillus anthracis in Escherichia coli].
AB  - The lysin gene of Bacillus anthracis-diagnosing bacteriophage, obtained by PCR amplification,was cloned into the Escherichia coli exepression vector pET22b which has been cleaved by EcoR I and Nde I. The recombinant vector pET22b-gamma lysin was verified to be correctly constructed by PCR, sequencing and enzyme digestion, and highly expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), which accounted for about 40 percent of total protein in E. coli BL21 (DE3), while in the 5L fermentor the expression level reached 15g/L. After expression, disruption and purification with three-step chromatography, Streamline SP, SP HP and Sephacryl S-100, the recombinant gamma lysin was finally obtained with purity of higher than 95 percent as determined by gel scan. The final yield following SP HP was 19.1 percent, with a greater-than-350-fold increase in specific activity. The pure enzyme has been shown active to Bacillus anthracis, and not to E. coli, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus. Its specific activity was about 1400 u/mg.
TI  - Systematic determination of the mosaic structure of bacterial genomes: species backbone versus strain-specific loops.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Public databases now contain multitude of complete bacterial genomes, including several genomes of the same species. The available data offers new opportunities to address questions about bacterial genome evolution, a task that requires reliable fine comparison data of closely related genomes. Recent analyses have shown, using pairwise whole genome alignments, that it is possible to segment bacterial genomes into a common conserved backbone and strain-specific sequences called loops. RESULTS: Here, we generalize this approach and propose a strategy that allows systematic and non-biased genome segmentation based on multiple genome alignments. Segmentation analyses, as applied to 13 different bacterial species, confirmed the feasibility of our approach to discern the 'mosaic' organization of bacterial genomes. Segmentation results are available through a Web interface permitting functional analysis, extraction and visualization of the backbone/loops structure of documented genomes. To illustrate the potential of this approach, we performed a precise analysis of the mosaic organization of three E. coli strains and functional characterization of the loops. CONCLUSION: The segmentation results including the backbone/loops structure of 13 bacterial species genomes are new and available for use by the scientific community at the URL: http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/mosaic.
TI  - Antagonistic activity against Salmonella infection in vitro and in vivo for two Lactobacillus strains from swine and poultry.
AB  - In this study, we isolated two lactobacillus strains, i.e., strain LAP5 and LF33, from swine and poultry, respectively, and showed that both strains were acid as well as bile tolerant and were able to adhere to the cultured human intestinal cell lines, such as Int-407 and Caco-2 cells, and to the intestinal epithelium cells isolated from swine, poultry and mouse (BALB/c). Both of these LAB strains were shown to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. When these two LAB strains were evaluated for their antagonistic activity against Salmonella (S. typhimurium) invasion to cultured human intestinal cell line Int-407 and to mouse (BALB/c) liver and spleen, these two LAB strains were found to have significant antagonistic effect.
TI  - Effect of the implementation of HACCP on the microbiological quality of meals at  a university restaurant.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the microbiological quality, including total mesophilic counts and markers of bacteriological hygiene, as indicator of food safety of three categories of the most consumed meals in a university restaurant, before and after implementation of the HACCP system and personnel training. Cold gastronomy products, cooked warm-served products, and cooked cold-served products were tested for bacterial contamination. Throughout the experiment, 894 samples were examined for total counts of aerobic bacteria, counts of indicator organisms (coliform organisms and Escherichia coli) and pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes). Implementation of the HACCP system, together with training in personnel hygiene, good manufacturing practices, and cleaning and sanitation procedures, resulted in lower aerobic plate counts and a lower incidence of S. aureus, coliform organisms, E. coli, and B. cereus, whereas Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes were not found in all samples studied. The microbial results of this study demonstrate that personnel training together with HACCP application contributed to improve the food safety of meals served in the restaurant studied.
TI  - In-house validation of the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the FDA for the purpose of quality control (QC) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates: the BacT/ALERT blood culture system (bioMerieux) and the Pall eBDS (Pall Corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived PLTs. After the decision of the AABB to institute universal QC testing of PLT concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the performance of our current blood culture system, the BACTEC 9240, was carried out for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with PLT contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis PLT unit per organism. Four mL of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL was inoculated into blood culture bottles (Standard 10 Aerobic/F, Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Systems) and incubated in a BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. Positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to insure the identity of bacterial growth. RESULTS: With the exception of Streptococcus mitis, the BACTEC system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 CFUs per mL for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The limit of detection for the S. mitis test strain was 61 CFUs per mL. Detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. Ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis PLT products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of the BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis PLTs in less than 24 hours.
TI  - Use of a spectrophotometric bioassay for determination of microbial sensitivity to manuka honey.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of manuka honey has been well documented (Molan, 1992a,b,c, 1997) [Molan, P.C., 1992. The antibacterial activity of honey. 1: the nature of the antibacterial activity. Bee World 73 (1) 5-28; Molan, P.C., 1992. The antibacterial activity of honey. 2: variation in the potency of the antibacterial activity. Bee World 73 (2) 59-76; Molan, P.C., 1992. Medicinal uses for honey. Beekeepers Quarterly 26; Molan, P.C., 1997. Finding New Zealand honeys with outstanding antibacterial and antifungal activity. New Zealand Beekeeper 4 (10) 20-26]. The current bioassays for determining this antimicrobial effect employ a well diffusion (Ahn and Stiles, 1990) [Ahn, C., Stiles, M.E., 1990. Antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from vacuum-packed meats. Journal of Applied Bacteriology 69, 302-310], (Weston et al., 1999) [Weston, R.J., Mitchell, K.R., Allen, K.L., 1999. Antibacterial phenolic components of New Zealand manuka honey. J. Food Chem. 64, 295-301] or disc diffusion (Taormina et al., 2001) [Taormina, Peter J., Niemira, Brendan A., Beuchat, Larry R., 2001. Inhibitory activity of honey against food borne pathogens as influenced by the presence of hydrogen peroxide and level of antioxidant power. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 69, 217-225] assay using zones of inhibition as indicators of bacterial susceptibility. The development of a 24-h spectrophotometric assay employing 96-well microtiter plates, that is more sensitive and more amenable to statistical analysis than the assays currently employed, was undertaken. This simple and rapid assay permits extensive kinetic studies even in the presence of low honey concentrations, and is capable of detecting inhibitory levels below those recorded for well or disc diffusion assays. In this paper, we compare the assay to both well and disc diffusion assays. The results we obtained for the spectrophotometric method MIC values show that this method has greater sensitivity than the standard well and disc diffusion assays. In addition, inter- and intra-assay variance for this method was investigated, demonstrating the methods reproducibility and repeatability.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of sulfonamide--derived Schiff's bases and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal Schiff's bases derived from sulfonamides, as well as their transition metal complexes incorporating cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) were synthesized, characterized and screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against six Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Shigella dysentriae) and four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureous and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacterial strains and for in-vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed Schiffs' bases. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study the in-vitro cytotoxic properties of these synthesized ligands and their complexes.
TI  - Rare trisubstituted sesquiterpenes daucanes from the wild Daucus carota.
AB  - Phytochemical and biological investigation of the roots of the wild Daucus carota ssp. carota afforded three new and four known compounds, including four sesquiterpenes daucane esters (1-3 [new], and 4), one polyacetylene (5), one sesquiterpene coumarin (6), and sitosterol glucoside. The structures of the new compounds were determined by comprehensive NMR studies, including DEPT, COSY, NOESY, HMQC and HMBC analyses. Based on an agar diffusion assay, 1, 2 and 4-6 were screened and found to contain a range of low antibacterial activities against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptomyces scabies, Bacillus subtilus, Bacillus cereus) and two gram negative species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) as well as antifungal against Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus niger using cup agar diffusion assay.
TI  - Peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosamine deacetylases from Bacillus cereus, highly conserved proteins in Bacillus anthracis.
AB  - The genomes of Bacillus cereus and its closest relative Bacillus anthracis contain 10 polysaccharide deacetylase homologues. Six of these homologues have been proposed to be peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosamine deacetylases. Two of these genes, namely bc1960 and bc3618, have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzymes have been purified to homogeneity and further characterized. Both enzymes were effective in deacetylating cell wall peptidoglycan from the Gram(+) Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis and the Gram(-) Helicobacter pylori as well as soluble chitin substrates and N-acetylchitooligomers. However, the enzymes were not active on acetylated xylan. These results provide insight into the substrate specificity of carbohydrate esterase family 4 enzymes. It was revealed that both enzymes deacetylated only the GlcNAc residue of the synthetic muropeptide N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-(beta-1,4)-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine-D-isoglutamine. Analysis of the constituent muropeptides of peptidoglycan from B. subtilis and H. pylori resulting from incubation of the enzymes BC1960 and BC3618 with these polymers and subsequent hydrolysis by Cellosyl and mutanolysin, respectively, similarly revealed that both enzymes deacetylate GlcNAc residues of peptidoglycan. Kinetic analysis toward GlcNAc(2-6) revealed that GlcNAc4 was the favorable substrate for both enzymes. Identification of the sequence of N-acetychitooligosaccharides (GlcNAc(2-4)) following enzymatic deacetylation by using 1H NMR revealed that both enzymes deacetylate all GlcNAc residues of the oligomers except the reducing end ones. Enzymatic deacetylation of chemically acetylated vegetative peptidoglycan from B. cereus by BC1960 and BC3618 resulted in increased resistance to lysozyme digestion. This is the first biochemical study of bacterial peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosamine deacetylases.
TI  - Expanding the bactericidal action of the food color additive phloxine B to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Phloxine B (D&C red no. 28) is a color additive for food, drugs, and cosmetics. It has been previously shown to have anti-Staphylococcus aureus activities. In this work, the effect of Phloxine B on various gram-negative bacteria and other gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus mycoides, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus aureus, Salmonella, Escherichia coli and Shigella was studied, along with the mechanism of anti-microbial activity. In the presence of fluorescent light, the viable count for gram-positive bacteria, (Bacillus spp. and S. aureus) decreased in a dose and time dependent manner when incubated with Phloxine B. The viability of gram-positive bacteria was reduced by 99.99% in 40 min, while there was no effect on gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella choleraesuis, E. coli and Shigella flexneri). However, the use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) expands the spectrum of activity for Phloxine B to include gram-negative bacteria. EDTA increased membrane-permeability by releasing lipopolysaccharide. Overall, in an Agar diffusion test the light-dependent bactericidal activity of 1 microg of Phloxine B had a potency of 0.64 units of chloramphenicol and 0.5 units of tetracycline when tested on B. cereus, and had a potency of 0.7 units of chloramphenicol and 0.2 units of tetracycline when tested on S. aureus. The data suggest that the dye may have some potential anti-microbial applications.
TI  - Characterization of chito-oligosaccharides prepared by chitosanolysis with the aid of papain and Pronase, and their bactericidal action against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Papain (from papaya latex; EC 3.4.22.2) and Pronase (from Streptomyces griseus; EC 3.4.24.31) caused optimum depolymerization of chitosan at pH 3.5 and 37 degrees C, resulting in LMMC (low molecular mass chitosan) and chito-oligomeric-monomeric mixture. The yield of the latter was 14-16% and 14-19% respectively for papain- and Pronase-catalysed reactions, depending on the reaction time (1-5 h). HPLC revealed the presence of monomer(s) and oligomers of DP (degree of polymerization) 2-6, which was also confirmed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight MS. Along with the chito-oligomers, the appearance of only GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine) in Pronase-catalysed chitosanolysis was indicative of its different action pattern compared with papain. Fourier-transform infrared, liquid-state 13C-NMR spectra and CD analyses of chito-oligomeric-monomeric mixture indicated the release of GlcNAc/GlcNAc-rich oligomers. The monomeric sequence at the non-reducing ends of chito-oligomers was elucidated using N-acetylglucosaminidase. The chito-oligomeric-monomeric mixture showed better growth inhibitory activity towards Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli compared with native chitosan. Optimum growth inhibition was observed with chito-oligomers of higher DP having low degree of acetylation. The latter caused pore formation and permeabilization of the cell wall of B. cereus, whereas blockage of nutrient flow due to the aggregation of chito-oligomers-monomers was responsible for the growth inhibition and lysis of E. coli, which were evidenced by scanning electron microscopy analysis. The spillage of cytoplasmic enzymes and native PAGE of the cell-free supernatant of B. cereus treated with chito-oligomeric-monomeric mixture further confirmed bactericidal activity of the latter. Use of papain and Pronase, which are inexpensive and easily available, for chitosanolysis, is of commercial importance, as the products released are of considerable biomedical value.
TI  - Host-pathogen interactions: a proteomic view.
AB  - Host-pathogen interactions reflect the balance of host defenses and pathogen virulence mechanisms. Advances in proteomic technologies now afford opportunities to compare protein content between complex biologic systems ranging from cells to animals and clinical samples. Thus, it is now possible to characterize host-pathogen interactions from a global proteomic view. Most reports to date focus on cataloging protein content of pathogens and identifying virulence-associated proteins or proteomic alterations in host response. A more in-depth understanding of host-pathogen interactions has the potential to improve our mechanistic understanding of pathogenicity and virulence, thereby defining novel therapeutic and vaccine targets. In addition, proteomic characterization of the host response can provide pathogen-specific host biomarkers for rapid pathogen detection and characterization, as well as for early and specific detection of infectious diseases. A review of host-pathogen interactions focusing on proteomic analyses of both pathogen and host will be presented. Relevant genomic studies and host model systems will be also be discussed.
TI  - Temperature effect on bacterial growth rate: quantitative microbiology approach including cardinal values and variability estimates to perform growth simulations on/in food.
AB  - Temperature effect on growth rates of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus, was studied. Growth rates were obtained in laboratory medium by using a binary dilutions method in which 15 optical density curves were generated to determine one mu value. The temperature was in the range from 2 to 48 degrees C, depending on the bacterial species. Data were analysed after a square root transformation. No large difference between the strains of a same species was observed, and therefore all the strains of a same species were analysed together with the same secondary model. The variability of the residual error, including both measurements errors and biological strain difference, was homogenous for sub-optimal temperature values. To represent this variability in bacterial kinetic simulation, the 95% confidence interval based on an asymptotic Normal distribution, around the growth rate value was determined. With this modelling approach, the behaviour of bacterial species on food, irrespective of the strain or the laboratory, was described. This growth simulation with confidence limits has several applications, such as to facilitate comparisons between a challenge-test and simulation results, and, to appreciate if the temperature change has or has not a significant effect on a bacterial growth profile, with regard to the uncontrolled factors. The integration of this piece of work in the Sym'Previus software is now in process. Results obtained in five French laboratories will be extended by working on new food and new microbial species and improved by further work on variability estimation.
TI  - Finding optimal photosensitisers for the decontamination of foods by the photodynamic effect.
AB  - A new method for sanitation based on the photodynamic effect is introduced. Photosensitisers are compounds that generate cytotoxic oxygen species and free radicals after excitation with appropriate visible light. The cell killing efficacy is due to their chemical structure, to the actual environment and therefore also to their degree of aggregation. As has been shown, photosensitisers bound to the cell wall or incorporated into the cells are very effective cytotoxic agents after illumination. Even singlet oxygen generated in the gas phase surrounding the micro-organisms effectively kills cells. Especially membrane components are the targets of the photodynamic effect. Membrane disintegration is observed soon after illumination. The food contaminants under investigation are Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, forming endospores, Staphylococcus aureus, forming a wide range of agressins, exotoxins and enterotoxins, all gram positive micro-organisms, Escherichia coli, a hygiene indicator, and the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kloeckera javanica, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, a blue and a pink pigmented isolate from foods. We investigated the capacity of several photosensitisers to induce the phototoxic effect towards those micro-organisms following excitation by visible light.
TI  - Chitooligosaccharides--preparation with the aid of pectinase isozyme from Aspergillus niger and their antibacterial activity.
AB  - An isozyme of pectinase from Aspergillus niger with polygalacturonase activity caused chitosanolysis at pH 3.5, resulting in low-molecular weight chitosan (86%), chitooligosaccharides (COs, 4.8%) and monomers (2.2%). HPLC showed the presence of COs with DP ranging from 2 to 6. Charcoal-Celite chromatography and re-N-acetylation of the COs followed by CD, IR, MALDI-TOF-MS and FAB-MS analyses revealed an abundance of chitobiose, chitotriose and chitotetraose. The COs-monomeric mixture showed a bactericidal effect towards Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli more efficiently than native chitosan. Among the chitooligomers, the hexamer showed maximum antibacterial effect followed by the penta-, tetra-, tri- and dimers. Of the two monomers, only GlcN showed slight bacterial growth inhibition. SEM revealed bactericidal action patterns of COs-monomeric mixture towards B. cereus and E. coli.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of extracts of the lichen Hypogymnia tubulosa and its  3-hydroxyphysodic acid constituent.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and the MIC values of the diethyl ether, acetone, chloroform, petroleum ether, and ethanol extracts of the lichen Hypogymnia tubulosa and its 3-hydroxyphysodic acid constituent have been investigated against some microorganisms. At least one of the extracts or 3-hydroxyphysodic acid showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans. No antifungal activity of the extracts has been observed against ten filamentous fungi.
TI  - Identification of an antifungal chitinase from a potential biocontrol agent, Bacillus cereus 28-9.
AB  - Bacillus cereus 28-9 is a chitinolytic bacterium isolated from lily plant in Taiwan. This bacterium exhibited biocontrol potential on Botrytis leaf blight of lily as demonstrated by a detached leaf assay and dual culture assay. At least two chitinases (ChiCW and ChiCH) were excreted by B. cereus 28-9. The ChiCW-encoding gene was cloned and moderately expressed in Escherichia coli DH5alpha. Near homogenous ChiCW was obtained from the periplasmic fraction of E. coli cells harboring chiCW by a purification procedure. An in vitro assay showed that the purified ChiCW had inhibitory activity on conidial germination of Botrytis elliptica, a major fungal pathogen of lily leaf blight.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of an eudesmane sesquiterpene isolated from common Varthemia, Varthemia iphionoides.
AB  - The ethyl acetate extract of the whole aerial parts of Varthemia iphionoides (Compositae) showed a pronounced antibacterial activity. The bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethyl acetate extract and further purification of the most antibacterially active fraction led to the isolation and identification of an antibacterial sesquiterpene, selina-4,11(13)-dien-3-on-12-oic acid. This compound exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against six bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enteritides). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of this compound which was determined by the agar dilution method ranged between 250 and 500 microg/ml.
TI  - Bacillus cereus Fur regulates iron metabolism and is required for full virulence.
AB  - A homologue of the Bacillus subtilis fur gene was identified in Bacillus cereus and characterized. The predicted amino acid sequence of the cloned gene was found to be highly similar to other members of the Fur family of transcriptional regulators. The B. cereus fur gene was shown to partially complement an Escherichia coli fur mutant. Purified B. cereus Fur bound specifically to a 19 bp DNA sequence homologous to the B. subtilis Fur box in a metal-dependent manner. Analysis of the available B. cereus genome data identified a number of genes which contain predicted Fur box sequences in the promoter region. Many of these genes are predicted to play a role in bacterial iron uptake and metabolism, but several have also been implicated as having a role in virulence. Fur and iron regulation of a siderophore biosynthesis operon was confirmed in a beta-galactosidase assay. A B. cereus fur null strain was constructed by allelic replacement of the chromosomal gene with a copy disrupted with a kanamycin resistance cassette. The Deltafur mutant was found to constitutively express siderophores, to accumulate iron intracellularly to a level approximately threefold greater than the wild-type, and to be hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide. In an insect infection model, the virulence of the fur null strain was found to be significantly attenuated, highlighting the essential role played by Fur in the virulence of this pathogen.
TI  - Synthesis of Schiff bases of 4-(4-aminophenyl)-morpholine as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In the present study, a novel series of Schiff bases of 4-(4-aminophenyl)-morpholine were synthesised and characterised by IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, Mass spectral and elemental analysis. The compounds were screened for antibacterial (Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 9144), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 155), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778), Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 4678), and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922)) and antifungal (Candida albicans (ATCC 2091) and Aspergillus niger (ATCC 9029)) activities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the compounds were also ascertained by agar streak dilution method. 4-(4-(4-Hydroxy-benzylidene-imino)phenyl)-morpholine (7) was found to be the most potent antimicrobial activity with MIC of 25, 19, 21, 16, 29, 20 and 40 microg/ml against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. cereus, M. luteus, E. coli, C. albicans and A. niger, respectively. All the other compounds exhibited moderate activity against the bacterial and fungal organisms tested.
TI  - Behavior of Escherichia coli cells and Bacillus cereus spores on poplar wood crates by impedance measurements.
AB  - Dry poplar wood crates and glass surfaces (bottoms of Pyrex flasks) were contaminated with aqueous suspensions of Escherichia coli Collection de l'Institut Pasteur (CIP) 54.8 cells or Bacillus cereus CIP 78.3 spores. After different periods of storage at 25 degrees C, the number of cells still present on both surfaces was determined by impedance microbiology. The physical and chemical properties of the wood greatly and rapidly decreased the number of cells. After 4 h of contact time, B. cereus residual metabolic activity corresponded to less than 10% of the initial inoculum level. With a low inoculum level of 2.4 x 10(2) E. coli cells, sterility of the wood was obtained after a contact time of 24 h. With a higher inoculum level of 10(6) E. coli cells, only a few viable bacteria, corresponding to the metabolic activity of four cells, could be recovered after a prolonged contact time of 145 h. Conversely, under the same conditions of storage, when bacteria were deposited on inert and nonporous materials such as glass surfaces, growth occurred. After 24 h of contact time at 25 degrees C, bacterial populations were about 10(9) cells for E. coli and 10(7) cells for B. cereus. Under our experimental conditions after a prolonged contact time, wood exhibited growth-inhibiting properties and cells were no longer metabolically active. These results indicate that the potential for cross-contamination of foods stored directly in contact with previously contaminated poplar wood crates is low under our experimental conditions.
TI  - Pollution status of swimming pools in south-south zone of south-eastern Nigeria using microbiological and physicochemical indices.
AB  - Microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of swimming pools in South Eastern states of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom and Cross River) were investigated. The bacterial isolates included Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Others were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fungal isolates were Penicillium sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus versicolor Fusarium sp, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Mucor sp, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Absidia sp. The total viable count of microorganims in Ibeno (B) and Uyo (E) swimming pools were 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml and for Calabar (H) swimming pool, 3.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The total coliform counts were 10(6) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (G) swimming pools and 2 x 10(7) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (H) swimming pools while the fungal count ranged from 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml to 3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. Physical and chemical parameters known to be hazardous to health were also identified. The presence of high levels of coliform and fecal coliform bacteria (E. coli) revelaed that the swimming pools have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for recreational waters. The swimming pools constitute a serious public health hazard.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 4-benzoyl-1-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid and derivatives.
AB  - Some new 1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid and pyridazinone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activities against Bacillus cereus ATCC 7064, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Escherichia coli ATCC 4230 and Pseudomonas putida using tube dilution method. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) experiments revealed that all chemical compounds showed inhibitor effects on the growth of the test microorganisms. Moreover, the results of this research showed that the compound named as 5c was the best compound in the series, exhibiting antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - High-level expression and characterization of two chitinases, ChiCH and ChiCW, of Bacillus cereus 28-9 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Many chitinase genes have been cloned and sequenced from prokaryotes and eukaryotes but overexpression of chitinases in Escherichia coli cells was less reported. ChiCH and ChiCW of Bacillus cereus 28-9 belong to two distinct groups based on their amino acid sequences of catalytic domains, and in addition, domain structures of two enzymes are different. In this study, we established an ideal method for high-level expression of chitinases in E. coli as glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins using pGEX-6P-1 vector. Both ChiCH and ChiCW were successfully highly expressed in E. coli cells as soluble GST-chitinase fusion proteins, and recombinant native ChiCH and ChiCW could be purified after cleavage with PreScission protease to remove GST tag. Purified chitinases were used for biochemical characterization of kinetics, hydrolysis products, and binding activities. The results indicate that ChiCW is an endo-chitinase and effectively hydrolyzes chitin and chito-multimers to chito-oligomers and the end product chitobiose, and ChiCH is an exo-chitinase and degrades chito-oligomers to produce chitobiose. Furthermore, due to higher affinity of ChiCW toward colloidal chitin than Avicel, C-terminal domain of ChiCW should be classified as a chitin-binding domain not a cellulose-binding domain although that was revealed as a cellulose-binding domain by conserved domain analysis. Therefore, the method of high-level expression of chitinases is helpful to studies and applications of chitinases.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and specificity of the six human {alpha}-defensins.
AB  - We developed a kinetic, 96-well turbidimetric procedure that is capable of testing the antimicrobial properties of six human alpha-defensins concurrently on a single microplate. The defensins were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis and tested against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli). Analysis of the growth curves provided virtual lethal doses (vLDs) equivalent to conventional 50% lethal doses (LD(50)s), LD(90)s, LD(99)s, and LD(99.9)s obtained from colony counts. On the basis of their respective vLD(90)s and vLD(99)s, the relative potencies of human myeloid alpha-defensins against S. aureus were HNP2 > HNP1 > HNP3 > HNP4. In contrast, their relative potencies against E. coli and E. aerogenes were HNP4 > HNP2 > HNP1 = HNP3. HD5 was as effective as HNP2 against S. aureus and as effective as HNP4 against the gram-negative bacteria in our panel. HD6 showed little or no activity against any of the bacteria in our panel, including B. cereus, which was highly susceptible to the other five alpha-defensins. The assay described provides a quantitative, precise, and economical way to study the antimicrobial activities of host-defense peptides. Its use has clarified the relative potencies of human alpha-defensins and raised intriguing questions about the in vivo function(s) of HD6.
TI  - Cloning, recombinant expression and biochemical characterisation of novel esterases from Bacillus sp. associated with the marine sponge Aplysina aerophoba.
AB  - Two novel esterases (EstB1 and EstB2) were isolated from a genomic library of Bacillus sp. associated with the marine sponge Aplysina aerophoba. EstB1 shows low identity (26-44%) with the published hydrolases of the genus Bacillus, whereas EstB2 shows high identity (73-74%) with the carboxylesterases from B. cereus and B. anthracis. Both esterases were efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of T7 promoter using the vector pET-22b(+). Recombinant EstB1 was purified in a single step to electrophoretic homogeneity by IMAC. A method for the refolding of inclusion bodies formed by the recombinant EstB2 was established to obtain active enzyme. Substrate specificity of the two enzymes towards p-nitrophenyl and methyl esters and the respective kinetic parameters K(m) and V(max) were determined. The temperature optima of EstB1 and EstB2 were determined to be in the range of 30-50 degrees C and 20-35 degrees C, respectively. The pH optima were found to be in the range of 6.5-7.5 and 6.5-8.0, respectively. Both enzymes showed the highest stability in up to 50% (v/v) DMSO followed by methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol. The influence of high NaCl and KCl concentrations was tested. The inhibition effect of 10-50 mM Zn(2+) and 50 mM Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) ions was observed for both esterases. One to five millimolar PMSF deactivated the enzymes, whereas beta-mercaptoethanol, DTT and EDTA had no effect on the enzymes activity.
TI  - Essential oils of Satureja, Origanum, and Thymus species: chemical composition and antibacterial activities against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oils obtained from the species restricted to Greece and the eastern Mediterranean region, Satureja spinosa L. and Thymus longicaulis L.; species endemic to central and south Greece, Satureja parnassica ssp. parnassica Heldr. and Sart ex Boiss.; species endemic to the island of Crete, Origanum dictamnus L.; and species widely distributed in the Mediterranean region, Satureja thymbra L. and Origanum vulgare L. subsp. hirtum, were determined by gas chromatography (GC) and GC/mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The in vitro antibacterial activities of the essential oils were evaluated against a panel of five foodborne bacteria (Escherichia coli 0157:H7 NCTC 12900, Salmonella enteritidis PT4, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Listeria monocytogenes ScottA, and Bacillus cereus FSS 134). The analytical data indicated that various monoterpene hydrocarbons and phenolic monoterpenes constitute the major components of the oils, but their concentrations varied greatly among the oils examined. The antibacterial assay results showed that 5 muL doses of the essential oils extracted from the endemic Satureja species in Greece possess remarkable bactericidal properties, which are clearly superior as compared to those of Origanum and Thymus species essential oils. Therefore, they represent an inexpensive source of natural mixtures of antibacterial compounds that exhibit potentials for use in food systems to prevent the growth of foodborne bacteria and extend the shelf life of the processed food.
TI  - Synthesis and study of antibacterial and antifungal activities of novel 2-[[(benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-yl)sulfanyl] acetylamino]thiazoles.
AB  - Several 2-[[(benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-yl)sulfanyl]acetylamino]thiazoles derivatives were synthesized by reacting 4-substituted-2-(chloroacetylamino)thiazoles with benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-thioles in acetone and in the presence of K2CO3. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, 1H-NMR, and FAB(+)-MS spectral data. Their antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus (NRLL B-4375), Bacillus cereus (NRRL B-3711), Proteus vulgaris (NRRL B-123), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Staphylococcus aureus (NRRL B-767), Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Candida albicans and Candida globrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi Uni. Fac.of Medicine) were investigated and in this investigation, a significant level of activity was illustrated.
TI  - Biologically active traditional medicinal herbs from Balochistan, Pakistan.
AB  - The biological activities of the following four important medicinal plants of Balochistan, Pakistan were checked; Grewia erythraea Schwein f. (Tiliaceae), Hymenocrater sessilifolius Fisch. and C.A. Mey (Lamiaceae), Vincetoxicum stocksii Ali and Khatoon (Asclepiadaceae) and Zygophyllum fabago L. (Zygophyllaceae). The methanolic extracts were fractionated into hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, butanol and water. The antifungal and antibacterial activities of these plants were determined against 12 fungal and 12 bacterial strains by agar well diffusion and disk diffusion assays. The extract of Zygophyllum fabago was found to be highly effective against Candida albicans and Escherichia coli. The extract of Vincetoxicum stocksii was also found to be significantly active against Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus. Extracts of Hymenocrater sessilifolius and Grewia erythraea showed good activity only against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Characterization of the Bacillus cereus Nhe enterotoxin.
AB  - The non-haemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) is one of two three-component enterotoxins responsible for the diarrhoeal food-poisoning syndrome caused by Bacillus cereus. Nhe is composed of NheA, NheB and NheC. The three genes encoding the Nhe components constitute an operon, and the transcriptional start site is located 61 bp upstream of the nheA translational start site. The nhe genes were cloned separately, and expressed in either Bacillus subtilis or Escherichia coli. Separate expression showed that all three components were required for biological activity. In addition, NheA and NheB were purified from B. cereus culture supernatants. As NheC seems to be expressed in only small amounts by B. cereus, NheC was expressed and purified as a histidine-tagged fusion protein. The maximum cytotoxic activity was obtained when the molar ratio between NheA : NheB : His6-NheC was 10 : 10 : 1, and it was shown that NheB was the binding component of the enterotoxin complex.
TI  - Detection and identification of bacteria in a juice matrix with Fourier transform-near infrared spectroscopy and multivariiate analysis.
AB  - The use of Fourier transform-near infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy combined with multivariate pattern recognition techniques was evaluated to address the need for a fast and senisitive method for the detection of bacterial contamination in liquids. The complex cellular composition of bacteria produces FT-NIR vibrational transitions (overtone and combination bands), forming the basis for identification and subtyping. A database including strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus thuringiensis was built, with special care taken to optimize sample preparation. The bacterial cells were treated with 70% (vol/vol) ethanolto enhance safe handling of pathogenic strains and then concentrated on an aluminum oxide membrane to obtain a thin bacterial film. This simple membrane filtration procedure generated reproducible FT-NIR spectra that allowed for the rapid discrimination among closely related strains. Principal component analysis and soft independent modeling of class analogy of transformed spectra in the region 5,100 to 4,400 cm(-1) were able to discriminate between bacterial species. Spectroscopic analysis of apple juices inoculated with different strains of E. coli at approximately 10(5) CFU/ml showed that FT-NIR spectralfeatures are consistent with bacterial contamination and soft independent modeling of class analogy correctly predicted the identity of the contaminant as strains of E. coli. FT-NIR in conjunction with multivariate techniques can be used for the rapid and accurate evaluation of potential bacterial contamination in liquids with minimal sample manipulation, and hence limited exposure of the laboratory worker to the agents.
TI  - Spectroscopic quantification of bacteria using artificial neural networks.
AB  - Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, in conjunction with artificial neural networks, has been used for identification and classification of selected foodborne pathogens. Five bacterial species (Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella Enteritidis, Bacillus cereus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella boydii) and five Escherichia coli strains (O103, O55, O121, O30, O26) suspended in phosphate-buffered saline were enumerated to provide seven different concentrations ranging from 10(9) to 10(3) CFU/ ml. The trained artificial neural networks were then validated with an independent subset of samples and compared with the traditional plate count method. It was found that the concentration-based classification of the species was 100% correct and the strain-based classification was 90 to 100% accurate.
TI  - [Interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. However, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. Neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin B, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland. The checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. The aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. Checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. In one case Salmonella Enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. Additive effects were predominant--49%. In 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations FIC indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. In combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. The best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.
TI  - A new Bacillus cereus DNA-binding protein, HlyIIR, negatively regulates expression of B. cereus haemolysin II.
AB  - Haemolysin II, HlyII, is one of several cytotoxic proteins produced by Bacillus cereus, an opportunistic human pathogen that causes food poisoning. The hlyII gene confers haemolytic activity to Escherichia coli cells. Here a new B. cereus gene, hlyIIR, which is located immediately downstream of hlyII and regulates hlyII expression, is reported. The deduced amino acid sequence of HlyIIR is similar to prokaryotic DNA-binding transcriptional regulators of the TetR/AcrA family. Measurements of haemolytic activity levels and of hlyII promoter activity levels using gene fusions and primer-extension assays demonstrated that, in E. coli, hlyII transcription decreased in the presence of hlyIIR. Recombinant HlyIIR binds to a 22 bp inverted DNA repeat centred 48 bp upstream of the hlyII promoter transcription initiation point. In vitro transcription studies showed that HlyIIR inhibits transcription from the hlyII promoter by binding to the 22 bp repeat and RNA polymerase, and by decreasing the formation of the catalytically competent open promoter complex.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of water extract of sumac (Rhus coriaria L.) on the growth of some food borne bacteria including pathogens.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect of water extracts of sumac (Rhus coriaria L.) at concentrations of 0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.5% and 5.0% (w/v), non-neutralized and after neutralization to pH 7.2+/-0.1, was studied on the growth of 12 bacterial strains (six Gram positive strains and six Gram negative strains), mostly food borne including pathogens. It was found to be effective against all the test organisms with Gram positive strains being more sensitive than Gram negative strains. Significant differences (P<0.01) were found among the bacteria and between the non-neutralized and neutralized extracts with non-neutralized being more effective against all the bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extract for each bacterial strain was studied by a gradient plate method. Among the Gram positive organisms, Bacillus species (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus thuringiensis) were found to be the most sensitive showing MICs of 0.25-0.32% (after 24 h incubation) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (0.49%), while Listeria monocytogenes was found to be the least sensitive demonstrating a MIC of 0.67%. Of the Gram negative organisms, Salmonella enteritidis was found to be the most resistant with a MIC of 0.67% followed by Escherichia coli Type I, E. coli O157:H7, Proteus vulgaris and Hafnia alvei having MICs of 0.63%, 0.60%, 0.55% and 0.45%, respectively; whereas Citrobacter freundii was found to be the least resistant surviving up to 0.42%. Some loss of antimicrobial activity was, however, observed after incubation for 3 days. Bacteriostatic/bactericidal effects of sumac, as studied by enumerating survival by the viable count technique after 1 h direct contact of each microorganism with various concentrations of sumac extract, revealed a 4-5 log cycle reduction in Bacillus spp. and 2-3 log cycle reduction in other bacteria tested with 1.0% sumac extract.
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens and food spoilage organisms by select raw honeys.
AB  - Twenty-seven honey samples from different floral sources and geographical locations were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of seven food spoilage organisms (Alcaligenes faecalis, Aspergillus niger, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Geotrichum candidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Penicillium expansum, Pseudomonas fluorescens) and five foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica Ser. Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) using an overlay inhibition assay. They were also tested for specific activity against S. aureus 9144 and B. stearothermophilus using the equivalent percent phenol test--a well diffusion assay corresponding to a dilute phenol standard curve. Honey inhibited bacterial growth due to high sugar concentration (reduced water activity), hydrogen peroxide generation, and proteinaceous compounds present in the honey. Some antibacterial activity was due to other unidentified components. The ability of honey to inhibit the growth of microorganisms varies widely, and could not be attributed to a specific floral source or demographic region produced in this study. Antibacterially active samples in this study included Montana buckwheat, tarweed, manuka, melaleuca, and saw palmetto. Furthermore, the bacteria were not uniformly affected by honey. Varying sensitivities to the antimicrobial properties were observed with four strains of S. aureus thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey samples. Mold growth was not inhibited by any of the honeys tested. B. stearothermophilus, a heat-resistant spoilage bacteria, was shown to be highly sensitive to honey in both the overlay and well diffusion assays; other sensitive bacteria included A. faecalis and L. acidophilus. Non-peroxide antibacterial activity was observed in both assays; the highest instance was observed in the specific activity assay against B. stearothermophilus. Further research could indicate whether honey has potential as a preservative in minimally processed foods.
TI  - A practical synthesis of gramicidin s and sugar amino Acid containing analogues.
AB  - A practical gram-scale and high-yielding synthesis of the antimicrobial peptide gramicidin S is presented. An Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis protocol is employed for the generation of the linear decapeptide precursor, which is cyclized in solution to afford the target compound. The versatility of our method is demonstrated by the construction of eight gramicidin S analogues (15a-h) having nonproteinogenic sugar amino acid residues (4-7) incorporated in the turn regions.
TI  - Phenolic compounds from Baseonema acuminatum leaves: isolation and antimicrobial  activity.
AB  - Three new phenolic compounds, 1-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-beta-D-galactopyranoside (1), 2-methoxy-5-(1 '2 3'-trihydroxypropyl)-phenyl- 1-0-(6"-galloyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2),and 2-methoxy-5-hydroxymethyl-phenyl-1-O-(6"-galloyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3), together with the known compounds benzyl 6'-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4), 1,6-di-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranose (5), myrciaphenone B (6), kaempferol 3-0-(6"-galloyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (7), quercetin 3-0-(6"-galloyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (8), vomifoliol 9-O-beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-2-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-3-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosylox ymethyl-7-methoxy-5-propanol, and benzyl-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->6)-Beta-D-glucopyranoside were isolated from the leaves of Baseonema acuminatum P. Choux (Asclepiadaceae). Their structures were determined by 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy and by ESI-MS analysis. The antimicrobial activity of all compounds was evaluated in vitro against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus two strains, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella thyphimurium) and three strains of Candida albicans. The new compounds 2 and 3, together with the known compound 4, showed antifungal activity against two clinically isolated Candida albicans strains and against C. albicans ATCC 2091; MIC values were in the range of 25-100 microg/mL. Compound 5 was active against the two clinically isolated strains of C. albicans with MICs of 12.5 microg/mL and 25 microg/mL. Compounds 1, 6, 7, and 8 inhibited only one strain of C albicans at the maximum concentration used. None of the phenolic compounds tested was active against the bacteria studied.
TI  - Screening of antimicrobial activity of diarylamines in the 2,3,5-trimethylbenzo[b]thiophene series: a structure-activity evaluation study.
AB  - Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis), Gram negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) bacteria, and Candida albicans as a representative of fungi were used for screening the in vitro antimicrobial activity of diarylamines in the 2,3,5-trimethylbenzo[b]thiophene series bearing different substituents, synthesized by us using the palladium-catalyzed C-N coupling methodology. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and structure-activity relationships (SARs) were evaluated.
TI  - A rapid bioassay for single bacterial cell quantitation using bioconjugated nanoparticles.
AB  - The rapid and sensitive determination of pathogenic bacteria is extremely important in biotechnology, medical diagnosis, and the current fight against bioterrorism. Current methods either lack ultrasensitivity or take a long time for analysis. Here, we report a bioconjugated nanoparticle-based bioassay for in situ pathogen quantification down to single bacterium within 20 min. The bioconjugated nanoparticle provides an extremely high fluorescent signal for bioanalysis and can be easily incorporated with biorecognition molecules, such as antibody. The antibody-conjugated nanoparticles can readily and specifically identify a variety of bacterium, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, through antibody-antigen interaction and recognition. The single-bacterium-detection capability within 20 min has been confirmed by the plate-counting method and realized by using two independent optical techniques. The two detection methods correlated extremely well. Furthermore, we were able to detect multiple bacterial samples with high throughput by using a 384-well microplate format. To show the usefulness of this assay, we have accurately detected 1-400 E. coli O157 bacterial cells in spiked ground beef samples. Our results demonstrate the potential for a broad application of bioconjugated nanoparticles in practical biotechnological and medical applications in various biodetection systems. The ultimate power of integrating bionanotechnology into complex biological systems will emerge as a revolutionary tool for ultrasensitive detection of disease markers and infectious agents.
TI  - Characterization and virulence of hemolysin III from Vibrio vulnificus.
AB  - Vibrio vulnificus, a highly virulent marine bacterium, is the causative agent of  both serious wound infections and fatal septicemia in many areas of the word. A gene (hlyIII) encoding a hemolysin was cloned and sequenced from V. vulnificus. Nucleotide sequence analysis predicted an open reading frame of 642 bp encoding a 214 amino acid polypeptide that showed 48% sequence identity to the hemolysin III of Bacillus cereus. When HlyIII of V. vulnificus was expressed in Escherichia coli, crude extracts exhibited hemolytic activity similar to that of hemolysin III from Bacillus cereus. A hlyIII isogenic mutant was constructed via insertional inactivation and showed an attenuated virulence compared with the wild-type strain when this mutant was administered intraperitoneally in mice.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Glycopeptide derived from hen egg ovomucin has the ability to bind enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Ovomucin glycopeptide (OGP) was prepared by size exclusion chromatography after Pronase digestion of hen egg ovomucin, and the binding of OGP to foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus,Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) was investigaed. Binding assays with biotinylated bacteria as probes in microtiter plates showed that OGP bound to only E. coli O157:H7 among these foodborne pathogens. Periodate treatment markedly reduced the binding ability, indicating that E. coli O157:H7 bound to carbohydrate moieties of OGP. Lectin blot analysis with Maackia amurensis (MAA) and Sambucus nigra (SNA), which are specific for oligosaccharides containing sialic acid, revealed their binding sites in OGP were similar to the E. coli O157:H7 binding sites that were probed with biotinylated E. coli O157:H7 after Western blotting of OGP. Sialydase treatment of OGP abolished its ability to bind E. coli O157:H7, demonstrating that sialic acid played an important role in the binding. These results suggest that OGP has E. coli O157:H7-specific binding sites that consist of sialic acid. On the basis of these properties, OGP has the potential to be an ingredient with a protective effect against E. coli O157:H7 infection and to be a novel probe for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 in the food hygiene field.
TI  - Anaerobic growth of Bacillus mojavensis and Bacillus subtilis requires deoxyribonucleosides or DNA.
AB  - Bacillus mojavensis strains JF-2 (ATCC 39307), ROB2, and ABO21191(T) and Bacillus subtilis strains 168 (ATCC 23857) and ATCC 12332 required four deoxyribonucleosides or DNA for growth under strict anaerobic conditions. Bacillus licheniformis strains L89-11 and L87-11, Bacillus sonorensis strain TG8-8, and Bacillus cereus (ATCC 14579) did not require DNA for anaerobic growth. The requirement for the deoxyribonucleosides or DNA did not occur under aerobic growth conditions. The addition of a mixture of five nucleic acid bases, four ribonucleotides, or four ribonucleosides to the basal medium did not replace the requirement of B. mojavensis JF-2 for the four deoxyribonucleosides. However, the addition of salmon sperm DNA, herring sperm DNA, Escherichia coli DNA, or synthetic DNA (single or double stranded) to the basal medium supported anaerobic growth. The addition of four deoxyribonucleosides to the basal medium allowed aerobic growth of B. mojavensis JF-2 in the presence of hydroxyurea. B. mojavensis did not grow in DNA-supplemented basal medium that lacked sucrose as the energy source. These data provide strong evidence that externally supplied deoxyribonucleosides can be used to maintain a balanced deoxyribonucleotide pool for DNA synthesis and suggest that ribonucleotide reductases may not be essential to the bacterial cell cycle nor are they necessarily part of a minimal bacterial genome.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of naturally occurring compounds against antibiotic-resistant Bacillus cereus vegetative cells and spores, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - After demonstrating the lack of effectiveness of standard antibiotics against the acquired antibiotic resistance of Bacillus cereus (NCTC 10989), Escherichia coli (NCTC 1186), and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 12715), we showed that the following natural substances were antibacterial against these resistant pathogens: cinnamon oil, oregano oil, thyme oil, carvacrol, (S)-perillaldehyde, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (beta-resorcylic acid), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine (dopamine). Exposure of the three pathogens to a dilution series of the test compounds showed that oregano oil was the most active substance. The oils and pure compounds exhibited exceptional activity against B. cereus vegetative cells, with oregano oil being active at nanogram per milliliter levels. In contrast, activities against B. cereus spores were very low. Activities of the test compounds were in the following approximate order: oregano oil > thyme oil approximately carvacrol > cinnamon oil > perillaldehyde > dopamine > beta-resorcylic acid. The order of susceptibilities of the pathogens to inactivation was as follows: B. cereus (vegetative) >> S. aureus approximately E. coli >> B. cereus (spores). Some of the test substances may be effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria in foods and feeds.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial properties of some medicinal plants used in Iran.
AB  - Forty-five species of 29 plant families used in the traditional medicine by Iranian people, showed antibacterial activities against one or more of the bacterial species: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. No plant showed activity against Serratia marcescens; Bordetella bronchiseptica being the most susceptible species. All extracts showed the same activity 18 months later.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of the essential oil of Curcuma zedoaria.
AB  - The chemical compositions of the essential oil of Curcuma zedoaria (Berg.) Rosc.  were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and showed a high content of epicurzerenone and curdione representing 46.6% and 13.7% of the total oil, respectively. The essential oil was evaluated for potential antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonasa aeruginosa, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus cereus. V. parahaemolyticus was sensitive to the presence of the essential oil, while the most resistant strain appeared to be E. coli. Based on 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction and cell morphology, the essential oil of C. zedoaria could inhibit the proliferation of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. These results suggest that the essential oil has the antimicrobial activity against some of Gram- positive and negative pathogenic microorganisms and the components of the extract lead to the apoptosis of human cancer cell line.
TI  - Use of a fluorescent viability stain to assess lethal and sublethal injury in food-borne bacteria exposed to high-intensity pulsed electric fields.
AB  - AIMS: To apply scanning electron microscopy, image analysis and a fluorescent viability stain to assess lethal and sublethal in food-borne bacteria exposed to high-intensity pulsed electric fields (PEF). METHODS AND RESULTS: A rapid cellular staining method using the fluorescent redox probes 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phylindole was used for enumerating actively respiring cells of Listeria mononcytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. This respiratory staining (RS) approach provided good agreement with the conventional plate count agar method for enumerating untreated and high-intensity PEF-treated bacteria suspended in 0.1% (w/v) peptone water. However, test organisms subjected to similar levels of lethality by heating at 56 degrees C resulted in ca 3-log-unit difference in surviving cell numbers ml(-1) when enumerated by these different viability indicators. PEF-treated bacteria were markedly altered at the cellular level when examined by scanning electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: While PEF-treatment did not produce sublethally injured cells (P < 0.05), substantial subpopulations of test bacteria rendered incapable of forming colonies by heating may remain metabolically active. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The fluorescent staining method offers interesting perspectives on assessing established and novel microbial inactivation methods. Use of this approach may also provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in microbial inactivation induced by PEF.
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - Validation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial detection of platelet (PLT)-rich-plasma (PRP)-derived PLTs  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. This study validated the BacT/ALERT for use in testing pooled PRP-derived PLTs with nine contaminating organisms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two PRP-derived PLT pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 CFUs/mL). Four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 mL was plated onto blood agar. RESULTS: All organisms (excluding P. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respective). P. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively). With E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. This was most notable with S. viridans where the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for the detection of bacteria in PRP-derived PLTs in a pooled format. Overall, the use of the BacT/ALERT system allowed the detection of pooled PRP-derived PLTs inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 CFUs per mL in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding P. acnes).
TI  - Essential oils: their antibacterial properties and potential applications in foods--a review.
AB  - In vitro studies have demonstrated antibacterial activity of essential oils (EOs) against Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella dysenteria, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus at levels between 0.2 and 10 microl ml(-1). Gram-negative organisms are slightly less susceptible than gram-positive bacteria. A number of EO components has been identified as effective antibacterials, e.g. carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, perillaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid, having minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.05-5 microl ml(-1) in vitro. A higher concentration is needed to achieve the same effect in foods. Studies with fresh meat, meat products, fish, milk, dairy products, vegetables, fruit and cooked rice have shown that the concentration needed to achieve a significant antibacterial effect is around 0.5-20 microl g(-1) in foods and about 0.1-10 microl ml(-1) in solutions for washing fruit and vegetables. EOs comprise a large number of components and it is likely that their mode of action involves several targets in the bacterial cell. The hydrophobicity of EOs enables them to partition in the lipids of the cell membrane and mitochondria, rendering them permeable and leading to leakage of cell contents. Physical conditions that improve the action of EOs are low pH, low temperature and low oxygen levels. Synergism has been observed between carvacrol and its precursor p-cymene and between cinnamaldehyde and eugenol. Synergy between EO components and mild preservation methods has also been observed. Some EO components are legally registered flavourings in the EU and the USA. Undesirable organoleptic effects can be limited by careful selection of EOs according to the type of food.
TI  - Validation of a microbiological method: the STAR protocol, a five-plate test, for the screening of antibiotic residues in milk.
AB  - The results of an in-house laboratory validation of a microbiological method for  the screening of antibiotic residues in milk are presented. The sensitivity of this five-plate test, called Screening Test for Antibiotic Residues (STAR), was established by the analysis of milk samples spiked with 66 antibiotics at eight different concentrations. Ten different groups of antibiotics were studied: macrolides, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, penicillins, quinolones, tetracyclines, sulphonamides, lincosamides, phenicolated and miscellaneous drugs. It was shown that 21 antibiotics were detected by the STAR protocol at or below the maximum residue limit (MRL), and that a further 27 drugs could be detected at levels from the MRL up to four times the MRL. The sensitivity of the STAR protocol was at or below the MRL for three macrolides, one tetracycline, two aminoglycosides, some sulphonamides, half of the beta-lactams, quinolones, lincosamides, trimethoprim and baquiloprim. Moreover, the STAR protocol was at least twice as sensitive as conventional methods for macrolides, quinolones and tetracyclines. The other antibiotics had limits of detection between four and 150 times the MRL. Each plate was preferentially sensitive for one or two families of antibacterials: the plate Bacillus cereus for tetracyclines, the plate Escherichia coli for quinolones, the plate Basillus subtilis for aminoglycosides, the plate Kocuria varians for macrolides, and the plate Bacillus stearothermophilus for sulphonamides and beta-lactams. This method has been used routinely on a day-to-day basis to direct the physicochemical confirmation towards one or two families of antibiotics. Considering the high cost of liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry detection analyses, the reduction of the range of antibiotics to test for confirmation is a significant gain in time and money.
TI  - Influence of the cell wall on ciprofloxacin susceptibility in selected wild-type  Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The susceptibility of several wild-type bacteria to ciprofloxacin and accumulation of the drug in these bacteria were evaluated. Species studied included Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus. Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was measured for each strain using two different methods: the minimal inhibitory concentration and the bactericidal index. Significant differences were observed between the results derived from these two methods. Whereas the minimal inhibitory concentration was low in all strains tested, ciprofloxacin's bactericidal activity, as indicated by the bactericidal index, varied with the species studied. To determine whether this finding was due to variations in cell envelope permeability to ciprofloxacin (i.e. to combined cell uptake and efflux), we studied ciprofloxacin accumulation using spectrofluorometry. In Gram-negative bacteria, differences in permeability can lead to altered susceptibility to antibiotics. In fact, the combination of slow uptake and efficient efflux seems to be crucial to the characteristic poor susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin. However, the low level of activity of ciprofloxacin against S. aureus and two Bacillus species may have resulted from the drug's interaction with its target enzymes (i.e. topoisomerase IV in S. aureus and DNA gyrase in Bacillus spp.) rather than diminished permeability.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts and flavonoids from Eucalyptus maculata.
AB  - AIMS: We investigated the antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts to find effective antibacterial agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antimicrobial activities of leaf extracts from 26 species of eucalyptus were measured. Extracts of Eucalyptus globulus, E. maculata and E. viminalis significantly inhibited the growth of six Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Propionibacterium acnes), and of a fungus (Trichophyton mentagrophytes), but they did not show strong antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida). 2',6'-dihydroxy-3'-methyl-4'-methoxy-dihydrochalcone, eucalyptin and 8-desmethyl-eucalyptin, isolated from E. maculata extracts, exhibited potent antimicrobial activities against seven micro-organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.0 to 31 mg l(-1). CONCLUSIONS: The eucalyptus extracts and three compounds from E. maculata were found to be effective against micro-organisms that cause food poisoning, acne and athlete's foot. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows potential uses of extracts from E. globulus, E. maculata and E. viminalis, and antimicrobial compounds isolated from E. maculata.
TI  - Insulator-based dielectrophoresis for the selective concentration and separation  of live bacteria in water.
AB  - Insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP) was utilized to separate and concentrate selectively mixtures of two species of live bacteria simultaneously. Four species of bacteria were studied: the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, and B. megaterium. Under an applied direct current (DC) electric field all the bacterial species exhibited negative dielectrophoretic behavior. The dielectrophoretic separations were carried out in a glass microchannel containing an array of insulating posts. The insulating posts in the microchannel produced nonuniformities in the electric field applied along the channel. Mixtures of two species of bacteria were introduced into the microchannel and the electric field was applied. The bacterial species exhibited different dielectrophoretic mobilities under the influence of the nonuniform field. From these experiments a trapping order was established with E. coli trapping at the weakest applied electric field, while the Bacillus species were trapped at different characteristic threshold fields. At stronger applied electric fields, the two different species of bacteria in the microchannel were dielectrophoretically trapped into two spatially distinct bands. The results showed that iDEP has the potential to selectively concentrate and separate different species of bacteria.
TI  - Cytoplasmic membrane polarization in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria grown in the absence and presence of tetracycline.
AB  - The ability of numerous diverse compounds and ions to cross the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane by diffusion and active transport is highly dependent on cytoplasmic membrane fluidity, which can be measured using fluorescent probes to estimate membrane polarization values. However, membrane polarization data are lacking for most bacterial species. The cytoplasmic membrane polarization values for Arthrobacter sp. ATCC 21908, Bacillus cereus NRC 3045, Pseudomonas fluorescens R2F, Pseudomonas putida NRC 2986 and Escherichia coli C600 bacterial cells were spectrofluorometrically measured over a temperature range from 10 to 50 degrees C, and in the absence and presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline, using the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) to obtain new information on their membrane fluidity. At an assay temperature of 10 degrees C, E. coli cells grown in the absence of tetracycline exhibited the highest cytoplasmic membrane polarization value (least fluid membrane) of 0.446, followed by values of 0.392, 0.371, 0.344 and 0.293, respectively, for B. cereus, Arthrobacter sp., P. fluorescens and P. putida. At an assay temperature of 30 degrees C, the polarization values ranged from 0.357 to 0.288 for cells grown in the absence of tetracycline, regardless of the species. B. cereus grown in the presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline had lower polarization values than when grown in the absence of this antibiotic at all assay temperatures. Regardless of the absence or presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline in the growth medium, all bacterial species generally exhibited a more fluid membrane as the assay temperature increased from 10 to 50 degrees C. To our knowledge, these are some of the first cytoplasmic membrane polarization values reported for these Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria over a broad temperature range and also for cells grown in the presence of tetracycline.
TI  - Investigation of the effectiveness of Ascopyrone P as a food preservative.
AB  - Ascopyrone P (APP), a novel antibacterial from fungi, was evaluated as a food preservative. Efficacy was generally assessed by comparing the time taken for test strains to grow to 10(6) CFU/g in food +/- APP. In chilled chicken soup, 2000 mg kg-1 APP prevented Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Salmonella and Escherichia coli reaching this threshold for >60 days. Good activity was also observed at 500-1000 mg kg-1 but not against L. monocytogenes. No activity was observed against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Activity was reduced at 20 degrees C, although 2000 mg kg-1 was still effective against B. cereus and P. fluorescens. APP was less effective in chilled cooked meat systems and ineffective in raw meat. In a cooked meat system at 8 degrees C, bacteriostatic effect was generally observed at 2000 mg kg-1 against Salmonella typhimurium, E. coli and P. fluorescens but not against L. monocytogenes or Lactobacillus sake. Activity against Gram-negative enteric bacteria was enhanced by low temperature. In milk, 2000 mg l-1 was effective against P. fluorescens at chilled but not ambient temperature. APP was ineffective against yeasts and the mould Byssochlamys in apple juice. A minimum of 2000 mg kg-1 APP would appear to be necessary for antibacterial efficacy in food, although low-temperature storage may help. Observed variations in sensitivity may be related to APP stability, which decreases >pH 5.5. Toxicology testing is needed before consideration of APP for food use.
TI  - Inactivation of pathogenic bacteria by cucumber volatiles (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal and (E)-2-nonenal.
AB  - The effects of (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal (NDE) and (E)-2-nonenal (NE) on Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella Typhimurium were investigated. A suspension of each organism of 6 to 9 log CFU/ml was incubated for 1 h at 37 degrees C in brain heart infusion solution that contained 0 to 500 or 1,000 ppm of NDE or NE. Depending on concentration, exposure to either NDE or NE caused a reduction in CFU of each organism. Treatment with 250 and 500 ppm NDE completely eliminated viable B. cereus and Salmonella Typhimurium cells, respectively. L. monocytogenes was the most resistant to NDE, showing only about a 2-log reduction from exposure to 500 ppm for 1 h. Conversely, this concentration of NDE caused a 5.8-log reduction in E. coli O157:H7 cells. NE was also effective in inactivating organisms listed above. A higher concentration of NE, 1,000 ppm, was required to kill E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes, or Salmonella Typhimurium compared with NDE. In conclusion, both NDE and NE demonstrated an apparent bactericidal activity against these pathogens.
TI  - Sensitization of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to jenseniin G by sublethal injury.
AB  - Jenseniin G, a bacteriocin produced by Propionibacterium thoenii P126, is active  against related propionibacteria and some lactic acid bacteria and is sporostatic to botulinal spores. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sublethal stress on jenseniin G activity. Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia enterocolitica were subjected to temperature, acid, and osmotic stresses in the presence of jenseniin G. The bacteriocin reduced the viability of sublethally injured cultures, although the extent of reduction varied with strain and treatment. E. faecalis was the most sensitive to temperature stress; no reduction of viable counts occurred in the absence of jenseniin G, and a 1.5-log reduction occurred in the presence of jenseniin G. B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus were more sensitive to jenseniin G when exposed to heat stress than when exposed to cold stress, whereas E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and S. flexneri were more sensitive to jenseniin G when exposed to cold stress than when exposed to heat stress. When comparing an acid stress test alone to a combination of acid stress and jenseniin G, E. faecalis and L. monocytogenes showed the greatest sensitivities with 4.87- and 2.82-log reductions, respectively, after 7 days. All cultures except for S. aureus were adversely affected by the combination of salt stress and jenseniin G. Salmonella Typhimurium showed the greatest sensitivity to salt stress with jenseniin G (a 1.54-log reduction at day 7) when compared to salt stress alone (a 0.55-log reduction at day 7). Jenseniin G, like bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive species, has broader activity against stressed organisms.
TI  - Attenuation regulation of amino acid biosynthetic operons in proteobacteria: comparative genomics analysis.
AB  - Candidate attenuators were identified that regulate operons responsible for biosynthesis of branched amino acids, histidine, threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine in gamma- and alpha-proteobacteria, and in some cases in low-GC Gram-positive bacteria, Thermotogales and Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi. This allowed us not only to describe the evolutionary dynamics of regulation by attenuation of transcription, but also to annotate a number of hypothetical genes. In particular, orthologs of ygeA of Escherichia coli were assigned the branched chain amino acid racemase function. Three new families of histidine transporters were predicted, orthologs of yuiF and yvsH of Bacillus subtilis, and lysQ of Lactococcus lactis. In Pasteurellales, the single bifunctional aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase gene thrA was predicted to be regulated not only by threonine and isoleucine, as in E. coli, but also by methionine. In alpha-proteobacteria, the single acetolactate synthase operon ilvIH was predicted to be regulated by branched amino acids-dependent attenuators. Histidine biosynthetic operons his were predicted to be regulated by histidine-dependent attenuators in Bacillus cereus and Clostridium difficile, and by histidine T-boxes in L. lactis and Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of oxindoles and benzimidazolinones derivatives.
AB  - The synthesis of new oxindoles and benzimidazolinones derivatives bearing a sugar residue on the aromatic nitrogen is described. The presence of the glycoside moiety should enhance the solubility of these heterocyclic compounds and/or improve the interaction with the active site of the biological targets. The inhibitory activities of these new compounds toward five kinases were examined: KDR (VEGFR-2), FGFR-1, PDGFR-beta, EGFR and Tie 2. Furthermore, the antibacterial activities of the prepared compounds were tested against two Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis, a Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and a yeast Candida albicans.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a putative transferrin cDNA of the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana.
AB  - A spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) transferrin cDNA (CfTf) was isolated  and cloned from a cDNA library that was constructed using mRNA from fifth to sixth instar larvae. CfTf cDNA encoded a predicted protein of 681 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 76 kDa. CfTf shared 72% and 74% identities at the amino acid level with transferrins of Manduca sexta and Bombyx mori, respectively. Like other transferrins, CfTf retains most of the N-terminal, iron-binding amino acid residues. Northern blot analyses indicated that CfTf mRNA was present at high levels after ecdysis, but that the expression level was low prior to ecdysis at the fourth-sixth instar stages. The highest level of CfTf expression was detected in the fat body. Relatively low levels of expression were detected in the epidermis and no expression was found in the midgut. Expression of CfTf mRNA could be induced by bacteria but not fungi. Expression of CfTf mRNA was suppressed by iron load.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Composition and bioactivity of the leaf essential oil of Heteropyxis dehniae from Zimbabwe.
AB  - The leaf oil of Heteropyxis dehniae Suess. (Heteropyxidaceae) was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC/MS. The most abundant essential oil components are linalool (58.3%), 4-terpineol (9.8%), alpha-terpineol (3.6%), and caryophyllene oxide (3.1%). The antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger, and the in vitro cytotoxicity of the oil on PC-3, MDA-MB-231, Hs 578T, MCF7, SK-MEL-28, and 5637 human tumor cells were also examined. Caryophyllene oxide shows notable cytotoxic activity with LC50 values of 147-351 microM.
TI  - Isolation of a minireplicon of the virulence plasmid pXO2 of Bacillus anthracis and characterization of the plasmid-encoded RepS replication protein.
AB  - A minireplicon of plasmid pXO2 of Bacillus anthracis was isolated by molecular cloning in Escherichia coli and shown to replicate in B. anthracis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus subtilis. The pXO2 replicon included (i) an open reading frame encoding the putative RepS replication initiation protein and (ii) the putative origin of replication. The RepS protein was expressed as a fusion with the maltose binding protein (MBP) at its amino-terminal end and purified by affinity chromatography. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the purified MBP-RepS protein bound specifically to a 60-bp region corresponding to the putative origin of replication of pXO2 located immediately downstream of the RepS open reading frame. Competition DNA binding experiments showed that the 5' and central regions of the putative origin were important for RepS binding. MBP-RepS also bound nonspecifically to single-stranded DNA with a lower affinity.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of Carica papaya fruit on common wound organisms.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate antibacterial activity of ripe and unripe Carica papaya on selected micro-organisms. Cultures of micro-organisms were routinely maintained in nutrient agar slants at 4 degrees C. Extracts of immature, mature and ripe Carica papaya fruit were obtained by separately grinding factions of the epicarp, endocarp and seeds and filtering them through gauze. Sensitivity tests were conducted by adding 0.06 ml of extract to agar wells (6 mm diameter) prepared from 20 ml agar seeded with 10(6) cells/ml suspension of one of the eight organisms per plate. The inoculated plates were allowed to equilibrate at 4 degrees C for 1 hour, incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, and zones of inhibition measured in millimetres. Anti-bacterial activity was expressed in terms of the radius of zone of inhibition. Seed extracts from the fruit showed inhibition in the following order: B cereus > E coli > S faecalis > S aureus > P vulgaris > S flexneri. No significant difference was found in bacterial sensitivity between immature, mature and ripe fruits. No inhibition zone was produced by epicarp and endocarp extracts. Carica papaya seeds contain anti-bacterial activity that inhibits growth of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Observed activity was independent of stage of fruit maturity. Carica papaya has antibacterial effects that could be useful in treating chronic skin ulcers to promote healing.
TI  - Antibacterial screening of plants used in Iranian folkloric medicine.
AB  - Fifty methanolic plant extracts belonging to 44 plant species of 33 families finding use in Iranian folkloric medicine were screened for antibacterial activity. Thirty samples, including 28 species in 20 families, had antibacterial activity against at least on one of the bacteria. Among the active plants, 32.6% were active against G(-), 62% against G(+), and 47.3% against both G(-) and G(+) bacteria. Dianthus coryophyllus was active against all tested G(-) and G(+) bacteria except Micrococcus luteus. Most susceptible G(-) bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bordetella bronchiseptica and least susceptible G(-) bacterium was Escherichia coli. In G(+) bacteria, most and least susceptible were Staphylococcus aureus and M. luteus, respectively. The least MIC, as 0.62 mg/ml, belonged to Myrtus communis seeds against S. aureus, Bacillus cereus and B. bronchiseptica, and to Terminalia chebula ripe seeds against S. aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Artemisia douglasiana leaf essential oil.
AB  - Artemisia douglasiana leaf has been shown to be efficacious complementary herbal  treatment for chronic bladder infection in a paraplegic youth. The leaf oil has been analyzed by GC-MS and the major components found to be camphor (29%), artemisia ketone (26%), artemisia alcohol (13%), alpha-thujone (10%), 1,8-cineole (8%), and hexanal (5%). The leaf oil and the major components have been tested for antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. The essential oil shows limited antimicrobial activity in vitro, so it is unclear if the oil exerts a direct antimicrobial effect in vivo, or plays some role in stimulation of host defenses.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in PLT components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A microbial detection system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux [formerly Organon Teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in PLTs. The recovery of nine organisms seeded into PLTs with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. The use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into Day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis PLT units to 10 and 100 CFUs per mL. Replicate samples (4 mL) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. RESULTS: All organisms (with the exception of P. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 CFUs/mL). In aggregate (with the exception of P. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). In all cases, the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. P. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 CFUs/mL), respectively. The narrower bottle neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.
TI  - Bacterial populations associated with meat from the deboning room of a high throughput red meat abattoir.
AB  - Developing countries are faced with high incidences of food poisoning outbreaks,  with obvious economic consequences. In highly perishable foodstuffs such as fresh red meat the threat of food poisoning is particularly intense. In this study, red meat samples were collected from a deboning room of a high throughput abattoir. The samples were analysed for the presence of Bacillus cereus., Staphylococcus aureus., Pseudomonas spp., Listeria monocytogenes., Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. The aerobic plate counts as well as Enterobacteriaceae were also enumerated. Almost without exception the counts exceeded the microbiological guidelines for raw meat as proposed by the South African Department of Health. The average B. cereus count over the sampling period was 8.32 x 10(3) cfu, g (-1), for S. aureus and Pseudomonas spp. 1.72 x 10(5) and 1.7 x 10(5) cfu g(-1) respectively and for E. coli 3.4 x 10(5) cfu g(-1). Sixty percent of the samples were positive for presumptive Salmonella spp. while 52% of the samples tested positive for the presence of L. monocytogenes. The aerobic plate and Enterobacteriaceae counts were 1.7 x 10(7) and 4.6 x 10(6) cfu g(-1), respectively. The data highlighted the need for a more systematic approach to ensuring safe food through implementing quality control methods to prevent the entry and proliferation of pathogens in meat and meat products, especially during processes with a high degree of handling, such as deboning.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a low-molecular-weight chitosan obtained from cellulase digestion of chitosan.
AB  - A water-soluble chitosan hydrolysate with high activity against Escherichia coli  was obtained during cellulase digestion of chitosan for 18 h. This 18-h hydrolysate is composed of low-molecular-weight chitosan (LMWC), with a molecular weight of 12.0 kDa, and chitooligosaccharides, which are composed of sugars with a degree of polymerization of 1 to 8. LMWC has a strong activity at 100 ppm against many pathogens and yeast species, including Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, while the chitooligosaccharides have much weaker antimicrobial activity than does LMWC. Accordingly, the antimicrobial activity against E. coli in the 18-h hydrolysate proved to come mainly from the presence of LMWC.
TI  - Development and validation of experimental protocols for use of cardinal models for prediction of microorganism growth in food products.
AB  - An experimental protocol to validate secondary-model application to foods was suggested. Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella were observed in various food categories, such as meat, dairy, egg, or seafood products. The secondary model validated in this study was based on the gamma concept, in which the environmental factors temperature, pH, and water activity (aw) were introduced as individual terms with microbe-dependent parameters, and the effect of foodstuffs on the growth rates of these species was described with a food- and microbe-dependent parameter. This food-oriented approach was carried out by challenge testing, generally at 15 and 10 degrees C for L. monocytogenes, E. coli, B. cereus, and Salmonella and at 25 and 20 degrees C for C. perfringens. About 222 kinetics in foods were generated. The results were compared to simulations generated by existing software, such as PMP. The bias factor was also calculated. The methodology to obtain a food-dependent parameter (fitting step) and therefore to compare results given by models with new independent data (validation step) is discussed in regard to its food safety application. The proposed methods were used within the French national program of predictive microbiology, Sym'Previus, to include challenge test results in the database and to obtain predictive models designed for microbial growth in food products.
TI  - The role of bacterial and non-bacterial toxins in the induction of changes in membrane transport: implications for diarrhea.
AB  - Bacterial toxins induce changes in membrane transport which underlie the loss of  electrolyte homeostasis associated with diarrhea. Bacterial- and their secreted toxin-types which have been linked with diarrhea include: (a) Vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin, E1 Tor hemolysin and accessory cholera enterotoxin); (b) Escherichia coli (heat stable enterotoxin, heat-labile enterotoxin and colicins); (c) Shigella dysenteriae (shiga-toxin); (d) Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens enterotoxin, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin and theta-toxin); (e) Clostridium difficile (toxins A and B); (f) Staphylococcus aureus (alpha-haemolysin); (g) Bacillus cereus (cytotoxin K and haemolysin BL); and (h) Aeromonas hydrophila (aerolysin, heat labile cytotoxins and heat stable cytotoxins). The mechanisms of toxin-induced diarrhea include: (a) direct effects on ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells, i.e. direct toxin interaction with intrinsic ion channels in the membrane and (b) indirect interaction with ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells mediated by toxin binding to a membrane receptor. These effects consequently cause the release of second messengers, e.g. the release of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate/guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, IP(3), Ca2+ and/or changes in second messengers that are the result of toxin-formed Ca2+ and K+ permeable channels, which increase Ca2+ flux and augment changes in Ca2+ homeostasis and cause depolarisation of the membrane potential. Consequently, many voltage-dependent ion transport systems, e.g. voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx, are affected. The toxin-formed ion channels may act as a pathway for loss of fluid and electrolytes. Although most of the diarrhea-causing toxins have been reported to act via cation and anion channel formation, the properties of these channels have not been well studied, and the available biophysical properties that are needed for the characterization of these channels are inadequate.
TI  - Low molecular weight chitosans: preparation with the aid of papain and characterization.
AB  - Low molecular weight chitosans (LMWC) of different molecular weight (4.1-5.6 kDa) were obtained by the depolymerization of chitosan using papain (from Carica papaya latex, EC. 3.4.22.2) at optimum conditions of pH 3.5 and 37 degrees C for 1-5 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed approximately 15-fold decrease in the particle size after depolymerization. Decrease in the molecular weight was associated with decrease in the degree of acetylation (DA) as evidenced by circular dichroism (CD), FT-IR and solid-state CP-MAS 13C-NMR data. X-ray diffraction pattern revealed slight decrease in the crystallinity index (CrI) whereas the 13C-NMR data showed molecular inhomogeneity. LMWC showed lytic effect towards Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli more efficiently than native chitosan. The growth inhibitory effect was maximal towards B. cereus, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.01% (w/v).
TI  - Phytoestrogen genistein as an anti-staphylococcal agent.
AB  - The soybean-derived isoflavone genistein has been shown to exert beneficial effects on many disorders, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The effects of genistein on mammalian cells are mediated by its abilities to inhibit topoisomerase II and protein tyrosine kinase. In order to examine the potential antibacterial activities of genistein, we incubated the bacteria with various concentrations of this compound for different periods of time and assessed the viable counts. Exposure to genistein exhibited an inhibitory effect on all staphylococcal strains tested, including methicillin-resistant strains. Furthermore, the growth of Streptococcus pasteurianus, Bacillus cereus, and Helicobacter pylori was clearly inhibited by genistein, whereas Escherichia coli growth was not suppressed. Daidzein, which is structurally similar to genistein, but deficient in topoisomerase II inhibitory activity, also inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, albeit with lower potency than genistein. Our results indicate that genistein exerts potent antibacterial properties in vitro, which are possibly mediated by the stabilization of the covalent topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex.
TI  - Purification and functional characterization of insecticidal sphingomyelinase C produced by Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Bacillus cereus isolated from the larvae of Myrmeleon bore was found to secrete proteins that paralyze and kill German cockroaches, Blattela germanica, when injected. One of these active proteins was purified from the culture broth of B. cereus using anion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. The purified toxin, with a molecular mass of 34 kDa, was identified as sphingomyelinase C (EC 3.1.4.12) on the basis of its N-terminal and internal amino-acid sequences. A recombinant sphingomyelinase C expressed in Escherichia coli was as potent as the native protein in killing the cockroaches. Site-directed mutagenesis (His151Ala) that inactivated the sphingomyelinase activity also abolished the insecticidal activity, suggesting that the rapid insect toxicity of sphingomyelinase C results from its phospholipid-degrading activity.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of extracts of the lichen Cetraria aculeata and its protolichesterinic acid constituent.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activity of the acetone, diethyl ether and ethanol extracts of the lichen Cetraria aculeata has been investigated. The extracts were tested against twelve bacteria and eight fungi and found active against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes. No antimicrobial activity against the fungi was detected. It was determined that only one substance in the extracts has antimicrobial activity and it was characterized as protolichesterinic acid. The MICs of the extracts and protolichesterinic acid were also determined.
TI  - [Conjugation in bacilli].
AB  - The review considers experimental data on the conjugal transfer of plasmids in the Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis groups (the transfer of large self-transmissible plasmids and the mobilization of small plasmids). Conjugation in bacilli is compared with conjugation in E. coli dependent on the F factor. Conjugation of bacilli in their natural habitats is also discussed.
TI  - X-ray crystallographic and site-directed mutagenesis analysis of the mechanism of Schiff-base formation in phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase catalysis.
AB  - Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phosphonatase) catalyzes the hydrolytic P-C bond cleavage of phosphonoacetaldehyde (Pald) to form orthophosphate and acetaldehyde. The reaction proceeds via a Schiff-base intermediate formed between Lys-53 and the Pald carbonyl. The x-ray crystal structures of the wild-type phosphonatase complexed with Mg(II) alone or with Mg(II) plus vinylsulfonate (a phosphonoethylenamine analog) were determined to 2.8 and 2.4 A, respectively. These structures were used to determine the identity and positions of active site residues surrounding the Lys-53 ammonium group and the Pald carbonyl. These include Cys-22, His-56, Tyr-128, and Met-49. Site-directed mutagenesis was then employed to determine whether or not these groups participate in catalysis. Based on rate contributions, Tyr-128 and Cys-22 were eliminated as potential catalytic groups. The Lys-53 epsilon-amino group, positioned for reaction with the Pald carbonyl, forms a hydrogen bond with water 120. Water 120 is also within hydrogen bond distance of an imidazole nitrogen of His-56 and the sulfur atom of Met-49. Kinetic constants for mutants indicated that His-56 (1000-fold reduction in k(cat)/K(m) upon Ala substitution) and Met-49 (17,000-fold reduction in k(cat)/K(m) upon Leu substitution) function in catalysis of Schiff-base formation. Based on these results, it is proposed that a network of hydrogen bonds among Lys-53, water 120, His-56, and Met-49 facilitate proton transfer from Lys-53 to the carbinolamine intermediate. Comparison of the vinylsulfonate complex versus unliganded structures indicated that association of the cap and core domains is essential for the positioning of the Lys-53 for attack at the Pald carbonyl and that substrate binding at the core domain stabilizes cap domain binding.
TI  - Synthesis of 6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In the present study, a series of 1-ethyl/benzyl-6-fluoro-7-(substituted piperazin-1-yl)1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H-NMR, mass spectral and elemental analysis. The in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of the compounds were evaluated by paper disc diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. The in vivo antibacterial activity of the compounds against Escherichia coli was also evaluated by mouse protection test. All the compounds exhibited significant antibacterial and weak antifungal activities. The in vivo antibacterial activity (ED50) against E. coli was 50-160 mg kg(-1) in the order of 7<9<8<10. 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-(2,5-dioxo-piperazin-1-yl)1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carbox ylic acid (7) was found to exhibit the most potent in vitro antimicrobial activity with MIC of 4.1, 3.1, 3.1, 2.4, 1, 1, 25 and >100 microg mL(-1) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger.
TI  - Effect of gamma irradiation on the survival of pathogens in kwamegi, a traditional Korean semidried seafood.
AB  - Kwamegi (semidried raw Pacific saury) is traditional seafood available in Korea.  It has water activity in the range of 0.90 to 0.95. Spoilage and the growth of most pathogenic bacteria is retarded because of low water activity, low temperature, and packaging. However, it is contaminated with bacteria of public health significance and poses a hazard to the consumer because it is consumed raw without any cooking. The effectiveness of these hurdles in preventing the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Escherichia coli and the efficacy of irradiation treatment in eliminating these bacteria from kwamegi using inoculated pack studies was examined. Radiation sensitivity of S. aureus, B. cereus, Salmonella Typhimurium, and E. coli in kwamegi was investigated. D10-values of these organisms in kwamegi were 590 +/- 13.6, 640 +/- 14.9, 560 +/- 45.4, and 550 +/- 8.6 Gy, respectively. The growth of all four test organisms inoculated into these foods during 4 weeks of storage at an ambient winter temperature (ranging from -5 degrees C to +5 degrees C) was recorded. All four pathogens (inoculated at 10(6) CFU/g) were eliminated by irradiation at 4 kGy. These studies unequivocally demonstrate that irradiation, with a combination of low water activity and low temperature, results in microbiologically safe kwamegi.
TI  - Genes for an alkaline D-stereospecific endopeptidase and its homolog are located  in tandem on Bacillus cereus genome.
AB  - Alkaline D-peptidase (Adp) from Bacillus cereus DF4-B is a D-stereospecific endopeptidase acting on oligopeptides composed of D-phenylalanine and the primary structure deduced from its gene, adp, shows a similarity with D-stereospecific hydrolases from Ochrobactrum anthropi strains. We have isolated DNA fragments covering the flanking region of adp from DF4-B genome and found an additional gene, adp2, located upstream of adp. The deduced amino acid sequence of Adp2 showed 96% and 85% identity with those of Adp from B. cereus strains AH559 and DF4-B, respectively. The recombinant Adp2 expressed in Escherichia coli was purified to homogeneity and characterized. It had hydrolyzing activity toward (D-Phe)3, (D-Phe)4, and (D-Phe)6 but did not act on (L-Phe)4, D-Phe-NH2, and L-Phe-NH2, some characteristics that are closely related to those of Adp from strain DF4-B. These results indicate that highly homologous genes encoding D-stereospecific endopeptidases are arranged in a tandem manner on the genomic DNA of B. cereus DF4-B.
TI  - Identification of foodborne bacteria by infrared spectroscopy using cellular fatty acid methyl esters.
AB  - Identification of bacterial species by profiling fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) has commonly been carried out by using a 20-min capillary gas chromatographic procedure followed by library matching of FAME profiles using commercial MIDI databases and proprietary pattern recognition software. Fast GC (5 min) FAME procedures and mass spectrometric methodologies that require no lipid separation have also been reported. In this study, bacterial identification based on the rapid (2 min) infrared measurement of FAME mixtures was demonstrated. The microorganisms investigated included Gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus anthracis, and Bacillus cereus, and Gram negative bacteria from the family Enterobacteriacae: Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella sonnei, and Escherichia coli (four strains of E. coli), and non-Enterobacteriacae: Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, and Vibrio parahemolyticus. Foodborne bacterial mixtures of FAMEs were measured by using an attenuated total reflection (ATR)-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic procedure and discriminated by multivariate analysis. Results showed that the Enterobacteriacae could be discriminated from the vibrios. The identification was at the level of species (for the Bacillus and Vibrio genera) or strains (for the E. coli species). A series of bacterial FAME test samples were prepared and analyzed for accuracy of identification, and all were correctly identified. Our results suggest that this infrared strategy could be used to identify foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Duplex real-time SYBR green PCR assays for detection of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in stools.
AB  - A duplex real-time SYBR Green LightCycler PCR (LC-PCR) assay with DNA extraction  using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini kit was evaluated with regard to detection of 8 of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in five stool specimens in 2 h or less. The protocol used the same LC-PCR with 20 pairs of specific primers. The products formed were identified based on a melting point temperature (T(m)) curve analysis. The 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens examined were enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, Aeromonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacillus cereus. No interference with the LC-PCR assay was observed when stool specimens were artificially inoculated with each bacterial species. The detection levels were approximately 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool. The protocol for processing stool specimens for less than 10(4) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool requires an overnight enrichment step to achieve adequate sensitivity. However, the rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of greater than 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g in samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food- or waterborne outbreaks.
TI  - Microbial and copper adsorption by smectitic clay--an experimental study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to quantify copper-, bacteria- and bacteriophage-binding capacities of natural clay with the aim of predicting the adsorption of heavy metals, human pathogenic bacteria and viruses by a clayey landfill liner. X-ray diffraction analysis of six natural clays showed that the dominant phase in all deposits consists of smectites together with illite, kaolin and, sometimes, palygorskite and sepiolite. The specific surface areas of different clay substrates were very high ranging from 293 to 351 m2 g(-1), and indicating a high proportion of phyllosilicates, consisting especially of smectites. The physico-chemical identification of separated smectites showed a high potential adsorbent character indicative of a large industrial use. The Kb12 smectite substrate chosen arbitrarily among six separated substrates, appeared as an excellent copper adsorbent. Copper was adsorbed to clay in a proportion ranging from 94.6 to 96.0% with an average of 95.1% and its adsorption occurred rapidly in less than 30 min. Organic contents of the clay substrate, evaluated as 17% of dry mass, may contribute and enhance copper adsorption. Different elution protocols using distilled water, 2 and/or 5% nitric acid revealed that while nitric acid resulted in the removal of more than 59% of the metal at the lower concentration and its complete depletion with a further elution at the higher concentration, distilled water alone was unable to remove more than 1% of adsorbed copper. This finding suggested that copper ions form high-energy bonds with layer-silicate surfaces. Interestingly, the use of a regenerated substrate as copper adsorbent subsequent to abundant washings of the used substrate consecutively, with 0.1 N HNO3 and distilled water, reduced copper adsorption by approximately 14%, suggesting a slight disturbance of clay initial structure. Batch adsorption experiments with phage T7 and raw clay Kb12 showed that the tested clay substrate appeared as a relatively moderate phage adsorbent since the quantity of adsorbed phage averaged 98.2 +/- 0.88% (2 log10 retention) as measured by infectivity for Escherichia coli ATCC 11303. As shown by two types of separating procedures, natural sedimentation and a low speed centrifugation, bacteriophage particles were bound essentially to fine and not to relatively coarse particles of the clay suspension. The retention capacity of purified clay Kb12 appeared low, with average values lower than 60 and 50%, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 and Bacillus cereus ATCC 1135, respectively. A significant increase of retention, in the order of 30%, was found for both bacteria when the mixture clay-bacteria was incubated at laboratory temperature for 6 hours.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Achillea clavennae L. essential oil.
AB  - The volatile constituents of Achillea clavennae L. (Asteraceae), rare plant of Europe, have been analysed using GC/MS. Twenty- five components making up 81.6% of the oil were characterized with camphor (29.5%), myrcene (5.5%), 1,8-cineole (5.3%), beta-caryophyllene (5.1%) and linalool (4.9%) being the major constituents. The essential oil was evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities. The screening of the antimicrobial activity of essential oil was conducted by a disc diffusion test against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and fungal organisms (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans). The activity was more pronounced against Gram-negative and fungal organisms than against Gram-positive bacteria. A. clavennae oil was found to possess antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and all fungal organisms.
TI  - Wessex shopping basket survey - a structured approach to local food sampling.
AB  - The shopping basket approach to food sampling, in which ready-to-eat food items from a shopping list were sampled at premises chosen at random, was adopted by 15 Environmental Health Departments in the Wessex region. A total of 2037 samples were analysed over a 30-month period. The microbiological quality varied considerably between food categories, with gravy and stock samples giving the highest proportion of satisfactory results. Sliced meats, cooked rice and sandwiches gave the poorest overall results. Whilst the majority of unsatisfactory results were due to elevated levels of indicator organisms (Aerobic Colony Count, Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli), unsatisfactory or potentially hazardous levels of pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens or Listeria monocytogenes) were detected in 1% of samples. Salmonella was not detected in any sample. The shopping basket survey was considered to be a useful way of structuring local sampling, and the random selection of premises was found to be a considerable advantage over previous sampling plans. In addition, the survey drew attention to a number of microbiological problems with specific food types, leading to more detailed investigations.
TI  - Aerobic tryptophan degradation pathway in bacteria: novel kynurenine formamidase.
AB  - While a variety of chemical transformations related to the aerobic degradation of L-tryptophan (kynurenine pathway), and most of the genes and corresponding enzymes involved therein have been predominantly characterized in eukaryotes, relatively little was known about this pathway in bacteria. Using genome comparative analysis techniques we have predicted the existence of the three-step pathway of aerobic L-tryptophan degradation to anthranilate (anthranilate pathway) in several bacteria. Based on the chromosomal gene clustering analysis, we have identified a previously unknown gene encoding for kynurenine formamidase (EC 3.5.1.19) involved with the second step of the anthranilate pathway. This functional prediction was experimentally verified by cloning, expression and enzymatic characterization of recombinant kynurenine formamidase orthologs from Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Ralstonia metallidurans. Experimental verification of the inferred anthranilate pathway was achieved by functional expression in Escherichia coli of the R. metallidurans putative kynBAU operon encoding three required enzymes: tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (gene kynA), kynurenine formamidase (gene kynB), and kynureninase (gene kynU). Our data provide the first experimental evidence of the connection between these genes (only one of which, kynU, was previously characterized) and L-tryptophan aerobic degradation pathway in bacteria.
TI  - Consumer food-handling behaviors associated with prevention of 13 foodborne illnesses.
AB  - To be effective in reducing the incidence of foodborne illness, consumers and food safety educators need information about behaviors that will decrease exposure to foodborne pathogens. A four-round Delphi technique was used to survey nationally recognized experts in food microbiology, epidemiology, food safety education, and food safety policy with the aim of identifying and ranking food-handling and consumption behaviors associated with 13 major foodborne pathogens. The food safety experts ranked behaviors related to keeping foods at safe temperatures as of primary importance in preventing illness caused by Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens and of secondary importance in preventing illness caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The use of a thermometer to cook foods adequately was ranked as of primary importance for the prevention of illness caused by Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella species, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Toxoplasma gondii, and Yersinia enterocolitica, with the avoidance of cross-contamination being ranked as of secondary importance for most of these pathogens. Hand washing was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of shigellosis. The avoidance of certain foods that are likely to be contaminated was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of illnesses caused by Listeria monocytogenes, Noroviruses, and Vibrio species. The expert panel's ranking of behaviors for the reduction of the risk of illness caused by major foodborne pathogens can enable consumers to make informed choices about food consumption and handling behaviors and can guide food safety educators in prioritizing their educational efforts.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of konjac fluid on several food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the bactericidal effects of Japanese alkaline foods on food-poisoning bacteria were evaluated. Konjac is an alkaline food soaked in calcinated calcium (the pH of konjac fluid ranges from 11.42 to 12.53). Konjac fluids completely inactivated Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 and E. coil O26:H9, Salmonella Enteritidis, Vibrio parahemolyticus. and Staphylococcus aureus. The initial level of 6 log CFU/ml dramatically decreased after incubation with konjac fluid, and no viable gram-negative bacterium cells could be detected within 1 to 2 days and no viable S. aureus cells could be detected within 3 to 5 days. On the other hand, treatment with konjac fluid was also effective in reducing levels of spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium botulinum type E and type A). At least a 4-log reduction of spore-forming bacteria was obtained in konjac fluid within 7 to 14 days. Vegetative cells were more susceptible to konjac fluid than spores were. When the initial cell count was 6 log CFU/ml, a few surviving spores remained for 60 to 90 days, but no spores could be detected after 120 days. When the initial count of spore-forming bacteria was 3 to 4 log CFU/ml, the cells considered vegetative were completely inactivated within I to 3 days. Repeated treatment with konjac fluid caused complete inactivation of spores in less than 1 to 3 days. Our studies indicate that konjac fluid, which has a long history of use in food, will control food-poisoning bacterial contamination during the production or preservation of konjac and other foods and has a preventive effect on bacteria that can cause severe disease at uniquely low levels.
TI  - Phytochemical and antimicrobial studies of extracts of solanum xanthocarpum.
AB  - Antibacterial activity pf various parts (stem, leaf and fruits) of solvent extracts (petroleum ether, alcohol and acetone) of Solanum xanthocarpum against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi and Bacillus cereus were detected by zone of inhibition. The extracts of Solanum xanthocarpum showed high sensitivity to Kiebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi, moderate sensitivity to Escherichia coli and less sensitivity and resistant to Bacillus cereus. In control, there is no inhibitory zone observed.
TI  - Antibacterial and proteolytic activity in venom from the endoparasitic wasp Pimpla hypochondriaca (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae).
AB  - Venom from the endoparasitic wasp, Pimpla hypochondriaca, is composed of a mixture of high and low molecular weight proteins, possesses phenoloxidase activity, has immunosuppressive properties, and induces paralysis in several insect species. In the present study we demonstrate that P. hypochondriaca venom also contains antibacterial and proteolytic activity. Antibacterial activity was detected against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Xanthamonas campestris but not against Pseudomonas syringae nor against two Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis. Endopeptidase and aminopeptidase activity in venom was detected using the synthetic fluorogenic substrates N-t-BOC-Phe-Ser-Arg-AMC, Arg-AMC and Leu-Arg. The aminopeptidase activity towards Arg-AMC was sensitive to amastatin (70% inhibition), an aminopeptidase inhibitor. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-like enzyme activity was detected, by reverse-phase HPLC using the synthetic tripeptide Hip-His-Leu as a substrate. This activity was sensitive to captopril, an ACE inhibitor (IC(50) 3.8 x 10(-8) M). Using an antiserum raised against recombinant Drosophila melanogaster ACE-like enzyme, (rAnce), Western blot analysis revealed an immunoreactive protein, with a molecular weight estimate of 74 kDa, in P. hypochondriaca venom. The possibility that the endopeptidase, aminopeptidase and ACE are involved in the processing of peptide precursors in the venom sac is discussed.
TI  - Interaction of a free-living soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, with surrogates of foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Free-living nematodes may harbor, protect, and disperse bacteria, including those ingested and passed in viable form in feces. These nematodes are potential vectors for human pathogens and may play a role in foodborne diseases associated with fruits and vegetables eaten raw. In this study, we evaluated the associations between a free-living soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Escherichia coli, an avirulent strain of Salmonella Typhimurium, Listeria welshimeri, and Bacillus cereus. On an agar medium, young adult worms quickly moved toward colonies of all four bacteria; over 90% of 3-day-old adult worms entered colonies within 16 min after inoculation. After 48 h, worms moved in and out of colonies of L. welshimeri and B. cereus but remained associated with E. coli and Salmonella Typhimurium colonies for at least 96 h. Young adult worms fed on cells of the four bacteria suspended in K medium. Worms survived and reproduced with the use of nutrients derived from all test bacteria, as determined for eggs laid by second-generation worms after culturing for 96 h. Development was slightly slower for worms fed gram-positive bacteria than for worms fed gram-negative bacteria. Worms that fed for 24 h on bacterial lawns formed on tryptic soy agar dispersed bacteria over a 3-h period when they were transferred to a bacteria-free agar surface. The results of this study suggest that C. elegans and perhaps other free-living nematodes are potential vectors for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including foodborne pathogens in soil.
TI  - Application of sonication to release DNA from Bacillus cereus for quantitative detection by real-time PCR.
AB  - A rapid sonication method for lysis of Gram-positive bacteria was evaluated for use in combination with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses for detection. Other criteria used for evaluation of lysis were microscopic cell count, colony forming units (cfu), optical density at 600 nm and total yield of DNA measured by PicoGreen fluorescence. The aim of this study was complete disruption of cellular structures and release of DNA without the need for lysing reagents and time-consuming sample preparation. The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus cereus was used as a model organism for Gram-positive bacteria. It was demonstrated by real-time PCR that maximum yield of DNA was obtained after 3 to 5 min of sonication. The yield of DNA was affected by culture age and the cells from a 4-h-old culture in the exponential phase of growth gave a higher yield of DNA after 5 min of sonication than a 24-h-old culture in the stationary phase of growth. The 4-h-old culture was also more sensitive for lysis caused by heating. The maximum yield of DNA, evaluated by real-time PCR, from a culture of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, was obtained after 20 s of sonication. However, the yield of target DNA from E. coli rapidly decreased after 50 s of sonication due to degradation of DNA. Plate counting (cfu), microscopic counting and absorbance at 600 nm showed that the number of viable and structurally intact B. cereus cells decreased rapidly with sonication time, whereas the yield of DNA increased as shown by PicoGreen fluorescence and real-time PCR. The present results indicate that 3-5 min of sonication is sufficient for lysis and release of DNA from samples of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Essential oil analysis and antimicrobial activity of eight Stachys species from Greece.
AB  - The volatile composition of eight Stachys species has been studied. The investigated taxa were St. alopecuros (L.) Bentham., St. scardica (Griseb.) Hayek, St. cretica L. ssp. cretica, St. germanica L. ssp. heldreichii (Boiss.) Hayek, St. recta L., St. spinulosa L., St. euboica Rech. and St. menthifolia Vis., growing wild in Greece. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation in a modified Clevenger-type apparatus, and their analyses were performed by GC and GC-MS. Identification of the substances was made by comparison of mass spectra and retention indices with literature records. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were shown to be the main group of constituents of all taxa. Furthermore, the obtained essential oils were tested against the following six bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Escherichia coli (ATCC 35210), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 10907), Bacillus cereus (clinical isolates), Micrococcus flavus (ATCC 10240), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 2228), as well as against the following five fungi: Aspergillus niger (ATCC 6275), Penicillium ochrochloron (ATCC 9112), Epidermophyton floccosum (clinical isolates), Candida albicans (clinical isolates) and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (clinical isolates). The tested essential oils showed better activity against bacterial species than against fungi. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most resistant strain, as none of the essential oils was active against this strain. The essential oil of St. scardica has been proven most active against both bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Antiplasmid effect of promethazine in mixed bacterial cultures.
AB  - Promethazine has been recognised as an effective antiplasmid agent in cultures containing a single bacterial species such as Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of heterogenity of the microbial flora on plasmid elimination by promethazine in a laboratory based model system of mixed bacterial infection. F'lac plasmid elimination of E. coli K12 LE140 was studied in the presence of a numerically predominant Gram-positive species (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis) by promethazine (0-120 mg/l) at 23, 37 and 39 degrees C. Growth kinetics of different bacterial species were studied at various temperatures without drug treatment in mixed bacterial cultures and it was found that the small number of added bacteria overgrew the pre-existing flora during the incubation period. We observed that bacterial-bacterial interactions modified the growth rate of individual bacterial species and gave selective advantages to some bacterial species of the microbial community. Some interactions between coexisting bacterial species enhanced the frequency of plasmid curing by promethazine in mixed cultures with S. epidermidis. In our experiments the plasmid curing action of promethazine was more effective at elevated temperature than at lower temperatures.
TI  - Analysis of whole bacterial cells by flow field-flow fractionation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop a novel bacterial analysis method by coupling the flow field-flow fractionation (flow FFF) separation technique with detection by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The composition of carrier liquid used for flow FFF was selected based on retention of bacterial cells and compatibility with the MALDI process. The coupling of flow FFF and MALDI-TOF MS was demonstrated for P. putida and E. coli. Fractions of the whole cells were collected after separation by FFF and further analyzed by MALDI-MS. Each fraction, collected over different time intervals, corresponded to different sizes and possibly different growth stages of bacteria. The bacterial analysis by flow FFF/MALDI-TOF MS was completed within 1 h with only preliminary optimization of the process.
TI  - Screening of Bifidobacterium strains isolated from human faeces for antagonistic  activities against potentially bacterial pathogens.
AB  - As probiotic bacteria, strains belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium colonise the gastro-intestinal tract of humans and animals at the time of birth, and they are found in young as well as in adult individuals in great numbers. Moreover, they can interact with the development of enteric infections by the production of antimicrobial metabolites. In this work 281 strains of bifidobacteria were anaerobically isolated from human faecal samples, supplied by volunteers of different ages (youngs, adults, elders), and preliminarly described by microscopic observation. All strains were screened by the fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase (F6PPK) test in order to confirm their classification within the genus Bifidobacterium. Selected strains were used to evaluate their antagonistic activities against Escherichia coli, Salmonella thyphimurium, Staphylococcus lentus, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Sphingomonas paucimobilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sporogenes. Experiments were performed in vitro by different methods based on the observation of growth inhibition in Petri dishes. The strains that showed the highest inhibiting activities were compared by SDS-PAGE for total cell proteins, using type strains of human origin as references. Representative isolates were metabolically characterised by the BIOLOG system; a specific database was created with strains obtained from our collection and a statistical evaluation for metabolic patterns was carried out.
TI  - Rebeccamycin analogues bearing amine substituents or other groups on the sugar moiety.
AB  - In the course of structure-activity relationship studies on rebeccamycin analogues, a series of compounds bearing an amino function on the sugar moiety were synthesized with the aim of improving the solubility and interaction with the macromolecular target(s). The syntheses of amino derivatives and the corresponding chloro, iodo and azido intermediates are described. Their interaction with DNA and effects on human DNA topoisomerases I and II were investigated. Their antimicrobial activities against two Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis, a Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and a yeast Candida albicans were also determined. 6'-Amino compound 7 and 6'-N-methylamino 14 very efficiently inhibit the growth of E. coli. The introduction of an amino group at the 6'-position strongly enhances the capacity of the drugs to interact with DNA but almost abolishes their poisoning effect on topoisomerase I. Unlike the vast majority of rebeccamycin analogues previously studied, the newly designed compounds do not stimulate DNA cleavage by topoisomerase I. The enhanced capacity of the 6'-amino glycosyl rebeccamycin derivatives to bind to DNA likely account for the improved biological profiles. DNA and topoisomerase I represent two independent targets which can both be used for the development of antitumor rebeccamycin derivatives.
TI  - A constitutively expressed 36 kDa exochitinase from Bacillus thuringiensis HD-1.
AB  - A 36 kDa chitinase was purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography from the culture supernatant of Bacillus thuringiensis HD-1. The chitinase production was independent of the presence of chitin in the growth medium and was produced even in the presence of glucose. The purified chitinase was active at acidic pH, had an optimal activity at pH 6.5, and showed maximum activity at 65 degrees C. Of the various substrates, the enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of the disaccharide 4-MU(GlnAc)(2) most efficiently and was therefore classified as an exochitinase. The sequence of the tryptic peptides showed extensive homology with Bacillus cereus 36 kDa exochitinase. The 1083 bp open reading frame encoding 36 kDa chitinase was amplified with primers based on the gene sequence of B. cereus 36 kDa exochitinase. The deduced amino-acid sequence showed that the protein contained an N-terminal signal peptide and consisted of a single catalytic domain. The two conserved signature sequences characteristic of family 18 chitinases were mapped at positions 105-109 and 138-145 of Chi36. The recombinant chitinase was expressed in a catalytically active form in Escherichia coli in the vector pQE-32. The expressed 36 kDa chitinase potentiated the insecticidal effect of the vegetative insecticidal protein (Vip) when used against neonate larvae of Spodoptera litura.
TI  - Diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on Helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  - Among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (AA) is one of the most important. AA has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on Helicobacter pylori. However, there are limited studies on the possible role of AA and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (PA) on the growth and survival of H. pylori. In the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that AA in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mM) inhibited H. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. In contrast, under aerobic conditions AA in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mM) significantly increased the survival of H. pylori presumably eliminating the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. The hydrophobic derivative of AA, PA (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mM). This effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium sporogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Among these bacterial strains, PA showed a similar inhibitory effect on B. cereus and B. subtilis as observed with H. pylori. The results suggest that PA may be considered an important AA derivative in eradication of H. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.
TI  - Microbiology of wheat and flour milling in Australia.
AB  - A survey was undertaken to determine the microbiological status of Australian wheat and the distribution of microorganisms in the flour milling fractions and end products. A total of 650 milling process and end product samples was obtained from nine flour mills located in New South Wales (4), Queensland (2), Victoria (2) and Western Australia (1) during the 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 wheat seasons. Most frequent (modal) counts in wheat and flour were, respectively, as follows: aerobic mesophilic plate count, 10(5) and 10(2) colony forming units/gram (cfu/g); coliforms, 10 and 1 most probable number/gram (MPN/g); Bacillus spp., 10(4) and 10(2) cfu/g; B. cereus, 1 and 0.1 MPN/g; mesophilic aerobic spores, 10 and 1 cfu/g; aerobic thermophiles, both 10 cfu/g; yeasts, 10(3) and 10(2) cfu/g, and moulds, 10(3) and 10(2) cfu/g. Bacillus spp., coliforms, yeasts and moulds were the most frequently detected microorganisms throughout the survey. The most common moulds isolated were Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cladosporium and Eurotium spp. Environmental serovars of Salmonella were isolated from two samples. Escherichia coli and B. cereus were present at very low levels, a majority of positive samples being at the minimum level of detection (3 and 0.3 MPN/g, respectively). As wheat grain layers are separated, surface-adhering contaminants are concentrated in end product bran, wheat germ and pollard, which comprise the outer layers of the grain. Consequently, the inner endosperm fraction contains lower microbial counts, and flour is the cleanest end product of the milling process. Higher microbiological counts midstream in the milling process indicate that equipment contamination may contribute to microbiological contamination; however, the microbiological quality of incoming wheat has a strong influence on the ultimate quality of milling end products.
TI  - Bioactivity of secoiridoid glycosides from Centaurium erythraea.
AB  - As part of our on-going search for bioactive compounds from Scottish plants, two  secoiridoid glycosides, swertiamarin and sweroside, have been isolated from the aerial parts of Centaurium erythraea Rafn (Family: Gentianaceae) by reversed-phase preparative HPLC coupled with a photo-diode-array detector. The structures of these compounds were elucidated unambiguously by UV, FABMS and extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses and also by comparing experimental data with literature data. Antibacterial, free radical scavenging activities and general toxicity of these glycosides have been assessed. Both compounds inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli. While swertiamarin was also active against Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens, sweroside inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Swertiamarin and sweroside exhibited significant general toxicity in brine shrimp lethality bioassay and the LD50 values were 8.0 microg/ml and 34 microg/ml, respectively, whereas that of the positive control podophyllotoxin, a well known cytotoxic lignan, was 2.79 microg/ml. Chemotaxonomic implications of these compounds in the family Gentianaceae have also been discussed briefly.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from Thymus spinulosus Ten. (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The chemical composition of essential oils from aerial parts of Thymus spinulosus Ten. (Lamiaceae) is reported. Four oils from plants growing in different environmental conditions were characterized by GC and GC-MS methods; the oils seem to indicate a new chemotype in the genus Thymus. Influences of soil and altitude characteristics on the essential oil composition are discussed. The oils showed antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimuium Ty2, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria.
TI  - The microbiological quality of ready-to-eat foods with added spices.
AB  - A microbiological study of ready-to-eat foods with added spices or spice ingredients was undertaken to identify any risk factors in the production, storage and display of this product and to establish their effect on microbiological quality. Examination of 1946 ready-to-eat foods from sandwich bars, cafes, public houses, restaurants, specialist sandwich producers, bakers, delicatessens, market stalls and mobile vendors found that 1291 (66%) were of satisfactory/acceptable microbiological quality, 609 (32%) were of unsatisfactory quality, and 46 (2%) were of unacceptable quality. Unacceptable results were due to high levels of B. cereus and/or other Bacillus spp. (>/=10(5) cfu g(-1)). Unsatisfactory results were mostly due to high Aerobic Colony Counts (up to >/=10(7) cfu g(-1)), Enterobacteriaceae (>/=10(4) cfu g(-1)), Escherichia coli (>/=10(2) cfu g(-1)), and Bacillus spp (>/=10(4) cfu g(-1)). Examination of 750 spices and spice ingredients revealed that B. cereus were present in 142 (19%) samples, other Bacillus spp. in 399 (53%) samples, and Salmonella spp. (S. enteritidis PT 11) in one (<1%) sample. Approximately a third (222) of spice and spice ingredients examined contained high counts (>/=10(4) cfu g(-1)) of B. cereus and/or other Bacillus spp., and appeared to be associated with the corresponding ready-to-eat foods containing similar high counts of these organisms (P<0.0001). Acceptable microbiological quality of ready-to-eat foods to which spices or spice ingredients have been added was associated with premises that had management food hygiene training and hazard analysis in place. Poor microbiological quality was associated with preparation on the premises, premises type, little or no confidence in the food business management of food hygiene, and small premises as indicated by local authority inspectors' confidence in management and consumer at risk scores.
TI  - A mammalian cell regulatory agent, CeReS-18, inhibits yeast cell proliferation but not bacterial replication.
AB  - A cell regulatory sialoglycopeptide, CeReS-18, purified from intact bovine cerebral cortex cells, has exhibited the capability of reversibly inhibiting cellular DNA synthesis and the proliferation of a wide array of mammalian cells. In the present study, the effect of CeReS-18 on the proliferation of bacterial ( Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli) and yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) cells was investigated. The results showed that replication and viability of the bacterial cells were not affected by CeReS-18 at any concentration tested, including 15-fold higher than that used for inhibiting mouse 3T3 cell proliferation. In contrast to bacterial cells, CeReS-18 was able to inhibit the replication of yeast cells, in a concentration-dependent, reversible manner, and the addition of calcium to the culture medium could abrogate the inhibitory effect of CeReS-18. A cytotoxic effect of CeReS-18 on both yeast cell species was observed when it was applied at higher concentrations.
TI  - Demonstration of a hermetic airborne ozone disinfection system: studies on E. coli.
AB  - An enclosed flow-through system using airborne ozone for disinfection and which removes the ozone with a catalytic converter was tested with a strain of Escherichia coli. Petri dishes containing the microorganisms were inserted in a chamber and exposed for 10-480 min to ozone concentrations between 4 and 20 ppm. Death rates in excess of 99.99% were achieved. Survival data is fitted to a two-stage curve with a shoulder based on the multihit target model. Ozone was removed from the exhaust air to nondetectable levels using a metal oxide based catalyst. The possibility of using ozone as an airborne disinfectant for internal building surfaces and catalytically removing the ozone on exhaust is demonstrated to be feasible. A model for the decay of Bacillus cereus under ozone exposure is proposed as an example for predicting the sterilization of buildings contaminated with anthrax. The potential for disinfecting airstreams and removing ozone to create breathable air is also implied by the results of this experiment.
TI  - Effects of gamma ray and electron-beam irradiations on survival of anaerobic and  facultatively anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - An extension of the approval for food irradiation is desired due to the increase  in the incidence of food poisoning in the world. One anaerobic (Clostridium perfringens) and four facultatively anaerobic (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella Enteritidis) bacteria irradiated with gamma ray or electron beam (E-beam) were tested in terms of survival on agar under packaging atmosphere. Using pouch pack, effects of two irradiations on survival of anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were evaluated comparatively. E-beam irradiation was more effective than gamma ray irradiation in decreasing the D10 value of B. cereus at 4 degrees C, slightly more effective in that of E. coli O157, and similarly effective in that of the other three bacteria at 4 degrees C. The gamma irradiation of the bacteria without incubation at 4 degrees C before irradiation was more effective than that of the bacteria with incubation overnight at 4 degrees C before irradiation in decreasing the D10 values of these bacteria (B. cereus, E. coli O157, and L. monocytogenes). Furthermore, ground beef patties inoculated with bacteria were irradiated with 1 kGy by E-beam (5 MeV) at 4 degrees C. The inoculated bacteria in the 1-9 mm beef patties were killed by 1 kGy E-beam irradiation and some bacteria in more than 9 mm beef patties were not killed by the irradiation.
TI  - Vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between September 2001 and May 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/mL, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/mL, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/mL respectively. Mean +/- SD sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low MIC(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Use of bioactive glass slides for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization analysis: application to microorganisms.
AB  - Glass slides are widely used in high-throughput analysis and are available commercially with surfaces activated, etched, and channeled. Thin glass microscope slides are shown here to be suitable sample supports for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. As a demonstration, lectins immobilized on glass slides with activated surfaces are used to concentrate and purify agglutinated Bacillis spores. It is expected that such slides will provide a rapid, inexpensive way to evaluate and implement new strategies involving MALDI MS readout.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the chitinase gene chiA74 from Bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  - The endochitinase gene chiA74 from Bacillus thuringiensis serovar kenyae strain LBIT-82 was cloned in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha F'. A sequence of 676 amino acids was deduced when the gene was completely sequenced. A molecular mass of 74 kDa was estimated for the preprotein, which includes a putative 4-kDa signal sequence located at the N terminus. The deduced amino acid sequence showed high degree of identity with other chitinases such as ChiB from Bacillus cereus (98%) and ChiA71 from Bacillus thuringiensis serovar pakistani (70%). Additionally, ChiA74 showed a modular structure comprised of three domains: a catalytic domain, a fibronectin-like domain, and a chitin-binding domain. All three domains showed conserved sequences when compared to other bacterial chitinase sequences. A ca. 70-kDa mature protein expressed by the cloned gene was detected in zymograms, comigrating with a chitinase produced by the LBIT-82 wild-type strain. ChiA74 is active within a wide pH range (4 to 9), although a bimodal activity was shown at pH 4.79 and 6.34. The optimal temperature was estimated at 57.2 degrees C when tested at pH 6. The potential use of ChiA74 as a synergistic agent, along with the B. thuringiensis insecticidal Cry proteins, is discussed.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria and spores by pulse electric field and high pressure CO2 at low temperature.
AB  - The common methods for inactivation of bacteria involve heating or exposure to toxic chemicals. These methods are not suitable for heat-sensitive materials, food, and pharmaceutical products. Recently, a complete inactivation of many microorganisms was achieved with high-pressure carbon dioxide at ambient temperature and in the absence of organic solvent and irradiation. The inactivation of spores with CO(2) required long residence time and high temperatures, such as 60 degrees C. In this study the synergistic effect of pulsed electric field (PEF) in combination with high-pressure CO(2) for inactivation was investigated. The bacteria Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus were suspended in glycerol solution and treated in the first step with PEF (up to 25 KV/cm) and then with high-pressure CO(2) not higher than 40 degrees C and 200 bar. The inactivation efficiency was determined by counting the colony formation units of control and sample. Samples of the cells subjected to PEF treatment alone and in combination with CO(2) treatment were examined by scanning electron microscopy to determine the effect of the processes on the cell wall. Experimental results indicate that the viability decreased with increasing electrical field strength and number of pulses. A further batch treatment with supercritical CO(2) lead to complete inactivation of bacterial species and decreased the count of the spores by at least three orders of magnitude, the inactivation being enhanced by an increase of contact time between CO(2) and the sample. A synergistic effect between the pulsed electric field and the high-pressure CO(2) was evident in all the species treated. The new low temperature process is an alternative for pasteurization of thermally labile compounds such as protein and plasma and minimizes denaturation of important nutrient compounds in the liquid media.
TI  - [Observations of characteristics of the mechanisms of biological oxidation of cell wall-deficient bacteria].
AB  - The L-forms were induced from Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus by beta-lactam antibiotics and then observations on the properties of oxygen requirement, sugar fermentation and sensitive to cyanide of the L-forms were done. The results were shown that the L-forms derived from the obligate aerobe or the facultative anaerobe did not ferment sugars and were highly oxygen-dependent and more sensitive to cyanide than their parent bacteria. The metabolic activities which were same as the parent bacteria of the L-forms would return after the L-forms reverted to the typical bacteria forms. It was possible that the changes of biological oxidation mechanism were due to the deficiency of the cell wall which led to loss of the periplasmic space or the membrane-wall interlayer so that the enzymes for fermentation existed in the space could not be hold.
TI  - [Cloning of parasporal body protein gene resembling to S-layer protein genes from Bacillus thuringiensis CTC strain].
AB  - Bacillus CTC strain was identified as Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. finitimus (serotype H2) and Pasteur Institute confirmed this identification. The parasporal body formed by CTC strain is oval shaped, and consists of 100 kD protein. The determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence showed this protein shares 93% similarity to that of B. anthracis S-layer proteins. The restriction map covering the related protein gene (ctc) was deduced according to southern hybridization. The DNA fragments containing the 5' and 3' end of ctc gene with 0.6 kb overlap were isolated, respectively. Full length ctc gene was then constructed. B. thuringiensis is a species similar to B. cereus and B. anthracis, and only can be distinguished by forming parasporal bodies. The growth of E. coli maintaining ctc gene is similar to that of E. coli expressing S-layer protein gene. The above preliminary results showed that the parasporal body protein in CTC strain is a cell surface-like protein. So identifying CTC strain as a species of B. thuringiensis and the unique criterion for the identification of B. thuringiensis by forming parasporal body should be reconsidered.
TI  - Vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between September 2001 and February 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Texas. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/mL, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/mL, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/mL, respectively. Mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has MIC90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. Furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. Potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis, and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Beta-lactamase genes of the penicillin-susceptible Bacillus anthracis Sterne strain.
AB  - Susceptibility to penicillin and other beta-lactam-containing compounds is a common trait of Bacillus anthracis. Beta-lactam agents, particularly penicillin, have been used worldwide to treat anthrax in humans. Nonetheless, surveys of clinical and soil-derived strains reveal penicillin G resistance in 2 to 16% of isolates tested. Bacterial resistance to beta-lactam agents is often mediated by production of one or more types of beta-lactamases that hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring, inactivating the antimicrobial agent. Here, we report the presence of two beta-lactamase (bla) genes in the penicillin-susceptible Sterne strain of B. anthracis. We identified bla1 by functional cloning with Escherichia coli. bla1 is a 927-nucleotide (nt) gene predicted to encode a protein with 93.8% identity to the type I beta-lactamase gene of Bacillus cereus. A second gene, bla2, was identified by searching the unfinished B. anthracis chromosome sequence database of The Institute for Genome Research for open reading frames (ORFs) predicted to encode beta-lactamases. We found a partial ORF predicted to encode a protein with significant similarity to the carboxy-terminal end of the type II beta-lactamase of B. cereus. DNA adjacent to the 5' end of the partial ORF was cloned using inverse PCR. bla2 is a 768-nt gene predicted to encode a protein with 92% identity to the B. cereus type II enzyme. The bla1 and bla2 genes confer ampicillin resistance to E. coli and Bacillus subtilis when cloned individually in these species. The MICs of various antimicrobial agents for the E. coli clones indicate that the two beta-lactamase genes confer different susceptibility profiles to E. coli; bla1 is a penicillinase, while bla2 appears to be a cephalosporinase. The beta-galactosidase activities of B. cereus group species harboring bla promoter-lacZ transcriptional fusions indicate that bla1 is poorly transcribed in B. anthracis, B. cereus, and B. thuringiensis. The bla2 gene is strongly expressed in B. cereus and B. thuringiensis and weakly expressed in B. anthracis. Taken together, these data indicate that the bla1 and bla2 genes of the B. anthracis Sterne strain encode functional beta-lactamases of different types, but gene expression is usually not sufficient to confer resistance to beta-lactam agents.
TI  - Lethal factor to mice produced by Escherichia coli isolated from chickens with swollen head syndrome.
AB  - A lethal toxin similar to Bacillus cererus lethal toxin was detected in the culture supernatants of Escherichia coli isolated from chickens with swollen head syndrome. The lethal activity was heat-labile, protease-sensitive and killed mice within 10 min. The light microscopy of the histopathological studies revealed that the principal organ affected by this toxin was the lung but the liver and kidneys also showed lesions. The relevance of this lethal activity from E. coli remains to be determined.
TI  - Eggshell matrix proteins as defense mechanism of avian eggs.
AB  - This study focused on the role of eggshell matrix proteins as a function of potential natural antimicrobial defenses of avian eggs. The electrophoretic profile of SDS-PAGE showed that the soluble eggshell matrix proteins had three major bands of 15 000, 36 000, and 66 000 and several minor bands comprising 17 000, 25 000, 30 000, and 75 000, while insoluble matrix proteins were consisting of various bands comprising at least 16 distinct migration bands between 10 000 and 200 000. Three bacteria species, Pseudomonas aureginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus, were found to be inhibited in the presence of soluble eggshell matrix proteins (100 microg/mL). On the other hand, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis were weakly inhibited at only an early stage of incubation time (up to 4 h). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that eggshell matrix proteins might interact and disrupt the membrane integrity of bacteria. The present study clearly indicated that avian eggshell matrix proteins possess a potential of novel antimicrobial defensin mechanism.
TI  - Application of a real-time biosensor to detect bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  - A spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. The system (termed LEXSAS, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. We studied the LEXSAS as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. If successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. In this study, we used the LEXSAS for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pyogenes. Bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. The results indicate that the LEXSAS could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.
TI  - [Study on the antibacterial activity of ginkgolic acids].
AB  - In this article we studied the anti-bacterial activity of the extract from testa  of Ginkgo biloba and ginkgolic acids. They can inhibit the growth of Staphylocococus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus and MRSA. Ginkgolic acids combined with peniciline can enhance their inhibitory activity to MRSA.
TI  - The enterotoxin T (BcET) from Bacillus cereus can probably not contribute to food poisoning.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment from strain NVH 38 (containing bceT) was cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. This sequence showed 50-60% identity to the original. When this bceT clone was expressed in E. coli no biological activity was found in either supernatants or cell extracts. Cell extracts from the Bacillus cereus strains (NVH 38 and B-4ac) were also negative on Vero cells. Neutralisation of supernatant from B. cereus B-4ac using a monoclonal antibody (reacting with NheB and HblD) abolished the activity. A test for cytotoxic enterotoxins was negative for both cell extracts and supernatants. Our data suggest that BcET either has an unknown type enterotoxic action or non at all.
TI  - Colony shape as a genetic trait in the pattern-forming Bacillus mycoides.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacillus mycoides Flugge, a Gram-positive, non-motile soil bacterium  assigned to Bacillus cereus group, grows on agar as chains of cells linked end to end, forming radial filaments curving clock- or counter-clockwise (SIN or DX morphotypes). The molecular mechanism causing asymmetric curving is not known: our working hypothesis considers regulation of filamentous growth as the prerequisite for these morphotypes. RESULTS: SIN and DX strains isolated from the environment were classified as B. mycoides by biochemical and molecular biology tests. Growth on agar of different hardness and nutrient concentration did not abolish colony patterns, nor was conversion between SIN and DX morphotypes ever noticed. A number of morphotype mutants, all originating from one SIN strain, were obtained. Some lost turn direction becoming fluffy, others became round and compact. All mutants lost wild type tight aggregation in liquid culture. Growth on agar was followed by microscopy, exploring the process of colony formation and details of cell divisions. A region of the dcw (division cell wall) cluster, including ftsQ, ftsA, ftsZ and murC, was sequenced in DX and SIN strains as a basis for studying cell division. This confirmed the relatedness of DX and SIN strains to the B. cereus group. CONCLUSIONS: DX and SIN asymmetric morphotypes stem from a close but not identical genomic context. Asymmetry is established early during growth on agar. Wild type bacilli construct mostly uninterrupted filaments with cells dividing at the free ends: they "walk" longer distances compared to mutants, where enhanced frequency of cell separation produces new growing edges resulting in round compact colonies.
TI  - Microbiological quality of 18 degrees C ready-to-eat food products sold in Taiwan.
AB  - A total of 164 samples of 18 degrees C ready-to-eat (RTE) food products, purchased in 1999-2000 from convenience stores and supermarkets in central Taiwan, were examined to determine the microbiological quality of these products. The 18 degrees C RTE food products, manufactured by 16 factories, were divided into groups based on the type of food and their major ingredients. Aerobic plate count, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and psychrotrophic Pseudomonas spp. were evaluated. The incidence of E. coli and coliforms in these 18 degrees C RTE food products was 7.9% and 75.0%, respectively, while 49.8% and 17.9% of the samples were found to contain B. cereus and S. aureus, respectively. Among the samples tested, 1.3% of the food products contained more than 10(5) CFU g(-1) of B. cereus and 0.7% contained more than 10(5) CFU g(-1) of S. aureus. The pH values of the samples were all below 7.0, except for cold noodles, which had pH values ranging from 5.18 to 8.20. Among the five types of 18 degrees C food products tested, the highest incidence of E. coli (16%) and Pseudomonas spp. (64.0%) were detected in hand-rolled sushi in a cone shape. On the other hand, the highest incidence rate of coliforms, B. cereus, and S. aureus were found in sandwiches (88%), cold noodles (66.7%) and rice balls rolled in seaweed (25.0%), respectively. Food products made of ham contained the highest incidence of coliforms (88.0%) and E. coli (16.0%), while food products containing meat and ham as the major ingredients had the highest incidence rates of B. cereus (62.5%) and S. aureus (26.1%), respectively. For coliforms, E. coli, B. cereus and S. aureus, the percentage of 18 degrees C RTE food products exceeding the microbiological standards for RTE food accepted by Republic of China was 75.0%, 7.9%, 49.8% and 17.9%, respectively.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts from some edible plants commonly consumed in Asia.
AB  - Extracts of edible plants (26 species) from China, Japan, Thailand and Yemen were screened for their antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli and Salmonella infantis. Buffered methanol (80% methanol and 20% PBS) and acetone extracted inhibitory substances against tested bacteria from 16 plants, as revealed by the disc assay. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of extracts determined by the agar dilution method ranged from 165 to 2640 mg l(-1). The most sensitive microorganism to extracts from Azadirachta indica, Cinnamomum cassia, Rumex nervosus, Ruta graveolens, Thymus serpyllum and Zingiber officinale was B. cereus, with MIC of 165 to 660 mg l(-1). E. coli and S. infantis were only inhibited by Cinnamomum cassia extracts at the highest MIC (2640 mg l(-1)). L. monocytogenes (Tottori) was more resistant than the ATCC 7644 strain to extracts from Ruta chalepensis, Artemisia absinthium and Cissus spp. EDTA (0.85 mM) reduced the MICs of Cinnamomum cassia and Cissus rotundifolia by at least 50% when tested against E. coli, S. infantis, S. aureus and L. monocytogenes.
TI  - Adhesion of Bacillus spores and Escherichia coli cells to inert surfaces: role of surface hydrophobicity.
AB  - The ability of bacterial spores and vegetative cells to adhere to inert surfaces  was investigated by means of the number of adherent spores (Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis spores) and Escherichia coli cells and their resistance to cleaning or rinsing procedures (adhesion strength). Six materials (glass, stainless steel, polyethylene high density (PEHD), polyamide-6, polyvinyl chloride, and Teflon) were tested. Slight differences in the number of adherent spores (less than 1 log unit) were observed between materials, but a higher number of adherent E. coli cells was found on the hydrophobic materials PEHD and Teflon. Conversely, the resistance of both B. cereus and B. subtilis spores to a cleaning procedure was significantly affected by the material. Hydrophobic materials were harder to clean. The topography parameter derived from the Abbott-Firestone curve, RVK, and, to a lesser extent, the widely used roughness parameters RA (average roughness) and Rz (maximal roughness), were related to the number of adherent cells. Lastly, the soiling level as well as the adhesion strength were shown to depend largely on the microorganism. The number of adhering B. cereus hydrophobic spores and their resistance to a cleaning procedure were found to be 10 times greater than those of the B. subtilis hydrophilic spores. Escherichia coli was loosely bound to all the materials tested, even after 24 h biofilm formation.
TI  - Development of a laser-induced cell lysis system.
AB  - A novel cell lysis system was developed that is based on laser-induced disruption of bacterial and yeast cells. It will find application as a rapid, efficient and clean sample preparation step in bioanalytical detection systems. Using E. coli as our model analyte, we optimized cell lysis with respect to optimal laser wavelength, lowest energy input requirements, RNA release from the cells, and potential protein damage. The optimized system was finally applied to the lysis of four additional microorganisms. All experiments were carried out with about 2000 cells per sample or less. Initially, lysis was determined by the detection of cell survival after laser treatment using standard microbiological techniques, (i.e., cells were grown on nutrient agar plates). Then, actual release of mRNA from the cells was proven. Wavelengths investigated ranged from 500 nm to 1550 nm. An average power of 100 mW for the lasers was shown to be sufficient to obtain cell lysis at wavelengths above 1000 nm, with optimal wavelengths between 1250 nm and 1550 nm. Since water absorbs energy at those wavelengths, it is assumed that laser exposure results in an instantaneous increase of the cell temperature, which causes rupture of the cell membrane. Second, damage to protein solutions treated under optimized laser-lysis conditions was also studied. Using a pure solution of horseradish peroxidase as a model protein, no loss in enzyme activity was observed. Thus, it was concluded that damage to intracellular proteins is unlikely. Third, RNA release was tested using an E. coli specific RNA biosensor. Release of RNA was not detected from untreated cells, but laser-treated E. coli cells displayed significant RNA release due to laser-induced cell lysis. Finally, lysis of M. luteus, B. subtilis, B. cereus, and S. cerevisiae were investigated under optimized conditions. In all cases, laser-induced lysis of the cells was confirmed by determination of cell survival. Hence, laser-induced cell lysis is an efficient procedure that can be used for sample preparation, without damage to macromolecules, in bioanalytical detection systems for microorganisms. Miniaturized lasers and miniaturized cell-lysis chambers will create a simple, field-usable cell lysis system and allow the application of laser-induced cell lysis in micro Total Analysis Systems.
TI  - Single-cell protein production from ram horn hydrolysate by bacteria.
AB  - Ram horns obtained from the slaughterhouse of Erzurum, Turkey were hydrolyzed by  treating with acid (6N-HCl) and ram horn hydrolysate (RHH) was obtained. The hydrolysate was used as substrate to grow Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Bacillus subtilis NRRL NRS-744 and Escherichia coli in batch system at 30 degrees C; air 1.5 v/v/min; stirring 150 rpm. Both RHH and biomass samples were analyzed. The bacterial cells produced in this hydrolysate were found to be rich in total protein (66%, 68% and 71% for E. coli, B. cereus and B. subtilis, respectively). The chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand were reduced significantly by the growth of bacteria. The protein produced contained all essential amino acids for ruminant feed.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lantana  xenica.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of Lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. The oil from the aerial parts of Lantana xenica Mold. (Verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The major constituent of the oil was (E)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene D (6.6 %). The antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of L. xenica inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus and Proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (E)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus showed a lower inhibition. The bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella sp., Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (E)-caryophyllene.
TI  - Simultaneous multiple substrate tag detection with ESI-ion trap MS for in vivo bacterial enzyme activity profiling.
AB  - A bacterial identification method in which multiple enzyme activities are measured simultaneously and in vivo with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is described. Whole-cell bacteria are immobilized onto a filter support and incubated with a mixture of substrates. Each substrate is chosen to measure a specific enzyme activity of a targeted bacterium and to produce a tag of unique molecular weight. After a predetermined incubation time, the solution is filtered, and the supernatant consisting of a mixture of released tags and unhydrolyzed substrates is directly analyzed, without chromatographic separation, by ESI-MS. Bacteria remain viable on the filter for further analyses. The method was tested by measuring the aminopeptidase activity of the bacteria Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The resulting aminopeptidase enzyme profiles allowed the differentiation between the four bacteria tested. The method is rapid, since a multiplex advantage is realized when assaying for multiple enzymes, and it is amenable to automation via a flow injection analysis setup.
TI  - Screening of some Siberian medicinal plants for antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of crude ethanolic extracts of 16 Siberian medicinal plants was tested against five species of microorganisms: Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. Of the 16 plants tested, 12 showed antimicrobial activity against one or more species of microorganisms. The most active antimicrobial plants were Bergenia crassifolia, Chelidonium majus, Rhaponticum carthamoides, Sanguisorba officinalis, and Tussilago farfara.
TI  - Street foods in Accra, Ghana: how safe are they?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the microbial quality of foods sold on streets of Accra and factors predisposing to their contamination. METHODS: Structured questionnaires were used to collect data from 117 street vendors on their vital statistics, personal hygiene, food hygiene and knowledge of foodborne illness. Standard methods were used for the enumeration, isolation, and identification of bacteria. FINDINGS: Most vendors were educated and exhibited good hygiene behaviour. Diarrhoea was defined as the passage of > or =3 stools per day) by 110 vendors (94.0%), but none associated diarrhoea with bloody stools; only 21 (17.9%) associated diarrhoea with germs. The surroundings of the vending sites were clean, but four sites (3.4%) were classified as very dirty. The cooking of food well in advance of consumption, exposure of food to flies, and working with food at ground level and by hand were likely risk factors for contamination. Examinations were made of 511 menu items, classified as breakfast/snack foods, main dishes, soups and sauces, and cold dishes. Mesophilic bacteria were detected in 356 foods (69.7%): 28 contained Bacillus cereus (5.5%), 163 contained Staphylococcus aureus (31.9%) and 172 contained Enterobacteriaceae (33.7%). The microbial quality of most of the foods was within the acceptable limits but samples of salads, macaroni, fufu, omo tuo and red pepper had unacceptable levels of contamination. Shigella sonnei and enteroaggregative Escherichia coli were isolated from macaroni, rice, and tomato stew, and Salmonella arizonae from light soup. CONCLUSION: Street foods can be sources of enteropathogens. Vendors should therefore receive education in food hygiene. Special attention should be given to the causes of diarrhoea, the transmission of diarrhoeal pathogens, the handling of equipment and cooked food, hand-washing practices and environmental hygiene.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An automated bacterial culture system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. The recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into Day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU per mL. Samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. RESULTS: All organisms, except P. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 CFU/mL) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 CFU/mL) hours. P. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 CFU/mL) or 66.0 (100 CFU/mL) hours. The 10-fold increase in inoculum was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. The aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours) between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION: No difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. The new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.
TI  - Isolation of S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide and six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates from Allium siculum.
AB  - Isolation and identification of (S(S)R(C))-S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide (1) from the bulbs of Allium siculum is reported. This compound was found in all parts of the plant (bulbs, stem, leaves, and flowers) along with known compounds (S(S)R(C))-S-methyl- and (R(S)R(C))-(E)-S-(1-propenyl)cysteine sulfoxides (2 and 3, respectively). In addition, six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates (4-9) have been found in a CH2Cl2 extract of the bulbs. Structures were determined by a combination of spectral methods (primarily NMR and MS) and by comparison with authentic compounds obtained by synthesis. Antimicrobial activities of 4-7 and 9 are reported.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the marine alkaloids haminol and pulo'upone and related compounds.
AB  - The marine alkaloids haminol A, haminol B and pulo'upone as well as 17 related compounds (twelve 2-substituted pyridine derivatives, four 3-substituted ones and one analogue of the bicyclic terminus of pulo'upone) were tested for antimicrobial activity against a panel of six microbes (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using the paper disc agar diffusion method. Six compounds were tested also against the mold Aspergillus niger. Some of the compounds displayed noteworthy antimicrobial activity, only one congener being completely devoid of activity. Nearly all compounds had activity against B. cereus and S. epidermidis. The growth of E. coli, C albicans and S. cerevisiae was also distinctly inhibited by many compounds. In contrast, most compounds were inactive or had minimal activity against P. aeruginosa. Interestingly, most of the compounds tested against the opportunistic pathogen A. niger were active, one of them having noteworthy inhibitory potency.
TI  - Prevalence of and resistance to anti-microbial drugs in selected microbial species isolated from bulk milk samples.
AB  - The prevalence of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative (CN) staphylococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Bacillus cereus, was investigated in 111 bulk milk samples. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 38 samples, CN staphylococci from 63 samples, E. coli from 49 samples, E. faecalis or E. faecium from 107 samples, and L. monocytogenes from two samples. Bacillus cereus was not found in any of the samples and three samples were free of any of the selected species. Sensitivity to the anti-microbial drugs amikacin, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cephalothin (CLT), cephotaxime, clindamycin, chloramphenicol (CMP), co-trimoxazole, erythromycin (ERY), gentamicin, neomycin, norfloxacin, oxacillin, penicillin, streptomycin (STR), tetracycline (TTC) and vancomycin was tested using the standard dilution technique. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) characteristics (MIC50, MIC90, MIC range) were determined for each microbial species. Resistance against one or more anti-microbial drugs was found in 93% of S. aureus, 40% of CN staphylococci, 73% of E. coli, 88% of E.faecalis, 55% of E.faecium, and one L. monocytogenes strain. Most of the strains, particularly enterococci, were resistant to STR, TTC, and ERY (MIC50 4 microg/ml). A high percentage of staphylococci were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. High resistance to CLT was found in 11 strains of E. coli (MIC 256 microg/ml) and strains resistant to CMP (MIC90 16 microg/ml) were detected. The highest numbers of resistance phenotypes were found in E. coil (16) and CN staphylococci (12). Eighteen identical resistance phenotypes were demonstrated in indicator bacteria (E. coli, E. faecalis, E. faecium) and pathogens (S. aureus, CN staphylococci) isolated from the same bulk milk sample. The obtained resistance data were matched against the herd owners' information on therapeutic use of the drugs. This confrontation could not explain the findings of strains resistant to ERY or CMP. Our findings are evidence of selection of resistant strains among not only pathogenic agents, but also among indicator bacteria which can become significant carriers of transmissible resistance genes.
TI  - Purification, characterization and cloning of a chitinase from Bacillus sp. NCTU2.
AB  - A chitin-degrading Bacillus strain, designated as NCTU2, was screened from soil and identified. An extracellular chitinase was purified to >90% homogeneity from the culture filtrate. The purification involved hydrophobic-interaction and gel-filtration chromatographic separations with a yield of 58%. The purified enzyme (ChiNCTU2) is a monomeric protein with an estimated molecular mass of 36.5 kDa and a pI of 6.3. It is thermally stable at 60 degrees C and pH 6-8 for more than 3 h. The optimal activity is in the range of 50-60 degrees C at pH 7.0. Chitobiose is the predominant product throughout the enzymic hydrolysis of the colloidal chitin, indicating that the purified chitinase is an exo-chitinase. Chito-oligosaccharides [with degree of polymerization (DP) values of 4-6] are good substrates of the purified enzyme, whereas a DP3 oligomer was slowly hydrolysed to form DP1 and DP2 sugars. The first 15 N-terminal amino acids of the enzyme were determined to be ANNLGSKLLVGYWHN, which is highly homologous to that of ChiA from Bacillus cereus. A PCR cloning technique was employed to obtain the corresponding gene from Bacillus NCTU2. The gene sequence was determined to be 1080 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 360 amino acids with the first 27 amino acids as the signal peptide.
TI  - Characterization of the bactericidal activity of the natural diterpene kaurenoic  acid.
AB  - Kaurenoic acid is a diterpene with selective antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The compound is bacteriolytic for Bacillus cereus. This activity was only partially affected by the composition and pH of the culture medium. Loss of the ability to retain the Gram stain and morphological alterations were produced in B. cereus cells exposed to kaurenoic acid. On the other hand, LPS mutants of Salmonella typhi were resistant to the compound, but spheroplasts of Escherichia coli became more sensitive to kaurenoic acid.
TI  - New labdene iterpenes from Eupatorium glutinosum.
AB  - The new diterpene glucoside 3,15-dihydroxy-ent-labd-7-en-17-oic acid 3-O-beta-D-glucoside (1) and its aglycone (2) have been isolated from Eupatorium glutinosum. The structures were determined by IR, one- and two-dimensional NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry, chemical transformations, and comparison of spectroscopic data with closely related diterpenes. Crude extracts showed antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, but compounds 1 and 2 showed only antimicrobial activity. These results support the vernacular medicinal use of the plant as an antimicrobial.
TI  - Essential oil constituents and in vitro antimicrobial activity of Decalepis hamiltonii roots against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Hydrodistillation of Decalepis hamiltonii roots yielded an essential oil (0.33% v/w) that contained 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (37.45%), 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (31.01%), 4-O-methylresorcylaldehyde (9.12%), benzyl alcohol (3.16%), and alpha-atlantone (2.06%) as major constituents, with aromatic aldehydes constituting the main fraction of this root's essential oil. The oil was tested for its antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens responsible for food spoilage and human pathologies using standard antimicrobial assays. It exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus roseus, and Staphylococcus aureus at a concentration range of 1:0 with inhibitory activities of 27, 23, 16, 19, 22, 19, and 23 mm, respectively, which are comparable to those of the standards. The roots of D. hamiltonii, therefore, may be considered as an inexpensive source of an essential oil rich in antimicrobial compounds against foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Mutational analysis of the two zinc-binding sites of the Bacillus cereus 569/H/9  metallo-beta-lactamase.
AB  - The metallo-beta-lactamase BcII from Bacillus cereus 569/H/9 possesses a binuclear zinc centre. The mono-zinc form of the enzyme displays an appreciably high activity, although full efficiency is observed for the di-zinc enzyme. In an attempt to assign the involvement of the different zinc ligands in the catalytic properties of BcII, individual substitutions of selected amino acids were generated. With the exception of His(116)-->Ser (H116S), C221A and C221S, the mono- and di-zinc forms of all the other mutants were poorly active. The activity of H116S decreases by a factor of 10 when compared with the wild type. The catalytic efficiency of C221A and C221S was zinc-dependent. The mono-zinc forms of these mutants exhibited a low activity, whereas the catalytic efficiency of their respective di-zinc forms was comparable with that of the wild type. Surprisingly, the zinc contents of the mutants and the wild-type BcII were similar. These data suggest that the affinity of the beta-lactamase for the metal was not affected by the substitution of the ligand. The pH-dependence of the H196S catalytic efficiency indicates that the zinc ions participate in the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring by acting as a Lewis acid. The zinc ions activate the catalytic water molecule, but also polarize the carbonyl bond of the beta-lactam ring and stabilize the development of a negative charge on the carbonyl oxygen of the tetrahedral reaction intermediate. Our studies also demonstrate that Asn(233) is not directly involved in the interaction with the substrates.
TI  - Microbiological quality and safety of ready-to-eat cooked foods from a centralized school kitchen in Argentina.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbiological and sensory quality as well as the safety of ready-to-eat (RTE) cooked foods prepared in and distributed from a centralized kitchen to schools in Argentina. A total of 101 cooked food samples delivered as hot RTE cooked foods (group A) and as RTE cooked foods at room temperature (group B) and 140 surface swab environment samples were collected from February to November 1999. Petrifilm plates were used for aerobic (PAC), coliform (PCC), and Escherichia coli (PEC) counts. Standard methods were used to determine Enterobacteriaceae (EntC) and thermotolerant coliform counts (TCC). Samples were also tested for the presence of Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens. Food temperatures just before samples were put into containers ranged from 80 to 98 degrees C and from 28 to 32 degrees C for group A and group B, respectively. For group A food samples, PAC ranged from 1.04 to 3.50 log CFU/g, and PCC, PEC, TCC, and EntC were not detected. For group B food samples, PAC ranged from 3.63 to 6.48 log CFU/g, PCC ranged from 1.90 to 5.36 log CFU/g, TCC ranged from 1.30 to 3.95 log CFU/g, and EntC ranged from 3.60 to 5.46 log CFU/g. Of the foodborne pathogens, only B. cereus was isolated (63.4% of samples) in both food groups (<4 log CFU/g). The microbiological and sensory quality and the safety of group A foods were satisfactory. Large numbers of PAC and EntC detected in group B foods show that better control is needed to avoid potential foodborne diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of chitosans and chitosan oligomers with different molecular weights.
AB  - Antibacterial activities of six chitosans and six chitosan oligomers with different molecular weights (Mws) were examined against four gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Salmonella typhimurium, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) and seven gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus megaterium, B. cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. brevis, and L. bulgaricus). Chitosans showed higher antibacterial activities than chitosan oligomers and markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria tested although inhibitory effects differed with Mws of chitosan and the particular bacterium. Chitosan generally showed stronger bactericidal effects with gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria in the presence of 0.1% chitosan. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chitosans ranged from 0.05% to >0.1% depending on the bacteria and Mws of chitosan. As a chitosan solvent, 1% acetic acid was effective in inhibiting the growth of most of the bacteria tested except for lactic acid bacteria that were more effectively suppressed with 1% lactic or formic acids. Antibacterial activity of chitosan was inversely affected by pH (pH 4.5-5.9 range tested), with higher activity at lower pH value.
TI  - Antimicrobial synergistic effect of linolenic acid and monoglyceride against Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect of linolenic acid with or without monoglyceride (glycerol laurate or glycerol myristate) against six food-borne microorganisms was determined in broth medium. Minimum inhibitory concentration of linolenic acid on Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus was 20 and 50 ppm, respectively. The growth of B. cereus treated with linolenic acid at 10 ppm with 10 ppm monoglyceride was more inhibitory than that of linolenic acid alone, and the viable cell population was reduced 2-4 log cycles compared to that of the control. When linolenic acid was added at that level, the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration of extracellular fluid was drastically increased compared with that of the control, and the combined effect with monoglyceride was higher than that with linolenic acid alone. However, the intracellular ATP concentration decreased compared with that of the control. From these results, we concluded that linolenic acid has a strong antimicrobial activity against B. cereus and S. aureus, and that linolenic acid combined with monoglyceride showed stronger antimicrobial activity than using linolenic acid alone.
TI  - The incompatibility between the PlcR- and AtxA-controlled regulons may have selected a nonsense mutation in Bacillus anthracis.
AB  - Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus cereus are members of the Bacillus cereus group. These bacteria express virulence in diverse ways in mammals and insects. The pathogenic properties of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis in mammals results largely from the secretion of non-specific toxins, including haemolysins, the production of which depends upon a pleiotropic activator PlcR. In B. anthracis, PlcR is inactive because of a nonsense mutation in the plcR gene. This suggests that the phenotypic differences between B. anthracis on the one hand and B. thuringiensis and B. cereus on the other could result at least partly from loss of the PlcR regulon. We expressed a functional PlcR in B. anthracis. This resulted in the transcriptional activation of genes weakly expressed in the absence of PlcR. The transcriptional activation correlated with the induction of enzymatic activities and toxins including haemolysins. The toxicity of a B. anthracis PlcR+ strain was assayed in the mouse subcutaneous and nasal models of infection. It was no greater than that of the parental strain, suggesting that the PlcR regulon has no influence on B. anthracis virulence. The PlcR regulon had dramatic effects on the sporulation of a B. anthracis strain containing the virulence plasmid pXO1. This resulted from incompatible interactions with the major AtxA-controlled virulence regulon. We propose that the PlcR-controlled regulon in B. anthracis has been counterselected on account of its disadvantageous effects.
TI  - Enumeration of total bacteria and bacteria with genes for proteolytic activity in pure cultures and in environmental samples by quantitative PCR mediated amplification.
AB  - Real-time quantitative PCR assays were developed for the absolute quantification  of different groups of bacteria in pure cultures and in environmental samples. 16S rRNA genes were used as markers for eubacteria, and genes for extracellular peptidases were used as markers for potentially proteolytic bacteria. For the designed 16S rDNA TaqMan assay, specificity of the designed primer-probe combination for eubacteria, a high amplification efficiency over a wide range of starting copy numbers and a high reproducibility is demonstrated. Cell concentrations of Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens in liquid culture were monitored by TaqMan-PCR using the 16S rDNA target sequence of Escherichia coli as external standard for quantification. Results agree with plate counts and microscopic counts of DAPI stained cells. The significance of 16S rRNA operon multiplicity to the quantification of bacteria is discussed.Furthermore, three sets of primer pair together with probe previously designed for targeting different classes of bacterial extracellular peptidases were tested for their suitability for TaqMan-PCR based quantification of proteolytic bacteria. Since high degeneracy of the probes did not allow accurate quantification, SybrGreen was used instead of molecular probes to visualize and quantify PCR products during PCR. The correlation between fluorescence and starting copy number was of the same high quality as for the 16S rDNA TaqMan assay for all the three peptidase gene classes. The detected amount of genes for neutral metallopeptidase of B. cereus, for subtilisin of B. subtilis and for alkaline metallopeptidase of P. fluorescens corresponded exactly to the numbers of bacteria investigated by the 16S rDNA targeting assay. The developed assays were applied for the quantification of bacteria in soil samples.
TI  - Cloning and overexpression of Bacillus cereus penicillin-binding protein 3 gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The pbp3 gene encoding PBP3 of Bacillus cereus was cloned and sequenced. For this purpose, PBP3 was first purified from B. cereus ts-4, and N-terminal amino acid sequences of the peptides obtained from the protease digests of the protein were analyzed. The B. cereus ts-4 pbp3 gene consisted of an open reading frame of 1,986 bp encoding 662 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 73,044 Da. The active site-motifs SXXK, SXN, and KTG are present at the positions 393, 452, and 590, respectively, in the deduced amino acid sequence. The pbp3 structural gene was ligated into the pET17 x b expression vector and pET-pbp3 was constructed. A protein was produced by the cells of E. coli carrying pET-pbp3. The produced protein migrated at about 75 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel and strongly reacted with biotinylated ampicillin.
TI  - Fish chromatophores as cytosensors in a microscale device: detection of environmental toxins and bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Fish chromatophores from Betta splendens are used as the cytosensor element in the development of a portable microscale device capable of detecting certain environmental toxins and bacterial pathogens by monitoring changes in pigment granule distribution. The adaptation of chromatophores to a microscale environment has required the development of enabling technologies to produce miniaturized culture chambers, to integrate microfluidics for sample delivery, to miniaturize image capture, and to design new statistical methods for image analyses. Betta splendens chromatophores were selected as the cytosensor element because of their moderate size, their toleration of close contact, and most importantly, for their responses to a broad range of chemicals and pathogenic bacteria. A miniaturized culture chamber has been designed that supports chromatophore viability for as long as 3 months, and that can be easily transported without damage to the cells. New statistical methods for image analyses have been developed that increase sensitivity and also decrease the time required for detection of significant changes in pigment granule distribution. Betta chromatophores have been tested for their responses to selected pathogenic bacteria and chemical agents. We discuss in detail the aggregation of pigment granules seen when chromatophores are incubated with Bacillus cereus, a common cause of food poisoning. Also described are the more subtle responses of chromatophores to a class of environmental chemical toxins, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. We show that the chromatophores are able to detect the presence of certain polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons at concentrations lower than the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) 550.1 standards.
TI  - The enzymes with benzil reductase activity conserved from bacteria to mammals.
AB  - The diketone compound, benzil is reduced to (S)-benzoin with living Bacillus cereus cells. Recently, we isolated a gene responsible for benzil reduction, and Escherichia coli cells in which this gene was overexpressed transformed benzil to (S)-benzoin. Although this benzil reductase showed high identity to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, enzymological features were unknown. Here, we demonstrated that many B. cereus strains had benzil reductase activity in vivo, and that the benzil reductases shared 94-100% amino acid identities. Recombinant B. cereus benzil reductase produced optically pure (S)-benzoin with NADPH in vitro, and the ketone group distal to a benzene ring was asymmetrically reduced. B. cereus benzil reductase showed 31% amino acid identity to the yeast open reading frame YIR036C protein and 28-30% to mammalian sepiapterin reductases, sharing the seven residues consensus for the SDR family. We isolated the genes encoding yeast YIR036C protein and gerbil sepiapterin reductase, and both recombinant proteins also reduced benzil to (S)-benzoin in vitro. Green fluorescent protein-tagged B. cereus benzil reductase distributed in the bipolar cytoplasm in B. cereus cells. Asymmetric reduction with B. cereus benzil reductase, yeast YIR036C protein and gerbil sepiapterin reductase will be utilized to produce important chiral compounds.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus sake as starter culture in dry sausages.
AB  - One hundred and fifty-two strains of Lactobacillus spp and Micrococcus spp, isolated from dry sausages, were screened for inhibitory activity. Two of the strains assayed of the genus Lactobacillus showed bactericidal activity. They were able to inhibit Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria seeligeri, Listeria innocua, Lactobacillus alimentarius and Lactobacillus bavaricus. The strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella bradford and Salmonella newlands, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens were resistant. Their antimicrobial activity was due to peptides detectable in the culture broths and inactivated by treatment with proteolytic enzymes. Using bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus sake as starter cultures in dry sausages could be promising in the food industry.
TI  - Epidemiologic profiling: evaluating foodborne outbreaks for which no pathogen was isolated by routine laboratory testing: United States, 1982-9.
AB  - The objective was to evaluate foodborne outbreaks of undetermined aetiology by comparing them to pathogen-specific epidemiologic profiles of laboratory-confirmed foodborne outbreaks. National foodborne outbreak data reported to CDC during 1982-9 were categorized by clinico-epidemiologic profiles based on incubation, duration, percent vomiting, fever and vomiting to fever ratio. From the pathogen-specific profiles, five syndromes were developed: a vomiting-toxin syndrome resembling Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus; a diarrhoea-toxin syndrome characteristic of Clostridium perfringens, a diarrhaeogenic Escherichia coli syndrome, a Norwalk-like virus syndrome, and a salmonella like syndrome. Of 712 outbreaks, 624 (87.6%) matched one of five syndromes; 340 (47.8%) matched the Norwalk-like syndrome and 83 (11.7%) matched the salmonella-like syndrome. After combining information on known pathogens and epidemiologic profiles, only 88 (12.4%) outbreaks remained unclassified. Norwalk-like virus outbreaks appear as common as salmonella-like outbreaks. We conclude that profiling can help classify outbreaks, guide investigations and direct laboratory testing to help detect new and emerging pathogens.
TI  - Effects of antibacterial dishwashing liquid on foodborne pathogens and competitive microorganisms in kitchen sponges.
AB  - In response to increasing concern about home hygiene, the use of antibacterial products to reduce microorganisms in kitchen sponges and cleaning cloths is strongly promoted by some producers of detergent for domestic use. The effects of an antibacterial dishwashing liquid on Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus were investigated in a modified suspension test and in used sponges with and without food residues under laboratory conditions. A limited study was conducted in households to assess the efficacy of antibacterial dishwashing liquid as used by the consumer. In the suspension tests, S. aureus and B. cereus were shown to be susceptible to low concentrations of antibacterial dishwashing liquid (0.5%), whereas E. coli and Salmonella Enteritidis maintained their initial numbers for at least 24 h at 25 degrees C. At higher concentrations (2 to 4%), all test organisms decreased to below the detection limit after 24 h. Over a 24-h period, the antibacterial dishwashing liquid did not significantly reduce these organisms in used sponges in which food residues were present. The antibacterial product did not reduce the competitive microorganisms either. Similar results were found for sponges involved in daily household use. The results of this study demonstrate that the antibacterial dishwashing liquid was effective in reducing pathogens in the suspension test but not in the used sponges. This finding indicates that to determine the efficacy of antibacterial products, their use in a household setting must be considered.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activities of indolocarbazoles bearing amino acid residues.
AB  - Three indolocarbazole compounds bearing a tripeptide or a lysine group attached to one of the indole nitrogens via a propylamino chain and two rebeccamycin derivatives bearing a lysine residue on the sugar moiety were synthesised with the aim of improving the binding to DNA and the antiproliferative activities. Four tumour cell lines, from murine L1210 leukemia, human HT29 colon carcinoma, A549 non-small cell lung carcinoma and K-562 leukemia, were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the drugs. Their effects on the cell cycle of L1210 cells and their antimicrobial properties against two Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis, a Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and a yeast Candida albicans were also investigated.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression of Mn(2+)-dependent sphingomyelinase/hemolysin of an aquatic bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain TK4.
AB  - We report here the molecular cloning and expression of a hemolytic sphingomyelinase from an aquatic bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain TK4. The sphingomyelinase gene was found to consist of 1,548 nucleotides encoding 516 amino acid residues. The recombinant 57.7-kDa enzyme hydrolyzed sphingomyelin but not phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, or phosphatidylethanolamine, indicating that the enzyme is a sphingomyelin-specific sphingomyelinase C. The hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by the enzyme was found to be most efficient at pH 8.0 and activated by Mn(2+). The enzyme shows quite a broad specificity, i.e., it hydrolyzed 4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-sphingomyelin with short-chain fatty acids and NBD-sphingosylphosphorylcholine, the latter being completely resistant to hydrolysis by any sphingomyelinase reported so far. Significant sequence similarities were found in sphingomyelinases from Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria ivanovii, and Leptospira interrogans, as well as a hypothetical protein encoded in Chromobacterium violaceum, although the first three lacked one-third of the sequence corresponding to that from the C terminus of the TK4 enzyme. Interestingly, the deletion mutant of strain TK4 lacking 186 amino acids at the C-terminal end hydrolyzed sphingomyelin, whereas it lost all hemolytic activity, indicating that the C-terminal region of the TK4 enzyme is indispensable for the hemolytic activity.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of triclosan-impregnated storage boxes against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus and Shewanella putrefaciens in conditions simulating domestic use.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance has increased over the past decade causing concern for public health. Domestic antimicrobial products containing triclosan (2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenylether), a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent, were introduced in 1997 and have become popular among consumers. Cross-resistance to other antibacterial agents has been suggested as a possible consequence of their widespread use. Triclosan-impregnated plastic storage boxes were tested for activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus and Shewanella putrefaciens in various conditions, including some designed to simulate usual storage conditions. Results showed inhibition up to a factor of 106 of bacteria grown in direct contact with triclosan-impregnated plastic at 30 and 22 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C. Triclosan resistance was not found to increase after repeated exposure in triclosan-impregnated boxes. Further investigation into the effect of triclosan-impregnated products on bacteria will increase understanding of domestic antimicrobial products and implications of their overuse.
TI  - Isolation and expression of a Bacillus cereus gene encoding benzil reductase.
AB  - Benzil was reduced stereospecifically to (S)-benzoin by Bacillus cereus strain Tim-r01. To isolate the gene responsible for asymmetric reduction, we constructed a library consisting of Escherichia coli clones that harbored plasmids expressing Bacillus cereus genes. The library was screened using the halo formation assay, and one clone showed benzil reduction to (S)-benzoin. Thus, this clone seemed to carry a plasmid encoding a Bacillus cereus benzil reductase. The deduced amino acid sequence had marked homologies to the Bacillus subtilis yueD protein (41% identity), the yeast open reading frame YIR036C protein (31%), and the mammalian sepiapterin reductases (28% to 30%), suggesting that benzil reductase is a novel short-chain de-hydrogenases/ reductase.
TI  - Nanoscale powders and formulations with biocidal activity toward spores and vegetative cells of bacillus species, viruses, and toxins.
AB  - Certain formulations of nanoscale powders possess antimicrobial properties. These formulations are made of simple, nontoxic metal oxides such as magnesium oxide (MgO) and calcium oxide (CaO, lime) in nanocrystalline form, carrying active forms of halogens, for example, MgO. Cl2 and MgO. Br2. When these ultrafine powders contact vegetative cells of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, or Bacillus globigii, over 90% are killed within a few minutes. Likewise, spore forms of the Bacillus species are decontaminated within several hours. Dry contact with aflatoxins and contact with MS2 bacteriophage (surrogate of human enterovirus) in water also causes decontamination in minutes.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of two genes encoding chitinases A and B from Bacillus cereus CH.
AB  - Two genes encoding chitinases A and B (chiA and chiB) from Bacillus cereus CH were cloned into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MRF', by using pBluescript II SK+, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. Open reading frames of the chiA and chiB genes encoded distinct polypeptide chains consisting of 360 and 674 amino acid residues, respectively, with calculated molecular sizes of 39,470 and 74,261 Da, respectively. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences with those of other bacterial chitinases revealed that chitinase A consisted of a catalytic domain, while chitinase B consisted of three functional domains, a catalytic domain, a fibronectin type III-like domain, and a cellulose-binding domain. The primary structures of these two proteins were not similar to each other.
TI  - Evaluation of the BacT/Alert automated blood culture system for detecting bacteria and measuring their growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the BacT/Alert automated blood culture system for the detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates, and to determine bacterial growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted units. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apheresis (Cobe Leucocyte Reduction System [LRS]) and pooled buffy coat-derived (Optipress) platelet concentrates (PCs) were tested. Six organisms were used for spiking the PCs: Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Units were inoculated to give a final concentration of approximately equal to 1 and 50 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. On days 0, 2 and 5, BacT/Alert standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles were inoculated with a 5-ml fill volume and bacteria were enumerated. RESULTS: The BacT/Alert Automated blood culture system gave rapid determination times of spiked units, with all positives detected within 48 h and 98.1% detected within 24 h. In general, as the inoculum concentration increased, the detection time decreased. Rapid growth was obtained with all organisms tested except for B. cereus, which failed to grow on four occasions. Bacterial numbers on day 2 ranged from 10(5) to 10(11) CFU/ml and on day 5 ranged from 10(4) to 10(12) CFU/ml. Growth was not significantly greater in leucodepleted units. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed that PCs are an excellent growth medium for bacteria. Rapid and substantial growth was obtained with all organisms under test. Leucodepletion does not appear to enhance bacterial proliferation. The BacT/Alert automated blood culture system could rapidly detect contamination of units. Bacterial screening using an automated blood culture system is therefore a potential option.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of honey against foodborne pathogens as influenced by the presence of hydrogen peroxide and level of antioxidant power.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of honey has been attributed to hydrogen peroxide, which is produced by naturally occurring glucose oxidase, and phenolic compounds, although lethality of and inhibition by these and other components against microorganisms vary greatly, depending on the floral source of nectar. This study was undertaken to compare honeys from six floral sources for their inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella sonnei, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus. A disc assay revealed that development of zones of inhibition of growth depends on the type and concentration of honey, as well as the test pathogen. Growth of B. cereus was least affected. The inhibition of growth of S. sonnei, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus in 25% solutions of honeys was reduced by treating solutions with catalase, indicating that hydrogen peroxide contributes to antimicrobial activity. Darker colored honeys were generally more inhibitory than light colored honeys. Darker honeys also contained higher antioxidant power. Since antimicrobial activity of the darker colored test honeys was not eliminated by catalase treatment, non-peroxide components such as antioxidants may contribute to controlling the growth of some foodborne pathogens. The antibacterial properties of honeys containing hydrogen peroxide and characterized by a range of antioxidant power need to be validated using model food systems.
TI  - Novel immuno-FRET assay method for Bacillus spores and Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Novel immunofluorescence resonance energy transfer (immuno-FRET) assays for both  Bacillus cereus spores and Escherichia coli O157:H7 are reported. Both assays involve the use of dual (QSY-7 and Oregon Green 514-antibody)-labeled spores or vegetative bacteria, such that Oregon Green 514-labeled antibodies are quenched by proximal QSY-7 molecules that are covalently bound to the dual (Oregon Green 514 and QSY-7)-labeled cells. Upon introduction of unlabeled bacteria or spores, in the respective assays, an increase in fluorescence is observed in proportion to the numbers of unlabeled cells. This is due to migration of Oregon Green 514-labeled antibody from the dual-labeled cells to the unlabeled target cells as verified by fluorescence microscopy. Optimization of the QSY-7 surface density led to a B. cereus spore detection sensitivity of approximately 1.0 x 10(5) to 2.5 x 10(5) spores per milliliter and 3.5 x 10(5) cells per milliliter for E. coli using a conventional cuvette-based spectrofluorometer.
TI  - GerN, an endospore germination protein of Bacillus cereus, is an Na(+)/H(+)-K(+)  antiporter.
AB  - GerN, a Bacillus cereus spore germination protein, exhibits homology to a widely  distributed group of putative cation transporters or channel proteins. GerN complemented the Na(+)-sensitive phenotype of an Escherichia coli mutant that is deficient in Na(+)/H(+) antiport activity (strain KNabc). GerN also reduced the concentration of K(+) required to support growth of an E. coli mutant deficient in K(+) uptake (strain TK2420). In a fluorescence-based assay of everted E. coli KNabc membrane vesicles, GerN exhibited robust Na(+)/H(+) antiport activity, with a K(m) for Na(+) estimated at 1.5 mM at pH 8.0 and 25 mM at pH 7.0. Li(+), but not K(+), served as a substrate. GerN-mediated Na(+)/H(+) antiport was further demonstrated in everted vesicles as energy-dependent accumulation of (22)Na(+). GerN also used K(+) as a coupling ion without completely replacing H(+), as indicated by partial inhibition by K(+) of H(+) uptake into right-side-out vesicles loaded with Na(+). K(+) translocation as part of the antiport was supported by the stimulatory effect of intravesicular K(+) on (22)Na(+) uptake by everted vesicles and the dependence of GerN-mediated (86)Rb(+) efflux on the presence of Na(+) in trans. The inhibitory patterns of protonophore and thiocyanate were most consistent with an electrogenic Na(+)/H(+)-K(+) antiport. GerN-mediated Na(+)/H(+)-K(+) antiport was much more rapid than GerN-mediated Na(+)/H(+) antiport.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of traditional Australian medicinal plants.
AB  - Fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional Australian Aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and four Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. In a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. B. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. Extracts from the leaves of Eremophila species (Myoporaceae) were the most active, with Eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against Gram-positive bacteria). The antibacterial effects of E. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for B. cereus, E. faecalis and S. aureus and 2 h for S. pyogenes.
TI  - [Determination of the antibacterial and antiviral activity of the essential oil from Minthostachys verticillata (Griseb.) Epling].
AB  - The in vitro antiviral activity of the essential oil from Minthostachys verticillata was investigated against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PrV). The viral inhibition was assayed employing viral plaque reduction assay. The antiviral activity of the essential oil specifically affects PrV and HSV-1 multiplication, since it was found that non toxic effects on cells were observed at the concentrations assayed. The therapeutic index values were 10.0 and 9.5 for HSV-1 and PrV, respectively. The antibacterial activity was studied using a diffusion assay and the broth tube dilution method. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to inhibition by plant essential oil than the gram-negative bacteria. The essential oil of M. verticillata was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) technique. Of the six components identified in the volatile oil, pulegone (44.56%) and menthone (39.51%) were the major constituents. The antimicrobial activity can be explained to some extent by the presence of pulegone. Results suggest that further investigations concerning the isolation of the substance responsible for the antimicrobial activity and an effort to define the mechanisms of action are warranted.
TI  - Isolation and bioactivities of constitutents of the roots of Garcinia atroviridis.
AB  - Two new prenylated compounds, the benzoquinone atrovirinone (1) and the depsidone atrovirisidone (2), were isolated from the roots of Garcinia atroviridis. Their structures were determined on the basis of the analysis of spectroscopic data. While compound 2 showed some cytotoxicity against HeLa cells, both compounds 1 and 2 were only mildly inhibitory toward Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Minor cytotoxic and antibacterial compounds from the rhizomes of Amomum aculeatum.
AB  - A new cytotoxic 1,7-dioxa-dispiro[5.1.5.2]pentadeca-9,12-dien-11-one derivative,  aculeatin D, and a new alkenone, 5-hydroxy-hexacos-1-en-3-one, have been isolated as minor compounds from the rhizomes of Amomum aculeatum. Their structures have been determined mainly by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Aculeatin D showed high cytotoxicity against the KB and the L-6 cell line with IC(50) of 0.38 microg/ml and 1 microg/ml, respectively. Additionally, it revealed remarkable activity against two Plasmodium falciparum strains, as well as against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma cruzi. 5-Hydroxy-hexacos-1-en-3-one exhibited neither cytotoxic nor antiprotozoal activity, whereas antibacterial testing against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed moderate to strong activity for both compounds.
TI  - Class II broad-spectrum mercury resistance transposons in Gram-positive bacteria  from natural environments.
AB  - We have studied the mechanisms of the horizontal dissemination of a broad-spectrum mercury resistance determinant among Bacillus and related species. This mer determinant was first described in Bacillus cereus RC607 from Boston Harbor, USA, and was then found in various Bacillus and related species in Japan, Russia and England. We have shown that the mer determinant can either be located at the chromosome, or on a plasmid in the Bacillus species, and is carried by class II mercury resistance transposons: Tn5084 from B. cereus RC607 and B. cereus VKM684 (ATCC10702) and Tn5085 from Exiguobacterium sp. TC38-2b. Tn5085 is identical in nucleotide sequence to TnMERI1, the only other known mer transposon from Bacillus species, but it does not contain an intron like TnMERI1. Tn5085 is functionally active in Escherichia coli. Tn5083, which we have isolated from B. megaterium MK64-1, contains an RC607-like mer determinant, that has lost some mercury resistance genes and possesses a merA gene which is a novel sequence variant that has not been previously described. Tn5083 and Tn5084 are recombinants, and are comprised of fragments from several transposons including Tn5085, and a relative of a putative transposon from B. firmus (which contains similar genes to the cadmium resistance operon of Staphylococcus aureus), as well as others. The sequence data showed evidence for recombination both between transposition genes and between mer determinants.
TI  - An enzymatic assay for quantifying sphingomyelin in tissues and plasma from humans and mice with Niemann-Pick disease.
AB  - Sphingomyelin is an important lipid component of cell membranes and lipoproteins  which can be hydrolyzed by sphingomyelinases into ceramide and phosphorylcholine. The type A and B forms of Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) are lipid storage disorders due to the deficient activity of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase, and the resultant accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells and tissues. In this paper we report a new, enzyme-based method to quantify the levels of sphingomyelin in tissues and plasma of normal individuals and NPD patients. The method utilizes sphingomyelinase from Bacillus cereus to completely hydrolyze the sphingomyelin into ceramide. Quantification of the sphingomyelin-derived ceramide is accomplished using Escherichia coli diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase and [gamma-(32)P]ATP. The resulting [(32)P]ceramide is quantified using a phosphor-imager system following TLC separation. This procedure allowed quantification of sphingomyelin over a broad range from 10 pmol to 1 nmol. To validate this assay we quantified sphingomyelin in plasma and tissues obtained from normal and NPD mice and humans. The sphingomyelin content in adult homozygous (-/-) or heterozygous (+/-) NPD mouse plasma was significantly elevated compared to that of normal mice (up to twofold). Moreover, the accumulated sphingomyelin in the tissues of NPD mice was 4 to 40 times higher than that in normal mice depending on the tissue analyzed. The sphingomyelin levels in plasma from several type B NPD patients also were significantly elevated compared to normal individuals of the same age. Based on these results we propose that this new, enzyme-based procedure can provide sensitive and reproducible sphingomyelin quantification in tissues and fluids from normal individuals and NPD patients. It could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of NPD and the evaluation of NPD treatment protocols, as well as for the study of ceramide-mediated apoptosis since the method provides the simultaneous determination of sphingomyelin and ceramide in the same lipid extract.
TI  - Inhibition tests for detection and presumptive identification of tetracyclines, beta-lactam antibiotics and quinolones in poultry meat.
AB  - A combination of three plates, seeded with strains of Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus or Escherichia coli, can be used for detection of residues of beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. The sensitivity of each plate is optimal for only one of these groups, resulting in detection limits (LOD) lower than the corresponding maximum residue limits (MRL) and in distinct inhibition patterns typical for each antibiotic family. Beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin G, ampicillin and amoxicillin give only inhibition zones on the plate with M. luteus. Tetracyclines are detected up to the MRL level with B. cereus, and fluoroquinolones with E. coli. The LODs of the antibiotics tested were as follows: penicillin G (PENG) 0.9 ng, ampicillin (AMPI) 0.6 ng and amoxicillin (AMOX) 1.0 ng on the plate with M. luteus; tetracycline (TET) 4 ng, oxytetracycline (OXY) 3 ng, doxycycline (DOX) 0.6 ng, and chlortetracycline (CHL) 0.3 ng on the plate with B. cereus; enrofloxacin (ENRX) 1.5 ng, ciprofloxacin (CIPX) 0.5 ng and flumequine (FLUM) 1.5 ng on the plate with E. coli. The combination of plates enables the laboratory to select appropriate chromatographic techniques for identification and quantification of the residues. On the other hand, the three groups can also be detected on one plate seeded with Bacillus subtilis, although the limits of detection are higher: PENG 0.4 ng, AMPI and AMOX 3 ng, TET 5 ng, OXY 8 ng, DOX 1 ng, CHL 0.5 ng, ENRX 4 ng, CIPX 10 ng and FLUM 4 ng. The test was applied to 228 broiler fillets and to 27 turkey thighs, originating from different poultry slaughterhouses. Nineteen broiler fillets contained inhibiting substances. The positive results of the inhibition tests were confirmed with a chromatographic technique. Doxycycline residues were found in 16 samples and amoxicillin in two.
TI  - Foodborne diseases in Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the occurrence of foodborne disease outbreaks in Kenya and the efforts employed to combat them. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Forty two districts in Kenya between 1970 and 1993. STUDY SUBJECTS: Foodborne disease outbreak episodes due to Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listera monocytogenes, chemicals, aflatoxin, plant and animal poisons. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and aetiological causes of foodborne disease outbreaks reported in the study period. RESULTS: Thirty seven food poisoning outbreaks were reported to the Ministry of Health from various parts of the country in the study period 1970 to 1993, and only 13 of these involving a total of 926 people were confirmed to be due to particular aetiological agents. Foods that were involved included milk and milk products, meat and meat products, maize flour, bread, scones and other wheat products, vegetables and lemon pie pudding. A high number of food poisoning cases were treated as outpatients in various health facilities. CONCLUSION: Under-reporting, inadequate investigation of outbreaks and inadequate diagnostic facilities suggest that foodborne disease outbreaks are more than is recorded by the Ministry of Health.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Rapid detection and identification of bacterial strains by Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy.
AB  - The use of Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy and multivariate pattern recognition techniques for the rapid detection and identification of bacterial contamination in liquids was evaluated. The complex biochemical composition of bacteria yields FT-NIR vibrational transitions (overtone and combination bands) that can be used for classification and identification. Bacterial suspensions (Escherichia coli HB101, E. coli ATCC 43888, E. coli 1224, Bacillus amyloliquifaciens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria innocua) were filtered to harvest the cells and eliminate the matrix, which has a strong NIR signal. FT-NIR measurements were done using a diffuse reflection-integrating sphere. Principal component analysis showed tight clustering of the bacterial strains at the information-rich spectral region of 6000-4000 cm(-1). The method reproducibly distinguished between different E. coli isolates and conclusively identified the relationship between a new isolate and one of the test species. This methodology may allow for the rapid assessment of potential bacterial contamination in liquids with minimal sample preparation.
TI  - Cloning of maltase gene from a methylotrophic yeast, Hansenula polymorpha.
AB  - The Hansenula polymorpha maltase structural gene (HPMAL1) was isolated from a genomic library by hybridization of the library clones with maltase-specific gene probe. An open reading frame of 1695 nt encoding a 564 amino-acid protein with calculated molecular weight of 65.3 kD was characterized in the genomic DNA insert of the plasmid p51. The protein sequence deduced from the HPMAL1 exhibited 58 and 47% identity with maltases from Candida albicans and Saccharomyces carlsbergesis encoded by CAMAL2 and MAL62, respectively, and 44% identity with oligo-alpha-1,6-glucosidase from Bacillus cereus. The recombinant Hansenula polymorpha maltase produced in Escherichia coli hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (PNPG), sucrose, maltose and alpha-methylglucoside and did not act on melibiose, cellobiose, trehalose and o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG). The affinity of the recombinant enzyme for its substrates increased in the order maltose <alpha-methylglucoside <sucrose <PNPG. Southern analysis revealed presence of a single maltase gene in H. polymorpha. This is the first report on the maltase gene sequence from a methylotrophic yeast.
TI  - Microbiological survey of retail herbs and spices from Mexican markets.
AB  - In the present study, 304 samples of herbs and spices (garlic powder, cumin seeds, black pepper, oregano, and bay leaves) widely used in Mexico were analyzed for the presence of Bacillus cereus, Salmonella Typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Escherichia coli, total and fecal coliforms, total mesophilic aerobic organisms, and fungi. Samples were nonpackaged or packaged in polyethylene bags or glass containers. High levels (10(5) to 10(7) CFU/g) of mesophilic aerobic microorganisms were found in most of the samples of garlic powder, cumin seed, and black pepper. Lower levels (<102 CFU/g) were found in oregano and bay leaves. Total and fecal coliforms counts were dependent on the type of packaging. More than 70% of the polyethylene-packaged samples had less than 10(3) CFU/g of microorganisms. Glass and nonpackaged spices showed lower levels of these microorganisms. B. cereus was present in 32 samples of which most were polyethylene packaged. The other pathogenic bacteria were not detected. Aspergillus niger was detected in 29% of the samples, Rhizopus sp. in 19%, and Penicillum sp. and Cunninghamella in 8%.
TI  - Bioactivity studies of extracts from Tridax procumbens.
AB  - An updated review on the biological activity of Tridax procumbens is presented. A detailed biological screening comprised of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi using crude extracts of this plant was undertaken. The n-hexane extract of the flowers showed activity against Escherichia coli. The same extract of the whole aerial parts was active against Mycobacterium smegmatis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella group C and Salmonella paratyphi. The ethyl-acetate extract of the flowers was active against Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella sp. The aerial parts extract also showed activity only against Mycobacterium smegmatis and Staphylococcus aureus, while the aqueous extract showed no antimicrobial activity. None of the tested extracts was active against the yeasts, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Rhodotorula rubra; or the fungi: Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Mucor sp. and Trichophyton rubrum.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of Thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of Thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. Among 3790 isolates (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus mutans DTMU 1, Strep. salivarius DTMU 1, Strep. sanguis DTMU 1, Candida albicans ATCC 13803 and C. albicans DTMU 2, as well as the oral pathogens. These antimicrobial isolates included L17 and N14 which showed the antibacterial activity, D14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and D6 and N8 which showed both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. The isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. They could utilize casein but could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. Their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by pH, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. The activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at pH > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees C. However, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. When the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. The final identification revealed that D6, D14 and N14 were Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and L17 and N8 were Lact. rhamnosus.
TI  - Synthesis and biological studies of some benzopyran.
AB  - 3-Chlorobenzopyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole (2) was prepared and reacted with sodium azide to give compound 3, whereas its reaction with benzoyl hydrazide, ethyl glycinate, anthranilic acid or o-phenylenediamine afforded the products 4-7, respectively. Compounds 8 and 9 were synthesized by the reaction of compound 2 with 2-mercaptobenzothiazole or piperidine. 3-Hydrazinobenzopyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole (10) was obtained and subjected to cyclization with different reagents such as CS2, benzoic acid, acetyl acetone and diethyl malonate to give compounds 11-14, respectively. Compound 10 was cyclized also with phenacyl cyanide, ylidenemalononitriles to afford the products 15-20, respectively. On the other hand, compound 10 was cyclized with 3-[bis(methylthio)methylene]pentane-2,4-dione or 1,1-dicyano 2,2-dimethylthioethylene to give the corresponding compounds 22 and 23 which in turn were reacted with some compounds containing active methylene groups to afford the corresponding compounds 24-27, respectively. The biological activities of someselected compounds were given.
TI  - The synergistic effect of excimer and low-pressure mercury lamps on the disinfection of flowing water.
AB  - Microorganisms in flowing water were disinfected by UV radiation from two excimer (excited dimer) lamps (emitting at 172 and 222 nm) in combination with two low-pressure mercury lamps (emitting at 254 nm). Synergies were investigated among the three types of radiation in the treatment of water spiked in turn with Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Shewanella putrefaciens, and spores of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus. Synergy was demonstrated between radiations at 222 and 254 nm in the treatment of E. coli, L. innocua, and S. putrefaciens, but little or no synergy was observed in the treatment of B. subtilis and B. cereus. At maximum flow rates (60 liters/min), 5-log reductions in E. coli were achieved at 254 nm, although at 222 nm, less than 1-log reductions were observed. No bacterial kill was observed with 172-nm radiation alone, despite increasing exposure time by reducing flow rates to less than 3 liters/min.
TI  - Efficacy of electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) and chemically modified water on different types of foodborne pathogens.
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) and chemically modified water with properties similar to the EO water for inactivation of different types of foodborne pathogens (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus). A five-strain cocktail of each microorganism was exposed to deionized water (control), EO water and chemically modified water. To evaluate the effect of individual properties (pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and residual chlorine) of treatment solutions on microbial inactivation, iron was added to reduce ORP readings and neutralizing buffer was added to neutralize chlorine. Inactivation of E. coli O157:H7 occurred within 30 s after application of JAW EO water with 10 mg/l residual chlorine and chemically modified solutions containing 13 mg/l residual chlorine. Inactivation of Gram-positive and -negative microorganisms occurred within 10 s after application of ROX EO water with 56 mg/l residual chlorine and chemically modified solutions containing 60 mg/l residual chlorine. B. cereus was more resistant to the treatments than E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes and only 3 log10 reductions were achieved after 10 s of ROX EO water treatment. B. cereus spores were the most resistant pathogen. However, more than 3 log10 reductions were achieved with 120-s EO water treatment.
TI  - Microbiological hazard identification and exposure assessment of street food vending in Johannesburg, South Africa.
AB  - One hundred and thirty-two samples of beef, chicken, salad and gravy were collected from two street vendors over eleven replicate surveys to assess microbiological safety and quality. For each food type samples were collected during preparation and holding. Dish water was also collected and food preparation surfaces swabbed during preparation and display. Standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts, Enterobacteriaceae counts, coliform counts and spore counts. Six hundred and seventy-five predominant colonies were isolated from aerobic plate counts of all samples and characterised. The incidence of selected foodborne bacterial pathogens and non-pathogenic E. coli 1 was also determined. In most cases mean bacterial counts of the raw materials were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of corresponding cooked foods. No significant differences (P > 0.05) in all count types were observed between food samples collected during cooking and those collected during holding. In addition, no significant differences (P > 0.05) in all count types were observed between prepared salads and their raw materials. Mean bacterial counts of water and swab samples collected from vendor 1 were lower than those of water and swab samples collected from vendor 2.The predominant populations isolated from the aerobic plate counts were Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae and Alcaligenes spp. Bacillus cereus was detected in 17%, Clostridium perfringens in 1%, Staphylococcus aureus in 3% and Vibrio metchnikovii in 2% of the food samples. Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were not detected. Non-pathogenic E. coli 1 was detected in 13% of food samples, in 86 and 36% of dish water samples collected from vendors 1 and 2, respectively, and in 36% of surface swab samples from vendor 2.
TI  - Human cell exposure assays of Bacillus thuringiensis commercial insecticides: production of Bacillus cereus-like cytolytic effects from outgrowth of spores.
AB  - Most contemporary bioinsecticides are derived from scaled-up cultures of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (Bti) and kurstaki (Btk), whose particulate fractions contain mostly B. thuringiensis spores (> 10(12)/L) and proteinaceous aggregates, including crystal-like parasporal inclusion bodies (PIB). Based on concerns over relatedness to B. cereus-group pathogens, we conducted extensive testing of B. thuringiensis (BT) products and their subfractions using seven human cell types. The Bti/Btk products generated nonspecific cytotoxicities involving loss in bioreduction, cell rounding, blebbing and detachment, degradation of immunodetectable proteins, and cytolysis. Their threshold dose (Dt approximately equal.5 times 10(-14)% BT product/target cell) equated to a single spore and a target cell half-life (tLD(50)) of approximately 16 hr. At Dts > 10(4), the tLD(50) rapidly shifted to < 4 hr; with antibiotic present, no component, including PIB-related [delta]-endotoxins, was cytolytic up to an equivalent of approximately 10(9 )Dt. The cytolytic agent(s) within the Bti/Btk-vegetative cell exoprotein (VCP) pool is an early spore outgrowth product identical to that of B. cereus and acting possibly by arresting protein synthesis. No cytolytic effects were seen with VCP from B. subtilis and Escherichia coli. These data, including recent epidemiologic work indicate that spore-containing BT products have an inherent capacity to lyse human cells in free and interactive forms and may also act as immune sensitizers. To critically impact at the whole body level, the exposure outcome would have to be an uncontrolled infection arising from intake of Btk/Bti spores. For humans, such a condition would be rare, arising possibly in equally rare exposure scenarios involving large doses of spores and individuals with weak or impaired microbe-clearance capacities and/or immune response systems.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of rosemary extracts.
AB  - A rosemary extract commercially exploited (Oxy'less) as an antioxidant of lipids  in foods was dissolved in ethanol (100 mg/ml), and the solution was tested against foodborne microorganisms. For gram-positive bacteria, the MIC of the ethanolic solution was 1% for Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 0.5% for Listeria monocytogenes, 0.5% for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.13% for Streptococcus mutans, and 0.06% for Bacillus cereus. It slowed the growth of Penicillium roquefortii and Botrytis cinerea. Up to 1% of the ethanolic solution had no activity on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Erwinia carotovora and on the yeasts Rhodotorula glutinis and Cryptococcus laurentii. Antibacterial activity of the rosemary extract was strongly influenced by the composition of the media. The MIC was reduced by low pH, high NaCl contents, and low temperatures. Low pH and high NaCl concentration had a synergistic effect on the MIC of the rosemary extract for S. aureus. Lipids, surface-active agents, and some proteins decreased its antibacterial activity, whereas pectin had no effect. The inhibitory effect was little modified by heat treatment (100 degrees C). The natural microflora of pasteurized zucchini broth was inhibited by 0.5% of the rosemary extract. The antibacterial activity was linked to the compounds extracted with hexane, which are presumably phenolic diterpenoids.
TI  - Structural model requirements to describe microbial inactivation during a mild heat treatment.
AB  - The classical concept of D and z values, established for sterilisation processes, is unable to deal with the typical non-loglinear behaviour of survivor curves occurring during the mild heat treatment of sous vide or cook-chill food products. Structural model requirements are formulated, eliminating immediately some candidate model types. Promising modelling approaches are thoroughly analysed and, if applicable, adapted to the specific needs: two models developed by Casolari (1988), the inactivation model of Sapru et al. (1992), the model of Whiting (1993), the Baranyi and Roberts growth model (1994), the model of Chiruta et al. (1997), the model of Daughtry et al. (1997) and the model of Xiong et al. (1999). A range of experimental data of Bacillus cereus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Lactobacillus sake are used to illustrate the different models' performances. Moreover, a novel modelling approach is developed, fulfilling all formulated structural model requirements, and based on a careful analysis of literature knowledge of the shoulder and tailing phenomenon. Although a thorough insight in the occurrence of shoulders and tails is still lacking from a biochemical point of view, this newly developed model incorporates the possibility of a straightforward interpretation within this framework.
TI  - New developments in chromogenic and fluorogenic culture media.
AB  - This review describes some recent developments in chromogenic and fluorogenic culture media in microbiological diagnostic. The detection of beta-D-glucuronidase (GUD) activity for enumeration of Escherichia coli is well known. E. coli O157:H7 strains are usually GUD-negative and do not ferment sorbitol. These characteristics are used in selective media for these organisms and new chromogenic media are available. Some of the new chromogenic media make the Salmonella diagnostic easier and faster. The use of chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates for detection of beta-D-glucosidase (beta-GLU) activity to differentiate enterococci has received considerable attention and new media are described. Rapid detection of Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus are other application of enzyme detection methods in food and water microbiology.
TI  - Characterization of reutericyclin produced by Lactobacillus reuteri LTH2584.
AB  - Lactobacillus reuteri LTH2584 exhibits antimicrobial activity that can be attributed neither to bacteriocins nor to the production of reuterin or organic acids. We have purified the active compound, named reutericyclin, to homogeneity and characterized its antimicrobial activity. Reutericyclin exhibited a broad inhibitory spectrum including Lactobacillus spp., Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria innocua. It did not affect the growth of gram-negative bacteria; however, the growth of lipopolysaccharide mutant strains of Escherichia coli was inhibited. Reutericyclin exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Staphylococcus aureus, and B. subtilis and triggered the lysis of cells of L. sanfranciscensis in a dose-dependent manner. Germination of spores of B. subtilis was inhibited, but the spores remained unaffected under conditions that do not permit germination. The fatty acid supply of the growth media had a strong effect on reutericyclin production and its distribution between producer cells and the culture supernatant. Reutericyclin was purified from cell extracts and culture supernatant of L. reuteri LTH2584 cultures grown in mMRS by solvent extraction, gel filtration, RP-C(8) chromatography, and anion-exchange chromatography, followed by rechromatography by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Reutericyclin was characterized as a negatively charged, highly hydrophobic molecule with a molecular mass of 349 Da. Structural characterization (A. Holtzel, M. G. Ganzle, G. J. Nicholson, W. P. Hammes, and G. Jung, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 39:2766-2768, 2000) revealed that reutericyclin is a novel tetramic acid derivative. The inhibitory activity of culture supernatant of L. reuteri LTH2584 corresponded to that of purified as well as synthetic reutericyclin.
TI  - Application of 2 microbioassays for evaluating the pollution present in the Xochimilco and Lerma-Santiago basins.
AB  - Pollution due to urban-agricultural and urban-industrial activities, on the enzymatic activity of two microorganisms was evaluated. The zones under study are located in the Caltongo "embarcadero", in Xochimilco, D.F., and the basin of Lerma-Santiago river, State of Mexico. Nine and ten stations were established, respectively. Samples of water and sediment were taken, in order to determine their pH, salinity, organic matter, as well as the toxic effect produced on Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase activity and on Bacillus cereus hydrogenase activity. Fecal coliforms and anionic detergents were quantified on the water samples. A correlation analysis was applied to results of chemical variables and microbiotest performed. In Xochimilco were found six stations over 50% of inhibition of the enzymatic activities evaluated, in Lerma-Santiago were only four stations. The correlation coefficient found was between -0.95 and 0.53. In general, the zones under study showed a pollution degree and toxic effect moderate, as well as a minimum correlation between chemical variables and the response of microorganisms used as indicators.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of new arylamido derivatives of 6 beta-aminopenicillanic, 7 beta-aminocephalosporanic and 7 beta-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acids.
AB  - New semisynthetic penicillins and cephalosporins have been synthesized by acylation of 6 beta-aminopenicillanic, 7 beta-aminocephalosporanic and 7 beta-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acids with ortho-substituted aromatic acids, using the method of mixed anhydrides. The chemical structures of the compounds obtained were confirmed by elemental analysis and by IR- and 1H-NMR spectra. Antibacterial activities of the compounds were determined by the macrodilution susceptibility test in brain-heart infusion broth. Test organisms producing beta-lactamases: Bacillus subtilis L2, Bacillus subtilis HB2, Bacillus cereus 30, Bacillus subtilis 6633 ATCC, Bacillus mycoides 924; Staphylococcus aureus 1/45 "Oxford" as Gram-positive bacteria, and Escherichia coli 111, Escherichia coli K12/F- inverted question marklac-/, Escherichia coli K12/F- inverted question marklambda-/, Escherichia coli K12/F- inverted question marklambda- inverted question marklac+/ as Gram-negative bacteria. In general, the derivatives of 6 beta-aminopenicillanic acid were more active than 7 beta-aminocephalosporanic and 7 beta-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid derivatives. Among all the compounds synthesized 6 beta-[4'-(dimethylamino)-azobenzene-2-amido]penicillanic acid and 6 beta-(N-phenylanthranilamido)penicillanic acid showed the best activity and were with the broadest spectrum of action.
TI  - Cytotoxic cardenolides and antibacterial terpenoids from Crossopetalum gaumeri.
AB  - From the methanol extract of the roots of (Crossopetalum gaumeri, four new highly cytotoxic cardenolides, securigenin-3beta-O-beta-6-deoxyguloside (2), 19-hydroxy-sarmentogenin-3beta-O-beta-6-deoxyguloside (4), sarmentogenin-3beta-O-[alpha-allosyl-(1-->4)-beta-6-deoxy alloside] (5), and securigenin-3beta-O-[alpha-allosyl-(1-->4)-beta-6-deoxyal loside] (6) were isolated. The dichloromethane extract afforded the new diterpene 3,15-dihydroxy-18-norabieta-3,8,11,13-tetraene (7) as well as the new triterpene 2,3,7-trihydroxy-6-oxo-1,3,5(10),7-tetraene-24-nor-friedelane-29-o ic acid methylester (11). The new terpenoids lack cytotoxicity and the antibacterial activity is moderate to low.
TI  - Investigating expression systems for the stable large-scale production of recombinant L-leucine-dehydrogenase from Bacillus cereus in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The established Escherichia coli expression vectors ptrc99a, pKK223-3, pPLlambda, pAsk75, pRA95, and pRA96, which differ in copy number, mode of induction, selection marker, and use of par sequences for stabilization, were investigated for the stable expression of recombinant L-leucine dehydrogenase from Bacillus cereus with a view to large-scale production. Best results were achieved with pIET98, a runaway-replication system derived from pRA96. Expression of L-leucine dehydrogenase was controlled by its constitutive B. cereus promoter and depended on host strain, cultivation temperature, induction time, and media composition. After cell cultivation at 30 degrees C and shifting to 41 degrees C to induce plasmid replication, E. coli BL21[pIET98] yielded 200 U LeuDH/mg protein, which corresponds to >50% of the soluble cell protein. Continuous cultivation in a semisynthetic high-cell-density medium verified structural and segregational stability over 100 generations in the absence of a selection pressure.
TI  - Molecular cloning, overproduction and characterization of the Bacillus cereus IMP dehydrogenase.
AB  - The gene of IMP dehydrogenase of Bacillus cereus ts-4, a temperature-sensitive mutant of B. cereus JCM 2152, was subcloned and its sequence was analyzed. A B. cereus ts-4 DNA fragment of 2,065 bp containing the entire impdh gene and flanking regions was sequenced. The fragment contained an open reading frame of 1,527 bp encoding 509 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 55,390 Da. The impdh sequence of JCM 2152 was also analyzed by TA cloning using PCR products amplified with primers from B. cereus ts-4 impdh gene. The gene amplified by PCR was expressed in Escherichia coli using a pET17 x b expression plasmid. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the overproduced enzyme was identified as Met-Trp-Glu-Ser-Lys-Phe-Val-Lys-Glu-Gly-Leu-Thr-Phe-AspAsp-Val-Leu -Leu-Val- Pro. The overproduced enzyme was eluted at a molecular mass of about 225 kDa by gel filtration. The molecular mass of the subunit was estimated to be 56 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The overproduced enzyme was active against IMP, IDP, and ITP, and showed the highest activity at pH 9.5. These properties of the recombinant enzyme were almost identical to those of IMP dehydrogenase of B. cereus.
TI  - Kombucha fermentation and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Kombucha was prepared in a tea broth (0.5% w/v) supplemented with sucrose (10% w/v) by using a commercially available starter culture. The pH decreased steadily from 5 to 2.5 during the fermentation while the weight of the "tea fungus" and the OD of the tea broth increased through 4 days of the fermentation and remained fairly constant thereafter. The counts of acetic acid-producing bacteria and yeasts in the broth increased up to 4 days of fermentation and decreased afterward. The antimicrobial activity of Kombucha was investigated against a number of pathogenic microorganisms. Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella sonnei, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Yersinia enterolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermis, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Helicobacterpylori, and Listeria monocytogenes were found to be sensitive to Kombucha. According to the literature on Kombucha, acetic acid is considered to be responsible for the inhibitory effect toward a number of microbes tested, and this is also valid in the present study. However, in this study, Kombucha proved to exert antimicrobial activities against E. coli, Sh. sonnei, Sal. typhimurium, Sal. enteritidis, and Cm. jejuni, even at neutral pH and after thermal denaturation. This finding suggests the presence of antimicrobial compounds other than acetic acid and large proteins in Kombucha.
TI  - Lupene-type triterpenes from Periploca aphylla.
AB  - Two new lupane derivatives, 3beta,6alpha-dihydroxylup-20(29)-ene (1) and 6alpha-hydroxylup-20(29)-en-3beta-octadecanoate (2), have been isolated from the stems of Periploca aphylla, in addition to beta-sitosterol and lupeol. The structures of 1 and 2 were determined by spectral and chemical methods. Compound 1 showed strong inhibition of alpha-glucosidase type VI and a moderate antibacterial activity.
TI  - Structure and absolute configuration of new acetylenic compounds isolated from cultures of Clitocybe catinus.
AB  - Investigations of the extracts of a culture of Clitocybe catinus gave rise to the isolation of new acetylenic diols 1-3. Their structure was determined on the basis of 1H- and 13C-NMR evidence and the absolute configuration elucidated by means of the modified Mosher's method.
TI  - Triterpene saponins from the fruits of Hedera helix.
AB  - Six triterpene saponins, including two new compounds, were isolated from the fruits of Hedera helix L. (Araliaceae). The structures of the new compounds, named helixosides A and B, were established as 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl hederagenin 28-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester, and 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl oleanolic acid 28-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester, respectively, on the basis of chemical and spectral data.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of some new non-proteinogenic amino acids containing thiazole residues.
AB  - Some new thioamides and thiazoles have been synthesized using canavanine, S-cysteine, homo-S-cysteinesulfonamides and their N-omega aminoethylated derivatives as adducts in order to investigate the structure-antimicrobial activity relationships. The compounds showed substantial antibacterial activity in vitro against various gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus etc.) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris etc.) bacteria. These findings indicate that the presence of the thiazole residue is an essential factor for the antibacterial effect.
TI  - [Prevalence of bacterial contamination of standard platelet units: prospective study].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet concentrates contaminated with bacteria are a main source of transfusion-associated sepsis. Several studies have reported a very wide incidence (0-10%) of contamination. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of bacterial contamination of standard platelet units at the regional blood transfusion center in Casablanca. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: During 15.5 months, 3,458 platelet concentrates (PCs) were analysed. The plasma from the bag and the tube was homogenised. One-fifth of the tube contents were inoculated every day for five days in two tubes containing 2.5 mL of Tryptic soy broth. One tube was incubated at room temperature and the other at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. The bacteria were identified by standard procedures. RESULTS: Twenty-five (0.72%) of 3,458 platelet bags were contaminated. Twenty-two bacteria (88%) were found in the platelet bags stored three days or more, of which 14 (56%) were Staphylococci coagulase negative, two Staphylococcus aureus, one alpha-haemolytic Streptococcus, four bacillus cereus, one Enterobacter cloacae, one Escherichia Coli and two Xanthomonas maltophilia. CONCLUSION: The incidence reported in this series is higher than that reported by most authors.
TI  - Biological screening of Brazilian medicinal plants.
AB  - In this study, we screened sixty medicinal plant species from the Brazilian savanna ("cerrado") that could contain useful compounds for the control of tropical diseases. The plant selection was based on existing ethnobotanic information and interviews with local healers. Plant extracts were screened for: (a) molluscicidal activity against Biomphalaria glabrata, (b) toxicity to brine shrimp (Artemia salina L.), (c) antifungal activity in the bioautographic assay with Cladosporium sphaerospermum and (d) antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion assay against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Forty-two species afforded extracts that showed some degree of activity in one or more of these bioassays.
TI  - Production of recombinant L-leucine dehydrogenase from Bacillus cereus in pilot scale using the runaway replication system E. coli[pIET98].
AB  - A method for the production of recombinant L-leucine dehydrogenase from Bacillus  cereus in pilot scale is described employing the temperature induced runaway replication vector pIET98 and the Escherichia coli host strain BL21. Fed-batch cultivation using a semi-synthetic high-cell densitiy medium was adjusted in 5-L scale to yield a constant growth rate of 0,17 h(-1) and a final cell concentration of 27 g dry weight/L by exponentially increasing the nutrient supply. Runaway replication and thus, LeuDH expression was induced during the feeding phase by increasing the cultivation temperature to 41 degrees C yielding a specific enzyme activity of 110 U/mg, which corresponds to 30% of the soluble cell protein. The cultivation was terminated when the dissolved oxygen content fell below 10% saturation. The final volume activity was 600,000 U/L cultivation. No change in growth, cell density, or expression activity was observed scaling up the cultivation volume to 200 L. Thus, 120,000,000 units L-leucine dehydrogenase were obtained from one cultivation. The purification of L-leucine dehydrogenase to homogeneity was carried out by heat denaturation, liquid-liquid extraction, gel filtration, and anion-exchange chromatography to give pure enzyme in 65% yield. The integrity of the recombinant enzyme was tested measuring the molecular weight and determining the N-terminal amino acid sequence.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - An algorithm for automated bacterial identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.
AB  - An algorithm for bacterial identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry is being developed. This mass spectral fingerprint comparison algorithm is fully automated and statistically based, providing objective analysis of samples to be identified. Based on extraction of reference fingerprint ions from test spectra, this approach should lend itself well to real-world applications where samples are likely to be impure. This algorithm is illustrated using a blind study. In the study, MALDI-MS fingerprints for Bacillus atrophaeus ATCC 49337, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579T, Escherichia coli ATCC 33694, Pantoea agglomerans ATCC 33243, and Pseudomonas putida F1 are collected and form a reference library. The identification of test samples containing one or more reference bacteria, potentially mixed with one species not in the library (Shewanella alga BrY), is performed by comparison to the reference library with a calculated degree of association. Out of 60 samples, no false positives are present, and the correct identification rate is 75%. Missed identifications are largely due to a weak B. cereus signal in the bacterial mixtures. Potential modifications to the algorithm are presented and result in a higher than 90% correct identification rate for the blind study data, suggesting that this approach has the potential for reliable and accurate automated data analysis of MALDI-MS.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Gene cloning, nucleotide sequencing, and purification and characterization of the D-stereospecific amino-acid amidase from Ochrobactrum anthropi SV3.
AB  - The gene encoding the D-stereospecific amino-acid amidase from Ochrobactrum anthropi SV3 was cloned and sequenced. Analysis of 7.3 kb of genomic DNA revealed the presence of six ORFs, one of which (daaA) encodes the D-amino-acid amidase. This enzyme, DaaA, is composed of 363 amino-acid residues (molecular mass 40 082 Da), and the deduced amino-acid sequence exhibits homology to alkaline D-peptidase from Bacillus cereus DF4-B (32% identity), DD-peptidase from Streptomyces R61 (29% identity), and other penicillin-recognizing proteins. The DaaA protein contains the typical SXXK, YXN, and H(K)XG active-site motifs identified in the penicillin-binding proteins and beta-lactamases. The daaA gene modified in the nucleotide sequence upstream from its start codon was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The activity of the recombinant DaaA enzyme in cell-free extracts of E. coli was 33.6 U. mg-1 with D-phenylalaninamide as substrate, which is about 350-fold higher than in extracts of O. anthropi SV3. This enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation and three column chromatography steps. On gel-filtration chromatography, DaaA appeared to be a monomer with a molecular mass of 40 kDa. It had maximal activity at 45 degrees C and pH 9.0, and was completely inactivated in the presence of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride or Zn2+. DaaA had hydrolyzing activity toward D-amino-acid amides with aromatic or hydrophobic side chains, but did not act on the substrates for the DD-peptidase and beta-lactamase, despite their sequence similarity to DaaA. The characteristics of the recombinant DaaA are similar to those found for the native enzyme partially purified from O. anthropi SV3.
TI  - Characterization of VIM-2, a carbapenem-hydrolyzing metallo-beta-lactamase and its plasmid- and integron-borne gene from a Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate in France.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa COL-1 was identified in a blood culture of a 39-year-old-woman treated with imipenem in Marseilles, France, in 1996. This strain was resistant to beta-lactams, including ureidopenicillins, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and meropenem, but remained susceptible to the monobactam aztreonam. The carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene of P. aeruginosa COL-1 was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli DH10B. The deduced 266-amino-acid protein was an Ambler class B beta-lactamase, with amino acid identities of 32% with B-II from Bacillus cereus; 31% with IMP-1 from several gram-negative rods in Japan, including P. aeruginosa; 27% with CcrA from Bacteroides fragilis; 24% with BlaB from Chryseobacterium meningosepticum; 24% with IND-1 from Chryseobacterium indologenes; 21% with CphA-1 from Aeromonas hydrophila; and 11% with L-1 from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. It was most closely related to VIM-1 beta-lactamase recently reported from Italian P. aeruginosa clinical isolates (90% amino acid identity). Purified VIM-2 beta-lactamase had a pI of 5.6, a relative molecular mass of 29.7 kDa, and a broad substrate hydrolysis range, including penicillins, cephalosporins, cephamycins, oxacephamycins, and carbapenems, but not monobactams. As a metallo-beta-lactamase, its activity was zinc dependent and inhibited by EDTA (50% inhibitory concentration, 50 microM). VIM-2 conferred a resistance pattern to beta-lactams in E. coli DH10B that paralleled its in vitro hydrolytic properties, except for susceptibility to ureidopenicillins, carbapenems, and cefepime. bla(VIM-2) was located on a ca. 45-kb plasmid that in addition conferred resistance to sulfamides and that was not self-transmissible either from P. aeruginosa to E. coli or from E. coli to E. coli. bla(VIM-2) was the only gene cassette located within the variable region of a novel class 1 integron, In56, that was weakly related to the bla(VIM-1)-containing integron. VIM-2 is the second carbapenem-hydrolyzing metalloenzyme characterized from a P. aeruginosa isolate outside Japan.
TI  - A novel spore peptidoglycan hydrolase of Bacillus cereus: biochemical characterization and nucleotide sequence of the corresponding gene, sleL.
AB  - The exudate of germinated spores of B. cereus IFO 13597 in 0.15 M KCl-50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) contained a spore-lytic enzyme which has substrate specificity for fragmented spore cortex from wild-type organisms (cortical-fragment-lytic enzyme [CFLE]), in addition to a previously characterized germination-specific hydrolase which acts on intact spore cortex (spore cortex-lytic enzyme [SCLE]) (R. Moriyama, S. Kudoh, S. Miyata, S. Nonobe, A. Hattori, and S. Makino, J. Bacteriol. 178:5330-5332, 1996). CFLE was not capable of degrading isolated cortical fragments from spores of Bacillus subtilis ADD1, which lacks muramic acid delta-lactam. This suggests that CFLE cooperates with SCLE in cortex hydrolysis during germination. CFLE was purified in an active form and identified as a 48-kDa protein which functions as an N-acetylglucosaminidase. Immunochemical studies suggested that the mature enzyme is localized on a rather peripheral region of the dormant spore, probably the exterior of the cortex layer. A gene encoding the enzyme, sleL, was cloned in Escherichia coli, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The gene encodes a protein of 430 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 48,136. The N-terminal region contains a repeated motif common to several peptidoglycan binding proteins. Inspection of the data banks showed no similarity of CFLE with N-acetylglucosaminidases found so far, suggesting that CFLE is a novel type of N-acetylglucosaminidase. The B. subtilis genome sequence contains genes, yaaH and ydhD, which encode putative proteins showing similarity to SleL.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase.
AB  - Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase, a C-P bond-cleaving enzyme which utilizes an unusual bicovalent catalytic strategy, has been crystallized by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method using PEG 4000 as the precipitant. The crystals belong to the monoclinic system and belong to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 210.5, b = 45.5, c = 64.7 A, beta = 105.0 degrees. The asymmetric unit contains a dimer related by a non-crystallographic dyad. In addition to a 2.7 A native data set, the following data sets have been collected: a 2.4 A data set from crystals complexed with the intermediate analog vinyl sulfonate, a 3.0 A three-wavelength MAD data set from crystals complexed with the product analog WO(4)(2-), as well as several heavy-atom data sets to 3.0 A or better, of which only three have proven useful for MIR calculations. Examination of the native Patterson map revealed NCS that made previously uninterpretable derivative data useful. Independent phase sets were first calculated and refined for the MAD and MIR experiments separately and were then combined. The combined phase set was further improved by solvent flattening, histogram matching and NCS averaging. Interpretation of the resulting electron-density map is currently under way.
TI  - Effect of L-glucose and D-tagatose on bacterial growth in media and a cooked cured ham product.
AB  - Cured meats such as ham can undergo premature spoilage on account of the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria. This spoilage is generally evident from a milkiness in the purge of vacuum-packaged sliced ham. Although cured, most hams are at more risk of spoilage than other types of processed meat products because they contain considerably higher concentrations of carbohydrates, approximately 2 to 7%, usually in the form of dextrose and corn syrup solids. Unfortunately, the meat industry is restricted with respect to the choice of preservatives and bactericidal agents. An alternative approach from these chemical compounds would be to use novel carbohydrate sources that are unrecognizable to spoilage bacteria. L-Glucose and D-tagatose are two such potential sugars, and in a series of tests in vitro, the ability of bacteria to utilize each as an energy source was compared to that of D-glucose. Results showed that both L-glucose and D-tagatose are not easily catabolized by a variety of lactic bacteria and not at all by pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Yersinia enterocolitica. In a separate study, D-glucose, L-glucose, and D-tagatose were added to a chopped and formed ham formulation and the rate of bacterial growth was monitored. Analysis of data by a general linear model revealed that the growth rates of total aerobic and lactic acid bacteria were significantly (P < 0.05) slower for the formulation containing D-tagatose than those containing L- or D-glucose. Levels of Enterobacteriaceae were initially low and these bacteria did not significantly (P < 0.20) change in the presence of any of the sugars used in the meat formulations. Compared to the control sample containing D-glucose, the shelf life of the chopped and formed ham containing D-tagatose at 10 degrees C was extended by 7 to 10 days. These results indicate that D-tagatose could deter the growth of microorganisms and inhibit the rate of spoilage in a meat product containing carbohydrates.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Orobanche cernua extract.
AB  - The effect of the parasitic plant Orobanche cernua extract was evaluated on 5 different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Dilution experiments show that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; microgram/ml) of the extract was as follows: Staphylococcus aureus-1526.5; Streptococcus sp.-3125; Streptococcus pyogenes-25,000 and both for Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli-50,000 micrograms/ml. Data indicated that the MIC of 3125 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) and tobromycin (10 micrograms) activity against Streptococcus sp. and S. aureus, respectively; 25,000 and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) activity against S. pyogenes and B. cereus, respectively, and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to nalidixic acid (30 micrograms) activity against E. coli. It can be concluded that the O. cernua extract displays remarkable activity against some Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus.
TI  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of Turkish medicinal plants.
AB  - A total of 76 extracts from 35 plants available in the Turkish flora were assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activities against five pathogenic bacteria and a yeast. Sixteen crude extracts from eight plant species were found to possess an activity against at least one or more test microorganisms. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the most active crude extracts was also carried out with the most active extracts. Activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Candida albicans (yeast) is discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial Effects of Propolis Extracts on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus Strains Resistant to Various Antibiotics and Some Microorganisms.
AB  - ABSTRACT Propolis is collected by worker honey bees from the trees. The bees pack propolis on their hind legs, carry it to their colony, and use it as a sterilant in the hive. Propolis has also been used by humans since early times for various purposes and, especially, as a medicine because of its antimicrobial properties. In this study, antimicrobial effects of propolis samples on three Escherichia coli and two Staphylococcus aureus strains that are multiresistant to antibiotics and on Salmonella typhimurium, Bruceila abortus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, Candida tropicalis, and Aspergillus niger were studied. Propolis extracts were prepared with acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). At concentrations of 10 and 25 ml, propolis extracts affected all of the microorganisms in acetone and DMSO in concentrations of 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 ppm. The results detected in this in vitro study provided evidence that propolis may be used as an antimicrobial agent against many microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of turmeric oil: a byproduct from curcumin manufacture.
AB  - Curcumin, the yellow color pigment of turmeric, is produced industrially from turmeric oleoresin. The mother liquor after isolation of curcumin from oleoresin contains approximately 40% oil. The oil was extracted from the mother liquor using hexane at 60 degrees C, and the hexane extract was separated into three fractions using silica gel column chromatography. These fractions were tested for antibacterial activity by pour plate method against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fraction II eluted with 5% ethyl acetate in hexane was found to be most active fraction. The turmeric oil, fraction I, and fraction II were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. ar-Turmerone, turmerone, and curlone were found to be the major compounds present in these fractions along with other oxygenated compounds.
TI  - RT-PCR: characterization of long multi-gene operons and multiple transcript gene  clusters in bacteria.
AB  - Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR is a valuable tool widely used for analysis of gene expression. In bacteria, RT-PCR is helpful beyond standard protocols of northern blot RNA/DNA hybridization (to identify transcripts) and primer extension (to locate their start points), as these methods have been difficult with transcripts that are low in abundance or unstable, similar to long multi-gene operons. In this report, RT-PCR is adapted to analyze transcripts that form long multi-gene operons--where they start and where they stop. The transcripts can also be semiquantitated to follow the expression of genes under different growth conditions. Examples using RT-PCR are presented with two different multi-gene systems for metal cation resistance to silver and mercury ions. The silver resistance system [9 open reading frames (ORFs); 12.5 kb] is shown by RT-PCR to synthesize three nonoverlapping messenger RNAs that are transcribed divergently. In the mercury resistance system (8 ORFs; 6.3 kb), all the genes are transcribed in the same orientation, and two promoter sites produce overlapping transcripts. For RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase enzyme is used to synthesize first-strand cDNA that is used as a template for PCR amplification of single-gene products, from the beginning, middle or end of long multi-gene, multi-transcript gene clusters.
TI  - Microbiological quality and safety of ready-to-eat street-vended foods in Johannesburg, South Africa.
AB  - Fifty-one ready-to-eat street foods, 18 dishwater, and 18 surface swab samples were collected from six vendors in Johannesburg, South Africa. Food temperatures were recorded at the time of sampling. Standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts (APCs), spore counts (SCs), and Enterobacteriaceae counts (ECs) for food samples as well as coliform counts (CCs) for water and swab samples. In addition, Petrifilm Escherichia coli count (PC) plates were used for the enumeration of coliforms in food, water, and swab samples. The presence of selected foodborne pathogens in the food samples as well as the presence of nonpathogenic E. coli 1 (in food and water samples) was also tested for. Predominant colonies isolated from APC plates were characterized to the genus level. Holding temperatures for cooked meats and gravies ranged from 42.0 to 94.0 degrees C, and those for uncooked salads ranged from 29.0 to 39.0 degrees C. Mean APC values of 3.4 (+/-0.4) log CFU/g, 4.0 (+/-1.2) log CFU/ml, and 2.1 (+/-0.4) log CFU/25 cm2 were obtained for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. Mean SC values of 1.6 (+/-0.2) log CFU/g and 1.5 (+/-0.3) log CFU/25 cm2 were obtained for food and swab samples, respectively. A mean EC value of 2.0 (+/-0.4) log CFU/g for food samples and mean CC values of 2.5 (+/-0.3) log CFU/ml and 1.3 (+/-0.3) log CFU/25 cm2 for water and swab samples, respectively, were determined. Mean PC values of 1.6 (+/-0.1) log CFU/g, 1.9 (+/-0.6) log CFU/ml, and 1.4 (+/-0.4) log CFU/25 cm2 were determined for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. Bacillus cereus was detected in 22%, Clostridium perfringens in 16%, Salmonella spp. in 2%, and E. coli (non-O157:H+) in 2% of the 51 food samples. E. coli was found in 14 water samples (78%) and in 3 food samples (6%). Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica were also tested for in the food samples, but they were not detected. The 340 isolates obtained from APC plates for food, water, and swab samples were predominantly Bacillus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. for all three sample types. It was concluded that the foods analyzed in this study were of acceptable quality and safety.
TI  - Mercury resistance in Bacillus cereus RC607: transcriptional organization and two new open reading frames.
AB  - The chromosomal mercury resistance determinant of Bacillus cereus RC607 confers resistance to inorganic mercury and to organomercurials. The order of genes in the completed mercury resistance determinant is operator-promoter 1 (O/P1) merR1 merT open reading frame 3 (ORF3) ORF4 merA O/P2 merR2 merB2 merB1. The previously undetermined 1-kb DNA sequence between the merA and merB1 genes includes two significant ORFs, whose predicted protein products are homologous with MerR (the transcriptional regulator) and MerB (the organomercurial lyase enzyme). Two transcriptional start sites (promoters), O/P1 at the beginning of the determinant and O/P2 immediately upstream of the sixth ORF, the newly identified merR2, were mapped by reverse transcriptase (RT) primer extension. A long 6.3-kb mRNA traversing all eight ORFs was shown by RT-PCR. Growth sensitivity measurements in liquid media and cellular mercury volatization assays characterized inducibility and differences in functional activity in B. cereus RC607 and after cloning of the mer determinant into plasmids in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of several parts of Pinus brutia, Juniperus oxycedrus, Abies cilicia, Cedrus libani and Pinus nigra.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activities of several parts of various trees grown in the Kahramanmaras region of Turkey were investigated by the disc diffusion method. Chloroform, acetone and methanol extracts of leaves, resins, barks, cones and fruits of Pinus brutia Ten., Juniperus oxycedrus L., Abies cilicia Ant. & Kotschy Carr., Cedrus libani A. Rich. and Pinus nigra Arn. were prepared and tested against Bacillus megaterium DSM 32, Bacillus subtilis IMG 22, Bacillus cereus FMC 19, Escherichia coli DM, Klebsiella pneumoniae FMC 3, Enterobacter aerogenes CCM 2531, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, Mycobacterium smegmatis RUT, Proteus vulgaris FMC 1, Listeria monocytogenes Scoot A, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 5007, Candida albicans CCM 314, Candida tropicalis MDC 86 and Penicillium italicum K. The results showed that antifungal effects were not observed for the whole extracts, E. coli was not inhibited by any of the plant extracts except by the chloroform and acetone extracts of the leaves of A. cilicia, which showed inhibition zones of 16-18 mm, respectively. All the plant extracts used in this study inhibited the development of the other bacteria studied. When the results of this study were compared with an ampicillin standard, it was found that the microorganisms studied were generally susceptible, intermediate or resistant to the extracts of species when compared with the ampicillin standard. On the other hand, the acetone and methanol extracts of Juniperus fruits were found to be quite resistant.
TI  - Changing epidemiology of infections in patients with neutropenia and cancer: emphasis on gram-positive and resistant bacteria.
AB  - Over the past 3 decades, considerable changes have occurred in the types of bacteria causing infection in febrile patients with neutropenia and cancer. Twenty years ago, gram-negative bacteria caused approximately 70% of bloodstream infections. As a probable consequence of long-dwelling intravascular devices, fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, and high-dose chemotherapy-induced mucositis, there has been a shift toward gram-positive coccal bacteremia. In most centers today, approximately 70% of bacteremic isolates are gram-positive cocci. Of potential concern is that antimicrobial-resistant gram-positive organisms are becoming increasingly frequent in patients with neutropenia. Fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli are being isolated from several cancer centers. Several "new" organisms, such as Stomatococcus mucilaginosus, Bacillus cereus, Leuconostoc species, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Rhodococcus species, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Moraxella catarrhalis, Burkholderia cepacia, and Bartonella species, now cause infections in these patients. Careful application of infection-control principles, judicious prophylaxis, appropriate evaluation of new antibiotics, and prompt effective therapy will maximize benefits for these patients.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity in vitro of new amino acids and peptides containing thiazole and oxazole moieties.
AB  - 2-(Pyrrolidinyl)thiazole-4-carboxylic acid 5d, 2-(1-aminoalkyl)thiazole-4-carboxamides and hydrazides 8, 10 have been synthesized using alanine, valine, and proline as educts. In addition oxazole amino acids derived from leucine 20a and alanine 20b and some peptides 13, 14, 16 containing the 5-ring heterocyclic backbone modifications have been prepared. The thiazole and oxazole containing amino acids and peptides showed moderate antibacterial activity in vitro against various Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, etc.) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Protens vulgaris, etc.) bacteria, fungi (Candida albicans), and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisae, etc.).
TI  - Binding of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C to phospholipid interfaces, determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer.
AB  - Dissociation constants for binding of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus (bcPI-PLC) and the mammalian phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-delta(1) to lipid interfaces containing phosphoinositol, phosphocholine, and phosphomethanol head groups were determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Dansyl-labeled lipid probes were used as acceptors, with intrinsic tryptophan of the enzyme as the donor. Titration of protein into lipid provided data from which K(d) and N, the limiting number of lipid molecules per protein bound, were calculated by non-linear regression analysis of exact binding equations. These results were compared with apparent K(m) values from kinetic data. K(d) values in the low microM range in terms of lipid monomers or low nM range in terms of binding sites were calculated with good fits of experimental data to theoretical binding curves. bcPI-PLC binds with high affinity to PI interfaces, slightly lower affinity to PC interfaces, and much lower affinity to PM interfaces. The mammalian enzyme also binds with high affinity to PI interfaces, but shows little or no binding with PC interfaces under similar concentration conditions. These K(d) values correlate reasonably with apparent K(m) values from kinetic experiments.
TI  - Bacterial populations associated with a sorghum-based fermented weaning cereal.
AB  - Microbiological surveys, to determine the quality and safety, were conducted on 45 sorghum samples comprising dry powders (n = 15) and corresponding fermented (n = 15) and cooked fermented porridge (n = 15) samples collected from households in an informal settlement of the Gauteng Province of South Africa. Mean aerobic plate counts, Gram-negative counts and bacterial spore counts of sorghum powder samples decreased in fermented and cooked fermented porridge samples. However, mean lactic acid bacteria counts increased in fermented porridge samples, but decreased slightly in cooked fermented porridge samples. The mean pH value of sorghum powder samples decreased in fermented and cooked fermented porridge, respectively. Bacillus (B.) cereus was detected in all 15 sorghum powder samples, while Escherichia (E.) coli was detected in 53%, Clostridium perfringens in 27%, Listeria monocytogenes in 13% and Aeromonas spp., Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella spp. and Yersinia spp., each in 7% of sorghum powder samples. Of the fermented porridge samples, 40% contained B. cereus and 7% contained E. coli. None of the pathogens tested for were detected in cooked fermented porridge samples. B. cereus (53%), B. subtilis (21%), B. thuringiensis (13%), B. licheniformis (10%) and B. coagulans (3%) were identified from 120 isolates randomly selected from spore count plates of the highest dilution showing growth.
TI  - The microbiological quality of cooked rice from restaurants and take-away premises in the United Kingdom.
AB  - The microbiological quality of 4,162 samples of cooked rice from restaurants and  take-away premises in the United Kingdom was examined, including ready-to-eat rice purchased at point-of-sale and rice that was stored precooked for reheating on demand. The majority of point-of-sale cooked rice samples (1,855 of 1,972; 94%) were of acceptable microbiological quality, but 15 (1%) samples were of unacceptable quality (Bacillus spp. and B. cereus, > or = 10(5) CFU/g; Escherichia coli, > or = 10(4) CFU/g), indicating a potential risk to health. The prevalence of Bacillus spp., B. cereus, and E. coli was significantly greater in precooked stored rice than in point-of-sale cooked rice (P < 0.005 to 0.0005). Bacillus spp. (> or = 10(4) CFU/g), B. cereus (> or = 10(4) CFU/g), and E. coli (> or = 10(2) CFU/g) were present in 7%, 2%, and 9% of precooked stored samples, respectively, compared to 2%, 0.5%, and 1%, respectively in point-of-sale samples. Although final heating at the point of sale reduces the levels of microorganisms present in rice it will not inactivate the B. cereus emetic toxin if present. Rice from Indian premises was of poorer microbiological quality than that from Chinese and other premises. Although most point-of-sale cooked rice samples (94%) were of an acceptable microbiological quality, evidence from this study indicates that the microbiological quality of cooked rice sold from certain outlets in the UK is of concern.
TI  - Formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  - Mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. Mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. The morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. Different bacterial strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. The results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by a surface film. The basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane. The membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. The results of this investigation seem to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. This type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.
TI  - An unusual cytochrome o'-type cytochrome c oxidase in a Bacillus cereus cytochrome a3 mutant has a very high affinity for oxygen.
AB  - Bacillus cereus strain PYM1 is a mutant unable to synthesize haem A or spectrally detectable cytochromes aa3 or caa3. The nature of the remaining oxidase(s) catalysing oxygen uptake has been studied. Respiratory oxidase activities and the levels of cytochromes b and c increased 2.6- to 4.2-fold on transition from exponential growth, in either of two media, to sporulation stage III, as previously observed for the parent wild-type strain. NADH oxidase activity at both stages of culture was several-fold higher than ascorbate plus tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) oxidase activity, consistent with the TMPD- phenotype of strain PYM1. Oxidase activity with ascorbate as substrate was significant even in the absence of TMPD as electron mediator, suggesting that the terminal oxidase receives electrons from a cytochrome c. Carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectra of membranes were obtained using various reductants (ascorbate +/- TMPD, NADH, dithionite) and revealed a haemoprotein resembling cytochrome o'. The CO complex of this cytochrome was photodissociable: the photodissociation spectrum (photolysed minus CO-ligated) exhibited a trough at 416 nm and a peak at 436 nm, together with minor features in the alpha/beta region of the spectrum, consistent with the presence of a cytochrome o'-like pigment. CO recombination occurred at -85 to -95 degrees C. No other haemoproteins showing photoreversible CO binding under these conditions were detected. Evidence that this pigment was the oxidase responsible for substrate oxidation was obtained by photodissociating the CO complex at subzero temperatures in the presence of oxygen; this resulted in faster ligand recombination, attributed to oxygen binding, and extensive oxidation of cytochromes c and b. The oxygen affinity of the oxidase was determined by using the deoxygenation of oxyleghaemoglobin as a sensitive reporter of dissociated oxygen concentration. A single oxidase was revealed with a K(m) for oxygen of about 8 nM; this is one of the highest affinities yet reported for a terminal oxidase.
TI  - A quantitative approach for studying the effect of heat treatment conditions on resistance and recovery of Bacillus cereus spores.
AB  - When a bacterial population undergoes an unfavourable transient increase in temperature, a death phase followed by a lag and growth phase are observed for the surviving and cultivable population. The lag phase is of great interest in regard to food safety, but for bacterial spores, very few studies have been carried out on the evolution of lag time versus heat treatment duration. The experiments monitored on spores of two strains of Bacillus cereus showed a biphasic evolution of the lag time for germination of stressed spores with increase in heat treatment duration, at 90 degrees C, 95 degrees C and 100 degrees C and for different recovery conditions in laboratory medium. Initially, the lag time increased with the duration of the thermal stress up to an optimum. Subsequently, the lag time decreased, with increasing stress duration, to a threshold. The evolution of the lag time to germination of surviving spores, under the range of temperature tested, was similar to the evolution of the lag time to growth after mild-temperature treatments observed with vegetative cells of Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes by Breand et al. (1997) [Breand, S., Fardel, G., Flandrois, J.-P., Rosso, L., Tomassone, R., 1997. A model describing the relationship between lag time and mild temperature increase duration. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 38, 157-167]. The mathematical model established from these investigations could also be applied in the case of heat-stressed spores. Moreover, it was observed that there was a significant linear relationship between the D-value and the treatment duration that gave the maximum lag time.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in the environment of food factories processing ready-to-eat fresh vegetables.
AB  - A total of 196 samples were collected from equipment for trimming, washing, slicing, soaking, dehydrating, blending, and packaging and from the floor and air of operation rooms before and after operation in two food factories processing ready-to-eat fresh vegetables located in the suburbs of Tokyo. Heavy contamination determined by an aerobic plate count of >5.0 log CFU/cm2 or ml was observed after operation in most of the samples examined, as were samples taken before operation on the interior surfaces of equipment for washing, slicing, dehydrating, and blending, the surfaces of blades for slicing, and the floor surfaces of operation rooms. From these environmental samples, the coliform group was detected before operation. Although 67 strains of 70 coliforms isolated were nonfecal, three Escherichia coli strains were detected in the surface of the operation room floors and the gloves of employees. Bacillus cereus was isolated from 9 of 86 and 17 of 85 samples examined before and after operation with the number of 2.0 to 3.0 log CFU/cm2 or ml. Listeria spp. were not detected in the environment of the food factories.
TI  - Structure analysis of a class II transposon encoding the mercury resistance of the Gram-positive Bacterium bacillus megaterium MB1, a strain isolated from minamata bay, Japan.
AB  - A unique transposon was found in the chromosome of Bacillus megaterium MB1, a Gram-positive bacterium isolated from mercury-polluted sediments of Minamata Bay, Japan. The transposon region of a 14.5kb DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using a single PCR primer designed from the nucleotide sequence of an inverted repeat of class II transposons. The molecular analysis revealed that the PCR-amplified DNA fragment encodes a transposition module similar to that of Tn21. The transposon also encodes a broad-spectrum mercury resistance region having a restriction endonuclease map identical to that of Bacillus cereus RC607, a strain isolated from Boston Harbor, USA. The result of a phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence of putative resolvase of the transposon showed that the transposon is phylogenetically closer to the transposons of Gram-positive bacteria than those of Gram-negative bacteria. Besides the transposition module and mer operon, the transposon encodes a mobile genetic element of bacterial group II introns between the resolvase gene and mer operon. The intron, however, does not intervene in any exon gene. The discovery of this newly found combination of the complex mobile elements may offer a clue to understanding the horizontal dissemination of broad-spectrum mercury resistance among microbes.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of blaVIM, a new integron-borne metallo-beta-lactamase gene from a Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate.
AB  - Production of a metallo-beta-lactamase activity was detected in a carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate (isolate VR-143/97) from an Italian inpatient at the Verona University Hospital (northern Italy). The metallo-beta-lactamase determinant was isolated from a genomic library of VR-143/97, constructed in an Escherichia coli plasmid vector, by screening for clones with reduced susceptibility to imipenem. Sequencing of the cloned gene revealed that it encoded a new class B beta-lactamase that was named VIM-1. At the sequence level VIM-1 was rather divergent from the other class B enzymes (16.4 to 38.7% identity), overall being more similar to members of subclass B1 including the beta-lactamase II of Bacillus cereus (Bc-II), the Bacteroides fragilis CcrA, the Chryseobacterium meningosepticum BlaB, and the cassette-encoded IMP-1 enzymes. Among these, VIM-1 showed the highest degree of similarity to Bc-II. Similarly to blaIMP, blaVIM was also found to be carried on a gene cassette inserted into a class 1 integron. The blaVIM-containing integron was located on the chromosome of P. aeruginosa VR-143/97, and the metallo-beta-lactamase-encoding determinant was not transferable to E. coli by conjugation. Expression of the integron-borne blaVIM gene in E. coli resulted in a significant decrease in susceptibility to a broad array of beta-lactams (ampicillin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, mezlocillin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefepime, and carbapenems), revealing a very broad substrate specificity of the VIM-1 enzyme.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of ready-to-eat foods and fresh products in retail shops  and food factories.
AB  - Raw vegetables cut for salad, cooked salad, cooked rice, boiled noodles, bean curd, and cooked Japanese foods were purchased in 27 retail shops in Tokyo. Intact vegetables before being processed and ready-to-eat fresh salad products were obtained from two food factories located in the suburbs of Tokyo. Two hundred thirty-eight retail samples, 137 samples of intact vegetables, and 159 samples of fresh products were examined for aerobic plate count (APC), coliforms, Escherichia coli, Listeria spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus. The APC of retail foods were 2.1 to 5.7 log CFU/g, and the range for the coliforms was 0.1 to 2.3 log CFU/g. The APC and coliform values showed that the raw vegetables cut for salad were the most heavily contaminated among the six kinds of ready-to-eat foods examined. Although L. monocytogenes was not detected, two samples of raw vegetables and five kinds of cooked foods yielded Listeria spp. S. aureus was detected in one sample of Japanese cooked food. The APC of the intact vegetables were 2.9 to 7.3 log CFU/g upon arrival and 2.2 to 7.2 log CFU/g after 3 days storage at 10 degrees C. The APC of the fresh products were 3.4 to 7.6 log CFU/g upon arrival and 4.7 to 8.7 log CFU/g after 3 days storage at 10 degrees C. The isolation rates for coliforms were 6.1 to 50% for intact vegetables and 50 to 66.7% for fresh products. E. coli was detected only in the fresh products. B. cereus was isolated from 20.1% (17 of 81) of the intact vegetables and 9.2% (8 of 87) of the fresh products.
TI  - Evaluation of a modified enzymatic test for the detection of tetracyclines in milk.
AB  - The tetracycline galactosidase (TG) test, a new method for the detection of tetracycline residues in raw milk based on the inhibition of beta-galactosidase biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, was previously validated with spiked milk samples. It has now been applied to milk from cows treated with oxytetracycline. In view of the occurrence of false positives, related to highly elevated somatic cell counts (>10(6)/ml), the improved TG test was developed, in which a heating step (80 degrees C, 15 min) preceded the original TG test protocol. A good agreement with other assays (Delvotest SP, the Bacillus cereus microtiter test, the LacTek tetracycline milk screening test, the Charm HVS-8100 tetracycline test) as well as with high-pressure liquid chromatography was obtained. No false negatives were observed with reference to the established maximum residue limit for tetracyclines of 100 microg/kg milk.
TI  - Modeling the inhibitory effects of organic acids on bacteria.
AB  - The inhibitory effect of acids on microbial growth has long been used to preserve foods from spoilage. While much of the effect can be accounted for by pH, it is well known that different organic acids vary considerably in their inhibitory effects. Because organic acids are not members of a homologous series, but vary in the numbers of carboxy groups, hydroxy groups and carbon-carbon double bonds in the molecule, it has typically not been possible to predict the magnitude, or in some cases even the direction, of the change in inhibitory effect upon substituting one acid for another or to predict the net result in food systems containing more than one acid. The objective of this investigation was to attempt to construct a mathematical model that would enable such prediction as a function of the physical and chemical properties of organic acids. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was applied to 11 properties for each of 17 acids commonly found in food systems; this resulted in four significant principal components (PCs), presumably representing fundamental properties of the acids and indicating each acid's location along each of these four scales. These properties correspond to polar groups, the number of double bonds, molecular size, and solubility in non-polar solvents. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for each of eight acids for six test microorganisms were determined at pH 5.25. The MICs for each organism were modeled as a function of the four PCs using partial least squares (PLS) regression. This produced models with high correlations for five of the bacteria (R2 = 0.856, 0.941, 0.968, 0.968 and 0.970) and one with a slightly lower value (R2 = 0.785). Acid susceptible organisms (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Alicyclobacillus) exhibited a similar response pattern. There appeared to be two separate response patterns for acid resistant organisms; one was exhibited by the two lactobacilli studied and the other by E. coli. Predicting the inhibitory effects of the organic acids as a function of their chemical and physical properties is clearly possible.
TI  - Toward functional genomics in bacteria: analysis of gene expression in Escherichia coli from a bacterial artificial chromosome library of Bacillus cereus.
AB  - As the study of microbes moves into the era of functional genomics, there is an increasing need for molecular tools for analysis of a wide diversity of microorganisms. Currently, biological study of many prokaryotes of agricultural, medical, and fundamental scientific interest is limited by the lack of adequate genetic tools. We report the application of the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector to prokaryotic biology as a powerful approach to address this need. We constructed a BAC library in Escherichia coli from genomic DNA of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus cereus. This library provides 5.75-fold coverage of the B. cereus genome, with an average insert size of 98 kb. To determine the extent of heterologous expression of B. cereus genes in the library, we screened it for expression of several B. cereus activities in the E. coli host. Clones expressing 6 of 10 activities tested were identified in the library, namely, ampicillin resistance, zwittermicin A resistance, esculin hydrolysis, hemolysis, orange pigment production, and lecithinase activity. We analyzed selected BAC clones genetically to identify rapidly specific B. cereus loci. These results suggest that BAC libraries will provide a powerful approach for studying gene expression from diverse prokaryotes.
TI  - Synthesis of some new biologically-active coumarin derivatives.
AB  - Coumarin and 6-nitrocoumarin hydrazones (2a,b), respectively, were prepared via the reaction of 2-thiocoumarin (1a,b) derivatives with hydrazine hydrate. The hydrazones were used as key intermediates for the preparation of some benzopyrano[2,3-c]pyrazoles (21-24) through the reaction of different acyl halides and subsequent cyclization in N,N-dimethylaniline. Benzopyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole-3-thione (25a,b) was prepared by the reaction of 1a with CS2 on which some alkylation, acylation and Mannich reactions were studied. Alternative procedures, other reactions and biological activity of some new compounds were given.
TI  - MIC231, a naturally occurring mobile insertion cassette from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Recent dissection of numerous plasmids and transposable elements has given more credence to the modular organization of these genetic and genomic entities. Although many variations on each theme exist, the number of basic functional cassettes is thought to be relatively limited. In this paper, a novel type of mobile cassette is described. A naturally occurring assemblage consisting of two left IS231 ends flanking a D-stereospecific endopeptidase (adp) gene was found in several natural isolates of Bacillus cereus. This 1.9 kb genetic entity was shown to transpose in the presence of IS231A transposase, not only in Escherichia coli but also in Bacillus. The acronym MIC231 is proposed for this mobile insertion cassette trans-activated (teletransposed) by IS231. Using (D-Phe)4 tetrapeptide as substrate, the endopeptidase activity of the MIC231 adp gene could be demonstrated in E. coli and B. subtilis. Interestingly, this D-stereospecific endopeptidase activity was not limited to the original B. cereus isolates but was also detected in all but one of the 69 B. cereus sensu lato strains tested, indicating its important, yet dispensable, biological function. However, inactivation of the MIC231 adp gene in two B. cereus strains did not result in any detectable variation of their activity on (D-Phe)4, suggesting the presence of other distantly related adp gene(s). Thus, although the exact role of MIC231 adp remains elusive, its presence inside a mobile cassette represents the archetype of a novel insertion sequence modular organization.
TI  - Macromolecular antimicrobial glycoprotein, achacin, expressed in a methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.
AB  - A cDNA encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant African snail Achacina fulica Ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rAch) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kDa. Carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rAch was composed of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol N-acetylglucosamine residues. Antimicrobial activity using Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus showed that the rAch had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. The rAch showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rAch inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis in addition to E. coli and S. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus luteus. The rAch was also effective in preventing growth of Vibrio anguillarum and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The results suggested that the rAch had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Preparation, 195Pt NMR spectra and biological activity of platinum (IV) complexes with dipeptides.
AB  - Three dipeptide complexes of the form K[Pt(IV) (dipep) Cl(OH)2] and four dipeptide complexes of the form K[Pt(IV)-(Hdipep)Cl2(OH)2] were newly prepared. The 195 Pt NMR peak of the K[Pt(IV) (dipep)Cl(OH)2] complexes appeared at about 1200 ppm and these chemical shifts were about 3150 ppm downfield compared with those of the K[Pt(II) (dipep) Cl] complexes. The chemical shifts of the K[Pt(IV) (Hdipep) Cl2 (OH)2] complexes were at about 900 ppm, i.e., about 3050 ppm downfield compared with those of the K[Pt(II) (Hdipep)Cl] complexes. The H[Pt(IV) (Hdigly) Cl2(OH)2] and K[Pt(IV) (Hdigly) Cl2(OH)2] complexes inhibited the growth of C. albicans at a more diluted concentration than cisplatin at 1 microgram/ml, but the platinum complexes only weakly inhibited the growth of these cells compared with the cisplatin-inhibited growth of Meth-A and Hep-2 cells at 10 micrograms/ml. These results suggested that the platinum complexes selectively inhibited the growth of fungal cells.
TI  - The role of the non-conserved residue at position 104 of class A beta-lactamases  in susceptibility to mechanism-based inhibitors.
AB  - The role of the non-conserved amino acid residue at position 104 of the class A beta-lactamases, which comprises a highly conserved sequence of amino acids at the active sites of these enzymes, in both the hydrolysis of beta-lactam substrates and inactivation by mechanism-based inhibitors was investigated. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the penPC gene encoding the Bacillus cereus 569/H beta-lactamase I to replace Asp104 with the corresponding Staphylococcus aureus PC1 residue Ala104. Kinetic data obtained with the purified Asp104Ala B. cereus 569/H beta-lactamase I was compared to that obtained from the wild-type B. cereus and S. aureus enzymes. Replacement of amino acid residue 104 had little effect on the Michaelis parameters for the hydrolysis of both S- and A-type penicillins. Relative to wild-type enzyme, the Asp104Ala beta-lactamase I had 2-fold higher Km values for benzylpenicillin and methicillin, but negligible difference in Km for ampicillin and oxacillin. However, kcat values were also slightly increased resulting in little change in catalytic efficiency, kcat/Km. In contrast, the Asp104Ala beta-lactamase I became more like the S. aureus enzyme in its response to the mechanism-based inhibitors clavulanic acid and 6-beta-(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)amido-penicillanic acid sulfone with respect to both response to the inhibitors and subsequent enzymatic properties. Based on the known three-dimensional structures of the Bacillus licheniformis 749/C, Escherichia coli TEM and S. aureus PC1 beta-lactamases, a model for the role of the non-conserved residue at position 104 in the process of inactivation by mechanism-based inhibitors is proposed.
TI  - A novel extracellular diterpenoid with antibacterial activity from the cyanobacterium Nostoc commune.
AB  - A novel extracellular metabolite with an unprecedented diterpenoid skeleton, 8-[(5-carboxy-2-hydroxy)benzyl]-2-hydroxy-1,1,4a,7, 8-pentamethyl-1,2,3,4,4a,6,7,8,8a,9,10,10a-dodecahydrophenanthrene , has been isolated from the culture medium of the terrestrial cyanobacterium Nostoc commune Vaucher (EAWAG 122b) by means of bioguided isolation. The molecule was designated as noscomin. The structure was determined by spectroscopic methods, mainly NMR and mass spectrometry. Noscomin exhibited antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Evaluation of accuracy and repeatability of identification of food-borne pathogens by automated bacterial identification systems.
AB  - The performances of five automated microbial identification systems, relative to  that of a reference identification system, for their ability to accurately and repeatedly identify six common food-borne pathogens were assessed. The systems assessed were the MicroLog system (Biolog Inc., Hayward, Calif.), the Microbial Identification System (MIS; MIDI Inc., Newark, Del.), the VITEK system (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, Mo.), the MicroScan WalkAway 40 system (Dade-MicroScan International, West Sacramento, Calif.), and the Replianalyzer system (Oxoid Inc., Nepean, Ontario, Canada). The sensitivities and specificities of these systems for the identification of food-borne isolates of Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli were determined with 40 reference positive isolates and 40 reference negative isolates for each pathogen. The sensitivities of these systems for the identification of these pathogens ranged from 42.5 to 100%, and the specificities of these systems for the identification of these pathogens ranged from 32.5 to 100%. Some of the systems had difficulty correctly identifying the reference isolates when the results were compared to those from the reference identification tests. The sensitivity of MIS for the identification of S. aureus, B. cereus, E. coli, and C. jejuni, for example, ranged from 47.5 to 72. 5%. The sensitivity of the Microlog system for the identification of E. coli was 72.5%, and the sensitivity of the VITEK system for the identification of B. cereus was 42.5%. The specificities of four of the five systems for the identification of all of the species tested with the available databases were greater than or equal to 97.5%; the exception was MIS for the identification of C. jejuni, which displayed a specificity of 32.5% when it was tested with reference negative isolates including Campylobacter coli and other Campylobacter species. All systems had >80% sensitivities for the identification of Salmonella species and Listeria species at the genus level. The repeatability of these systems for the identification of test isolates ranged from 30 to 100%. Not all systems included all six pathogens in their databases; thus, some species could not be tested with all systems. The choice of automated microbial identification system for the identification of a food-borne pathogen would depend on the availability of identification libraries within the systems and the performance of the systems for the identification of the pathogen.
TI  - Characterization of the mbl determinant and cloning of the spoIIID gene from Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987.
AB  - To examine the transcriptional start site of the putative Bacillus cereus mbl gene, we have cloned and sequenced the upstream region of the previously reported B. cereus mbl determinant, which showed sequence similarity to the mreB morphogene from Escherichia coli. Primer extension analysis revealed the transcriptional start site of mbl to 259 bp upstream of the putative translational start site and showed that the mbl gene was expressed at 3, 6, and 10 h of growth after inoculation. Antibodies against B. cereus Mbl showed that even though mbl mRNA was present in amounts detectable with Northern blot analysis exclusively in the early logarithmic growth phase, the amount of protein was constant during the cell cycle. Immunogold labeling cryo-transmission electron microscopy indicates that B. cereus Mbl is a cytoplasmic protein. The upstream sequence of mbl revealed two open reading frames, spoIIID and orf1. The amino acid sequence of B. cereus SpoIIID is identical to the SpoIIID sequence from Bacillus thuringiensis. Primer extension showed that mbl is not cotranscribed with spoIIID.
TI  - Syntheses and biological activities of rebeccamycin analogues. Introduction of a  halogenoacetyl substituent.
AB  - In the course of structure-activity relationships on rebeccamycin analogues, a series of compounds bearing a halogenoacetyl substituent were synthesized with the expectation of increasing the interaction with DNA, possibly via covalent reaction with the double helix. Two rebeccamycin analogues bearing an acetyl instead of a bromoacetyl substituent were prepared to gain an insight into the role of the halogen atom. The new compounds show very little effect on protein kinase C and no covalent reaction with DNA was detected. However, the drugs behave as typical topoisomerase I poisons, and they are significantly more toxic toward P388 leukemia cells than to P388/CPT5 cells resistant to camptothecin. The introduction of a bromo- or chloro-acetyl substituent does not affect the capacity of the drug to interfere with topoisomerase I either in vitro or in cells. One of the bromoacetyl derivatives, compound 8, is the most cytotoxic rebeccamycin derivative among the hundred of derivatives we have synthesized to date. In addition, we determined the antimicrobial activities against two Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis, and against the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. The effect of the drugs on Candida albicans yeast growth and their anti-HIV-1 activities were also measured.
TI  - Pulsed-light inactivation of food-related microorganisms.
AB  - The effects of high-intensity pulsed-light emissions of high or low UV content on the survival of predetermined populations of Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus were investigated. Bacterial cultures were seeded separately on the surface of tryptone soya-yeast extract agar and were reduced by up to 2 or 6 log10 orders with 200 light pulses (pulse duration, approximately 100 ns) of low or high UV content, respectively (P < 0.001).
TI  - Suitability of the Charm HVS and a microbiological multiplate system for detection of residues in raw milk at EU maximum residue levels.
AB  - In this paper we assessed the suitability of the Charm HVS and a newly developed  microbiological multiplate system as post-screening tests to confirm the presence of residues in raw milk at or near the maximum permissible residue level (MRL). The multiplate system is composed of Bacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis plate at pH 8.0 for detection of beta-lactam antibiotics and tylosin, Bacillus cereus plate at pH 6.0 for detection of tetracyclines, Micrococcus luteus plate at pH 8.0 for detection of macrolides, Bacillus subtilis BGA plate at pH 8.0 for detection of aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-containing plate seeded with B. subtilis BGA at pH 7.0 for detection of sulphonamides, Escherichia coli plate at pH 6.0 for detection of quinolone and polymyxin, and Staphylococcus epidermidis plate at pH 6.0 for detection of novobiocin. For each test plate an action level is proposed in such a way that residues can be detected in raw bulk tank milk at levels near or below the established EU MRLs of beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, macrolides, sulphonamides, colistin, and quinolones. The Charm HVS test used to confirm the presence of tetracycline and macrolide residues gave false-positive results near the EU MRLs. The multiplate system gave valid results. Based on data for raw bulk tank milk samples and the proposed action level for each test plate for suspected samples, we demonstrated that the multiplate system is a reliable post-screening method that can be performed easily and cheaply in microbiological laboratories.
TI  - Contamination of weaning foods: organisms, channels, and sequelae.
AB  - A study was carried out to identify the microbial contaminants of weaning foods in an Egyptian village and the sources of contamination. All 300 households containing infants (< 24 months) were visited. Information regarding food preparation and household sanitation was gathered. Samples of weaning foods (270) were collected and analysed for the presence of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Shigella and parasites. The first two pathogens were detected in 43.7 per cent and 21.4 per cent of samples respectively. The others were not detected in any sample. The risk of contamination by E. coli and B. cereus was significantly associated with the presence of dung and/or refuse in the house, lack of indoor latrine, non-use of latrine by children, weaning foods not freshly prepared, uncovered storage of foods, and the presence of a case of diarrhoea in the house.
TI  - Innate immunity in insects: the role of multiple, endogenous serum lectins in the recognition of foreign invaders in the cockroach, Blaberus discoidalis.
AB  - Unlike vertebrates, insects do not have an Ab-based nonself recognition system, and must rely totally on innate immunity to defend themselves from microbial invaders. The most likely candidates for recognizing foreign material in insects are the lectins, which have already been shown to be important in mammalian innate immunity. The hemolymph of the cockroach, Blaberus discoidalis, contains multiple lectins, designated BDL1, BDL2, BDL3, and GSL (beta-1,3-glucan-specific lectin), two of which, namely BDL1 and GSL, have close similarities to acute phase reactants. These endogenous molecules, as well as Con A, wheat germ agglutinin, and Helix pomatia agglutinin, have been shown to induce an enhanced phagocytic response by B. discoidalis plasmatocytes. This effect is related to the carbohydrates presented on the surface of the microorganism and to the sugar specificities of the lectins. Thus, the mannose-specific lectins, BDL1 and Con A, both increase the phagocytosis of baker's yeast and Escherichia coli, whereas the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine/N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-specific lectins, BDL2, wheat germ agglutinin, and H. pomatia agglutinin, induce the phagocytosis of Bacillus cereus and E. coli. GSL, specific for beta-1,3-glucan, and the N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-specific BDL3, only enhance the phagocytosis of yeast and B. cereus, respectively. Phenylthiourea, an inhibitor of the prophenoloxidase system, caused either total, partial, or no inhibition of the lectin-induced increase in phagocytosis, indicating that this immune enhancement results, in some cases, from at least two closely linked mechanisms. These results show that the endogenous lectins in the cockroach hemolymph are capable of acting as nonself recognition molecules for a wide range of microorganisms, and thus obviate the necessity of Abs in these animals.
TI  - A vector for promoter trapping in Bacillus cereus.
AB  - We constructed a promoter-trap plasmid, pAD123, for Bacillus cereus. This plasmid contains a promoterless gene that encodes a mutant version of the green fluorescent protein, GFPmut3a, that is optimized for fluorescence-activated cell sorting [Cormack, B.P., Valdivia, R.H., Falkow, S., 1996. FACS-optimized mutants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Gene 173, 33-38.]. The plasmid replicates and confers drug resistance in both Escherichia coli and B. cereus. We constructed a library in pAD123, which consists of 29000 clones containing chromosomal DNA from B. cereus strain UW85. A portion of the library (988 clones) was screened for GFP expression in B. cereus UW85 using a 96-well microtiter dish assay. GFP expression was detected by visual inspection with a fluorimager. We identified 21 clones as fluorescing in the initial screen, and further characterized these clones by restriction analysis, sequencing, and quantification of fluorescence intensity. Flow cytometry and cell sorting efficiently separated B. cereus cells expressing GFP from a 10000-fold excess of non-expressing cells. Selected clones provided useful markers to follow B. cereus populations on plant surfaces. Our results indicate that GFP and pAD123 are useful tools for identifying regulatory sequences in Bacillus cereus, and that flow cytometry and cell sorting is a useful method for screening large libraries constructed in this vector.
TI  - In-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam relative to other antibiotics against blood culture isolates.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is an increasing problem in many countries. Accurate locally relevant information is essential for detection and control of emerging resistance and to facilitate choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in the immediate management of seriously ill patients. We have determined the minimum inhibitory concentration of piperacillin/tazobactam for 97 strains of bacteria (55 Enterobacteriaceae, 13 non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, 22 Staphylococcus aureus, 6 Enterococcus faecalis and 1 Bacillus cereus) isolated from blood cultures and compared its activity to that of amoxycillin, co-amoxiclav, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, cefotaxime. The strains were consecutive non-fastidious isolates with the following qualifications: coagulase negative staphylococci and diphtheroids were excluded and the number of Staphylococcus aureus isolates was limited to 12 methicillin-resistant and 10 methicillin-sensitive strains. Multiple isolates of the same species from individual patients were not included. The minimum inhibition concentrations of methicillin, penicillin, teichoplanin and vancomycin were also determined for specific groups of organisms. MICs were determined by the Etest method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) on Mueller Hinton agar. The MICs of appropriate American Type Culture Collection control strains were determined. Based on the interpretative criteria of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (USA), 87 per cent of Gram-negative bacilli were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam compared with amoxycillin 26 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, co-amoxiclav 54 per cent, piperacillin 56 per cent, cefotaxime 69 per cent, ceftazidime 84 per cent, gentamicin 85 per cent and ciprofloxacin 91 per cent. Of all isolates 75 per cent were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, compared with amoxycillin 22 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, piperacillin 41 per cent, co-amoxiclav 52 per cent, cefotaxime 59 per cent, ceftazidime 60 per cent, gentamicin 74 per cent and ciprofloxacin 77 per cent. Two isolates (1 E. coli and 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae) with antibiograms consistent with the relatively new resistance phenomenon of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were identified. The spectrum of activity of piperacillin-tazobactam for empirical antibiotic therapy is significantly greater than that of piperacillin alone and is similar to that of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin.
TI  - A review of analytical methods for the detection of bacterial toxins.
AB  
TI  - Microbiological quality of hot meals served by airlines.
AB  - The microbiological quality of 1,012 hot meals served on aircraft was studied in  1991 to 1994. The material included dishes prepared in 33 countries all over the world. The geometric means of aerobic colony counts and Escherichia coli were significantly lower in breakfasts (P < 0.05) than in main dishes. Pathogenic bacteria were found in 30 samples (3.0%), Bacillus cereus being the most common pathogen. The frequencies of B. cereus and Staphylococcus aureus did not differ between breakfasts and main dishes. Many of the samples exceeded the minimum acceptable microbiological standards recommended by the Association of European Airlines (AEA) for E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella; i.e., 8.2%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. There were considerable differences in aerobic colony counts and E. coli counts between countries where the food was prepared.
TI  - Chemical and bacteriological characteristics of Pichtogalo Chanion cheese and mesophilic starter cultures for its production.
AB  - Sixty-two samples of Pichtogalo Chanion cheese traditionally produced in Crete, a few (3 to 6) days old, were analyzed for some chemical and bacteriological characteristics. The results of physicochemical analyses were as follows: (1) moisture content 61.63% (standard deviation 4.67); (2) fat in dry matter 54.03% (SD 7.73); (3) protein content 14.23% (SD 1.72); (4) salt content 1.02% (SD 0.38); (5) water activity (aw) 0.990 (SD 0.003); and (6) pH 4.36 (SD 0.25). None of the samples yielded Salmonella spp. Listeria monocytogenes and coagulase-positive staphylococci were present in 6.45% of the samples. Bacillus cereus and sulfite-reducing clostridia were isolated from 14.51% and 40.32% of the samples, respectively. High populations of coliforms were determined in the cheese samples. In 11.3% of the samples, Escherichia coli was not detected, while 88.7% of the samples yielded E. coli most probable number levels from 1.32 to 5.66 log10/g. The log10 CFU/g counts of enterococci were 6.89 (SD 0.84), of yeasts 6.79 (SD 0.61), of molds 4.68 (SD 0.69), and of psychrotrophic bacteria 7.63 (SD 0.62). The log10 CFU/g counts of lactic acid streptococci and lactococci were 7.91 (SD 0.68) and of lactobacilli 8.11 (SD 0.65). Lactic acid bacteria, mainly mesophilic, were isolated and confirmed using API 50 CH test trips. A pasteurized mixture of ewe's and goat's milk was made into Pichtogalo Chanion cheese according to standard procedure at 23 degrees C, after the addition of 4% commercial mesophilic starter culture or 2%, 3%, and 4% starter culture of the isolated and confirmed lactic acid bacteria and the addition of rennet. Results of this work indicated that high quality of Pichtogalo Chanion cheese can be produced using a pasteurized mixture of ewe's and goat's milk and 4% (vol/vol) of mesophilic starter culture.
TI  - Current microbiological status of 'health foods' sold in Canada.
AB  - A follow-up survey was conducted across Canada to evaluate the current status of  'health foods' sold in Canada. A total of 1239 sample units of 'health foods' were analysed for a variety of bacteria, including aerobic colony counts (ACC), coliforms, aerobic and anaerobic sporeformers, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus. Results presented indicate that 16.8-18.4% of the 'health foods' exceed ACC guidelines, 16.0-17.8% exceeded coliform guidelines, 35.7% exceeded aerobic sporeformer guidelines, 81.4% exceeded anaerobic sporeformer guidelines, and 9% exceeded B. cereus guidelines. Some ACC were further identified and found to be opportunistic pathogens, including the genera Bacillus, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus. It was concluded that more extensive surveillance of this industry by health officials is needed.
TI  - Clustered proline residues around the active-site cleft in thermostable oligo-1,6-glucosidase of Bacillus flavocaldarius KP1228.
AB  - The gene that coded for a cellular oligo-1,6-glucosidase (dextrin 6-alpha-D-glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.10) in Bacillus flavocaldarius KP1228 (FERM-P9542) cells growing at 51-82 degrees C was expressed in Escherichia coli JM109. The enzyme had a half-life of 10 min at 89.2 degrees C. Purification of the enzyme and its characterization showed that the enzyme was identical with the native one. Its primary structure of 529 residues with a molecular weight of 61,469 deduced from the gene was 40-42% identical to the sequences of less thermostable oligo-1,6-glucosidases from Bacillus cereus ATCC 7064, Bacillus coagulans ATCC 7050, and Bacillus thermoglucosidasius KP1006. Sequence analysis showed that the B. flavocaldarius enzyme shared 14 proline residues at the same positions as in the three other enzymes, and that the B. flavocaldarius enzyme had 22 of 33 additional proline residues (cf. 1/5, 5/10, and 9/18 in the respective counterparts) in three long polypeptides constituting the active-site cleft, which connected the third, fourth, and eighth beta-strands to the corresponding third, fourth, and eighth alpha-helices in the (beta/alpha)8-barrel.
TI  - Biologically active polymers: synthesis and antimicrobial activity of modified glycidyl methacrylate polymers having a quaternary ammonium and phosphonium groups.
AB  - Polymers with antibacterial activity have been synthesized by chemical modification of poly(glycidyl methacrylate). The glycidyl methacrylate was polymerized by the free radical polymerization technique. The poly(glycidyl methacrylate) was hydrolyzed and was chloroacetylated using chloroacetyl chloride. The chloroacetylated product was modified to yield polymers with either quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts. The antimicrobial activity of the modified glycidyl methacrylate polymers has been examined against a variety of test microorganisms by the cut plug and the viable cell counting methods using shake flask of ten times diluted nutrient broth medium. All three polymers obtained were inhibitory to the growth of Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomones aeruginosa, Shigella sp. and Salmonella typhae) and Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and B. cereus) as well as the fungus (Trichophytun rubrum). It was found that the growth inhibitory effect varied according to the structure of the polymer and the composition of the active group and increased with increasing the concentration of the polymer. The tested polymers showed more antimicrobial activity against Gram negative bacteria and the fungus, whereas were less active against Gram positive bacteria.
TI  - Comparative antibacterial and antifungal effects of some phenolic compounds.
AB  - The antimicrobial potential of eight phenolic compounds isolated from olive cake  was tested against the growth of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. The phenolic compounds included p-hydroxy benzoic, vanillic, caffeic, protocatechuic, syringic, and p-coumaric acids, oleuropein and quercetin. Caffeic and protocatechuic acids (0.3 mg/ml) inhibited the growth of E. coli and K. pneumoniae. The same compounds apart from syringic acid (0.5 mg/ml) completely inhibited the growth of B. cereus. Oleuropein, and p-hydroxy benzoic, vanillic and p-coumaric acids (0.4 mg/ml) completely inhibited the growth of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and B. cereus. Vanillic and caffeic acids (0.2 mg/ml) completely inhibited the growth and aflatoxin production by both A. flavus and A. parasiticus, whereas the complete inhibition of the moulds was attained with 0.3 mg/ml p-hydroxy benzoic, protocatechuic, syringic, and p-coumaric acids and quercetin.
TI  - Spectroscopic characterization of a binuclear metal site in Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase II.
AB  - The zinc metalloenzyme beta-lactamase II (betaLII) from Bacillus cereus has been  overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase, and the metal binding properties of recombinant betaLII toward Zn(II) and Co(II) have been studied by fluorescence and activity measurements. The apoenzyme is able to bind two metal ion equivalents, which confer on betaLII its maximum enzymatic efficiency. The enzyme is partially active with one metal ion equivalent. The diCo(II) and a mixed Zn(II)Co(II) derivative of betaLII were obtained and probed by electronic and paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy. In the high-affinity site, the metal is bound to three His residues and a solvent molecule, adopting a tetrahedral geometry. A Cys, a His, and an Asp residue are coordinated to the low-affinity metal site, together with two or three solvent molecules. This coordination polyhedron resembles the binuclear metal site of the Bacteroides fragilis beta-lactamase [Concha, N., Rasmussen, B. A., Bush, K., and Herzberg, O. (1996) Structure 4, 823-836; Carfi, A., Duee, E., Paul-Soto, R., Galleni, M., Frere, J. M., and Dideberg, O. (1998) Acta Crystallogr. D54, 47-57] but differs from that resulting from the X-ray study of betaLII [Carfi, A., Pares, S., Duee, E., Galleni, M., Duez, C., Frere, J. M., and Dideberg, O. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 4914-4921]. These results suggest that this binuclear metal site may be a general feature of metallo-beta-lactamases.
TI  - Insights into the mechanism of catalysis by the P-C bond-cleaving enzyme phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase derived from gene sequence analysis and mutagenesis.
AB  - Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phosphonatase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphonoacetaldehyde to acetaldehyde and inorganic phosphate. In this study, the genes encoding phosphonatase in Bacillus cereus and in Salmonella typhimurium were cloned for high-level expression in Escherichia coli. The kinetic properties of the purified, recombinant phosphonatases were determined. The Schiff base mechanism known to operate in the B. cereus enzyme was verified for the S. typhimurium enzyme by phosphonoacetaldehyde-sodium borohydride-induced inactivation and by site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic lysine 53. The protein sequence inferred from the B. cereus phosphonatase gene was determined, and this sequence was used along with that from the S. typhimurium phosphonatase gene sequence to search the primary sequence databases for possible structural homologues. We found that phosphonatase belongs to a novel family of hydrolases which appear to use a highly conserved active site aspartate residue in covalent catalysis. On the basis of this finding and the known stereochemical course of phosphonatase-catalyzed hydrolysis at phosphorus (retention), we propose a mechanism which involves Schiff base formation with lysine 53 followed by phosphoryl transfer to aspartate (at position 11 in the S. typhimurium enzyme and position 12 in the B. cereusphosphonatase) and last hydrolysis at the imine C(1) and acyl phosphate phosphorus.
TI  - Development of a streptavidin-conjugated single-chain antibody that binds Bacillus cereus spores.
AB  - Control of microorganisms such as Bacillus cereus spores is critical to ensure the safety and a long shelf life of foods. A bifunctional single chain antibody has been developed for detection and binding of B. cereus T spores. The genes that encode B. cereus T spore single-chain antibody and streptavidin were connected for use in immunoassays and immobilization of the recombinant antibodies. A truncated streptavidin, which is smaller than but has biotin binding ability similar to that of streptavidin, was used as the affinity domain because of its high and specific affinity with biotin. The fusion protein gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) with the T7 RNA polymerase-T7 promoter expression system. Immunoblotting revealed an antigen specificity similar to that of its parent native monoclonal antibody. The single-chain antibody-streptavidin fusion protein can be used in an immunoassay of B. cereus spores by applying a biotinylated enzyme detection system. The recombinant antibodies were immobilized on biotinylated magnetic beads by taking advantage of the strong biotin-streptavidin affinity. Various liquids were artificially contaminated with 5 x 10(4) B. cereus spores per ml. Greater than 90% of the B. cereus spores in phosphate buffer or 37% of the spores in whole milk were tightly bound and removed from the liquid phase by the immunomagnetic beads.
TI  - Construction and expression of a bifunctional single-chain antibody against Bacillus cereus p6ores.
AB  - The variable-region genes of monoclonal antibody against Bacillus cereus spores were cloned from mouse hybridoma cells by reverse transcription-PCR. The heavy- and light-chain variable-region genes were connected by a 45-base linker DNA to allow folding of the fusion protein into a functional tertiary structure. For detection of protein expression, a 10-amino-acid strep tag (biotin-like peptide) was attached to the C terminus of recombinant antibody as the reporter peptide. The single-chain antibody construct was inserted into the expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase-T7 promoter expression system. The expressed single-chain antibody was detected on Western blots by using a streptavidin-conjugated enzyme system. This small recombinant antibody fragment (ca. 28,000 Da by calculation) had B. cereus spore binding ability and antigen specificity similar to those of its parent native monoclonal antibody.
TI  - Target range of zwittermicin A, an aminopolyol antibiotic from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Zwittermicin A is a novel antibiotic produced by Bacillus cereus UW85, which suppresses certain plant diseases in the laboratory and in the field. We developed a rapid method for large-scale purification of zwittermicin A and then studied the in vitro activity of zwittermicin A against bacteria, fungi, and protists. Zwittermicin A was highly active against the Oomycetes and their relatives, the algal protists, and had moderate activity against diverse Gram-negative bacteria and certain Gram-positive bacteria as well as against a wide range of plant pathogenic fungi. Zwittermicin A was more active against bacteria and fungi at pH 7-8 than at pH 5-6. When zwittermicin A was combined with kanosamine, another antibiotic produced by B. cereus, the two acted synergistically against Escherichia coli and additively against Phytophthora medicaginis, an Oomycete. The results indicate that there are diverse potential applications of this new class of antibiotic.
TI  - New positive/negative selectable markers for mammalian cells on the basis of Blasticidin deaminase-thymidine kinase fusions.
AB  - Two positive and negative selectable markers were created for use in mammalian cells. They are based on two genes for the resistance to Blasticidin S (BlaS) and on the thymidine kinase (Tk) gene of herpes simplex virus (HSV). The markers can be selected positively by their ability to induce BlaS resistance and negatively on the induced sensitivity towards gancyclovir (GANC). Both constructs are also expressed in Escherichia coli and transfer BlaS resistance to this organism as well, making these markers very suitable for the construction of shuttle vectors.
TI  - Studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  - The specific growth rates of Brochothrix thermosphacta, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the Food MicroModel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a Td, r = specific growth rate; T = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). The exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. A microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. The d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. The temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for B. thermosphacta and Y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as B. cereus, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and S. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the d-value of C. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. The values of parameter a of the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. For all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. The lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. The change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. The influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in Chinese sausages. The d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of Enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from MRS cultures was 2.36. In refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. In this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.
TI  - Syntheses and biological evaluation of indolocarbazoles, analogues of rebeccamycin, modified at the imide heterocycle.
AB  - A series of 10 indolocarbazole derivatives, analogues to the antitumor antibiotic rebeccamycin, bearing modifications at the imide heterocycle were synthesized. They bear an N-methyl imide, N-methyl amide, or anhydride function instead of the original imide. Their inhibitory potencies toward topoisomerase I were examined using a DNA relaxation assay and by analyzing the drug-induced cleavage of 32P-labeled DNA. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition and interaction with DNA were also studied together with the in vitro antiproliferative activities against B16 melanoma and P388 leukemia cells. The antimicrobial activities against two Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis), a Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli), and a yeast (Candida albicans) were tested as well as their antiviral activities toward HIV-1. The efficiency of the anhydride compounds was compared to that of the parent compound rebeccamycin and its dechlorinated analogue. All the compounds studied were inactive against PKC. The structural requirements for PKC and topoisomerase I inhibition are markedly different. In sharp contrast with the structure-PKC inhibition relationships, we found that an anhydride function does not affect topoisomerase I inhibition, whereas a methyl group on the indole nitrogen prevents the poisoning of topoisomerase I. The compounds exhibiting a marked toxicity to P388 leukemia cells had little or no effect on the growth of P388CPT5 cells which are resistant to the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin. This study reinforces the conclusion that the DNA-topoisomerase I cleavable complex is the primary cellular target of the indolocarbazoles and significantly contributes to their cytotoxicity and possibly to their weak but noticeable anti-HIV-1 activities. The structure-activity relationships are also discussed.
TI  - Plantaricin LP84, a broad spectrum heat-stable bacteriocin of Lactobacillus plantarum NCIM 2084 produced in a simple glucose broth medium.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum NCIM 2084 produced an antibacterial substance when grown  at 40 degrees C for 36 h in a laboratory medium. The antibacterial substance was active against a wide range of bacteria comprising Gram positive and negative foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. However, related mesophilic lactobacilli were not inhibited, except for L. amylovorus DSM 20531. The antimicrobial activity was observed between late log and stationary growth phases. The antibacterial substance was partially purified through concentration under vacuum, followed by extraction with methanol and acetone (M-A extract). On fractionation of the M-A extract through Sephadex G-25, the activity was present in an eluant volume of 85 to 100 ml (peak I), indicating an apparent molecular mass of between 1 and 5 kDa and the purification attained was 80-fold. The antimicrobial principle was stable to heat (121 degrees C for 20 min) and catalase, but sensitive to trypsin and chymotrypsin, indicating it to be a bacteriocin. The M-A extract exhibited a bactericidal and lytic effect against Bacillus cereus F 4810 and Escherichia coli D 21. The ability of L. plantarum NCIM 2084 to produce an effective bacteriocin in a simple growth medium is of potential interest in its application as a biopreservative in traditional fermented foods.
TI  - General base catalysis by the phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus: the role of Glu4 and Asp55.
AB  - To assess what roles the active site residues Glu4 and Asp55 of the phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase C of Bacillus cereus (PLCBc) might play in binding and catalysis, selected mutants were prepared through site-directed mutagenesis of the plc gene. The mutants were then expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as fusion proteins with the maltose binding protein (MBP). Kinetic analysis showed that mutations at Glu4 had only modest effects on the catalytic activity, whereas those at Asp55 led to proteins whose values for kcat/KM were 10(4)-10(6) times less than that of the wild-type enzyme. The modest decrease in catalytic activity and the pH-dependent profile of the E4L mutant strongly suggest that glutamic acid at position 4 is not the general base in the PLCBc-catalyzed reaction. Rather, the results support the hypothesis that Glu4 is primarily involved in substrate binding, perhaps by electrostatic stabilization of the positive charge of the choline moiety of the phosphatidylcholine substrate. Examination of X-ray crystallographic data of PLCBc and its various complexes reveals that the carboxylate side chain of Asp55 is positioned such that it could activate a water for nucleophilic attack on the substrate or serve as a ligand for Zn1. However, the involvement of the side chain of Asp55 as an important Zn1 ligand is not consistent with the atomic absorption and thermostability data obtained for the D55L mutant, which are virtually identical with that of the wild-type enzyme. The large reduction in the measured kcat/KM of the D55E, D55N, and D55L mutants of PLCBc indicates that Asp55 plays a critical role in catalysis and likely serves as the general base in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by PLCBc.
TI  - A cysteine-dependent serine protease associated with the dormant spores of Bacillus cereus: purification of the protein and cloning of the corresponding gene.
AB  - Subtilisin-like serine protease, which is associated with the dormant spores of Bacillus cereus, was solubilized by washing the spores with 2 M KCl and purified to homogeneity by carbobenzoxy-D-phenylalanine-liganded affinity column chromatography and hydrophobic interaction column chromatography. Enzyme activity was completely inhibited by reagents for sulfhydryl groups such as HgCl2 as well as by conventional subtilisin inhibitors, suggesting the enzyme to be cysteine-dependent. The enzyme retained activity in 5 M urea at 4 degrees C for at least 2 months, and the specific activity was 50 times that of subtilisin BPN when measured for a common chromogenic substrate, carbobenzoxy-glycyl-glycyl-L-leucine p-nitroanilide. The gene encoding this protease was cloned in Escherichia coli, and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed. The deduced amino acid sequence suggested that the protease is produced as a precursor comprising three portions; a signal sequence (28 amino acid residues), a prosequence (80 amino acid residues) and a mature enzyme (289 amino acid residues). The mature region of the enzyme had high similarity with a thermitase from Thermoactinomyces vulgaris (72% identity) and a thermostable alkaline protease from Thermoactinomyces sp. E79 (66% identity), which have the N-terminal sequence showing scarcely noticeable similarity with corresponding stretches of subtilisins and mercuric ion-sensitive free cysteine in the equivalent position of the primary structure.
TI  - Antibacterial and chemical evaluation of Chromolaena moritziana.
AB  - Chromolaena moritziana (Sch. Bip. ex Hieron.) King & Robin. (Asteraceae) is used  in local ethnomedicine as an anticatarrhal, a depurative and in the treatment of skin diseases. This ethnopharmacological information has a direct correlation with that reported for other Chromolaena species. Dichloromethane and aqueous extracts from the leaves as well as ethyl acetate extracts from the flowers have shown antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and a UV-V light effect was not observed against this bacterium. These results may justify the ethnomedical use in skin infections. The flavonoids kaempferol, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, rutin and isoquercitrin as well as the triterpene alpha-amyrin were isolated.
TI  - Mutagenesis study of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase C of Trypanosoma brucei.
AB  - The glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) from Trypanosoma brucei is particularly effective in hydrolysing the GPI-anchors of some proteins. The enzyme is inhibited by Zn2+ and p-chloromercurylphenylsulphonic acid, both of which can act as sulphydryl reagents, suggesting that a cysteine residue may be important in catalysis. Single cysteine to serine mutants have been produced for all eight cysteines in GPI-PLC; all the mutants were fully active in vitro and were still susceptible to p-chloromercurylphenylsulphonic acid inhibition. In contrast, a single histidine 34 to glutamine mutation totally inactivated GPI-PLC. The histidine was chosen after a sequence alignment with the Bacillus cereus phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PI-PLC) suggested a conservation of active site residues, including histidine 34 which is central to the proposed reaction mechanism (Heinz D.W., Ryan M., Bullock T.L., Griffith O.H. EMBO J 1995;14:3855-3863). The results suggest that the GPI-PLC and bacterial PI-PLCs have conserved active sites and that the inhibition of GPI-PLC by sulphydryl reagents can occur through more than one residue.
TI  - A universal protocol for PCR detection of 13 species of foodborne pathogens in foods.
AB  - A universal protocol for PCR detection of 13 species of foodborne pathogens in foods was developed. The protocol used a universal culture medium and the same PCR conditions with 13 sets of specific primers. The 13 species of foodborne pathogens examined were Escherichia coli, E. coli-ETEC, E. coli-O157:H7, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Y. pseudotuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. No interference was observed using the PCR assay when food sample was artificially inoculated with each individual bacterial species. Twelve different seafood samples and two soft cheese samples without artificial inoculation were examined by this protocol. Vibrio vulnificus, Salmonella spp., E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus were detected in some foods. Internal probe hybridization and nested PCR procedures were used to confirm the above findings.
TI  - In-vitro photobactericidal activity of aminoacridines.
AB  - The toxicities of several aminoacridines were measured against pathogenic strains of both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) organisms. In several cases, illumination at a light dose of 6.3 J/cm2 resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal drug concentrations required, giving up to 50-fold increases in bactericidal activity. Derivatives of 9-aminoacridine (aminacrine) exhibited phototoxicity against one or more of the test organisms, but the established photosensitizing acridines proflavine and acridine orange were photobactericidal against all strains.
TI  - Crystal structure of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - The X-ray crystal structure of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C  (PI-PLC) from the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes has been determined both in free form at 2.0 A resolution, and in complex with the competitive inhibitor myo-inositol at 2.6 A resolution. The structure was solved by a combination of molecular replacement using the structure of Bacillus cereus PI-PLC and single isomorphous replacement. The enzyme consists of a single (beta alpha)8-barrel domain with the active site located at the C-terminal side of the beta-barrel. Unlike other (beta alpha)8-barrels, the barrel in PI-PLC is open because it lacks hydrogen bonding interactions between beta-strands V and VI. myo-Inositol binds to the active site pocket by making specific hydrogen bonding interactions with a number of charged amino acid side-chains as well as a coplanar stacking interaction with a tyrosine residue. Despite a relatively low sequence identity of approximately 24%, the structure is highly homologous to that of B.cereus PI-PLC with an r.m.s. deviation for 228 common C alpha positions of 1.46 A. Larger differences are found for loop regions that accommodate most of the numerous amino acid insertions and deletions. The active site pocket is also well conserved with only two amino acid replacements directly implicated in inositol binding.
TI  - Produce handling and processing practices.
AB  - In the past decade, outbreaks of human illness associated with the consumption of raw vegetables and fruits (or unpasteurized products produced from them) have increased in the United States. Changes in agronomic, harvesting, distribution, processing, and consumption patterns and practices have undoubtedly contributed to this increase. Pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum, and Bacillus cereus are naturally present in some soil, and their presence on fresh produce is not rare. Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae, parasites, and viruses are more likely to contaminate fresh produce through vehicles such as raw or improperly composted manure, irrigation water containing untreated sewage, or contaminated wash water. Contact with mammals, reptiles, fowl, insects, and unpasteurized products of animal origin offers another avenue through which pathogens can access produce. Surfaces, including human hands, which come in contact with whole or cut produce represent potential points of contamination throughout the total system of growing, harvesting, packing, processing, shipping, and preparing produce for consumption. Treatment of produce with chlorinated water reduces populations of pathogenic and other microorganisms on fresh produce but cannot eliminate them. Reduction of risk for human illness associated with raw produce can be better achieved through controlling points of potential contamination in the field; during harvesting; during processing or distribution; or in retail markets, food-service facilities, or the home.
TI  - Diacylglycerol partitioning and mixing in detergent micelles: relevance to enzyme kinetics.
AB  - For many of the enzymes that utilize or produce diacylglycerols, detergent mixed  micelles are often used in assay systems to solubilize the lipophilic substrates or products. The assumption is often made that the diacylglycerol (DAG) is solubilized and well mixed throughout the population of micelles during the time course of the assay. In the present work the partitioning and exchange dynamics of diacylglycerols (from dihexanoyl-DAG to didecanoyl-DAG) in a variety of detergent micelles have been studied by NMR and fluorescence methods. In all detergents, the longer the DAG chain lengths, the more detergent is required for solubilization. However, efficiency of solubilization varies tremendously with Triton X-100 the most efficient (i.e. the least detergent is required), and deoxycholate the least efficient in solubilizing DAG. The mixing and exchange dynamics of pyrene-labeled DAG molecules in these micelles (measured by stopped-flow fluorescence) were fastest for Triton X-100 and slowest with charged bile salt micelles. Of the detergent systems characterized, Triton X-100 appears to be the optimal detergent for use in assays of enzymes that interact with DAG (beta-octylglucoside and diheptanoylphosphatidylcholine have good exchange dynamics, but higher amounts of these detergents are needed to solubilize DAG). Bile salt micelles provide the least solubilization and the slowest exchange kinetics (so slow that this could be a significant problem in some enzyme assays). This information on DAG behavior in micelles is discussed with respect to assays of an enzyme that generates DAG as product (phospholipase C) and one that uses DAG as substrate (DAG kinase). Although slow exchange of DAG occurs in some micelle systems, this does not appear to be a rate-limiting step in the kinetics for either of these enzymes.
TI  - A xanthanolide with potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - This study was conducted to find constituents of an annual herb, Xanthium sibiricum Patr er Widd, with effective antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). By monitoring antibacterial activity against MRSA strains, it was shown that a sesquiterpene lactone, identified as [3aR-(3a alpha, 7 beta,8a beta)]-3,3a,4,7,8,8a-hexahydro-7- methyl-3-methylene-6-(3-oxo-1-butenyl)-2H-cyclohepta[b]furan-2-one, or xanthatin, isolated from leaves of the herb, had outstandingly potent activity against S. aureus species, including MRSA; its activity against MRSA and MSSA strains was similar. Other bacteria, e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi, were also susceptible at the concentrations tested but the compound had no inhibitory effect on some other bacteria, including Escherichia coli. The results show that xanthatin has outstandingly potent activity against strains of S. aureus but that the activity of the compound is highly species-specific.
TI  - Novel selective and non-selective optical detection of microorganisms.
AB  - A new instrument, capable of detecting metabolic changes due to microbiological activity, is described. Optical changes in growth media are monitored in a semi-fluid zone that separates the liquid medium containing the sample. Data demonstrate that common media can be utilized in conjunction with this rapid automated technology. Nutrient broth with the pH dye indicator. bromocresol purple was suitable for total counts. Selective media containing dyes were utilized to assess the presence or absence of specific groups of organisms. Biochemical reactions, such as lysine decarboxylase activity, were identified by the unique generated patterns, and specific enzymatic cleavage reactions with chromogenic substrates, such as 5-bromo-4 chloro-3 indolyl-beta-D-glucuronic acid (X-GLUC), were monitored.
TI  - Syntheses and biological activities (topoisomerase inhibition and antitumor and antimicrobial properties) of rebeccamycin analogues bearing modified sugar moieties and substituted on the imide nitrogen with a methyl group.
AB  - As a part of studies on structure-activity relationships, several potential topoisomerase I inhibitors were prepared. Different analogues of the antitumor antibiotic rebeccamycin substituted on the imide nitrogen with a methyl group were synthesized. These compounds bore either the sugar residue of rebeccamycin, with or without the chlorine atoms on the indole moieties, or modified sugar residues (galactopyranosyl, glucopyranosyl, or fucopyranosyl) linked to the aglycone via a beta- or alpha-N-glycosidic bond. Their inhibitory properties toward protein kinase C, topoisomerase I, and topoisomerase II were examined, and their DNA-binding properties were investigated. Their in vitro antitumor activities against murine B16 melanoma and P388 leukemia cells were determined. Their antimicrobial activities were tested against Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis, Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, and yeast Candida albicans. These compounds are inactive toward topoisomerase II but inhibit topoisomerase I. A substitution with a methyl group on the imide nitrogen led to a loss of proteine kinase C inhibition in the maleimide indolocarbazole series but did not prevent topoisomerase I inhibition. Compounds possessing a beta-N-glycosidic bond, which fully intercalated into DNA, were more efficient at inhibiting topoisomerase I than their analogues with an alpha-N-glycosidic bond; however, both were equally toxic toward P388 leukemia cells. Dechlorinated rebeccamycin possessing a methyl group on the imide nitrogen was about 10 times more efficient in terms of cytotoxicity and inhibition of topoisomerase I than the natural metabolite.
TI  - A study of photobactericidal activity in the phenothiazinium series.
AB  - The photodynamic antibacterial properties of a closely related series of commercially available phenothiazinium dyes were tested against a range of pathogenic strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The photosensitisers were illuminated using a non-laser light source at a fluence of 1.75 mW cm-2 and this resulted in the enhancement of antibacterial activity in liquid culture. In several cases, illumination resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal concentrations required, giving up to 100-fold increases in bactericidal activity.
TI  - Milk pasteurisation and safety: a brief history and update.
AB  - A brief history of the development of milk pasteurisation is presented and updated. Concerns about the margin of safety provided by current pasteurisation standards in terms of milk-borne pathogens such as mycobacteria (in particular Mycobacterium paratuberculosis) and other emerging pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 are discussed. With the exception of the endospores of Bacillus cereus, current standards appear to be adequate for public health assurance of milk safety provided good manufacturing practices are followed.
TI  - Meat from dairy cows: possible microbiological hazards and risks.
AB  - The authors provide an overview of the circumstances associated with culling of dairy cattle in the United States of America (USA) and focus on the possible significant microbiological hazards associated with meat from cull dairy cows. Cull dairy cows are an important source of food in the USA, accounting for at least approximately 17% of ground beef. The potential microbiological hazards for foodborne illness from cull dairy cows discussed here include Salmonella (with special attention to S. Typhimurium DT104), Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. Possible sources and means of contamination are pointed out, as are the potential foodborne risks from Bacillus cereus and Aeromonas spp. In conclusion, widespread microbiological studies are needed to determine the prevalence and risk of foodborne pathogens in cull dairy cattle.
TI  - Comparative sensitivity of 13 species of pathogenic bacteria to seven chemical germicides.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative resistance of diverse human bacterial pathogens to commonly used germicidal agents has not been established. METHODS: We measured by titration the survival of thirteen different bacteria after exposure to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, cupric ascorbate, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol. RESULTS: Our comparative experiments allowed classification of the organisms' survival into four groups: (a) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus showed the most resistance, (b) Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed intermediate resistance, (c) Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella sonnei, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus survived some treatments with chemical agents only in the presence of protecting protein (serum albumin), and (d) Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, Bacillus cereus, and Yersinia enterocolitica did not survive any of the treatments applied. CONCLUSION: We found species that more frequently survived exposure to germicidal agents were also those most commonly reported in association with hospital infections. Our findings suggest that resistance to disinfectants may be more important than pathogenicity in determining the relative prominence of an organism as an agent responsible for nosocomial infections.
TI  - Cloning, overexpression, refolding, and purification of the nonspecific phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Bacillus cereus secretes a nonspecific phospholipase C (PLC) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids to yield diacylglycerol and a phosphate monoester. B. cereus PLC has been overexpressed with its signal sequence in Escherichia coli using a T7 expression system. The expressed enzyme formed intracellular inclusion bodies which were solubilized in the presence of 8 M urea. Renaturation was initiated by gradual removal of urea and addition of zinc ions. The signal peptide was specifically cleaved by a protease, clostripain, added when the urea concentration was 1.5 M. Factors that led to protein reaggregation included rapid removal of urea, use of Tris instead of barbital buffer, and presence of the signal peptide when the urea concentration was below 1.5 M. The folded protein was purified by Q-Sepharose Fast flow chromatography to yield a preparation > 99% pure. The final yield of active enzyme was 30-40 mg per liter of culture. The recombinant PLC exhibited biochemical and kinetic properties identical to those of extracellularly produced PLC from B. cereus. Site-specific mutagenesis of Asn-134 was carried out as a test of the general effectiveness of the refolding procedure.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and characterization of the cryptic Bacillus thuringiensis plasmid pGI3 reveal a new family of rolling circle replicons.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pGI3 from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. thuringiensis H1.1. was obtained. Although this 11,365-bp molecule contained at least 11 putative open reading frames (ORFs), extensive database searches did not reveal any homologous sequences with the exception of ORF6, which displayed similarity to the largest ORF of pSTK1, a 1,883-bp cryptic plasmid isolated from Bacillus stearothermophilus. Deletion analysis to determine the pGI3 minimal replicon revealed that ORF6 is the rep gene. Replication occurred via a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) intermediate, as demonstrated by S1 treatment and Southern hybridization in nondenaturating conditions. Interestingly, however, no homology was found between the pGI3 (ORF6) and pSTK1 (ORF3) rep genes and those from other single-stranded DNA plasmids, nor was there any DNA similarity to the double-strand origins of replication characterized so far, indicating that pGI3 and pSTK1 form another, new family of ssDNA plasmids. PCR analysis revealed that the pGI3 rep gene is largely distributed among B. thuringiensis strains but can also be found in B. cereus and B. mycoides strains, albeit at a lower frequency. Finally, segregation experiments performed with B. subtilis and B. thuringiensis showed that the pGI3 derivatives, including the minimal replicon, were segregationally stable at temperatures suitable for B. thuringiensis growth (<43 degrees C).
TI  - Neutralization of hemolytic and mouse lethal activities of C. perfringens alpha-toxin need simultaneous blockade of two epitopes by monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Three murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs 3B4, 1E8, 1F9) were produced by fusion of X63-Ag8.653 myeloma cells and splenocytes of mice immunized with glutaraldehyde-inactivated alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens. All MAbs belonged to the immunoglobulin G (IgG) class and possessed a kappa light chain. All the MAbs were specific for alpha-toxin of C. perfringens as demonstrated by immunoblotting experiments performed with culture supernatants of C. perfringens, C. bifermentans, C. sordellii, and Bacillus cereus. Competition analysis in an ELISA revealed that the MAbs recognized different epitopes on the alpha-toxin molecule. In an immunoblot assay based on a recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli, the binding site of MAb 1E8 but not those of MAbs 3B4 and 1 F9 were mapped to the COOH-terminal fragment of alpha-toxin (aa 248-370). To prove the neutralizing potential of the MAbs, alpha-toxin was preincubated with MAbs and subsequently tested for its lecithinase activity in an egg yolk diffusion turbidity (EYDT) assay, its hemolytic activity in a hemolysis test, and its lethal effect on mice after intraperitoneally administration. When the MAbs were tested individually, neutralization was only seen in the EYDT assay, where MAb 3B4 completely abolished the lecithinase activity of alpha toxin. However, when MAbs 3B4 and 1 E8 were used in combination, they acted synergistically and inhibited the lysis of rabbit erythrocytes in vitro. The same mixture of MAbs was also able to completely neutralize the lethal effect of three LD50 of alpha-toxin on Balb/c mice. Our results suggest that the alpha-toxin molecule contains several domains which are differently involved in the various activities of the toxin. We conclude that the hemolytic domain(s) of alpha-toxin is (are) identical with or very closely located to the domain(s) that cause the mouse lethal effect. The lecithinase activity may be involved in the mechanisms of hemolysis and mouse lethality but appears not to be the only determinant.
TI  - Bacterial viability and antibiotic susceptibility testing with SYTOX green nucleic acid stain.
AB  - A fluorescent nucleic acid stain that does not penetrate living cells was used to assess the integrity of the plasma membranes of bacteria. SYTOX Green nucleic acid stain is an unsymmetrical cyanine dye with three positive charges that is completely excluded from live eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Binding of SYTOX Green stain to nucleic acids resulted in a > 500-fold enhancement in fluorescence emission (absorption and emission maxima at 502 and 523 nm, respectively), rendering bacteria with compromised plasma membranes brightly green fluorescent. SYTOX Green stain is readily excited by the 488-nm line of the argon ion laser. The fluorescence signal from membrane-compromised bacteria labeled with SYTOX Green stain was typically > 10-fold brighter than that from intact organisms. Bacterial suspensions labeled with SYTOX Green stain emitted green fluorescence in proportion to the fraction of permeabilized cells in the population, which was quantified by microscopy, fluorometry, or flow cytometry. Flow cytometric and fluorometric approaches were used to quantify the effect of beta-lactam antibiotics on the cell membrane integrity of Escherichia coli. Detection and discrimination of live and permeabilized cells labeled with SYTOX Green stain by flow cytometry were markedly improved over those by propidium iodide-based tests. These studies showed that bacterial labeling with SYTOX Green stain is an effective alternative to conventional methods for measuring bacterial viability and antibiotic susceptibility.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the adhering human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB.
AB  - The spent culture supernatant of the human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. It decreased the in vitro viability of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. In contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. The activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. The antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. Activity against S. typhimurium SL1344 infecting human cultured intestinal Caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional C3H/He/oujco mouse model with S. typhimurium C5 infection and oral treatment with the LB spent culture supernatant.
TI  - Three Bacillus cereus bacteriophage endolysins are unrelated but reveal high homology to cell wall hydrolases from different bacilli.
AB  - The ply genes encoding the endolysin proteins from Bacillus cereus phages Bastille, TP21, and 12826 were identified, cloned, and sequenced. The endolysins could be overproduced in Escherichia coli (up to 20% of total cellular protein), and the recombinant proteins were purified by a two-step chromatographical procedure. All three enzymes induced rapid and specific lysis of viable cells of several Bacillus species, with highest activity on B. cereus and B. thuringiensis. Ply12 and Ply21 were experimentally shown to be N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases (EC 3.5.1.28). No apparent holin genes were found adjacent to the ply genes. However, Ply21 may be endowed with a signal peptide which could play a role in timing of cell lysis by the cytoplasmic phage endolysin. The individual lytic enzymes (PlyBa, 41.1 kDa; Ply21, 29.5 kDa, Ply12, 27.7 kDa) show remarkable heterogeneity, i.e., their amino acid sequences reveal only little homology. The N-terminal part of Ply21 was found to be almost identical to the catalytic domains of a Bacillus sp. cell wall hydrolase (CwlSP) and an autolysin of B. subtilis (CwlA). The C terminus of PlyBa contains a 77-amino-acid sequence repeat which is also homologous to the binding domain of CwlSP. Ply12 shows homology to the major autolysins from B. subtilis and E. coli. Comparison with database sequences indicated a modular organization of the phage lysis proteins where the enzymatic activity is located in the N-terminal region and the C-termini are responsible for specific recognition and binding of Bacillus peptidoglycan. We speculate that the close relationship of the phage enzymes and cell wall autolysins is based upon horizontal gene transfer among different Bacillus phages and their hosts.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and overexpression of the leucine dehydrogenase gene from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - The L-leucine dehydrogenase gene from Bacillus cereus (DSM 626) was cloned from a partial genomic library and sequenced. The open reading frame has 1101 bp and codes for a protein of 39.9 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of the LeuDH from B. cereus shares 70-80% identity with LeuDH's from the thermophilic strains B. stearothermophilus and Thermoactinomyces intermedius. The active protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli to yield approximately 30% of the total soluble protein.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial respiration by a low-molecular weight lectin, scyllin, from Scylla serrata crab hemolymph.
AB  - Interaction of plant and/or invertebrate lectins with mammalian cells and different microorganisms is well known. In the present study, we have demonstrated that scyllin, a low molecular weight (MW 4000) lectin from the edible crab Scylla serrata hemolymph, purified by GalNAc-Sepharon affinity column followed by Mono-Q ion exchanger in FPLC exhibits antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli by inhibiting endogenous respiration as well as exogenous glucose oxidation. In both the cases oxygen consumption has been measured in an oxygraph. Scyllin has produced 50% inhibition of endogenous respiration at a concentration of 110 micrograms/ml and 125 micrograms/ml in B. cereus and E. coli respectively. It also reduced the exogenous glucose oxidation by 50% at a concentration of 12 micrograms/ml and 80 micrograms/ml respectively in B. cereus and E. coli. From the above study the mechanism of bacterial growth inhibitory property of scyllin is suggested though the other studies such as inhibition of nucleic acid biosynthesis, cell wall biosynthesis etc. to evaluate its total mode of inhibitory action are not yet obtained.
TI  - Survival of selected bacteria and fungi in hypertonic (7.2%) saline.
AB  
TI  - Intracellular transport and processing of protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial toxins are associated with disease in humans and animals. Toxins can either be preformed in food or produced by bacteria in the intestine. There are two types of toxins: heat-labile protein toxins and heat stabile toxins. Heat labile toxins are produced by Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio cholerae, and heat-stabile enterotoxins consisting of relatively few amino acids are produced by Escherichia coli and acts by activation of guanylate cyclase. Similarly, heat-stabile entero-toxins are also produced by Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of food poisoning in the United States, and Yersenia enterocolitica. Protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria can intoxicate intestinal cells and can also be taken up from the gut and reach other cells in the body. For example the Shiga-like toxins (vero-toxins) can intoxicate endothelial cells in the kidney and cause kidney failure. Intracellular transport and processing of a few of the protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria, namely Clostridium difficile toxin A and B, cholera toxin and the related heat-labile toxin produced by Escherichia coli, and Shiga toxin and Shiga-like toxins are presented.
TI  - [Formation of resting cells in microbial suspensions undergoing autolysis].
AB  - Under experimentally selected conditions favoring spontaneous or induced autolysis of cell suspensions, the asporogenous bacteria Escherichia coli and Methylococcus capsulatus, the bacilli Bacillus cereus (under conditions of suppressed sporulation), and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were shown to be capable of forming cystlike resting cells. Their number was influenced by (1) cell density in the suspensions; (2) the presence of Ca2+ ions in nutrient-limited medium; (3) pH of medium; and (4) autolysis rate, dependent on the concentration of oleic acid (a chemical analogue of the autolysis-inducing d2 factor) introduced into the cell suspensions.
TI  - A Bacillus cereus member of the SNF2 family.
AB  - The complete sequence of a Bacillus cereus member of the SNF2 family of putative  helicases showed conservation of all seven motifs typical of this family. Bcsnf predicted a protein of 1064 aa where the conserved SNF2 domain was located at the carboxy terminus, whereas the 633 amino-terminal aa showed no homology to any protein in the databases. A putative transcriptional start was identified by primer extension, indicating that Bcsnf is not a part of a larger operon. No phenotypical changes were observed after insertional inactivation of Bcsnf. The completely sequenced genomes of Mycoplasma genitalium and Haemophilus influenzae contain one ORF each with similarity to the SNF2 family: MG018 and HI0616, respectively. A phylogenetic tree of the SNF2 family showed that BcSNF and MG018 were most closely related, and appeared closer to the eukaryotic members of the SNF2 family than to the two other bacterial members of the family, HepA from Escherichia coli and HI0616.
TI  - Haem O and a putative cytochrome bo in a mutant of Bacillus cereus impaired in the synthesis of haem A.
AB  - In a spontaneous mutant (PYM1) of Bacillus cereus impaired in the synthesis of haem A, no haem-A-containing cytochromes were detected spectroscopically. The haem A deficiency was compensated by high levels of haem O and a CO-reactive cytochrome o in membranes; no other oxidases were detected. In contrast, the wild-type strain had considerable amounts of haem A and negligible levels of haem O. The mutant PYM1 exhibited normal colony morphology, growth, and sporulation in nonfermentable media, whereas on fermentable media, the mutant overproduced acid, which led to poor growth and inhibition of sporulation. External control of the pH of the medium in fermentable media allowed close-to-normal growth and massive sporulation of the mutant. The presence of membrane-bound cytochrome caa3-OII and aa3-II subunits in strain PYM1 was confirmed by Western blots and haem C staining (COII subunit). Western blotting also revealed that in contrast to the wild-type - strain PYM1 contained the membrane-bound subunits caa3-COI and aa3-I, but in low amounts. The effect of several respiratory inhibitors on the respiratory system of strain PYM1 suggested that the terminal oxidase is highly resistant to KCN and CO and that a c-type cytochrome might be involved in the electron transfer sequence to the putative cytochrome bo.
TI  - Cloning of the glutamine synthetase gene from group B streptococci.
AB  - The glnA gene from the human pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae was cloned from a  genomic library prepared with the lambda phage vector lambdaDASHII. A 4.6-kb DNA fragment of one of the recombinant phages was subcloned in pUC18. This Escherichia coli clone expressed a 52-kDa protein encoded by a 1,341-bp open reading frame. The nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame and the deduced amino acid sequence shared a significant degree of homology with the sequences of other glutamine synthetases (GS). The highest homology was between our deduced protein and GS of gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Plasmids with the cloned streptococcal glnA were able to complement E. coli glnA mutants grown on minimal media. Rabbit antisera to streptococcal GS recombinant protein recognized not only the recombinant protein but also a similar-sized band in mutanolysin extracts of all group B streptococcal strains tested, regardless of polysaccharide type or surface protein profile. The amino acid sequence of the deduced protein had similarities to other streptococcal cell-surface-bound proteins. The possible functional role of the immunological features of streptococcal GS is discussed.
TI  - Kinetics of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C with vesicles of a thiophosphate analogue of phosphatidylinositol.
AB  - 1,2-Dimyristoyloxypropane-3-thiophospho(1D-1-myo-inositol) (D-thio-DMPI) was synthesized as a substrate for the continuous spectrophotometric assay of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from Bacillus cereus. Release of thio-diglyceride is followed by a coupled reaction with 4,4'-dithiopyridine to produce a chromophore, 4-thiopyridine, measured by its absorption at 324 nm. Sonicated vesicles of D-thio-DMPI gave sigmoidal Michaelis-Menten kinetics with PI-PLC as a function of bulk concentration of substrate (Hill plot: Vmax = 132 mumol min-1 mg-1, apparent Km = 0.115 mM, h = 1.8). Addition of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or dimyristoyl phosphatidylmethanol to vesicles of D-thio-DMPI resulted in an initial increase in rate followed by a decrease at higher concentrations of non-substrate lipid. Binding of PI-PLC to vesicles of DMPC with 10 mol% of N-dansyl phosphatidylethanolamine was demonstrated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer from tryptophan in the enzyme to the dansyl lipid probe.
TI  - Risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  - The epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. From 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1994, the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in England and Wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). Salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and S. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. Small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, Clostridium perfringens in four, Bacillus cereus in two, and Campylobacter sp and Escherichia coli in one each. No pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. Outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. The commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. Salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight outbreaks. Raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. Inappropriate storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. Outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. Public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.
TI  - Incidence of diarrhea with antibiotics and the increase of clostridia in rabbits.
AB  - Rabbits were treated with a single intravenous injection of various antibiotics.  More than 40 per cent of the animals showed diarrhea after being treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefmetazole, clindamycin, piperacillin or aspoxicillin. Clostridium difficile was isolated from sulbactam/cefoperazone-treated diarrheic rabbits, with their cecal contents showing positive reaction in a latex agglutination test for C. difficile enterotoxin. However, 27 cefmetazole-induced diarrheic cases were not associated with C. difficile. Other enteropathogenic bacteria, such as Campylobacter spp., Bacillus cereus, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium spiroforme, were not isolated from either of diarrheic rabbit. However, the counts of clostridia remarkably increased in the intestine of cefmetazole-associated diarrheic rabbits. This was ascribed to the overgrowth of Clostridium innocuum and Clostridium sporogenes. There were no remarkable differences in changes in other bacterial population between diarrheic and non-diarrheic rabbits.
TI  - Evaluation of swirling, pH, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. This study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular pH, and low plasma glucose levels. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees C for up to 5 days. In the morning and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet pH, plasma glucose, and swirling. Quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine pH and glucose levels. RESULTS: Platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus mitis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. The sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. Although the sensitivity of the pH test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with E. cloacae had normal pH despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) CFU/mL). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular pH or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with Gram stain (10(5)-10(6) CFU/mL), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) CFU/mL), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal RNA (10(3)-10(4) CFU/mL), and automated bacterial culture (1 CFU/sample volume).
TI  - Some like it cold: response of microorganisms to cold shock.
AB  - Bacteria respond to an abrupt decrease in temperature with a specific response, in which cold-induced proteins (CIPs) are transiently expressed at a higher level. Employing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, several CIPs have been identified. In spite of this, the overall function of the cold shock response is unclear. Recently, the main attention has focused on a group of conserved cold shock proteins (CSPs) that have been shown to have the highest induction after cold shock and to play a major regulatory role in the physiology of adaptation to low temperatures. CSPs, of which Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and B. cereus possess a family comprising at least 3-7 proteins, are small acidic proteins that share over 45% of sequence identity. Recent evidence suggests that members of this wide-spread protein family can function both at the transcriptional and translational level in vitro. However, the exact mode of action has yet to be established. In addition, post-transcriptional regulation seems to play a major role in the induction of CSPs, a process in which the ribosome may be involved. This is in accordance with a model in which the ribosome has been proposed to be the sensor of temperature in bacteria.
TI  - Inhibition of microbial growth by ajoene, a sulfur-containing compound derived from garlic.
AB  - Ajoene, a garlic-derived sulfur-containing compound that prevents platelet aggregation, exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Growth of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Streptomyces griseus, was inhibited at 5 micrograms of ajoene per ml. Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus plantarum also were inhibited below 20 micrograms of ajoene per ml. For gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, MICs were between 100 and 160 micrograms/ml. Ajoene also inhibited yeast growth at concentrations below 20 micrograms/ml. The microbicidal effect of ajoene on growing cells was observed at slightly higher concentrations than the corresponding MICs. B. cereus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were killed at 30 micrograms of ajoene per ml after 24 h of cultivation when cultivation was started at 10(5) cells per ml. However, the minimal microbicidal concentrations for resting cells were at 10 to 100 times higher concentrations than the corresponding MICs. The disulfide bond in ajoene appears to be necessary for the antimicrobial activity of ajoene, since reduction by cysteine, which reacts with disulfide bonds, abolished its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Methods for increasing survivability during storage of exponentially growing bacteria.
AB  - A protocol has been developed for storing Gram (-) bacterial cells at 0 degrees C, which allows greater than 90% of stored cells to retain colony-forming ability for up to 60 days. The protocol, which yields essentially identical results when used with Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, does not enhance survivability of Bacillus cereus. The greatest and longest survival is enjoyed when exponentially growing cells in minimal-glucose medium are deprived of carbon for about 9 h, supplemented with 750 microg/ml chloramphenicol, and immediately placed at 0 degrees C. By decreasing the period of carbon starvation from 9 to 5 h, or increasing the period of carbon starvation from 9 to 12 h, both the ultimate survival rate and kinetics of loss of culturability are affected. Survival enhancement induced by chloramphenicol is not similarly induced by kanamycin.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships in a series of substituted indolocarbazoles: topoisomerase I and protein kinase C inhibition and antitumoral and antimicrobial properties.
AB  - A series of compounds structurally related to staurosporine, rebeccamycin, and corresponding aglycones was synthesized, and their activities toward protein kinase C and topoisomerases I and II were tested together with their in vitro antitumor efficiency against murine B16 melanoma and P388 leukemia cells. Their antimicrobial activities were also examined against a Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli), a yeast (Candida albicans), and three Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Streptomyces chartreusis, and Streptomyces griseus). To avoid side effects expected with protein kinase C inhibitors, we introduced substitution on the maleimide nitrogen and/or a sugar moiety linked to one of the indole nitrogens to obtain specific inhibitors of topoisomerase I with minimal activities on protein kinase C. As expected, these structures were inefficient on topoisomerase II, and some of them exhibited a strong activity against topoisomerase I. Generally, dechlorinated compounds were found to be more active than chlorinated analogues against both purified topoisomerase I and protein kinase C. On the other hand, opposite results were obtained in the cell antiproliferative assays. These results suggest lack of cell membrane permeability in the absence of the chlorine residue or cleavage of carbon-chlorine bonds inside the cell.
TI  - Mechanism of action of hemolysin III from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Bacillus cereus hemolysin III activity was tested in crude extracts, from Escherichia coli carrying the hly-III gene. It was concluded that hemolysin III is a pore-forming hemolysin with functional pore diameter of about 3-3.5 nm. Hemolysis occurs in at least three steps: (i) the temperature-dependent binding of the Hly-III monomers to the erythrocyte membrane; (ii) the temperature-dependent formation of the transmembrane oligomeric pore; (iii) the temperature-independent erythrocyte lysis.
TI  - Expression and site-directed mutagenesis of the phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase C of Bacillus cereus: probing the role of the active site Glu146.
AB  - A series of site-specific mutants of the phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus (PLCBc) was prepared in which the glutamic acid residue at position 146 was replaced with glutamine, aspartic acid, histidine, and leucine to elucidate what role Glu146 might play in catalysis. An expression system for the native enzyme in Escherichia coli was first developed to provide PLCBc that was fused via an intervening factor Xa protease recognition sequence at its N-terminus to maltose binding protein (MBP). This MBP-PLCBc fusion protein was isolated at levels of 50-70 mg/L of culture; selective trypsin digestion of the MBP-PLCBc fusion protein followed by chromatographic purification yielded recombinant PLCBc at levels of ca. 10 mg/L. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis on the PLCBc gene (plc) was then used to replace the Glu146 codon with those for glutamine (E146Q), aspartic acid (E146D), histidine (E146H), and leucine (E146L). The catalytic efficiency of the E146Q mutant was 1.6% that of native PLCBc, while the other mutants each possessed activities of 0.2-0.3% of the wild type. The kcat/Km vs pH profiles for both E146Q and native PLCBc have ascending acidic limbs, suggesting that Glu146 does not serve as the general base in the hydrolysis reaction. As measured by circular dichroism, all of the mutant proteins contained less helical structure and underwent denaturation at lower temperatures than the wild type in the order: wild type > E146Q > E146D approximately E146H approximately E146L. Atomic absorption analyses indicated that the mutant proteins also exhibited lower Zn2+ content than the wild type. Thus, the Glu146 residue in PLCBc stabilizes the secondary and tertiary structure of the enzyme and serves as a critical ligand for Zn2, but it does not appear to have any specific catalytic role.
TI  - N-(2-ferrocene-ethyl)maleimide: a new electroactive sulphydryl-specific reagent for cysteine-containing peptides and proteins.
AB  - We report the synthesis and application of a specific electroactive label, N-(2-ferrocene-ethyl)maleimide, which provides new redox properties to organic compounds and proteins possessing sulphydryl groups. Its reaction conditions with the cysteine-containing peptide, glutathione, and a terminal monooxygenase enzyme, cytochrome P450cam are presented. The labelled peptide and enzyme acquired reversible electrochemical properties due to the attached ferrocene moiety.
TI  - Increased accommodation of nascent RNA in a product site on RNA polymerase II during arrest.
AB  - RNA polymerases encounter specific DNA sites at which RNA chain elongation takes  place in the absence of enzyme translocation in a process called discontinuous elongation. For RNA polymerase II, at least some of these sequences also provoke transcriptional arrest where renewed RNA polymerization requires elongation factor SII. Recent elongation models suggest the occupancy of a site within RNA polymerase that accommodates nascent RNA during discontinuous elongation. Here we have probed the extent of nascent RNA extruded from RNA polymerase II as it approaches, encounters, and departs an arrest site. Just upstream of an arrest site, 17-19 nucleotides of the RNA 3'-end are protected from exhaustive digestion by exogenous ribonuclease probes. As RNA is elongated to the arrest site, the enzyme does not translocate and the protected RNA becomes correspondingly larger, up to 27 nucleotides in length. After the enzyme passes the arrest site, the protected RNA is again the 18-nucleotide species typical of an elongation-competent complex. These findings identify an extended RNA product groove in arrested RNA polymerase II that is probably identical to that emptied during SII-activated RNA cleavage, a process required for the resumption of elongation. Unlike Escherichia coli RNA polymerase at a terminator, arrested RNA polymerase II does not release its RNA but can reestablish the normal elongation mode downstream of an arrest site. Discontinuous elongation probably represents a structural change that precedes, but may not be sufficient for, arrest by RNA polymerase II.
TI  - Zwittermicin A resistance gene from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Zwittermicin A is a novel aminopolyol antibiotic produced by Bacillus cereus that is active against diverse bacteria and lower eukaryotes (L.A. Silo-Suh, B.J. Lethbridge, S.J. Raffel, H. He, J. Clardy, and J. Handelsman, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60:2023-2030, 1994). To identify a determinant for resistance to zwittermicin A, we constructed a genomic library from B. cereus UW85, which produces zwittermicin A, and screened transformants of Escherichia coli DH5alpha, which is sensitive to zwittermicin A, for resistance to zwittermicin A. Subcloning and mutagenesis defined a genetic locus, designated zmaR, on a 1.2-kb fragment of DNA that conferred zwittermicin A resistance on E. coli. A DNA fragment containing zmaR hybridized to a corresponding fragment of genomic DNA from B. cereus UW85. Corresponding fragments were not detected in mutants of B. cereus UW85 that were sensitive to zwittermicin A, and the plasmids carrying zmaR restored resistance to the zwittermicin A-sensitive mutants, indicating that zmaR was deleted in the zwittermicin A-sensitive mutants and that zmaR is functional in B. cereus. Sequencing of the 1.2-kb fragment of DNA defined an open reading frame, designated ZmaR. Neither the nucleotide sequence nor the predicted protein sequence had significant similarity to sequences in existing databases. Cell extracts from an E. coli strain carrying zmaR contained a 43.5-kDa protein whose molecular mass and N-terminal sequence matched those of the protein predicted by the zmaR sequence. The results demonstrate that we have isolated a gene, zmaR, that encodes a zwIttermicin A resistance determinant that is functional in both B. cereus and E. coli.
TI  - [The anticomplement activity of the commercial strain of Bacillus cereus IP 5832  and of enterobacteria when cocultured].
AB  - Bacillus cereus production strain IP 5832 of the preparation "Bactisubtil" has been characterized with respect to its anticomplementary activity (ACA) and the parameters of its heterogeneity in the process of adaptation to trypticase-soybean medium and during cultivation in anaerobic conditions have been determined. The cultivation of B.cereus strain IP 5832 jointly with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, isolated in enteric disbiosis, affects ACA in different ways, which leads to structural changes in the populations of these enterobacteria, characterized by an increase of their heterogeneity with respect to ACA.
TI  - Microbiological quality & incidence of organisms of public health importance in food & water in Ludhiana.
AB  - Bacteriological analysis of 713 samples of various types of foods and related articles and potable water samples from different places in Ludhiana, Punjab was carried out. The highest counts ranging from 2.5 x 10(6)-7.5 x 10(8) organisms/g were observed in raw vegetables and fruits, followed by 3 x 10(6)-9.8 x 10(7)/ml, 8.3 x 10(4)-8.9 x 10(7)/g and 1 x 10(3)-6.7 x 10(7)/g in fruit juice, milk and its products, and salty/non milk snacks respectively. Fresh chapati, dal, rice, cooked vegetables and karhi etc., showed no microbial contamination. However, samples of these articles from road side cafes gave counts up to 1 x 10(7) organism/g. The most probable number of coliforms and Escherichia coli/100 ml of water ranged from < 1 to > 1100. Although 1332 isolates of 16 types of organisms of public health significance were obtained those of proven enteropathogenicity were enterotoxigenic Esch. coli (55), Esch. coli O157 (3), enteropathogenic Esch. coli (1), enterotoxigenic Klebsiella (23), Streptococcus faecalis (152), Bacillus cereus (133), Staphylococcus aureus (125), Aeromonas spp (47), Salmonella spp (10), Shigella spp (4) and Yersinia enterocolitica (2). Poor quality of potable water and widespread occurrence of enteropathogens in food consumed by the common man in Ludhiana was evident.
TI  - (all trans)-2,4,6,8,10,12-tetradecahexene-1,14-dial, a new pigment from Conidiobolus paulus.
AB  - A study of the coloring matter produced by Conidiobolus paulus Drechsler NRRL 2648 on potato-dextrose medium led to the isolation of a new dialdehyde unsaturated metabolite, (all trans)-2,4,6,8,10,12-tetradeca-1,14-hexenedial. The structure was characterized by MS and by 1H- and 13C-NMR. The compound inhibited the growth of the Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus cereus, and the Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli (MIC values of 10 micrograms and 50 micrograms, respectively).
TI  - Syntheses and antimicrobial activities of five-membered ring heterocycles coupled to indole moieties.
AB  - Indole-substituted oxazolidinones, oxazolones, pyrrolidinone, imidazolidinone and imidazolones were synthesized. Their inhibitory potencies towards protein kinase C and protein kinase A were determined and their in vitro activities against Streptomyces chartreusis, Streptomyces griseus, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans and Escherichia coli were examined. The inhibition of Streptomyces sporulation observed for some of them could not be linked to in vitro protein kinase C inhibition. All proved inactive against C. albicans but three of them exhibited a marked activity towards E. coli. This effect extends to other Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Killing of microorganisms by pulsed electric fields.
AB  - Lethal effects of pulsed electric fields (PEF) on suspensions of various bacteria, yeast, and spores in buffer solutions and liquid foodstuffs were examined. Living-cell counts of vegetative cell types were reduced by PEF treatment by up to more than four orders of magnitude (> 99.99%). On the other hand, endo- and ascospores were not inactivated or killed to any great extent. The killing of vegetative cell types depends on the electrical field strength of the pulses and on the treatment time (the product of the pulse number and the decay time constant of the pulses). For each cell type, a specific critical electric field strength (Ec) and a specific critical treatment time (tc) were determined. Above these critical values, the fractions of surviving cells were reduced drastically. The "limits" Ec and tc depend on the cell characteristics as well as on the type of medium in which the cells are suspended. Especially in acid media living-cell counts were sufficiently decreased at very low energy inputs. In addition to the inactivation of microorganisms, the effect of PEF on food components such as whey proteins, enzymes and vitamins, and on the taste of foodstuffs was studied. The degree of destruction of these food components by PEF was very low or negligible. Moreover, no significant deterioration of the taste of foodstuffs was detected after PEF treatment. Disintegration of cells by PEF treatment in order to harvest intracellular products was also studied. Yeast cells, suspended in buffer solution, were not disintegrated by electric pulses. Hence, PEF treatment is an excellent process for inactivation of microorganisms in acid and in thermosensive media, but not for complete disintegration of microbial cells.
TI  - [Construction of shuttle vector containing delta-endotoxin gene of Bacillus thuringiensis].
AB  - The Bacillus thuringiensis toxin gene CryIA(c) was inserted into the shuttle vector pBE-2 to construct pAMY for expressing the B.t. gene in both Gram-negative and -positive bacterial systems. pAMY was introduced into wild type Bacillus cereus, B.brevis and B.subtilis by electroporation. Transformants containing delta-endotoxin gene produced proteins reacted with B.t. crystal protein antibody. Upon biological toxicity tests, the transformants gave a mortality of 100% against Ostrinia furnacilis, 58.8% against Heliothis armigera and 100% against Heliothis assulta. The ability of promoting plant growth of the original strains is retained.
TI  - [Street-vendor foods: quality of ice creams, sherbets and sorbets sold in the urban agglomeration of Antananarivo].
AB  - A survey of selling conditions and bacteriological examinations of ice-cream was  carried-out in Antananarivo from June 1996 to May 1997. The way of investigation by vendors and of bacteriological examinations were widely described. Sellers had classic features of a street-vended food vendor: uneducated, no having professional training and mishandling foodstuffs. 202 samples of ice-cream were collected. The contamination prevalence rate was of 95% +/- 3.7%. Salmonella typhimurium was isolated from one sample. Immediate and rigourous measures ought to be put into effect by authorities to right this alarming situation.
TI  - Characteristics of Streptomyces strains isolated from soils in two landfill areas in north Jordan.
AB  - A total of 114 Streptomyces strains were isolated and purified from soils collected from Al Akider (53) and from Al Kafeer (61) landfill areas in north Jordan. The Al Akider strains were classified into 5 colour series gray (27), white (18), yellow (3), violet (3) and green (2); while the Al Kafeer strains were classified into 6 colour series white (26), gray (16), yellow (9), red (2), green (7) and blue (1). Melanin pigment was produced by 21 and 25% of the Al Akider and Al Kafeer strains, respectively, while soluble pigment was produced by 15% of the A; Akider and 21% of the Al Kafeer strains; 17% of Al Akider strains and 23% of Al Kafeer strains showed distinctive reverse side pigment. Forty, 32, 19, and 9% of the Al Akider strains had spiral, rectus, flexous and retinaculum apertum spore-chains, respectively, while the distribution of the Al Kafeer strains in the same spore-chain forms was equally 25% each. Arabinose, xylose, inositol, fructose, rhamnose, sucrose, raffinose, and mannitol were utilized by 91, 53, 89, 60, 30, 25 and 79% of the Al Akider strains and by 84, 59, 62, 64, 70, 75, 41 and 26% of the Al Kafeer strains, respectively, while only 2% of the Al Kafeer strains were found to utilize cellulose. Thirty-six percent of the Al Akider strains showed, in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus followed by Aspergillus niger (26%), Bacillus cereus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (25% each), Fusarium monilliforme (21%), Candida albicans (15%), Escherichia coli (8%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), while 51, 49, 46, 34, 25, 15, 7 and 2% of the Al Kafeer strains exhibited activity against A. niger, S. cerevisiae, B. cereus, S. aureus, F. monilliforme, C. albicans, P. aeruginosa and E. coli, respectively.
TI  - Cloning and primary structure of a new hemolysin gene from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - A new hemolysin gene from Bacillus cereus VKM-B164 was cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. Deduced protein consists of 219 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 24.4 kDa. It has been concluded that the hemolysin, named 'hemolysin III', is distinct from the B. cereus hemolysins reported previously: cereolysin, sphingomyelinase, cereolysin AB, hemolysin II, and 'cereolysin-like' hemolysin (Honda, T., Shiba, A., Seo, S., Yamamoto, J., Matsuyama, J. and Miwatani, T. (1991) FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 79, 205-210).
TI  - Diverse capacities for the adaptive response to DNA alkylation in Bacillus species and strains.
AB  - Our previous studies of Bacillus subtilis showed that the genes responsible for the adaptive response to DNA alkylation were organized as a divergent regulon, in contrast to scattered operons in Escherichia coli ada regulon. To study the generality and diversity of gene organization, several species and strains of Bacillus were examined for the responsiveness to DNA alkylation. B. cereus cells exhibited the highest resistance to MNNG treatment. When the cells were grown in the presence of MNNG, 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase and two species of DNA methyltransferase were induced as in B. subtilis 168 cells. B. licheniformis 749 and B. amyloliquefaciens H cells exhibited a partial response that manifested itself as the induction of one species of DNA methyltransferase. On the other hand, B. thuringiensis var. Tohokuensis, B. megaterium KMT, and B. subtilis W23 cells were totally deficient in this response, and were hypersensitive to alkylating agents. To determine the cause of this deficiency in strain W23, we examined the genomic structure of the corresponding region where three genes (alkA, adaA, and adaB) were located in 168. No homologues for the three genes were detected in W23 DNA by Southern hybridization. Two genes (glmS and ndhF) flanking the adaptive response regulon in 168 were also present in W23. A sequence of about 2750 bp that carried the entire regulon in 168 was replaced with a sequence of about 250 bp that was unique to W23. At the ends of the conserved segments, palindromic sequences corresponding to the transcriptional termination sites of the adaB and glmS genes were observed. The regulon in 168 could be artificially replaced by the W23 sequence, and be regained through DNA-mediated transformation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of indolocarbazole and bis-indole protein kinase C inhibitors. II. Substitution on maleimide nitrogen with functional groups bearing a labile hydrogen.
AB  - New compounds, structurally related to the potent protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine, and substituted on the imide nitrogen with a functional group bearing a labile hydrogen (hydroxymethyl, amino, hydroxy), were synthesized. Their in vitro inhibitory potencies towards protein kinase C and protein kinase A showed that N-hydroxymethyl and N-hydroxy substitution, unlike alkyl substitution, can provide efficient protein kinase C inhibitors. The antimicrobial activities of these new compounds against Streptomyces chartreusis and Streptomyces griseus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and Botrytis cinerea were examined. They proved to be inactive against E. coli and two fungi. The results suggest that there is no link between in vitro inhibition of protein kinase C and inhibition of growth and sporulation of the two Streptomyces tested. Unlike indolocarbazole maleimides, bis-indole maleimides are active against the two Streptomyces species.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Helichrysum aureonitens (Asteraceae).
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extracts from Helichrysum aureonitens was investigated. The dichloromethane extract was active against all five gram positive bacteria tested and the methanol extract was active only against Bacillus cereus, B. pumilus and Micrococcus kristinae, while the water extract had no activity against any of the organisms. None of the extracts inhibited the growth of the five gram negative bacteria tested.
TI  - Studies on microbial aerobic flora of skin in leprosy patients.
AB  - This study reports the isolation and identification of aerobic organisms from biopsies/slit-skin smears/scrapings from 129 leprosy patients and 50 healthy controls. These include 56 paucibacillary (PB) and 73 multibacillary (MB) cases. Thirty-six isolates from the specimens from 21 patients and 15 healthy controls were grown. The non-mycobacterial isolates from clinically PB leprosy (TT/BT/I) patients were: (1) Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus aureus(1), Staphylococcus albus(1); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Bacillus subtilis(1), Corynebacterium xerosis(1); (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(1), Proteus mirabilis(2), Klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa(1). The isolates from clinically MB leprosy (BB/BL/LL) patients were: (a) Gram-positive cocci: Micrococci(1), Staphylococcus aureus(1) and Staphylococcus albus(1); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Corynebacterium xerosis(1); Corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and Bacillus cereus(1). (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(2), Klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and Proteus mirabilis(2). The specimens from healthy controls yielded similar organisms. These were (a) Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus albus(2), Staphylococcus aureus(2) and Micrococci(2); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Corynebacterium xerosis(1), Bacillus subtilis(2), Corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and Bacillus cereus(1); (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(3), Proteus vulgaris(1) and Proteus mirabilis(1). While these results show no significant differences in the species types of non-mycobacterial aerobic organisms isolated from healthy skin and PB/MB types of leprosy, these isolates need to be characterized by immunological/molecular methods to find out subtypes if any.
TI  - A survey of enteropathogens among United States military personnel during Operation Bright Star '94, in Cairo, Egypt.
AB  - Acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in U.S. military personnel during deployment. This study was conducted to evaluate enteric pathogens associated with diarrhea in a U.S. military population on deployment in Cairo, Egypt, during November 1993. Enteric pathogens found to be associated with cases of diarrhea included: enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), 27% (22% heat-stable [ST], 3% heat-labile [LT], and 2% ST/LT producers); Campylobacter spp., 3%; and Salmonella spp. 3%. Other enteric pathogens, namely Shigella, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio spp., Bacillus cereus, and enteric parasites, were not found in any of the 36 patients. Of the 8 patients who were ETEC-positive, three expressed colonization factor antigens (CFA)/II, and two expressed putative colonization factor antigen (PCF) 0159. All of the latter isolates produced ST. ETEC with different surface protein antigens were found to have surface hydrophobicity in the range of 0.2 M to greater than 2.0 M. Plasmid profiles of the ETEC strains showed no correlation with toxin production. In vitro susceptibility testing of the ETEC strain showed that 32% of the strains were resistant to three or more antimicrobial agents, whereas 24% showed 100% susceptibility. The enteropathogens tested were susceptible to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid, suggesting that the quinolones might be useful for the treatment of diarrheic patients.
TI  - Interactions of biapenem with active-site serine and metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  - Biapenem, formerly LJC 10,627 or L-627, a carbapenem antibiotic, was studied in its interactions with 12 beta-lactamases belonging to the four molecular classes proposed by R. P. Ambler (Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Biol. Sci. 289:321-331, 1980). Kinetic parameters were determined. Biapenem was readily inactivated by metallo-beta-lactamases but behaved as a transient inhibitor of the active-site serine enzymes tested, although with different acylation efficiency values. Class A and class D beta-lactamases were unable to confer in vitro resistance toward this carbapenem antibiotic. Surprisingly, the same situation was found in the case of class B enzymes from Aeromonas hydrophila AE036 and Bacillus cereus 5/B/6 when expressed in Escherichia coli strains.
TI  - Cephalosporin derivatives of doxorubicin as prodrugs for activation by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates.
AB  - The synthesis of a series of cephalosporin doxorubicin derivatives that differ with respect to the substituent at position 7 of the cephem nucleus is described. These compounds are designed as prodrugs of doxorubicin for activation by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates. The key step in the synthesis of this series of compounds involves the use of the phenylacetamido group as an enzymatically removable protecting group for the 7-amino group on the cephem. In vitro cytotoxicity assays with H2981 lung adenocarcinoma cells revealed that cephalosporin doxorubicin derivatives were all less toxic than the released drug. Prodrugs containing negatively charged groups in the side chain, such as the delta-carboxybutanamido derivative 4 and the alpha-sulfophenylacetyl derivative 5, displayed the least cytotoxic activity and were 46- and 26-fold less toxic than doxorubicin, respectively. The efficiency of activation of all the prodrugs was evaluated in cytotoxicity assays on H2981 cells with the beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae P99, Escherichia coli TEM-1, and Bacillus cereus (type II). In general, the E. cloacae enzyme was found to most rapidly activate the majority of these prodrugs. Phenylacetamido prodrug 2 and delta-carboxybutanamido prodrug 4 were both activated in an immunospecific manner by L6-E. cloacae beta-lactamase, a monoclonal antibody conjugate that binds to receptors on H2981 lung adenocarcinoma cells.
TI  - The bceT gene of Bacillus cereus encodes an enterotoxic protein.
AB  - A toxin gene (bceT) on a 2.9 kb DNA fragment of Bacillus cereus B-4ac was cloned  and expressed in Escherichia coli, and its nucleotide sequence determined. The DNA fragment contained an open reading frame capable of encoding a polypeptide of 336 amino acids with a molecular mass of 41039 Da. The translated product in E. coli exhibited Vero cell cytotoxicity, and was positive in a vascular permeability assay. It also caused fluid accumulation in a ligated mouse ileal loop and was lethal to mice upon injection. These biological activities are considered characteristic of diarrhoeal enterotoxins. We therefore conclude that this gene, designated bceT, encodes one of the enterotoxic proteins of B. cereus which cause food-borne diarrhoea.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis possesses a second determinant with extensive sequence similarity to the Escherichia coli mreB morphogene.
AB  - A gene with substantial sequence similarity to the mreB morphogene of Bacillus subtilis has been identified at 302 degrees on the chromosomal map by A. Decatur, B. Kunkel, and R. Losick (Harvard University; personal communication). Our characterization has revealed that the protein product of this determinant (termed mbl for mreB-like) is 55 and 53% identical in sequence to the MreB proteins of B. subtilis and Escherichia coli, respectively. The protein is 86% identical to a protein identified as MreB from Bacillus cereus, suggesting that the B. cereus protein is actually Mbl. Insertional inactivation of mbl indicated that this gene is not essential for cell viability or sporulation. Cells bearing mutant mbl alleles display a decreased growth rate and an altered cellular morphology. The cells appear bloated and are frequently twisted. Intergenic suppressor mutations which restore the growth rate to an approximately normal level arise within the mutant population. A second site mutation, designated som-1, was mapped to the hisA-mbl region of the chromosome by transduction.
TI  - Antimicrobial mode of action of secretions from the metapleural gland of Myrmecia gulosa (Australian bull ant).
AB  - Secretions from exocrine metapleural glands of Myrmecia gulosa (Australian bull ant) exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Treatment of the yeast Candida albicans with metapleural secretion resulted in the rapid and total leakage of K+ ions from cells within 10 min. Ultrastructural analysis of the bacteria Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and cells and protoplasts of Candida albicans demonstrated gross damage of the cell membrane and aggregation of the cytoplasmic matrix of treated cells. Degradation of membrane-bound organelles was also observed in Candida albicans. The antimicrobially active components of metapleural secretions were nonpolar and interacted with the phospholipid bilayer, causing damage to the structural integrity of liposomes and the release of carboxyfluorescein. The data suggest that the antimicrobial agents in metapleural secretion act primarily by disrupting the structure and function of the phospholipid bilayer of the cytoplasmic membrane.
TI  - Transformation of microorganisms with the plasmid vector with the replicon from pAC1 from Acetobacter pasteurianus.
AB  - A number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria species was screened for the expression of the gram-negative plasmid pACK5 and pACT72 with replicon of pAC1 plasmid from Acetobacter pasteurianus. As was described previously, both plasmids were expressed in Escherichia coli, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Acetobacter aceti, Shigella spp. and Citrobacter spp. Expressions of plasmids were successful in twelve species tested, Comamonas terrigena, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megatericum, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Micrococcus luteus, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptoccocus feacalis, and the stability of plasmid DNA was tested after cultivation in non-selective conditions.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of the leaf extract of moringa oleifera lam.
AB  - The ethnolic extract of the leaves of Moringa oleifera Lam. (Fam. Moringaceae) was tested for antimicrobial activities against Gram Positive - Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea: Gram negative - Escherichia coli and Acid fast Mycobacterium phlei. Significant antimicrobial activity of the extract was found in this study.
TI  - Microbial counts and characteristics of Streptoverticillium strains isolated from soils in the Jordan valley.
AB  - A microbial survey of total bacterial count, agrobacteria, streptomycetes, and fungi was carried out in six locations in the Jordan Valley. The highest microbial counts for the four populations were in spring, the lowest mostly in autumn. No significant differences at p < 0.05 were observed either in the counts between the six locations, or in the seasonal counts of agrobacteria and streptomycetes between the six locations as well as within each location. The total bacterial counts (at p < 0.01) and fungi (at p < 0.05) differed significantly in the six locations. Microbial counts and the studied environmental conditions showed no significant regression. Of 552 streptomycetes strains isolated from soils collected from these locations, 58 belonged to the genus Streptoverticillium. They were distributed in five colour series grey (41%), red (31%), green (17%), blue (7%) and white (3%). Forty-eight strains had biverticillium spore bearing hyphae while only 10 had monoverticillium. While 28 strains produced distinctive reverse side pigment, only 8 and 6 strains produced soluble pigment and melanin pigment, respectively. Most strains utilized arabinose followed by fructose, mannitol, rhamnose, xylose, sucrose, inositol, and raffinose. Sixty-nine per cent of the strains exhibited activity in vitro test against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 45, 41, 28, and 7% against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Escherichia coli, respectively.
TI  - Kinetic analysis of extension of substrate specificity with Xanthomonas maltophilia, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Bacillus cereus metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  - Twenty beta-lactam molecules, including penicillins, cephalosporins, penems, carbapenems, and monobactams, were investigated as potential substrates for Xanthomonas maltophilia ULA-511, Aeromonas hydrophila AE036, and Bacillus cereus 5/B/6 metallo-beta-lactamases. A detailed analysis of the kinetic parameters examined confirmed these enzymes to be broad-spectrum beta-lactamases with different ranges of catalytic efficiency. Cefoxitin and moxalactam, substrates for the beta-lactamases from X. maltophilia ULA-511 and B. cereus 5/B/6, behaved as inactivators of the A. hydrophila AE036 metallo-beta-lactamase, which appeared to be unique among the enzymes tested in this study. In addition, we report a new, faster, and reliable purification procedure for the B. cereus 5/B/6 metallo-beta-lactamase, cloned in Escherichia coli HB101.
TI  - [The microorganism count on impression materials following disinfection by dynamic plasma treatment].
AB  - B. subtilis and B. cereus in concentrations under 10(5) mt, and of E. coli M-17 below 10(7) mt on different plaster materials die within fractures of a second after dynamic plasma processing at atmospheric pressure and at least one passing of the processed surface at a rate of 2.0 to 2.5 m/s at plasma flow power of 60 kw.
TI  - Interactions between saturated acyl chains confer detergent resistance on lipids  and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins: GPI-anchored proteins in liposomes and cells show similar behavior.
AB  - Proteins anchored by GPI are poorly solubilized from cell membranes by cold nonionic detergents because they associate with detergent-resistant membranes rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids. In this study, we demonstrated that cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich liposomes were incompletely solubilized by Triton X-100. GPI-anchored placental alkaline phosphatase incorporated in these liposomes was also not solubilized by cold Triton X-100. As sphingolipids have much higher melting temperatures (Tm) than cellular phospholipids, a property correlated with Tm might cause detergent inextractability. In support of this idea, we found that the low-Tm lipid dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) was efficiently extracted from detergent-resistant liposomes by Triton X-100, whereas the high-Tm lipid dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) was not. The fluorescence polarization of liposome-incorporated diphenylhexatriene was measured to determine the "fluidity" of the detergent-resistant liposomes. We found that these liposomes were about as fluid as DPPC/cholesterol liposomes, which were present in the liquid-ordered phase, and much less fluid than DOPC or DOPC/cholesterol liposomes. These findings may explain the behavior of GPI-anchored proteins, which often have saturated fatty acyl chains and should prefer a less-fluid membrane. Therefore, we propose that acyl chain interactions can influence the association of GPI-anchored proteins with detergent-resistant membrane lipids. The affinity of GPI-anchored proteins for a sphingolipid-rich membrane phase that is not in the liquid crystalline state may be important in determining their cellular localization.
TI  - pH and acidity in lactic-fermenting cereal gruels: effects on viability of enteropathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Survival of Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri during lactic acid fermentation of cereal gruels prepared from low-tannin (white) and high-tannin (red) sorghum varieties was studied. A previously fermented gruel (starter culture, SC) recycled daily or stored for 7, 14 or 28 days, germinated cereal flour (power flour, PF), or a combination of PF and SC (PF+SC) were used as starters. At 24 h, the pH of all gruels with added starter was </=4; the pH in control gruels without starter was >/=5.2. pH decrease was significantly faster in gruels made with PF+SC than with either PF or SC alone (P<0.05). A daily recycled SC resulted in a significantly faster decrease in pH (P<0.05) than SC stored for more than 7 days. Acid production was correlated with pH decrease (r=-0.94; P<0.01). In control gruels, the enteropathogens remained at the inoculation level or increased in number. Their growth was inhibited within 24 to 48 h in the fermented gruels, in the order: Bacillus > Campylobacter > Escherichia coli > Salmonella > Shigella. The inhibition rate was significantly faster in fermenting gruel with PF+SC (P<0.05) than in gruel with PF or SC alone and correlated with pH development (r=0.71; P<0.01). Both white and red sorghum gruels gave similar results. Using PF+SC as a starter resulted in a faster decrease in pH as well as a more rapid inhibition of enteropathogenic microorganisms. The effect is optimal if the SC is transferred daily.
TI  - A device to measure the oxygen uptake rate of attached cells: importance in bioartificial organ design.
AB  - Quantification of the dependence of cellular oxygen uptake rate (OUR) on oxygen partial pressure is useful for the design and testing of bioartificial devices which utilize cells. Thus far, this information has only been obtained from suspended cells and from cells attached to microcarriers. In this work, a device was developed to obtain the dependence of OUR on oxygen partial pressure for anchorage-dependent cells cultured in standard culture dishes. The device is placed and sealed on the top of the culture dish, and holds a Clark polarographic mini-electrode flush with the bottom surface of the device. It also houses a motor to spin a magnetic stir bar within the cell chamber to insure that the medium is well-mixed. Several characteristics of the device--such as oxygen leakage into the device chamber, electrode-lag time, and linearity of the electrode at low oxygen partial pressures--were quantified and their potential effect on the values of Vm (maximal OUR) and K0.5 (oxygen partial pressure at which OUR is half-maximal) were evaluated. Comparison of Vm and K0.5 values obtained with this device with previously published values for suspended rat hepatocytes, Bacillus cereus, and E. coli indicated that the technique provides values accurate within 30% as long as the cell under study has a K0.5 greater than approximately 1.0 mmHg. For hepatocytes cultured on 0.05 mm thickness collagen gel for 1 day (n = 4) and 3 days (n = 6), Vm was found to be 0.38 +/- 0.12 and 0.25 +/- 0.09 nmol O2/S/10(6) cells, respectively, and K0.5 was found to be 5.6 +/- 0.5 and 3.3 +/- 0.6 mmHg, respectively. This technique should aid in predicting bioreactor conditions such as flow rate, cell density, distance of cell from flow, and gas phase oxygen partial pressure which can lead to oxygen limitations. In addition, further studies of the effect of factors such as extracellular matrix composition, metabolic substrate, and drugs on the dependence of OUR on oxygen partial pressure for many anchorage-dependent cell types can be pursued with this technique.

TI  - Glutamine synthetase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: extracellular release and characterization of its enzymatic activity.
AB  - We have investigated the activity and extracellular release of glutamine synthetase [L-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming), EC 6.3.1.2] of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The purified, homogeneous M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase appears to consist of 12 most likely identical subunits of M(r) 58,000, arranged in two superimpose hexagons. In the catalysis of L-glutamine, the enzyme has an apparent Km for L-glutamate of approximately 3 mM at the pH optimum of 7.5. M. tuberculosis releases a large proportion (approximately 30%) of its total measurable enzyme activity into the culture medium, a feature that is highly specific for pathogenic mycobacteria. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed that M. tuberculosis also releases the enzyme into its phagosome in infected human monocytes. Two potentially important roles for glutamine synthase in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis infection are (i) the synthesis of L-glutamine, a major component of the cell wall of pathogenic but not nonpathogenic mycobacteria, and (ii) the modulation of the ammonia level in the M. tuberculosis phagosome, which may in turn influence phagosomal pH and phagosomelysosome fusion.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of indolocarbazole and bis-indole protein kinase C inhibitors.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of twenty-two substances structurally related to staurosporine, aglycone in the indolocarbazole and bis-indole series were examined against Streptomyces chartreusis and Streptomyces griseus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and Botrytis cinerea. Inhibition of sporulation was examined also on the two species of Streptomyces. Unlike literature reports for efficient protein kinase inhibitors, staurosporine and K-252a, no evident correlation could be found either between protein kinase inhibitory potencies and inhibition of sporulation of the Streptomyces species, or protein kinase inhibitory potencies and growth of all microorganisms tested. A weak activity against C. albicans was observed for the chloro-indolocarbazole compounds as already reported for structurally related substances from the cyanobacterium Tolypothrix tjipanasensis.
TI  - Modes of inhibition of foodborne non-Salmonella bacteria by selenite cystine selective broth.
AB  - Various cell densities of six common foodborne non-Salmonella bacteria were exposed to selenite cystine (SC) Salmonella selective medium. The insensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris to SC was confirmed. Selenite cystine selective medium was effective against the sensitive bacteria up to certain cell densities, beyond which the bacteria survived. As judged from the minimum cell number required for survival in SC, Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive to SC, followed by Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii. When sensitive bacteria were grown in SC, they enriched resistant variants which exhibited no or reduced sensitivity to SC. The change in density of sensitive cells after exposure to SC suggested that bacterial sensitivity to SC depended on the efficiency of killing and growth inhibition by SC as well as the fraction of resistant variants in the bacterial population. Since Salmonella samples generally contain unknown numbers and types of sensitive bacteria, it is difficult to predict the effectiveness of their selective inhibition by SC.
TI  - Responses of diverse heterotrophic bacteria to elevated copper concentrations.
AB  - The influence of copper on the growth of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus (three strains), and an unidentified Vibrio sp. was examined in batch cultures. The effects of copper at micromolar concentrations varied from undetectable to complete growth inhibition. Each strain was able to recover from a growth lag observed after copper addition at a characteristic concentration. Copper concentrations that allowed recovery ranged from 25 to 150 microM. Extracellular proteins in the medium of cultures that had recovered from copper stress were compared with those from control cultures. Protein profiles were analyzed for the presence of proteins similar to extracellular copper-binding proteins (CuBP) previously reported in V. alginolyticus. CuBP-like proteins were found in each Vibrio sp. examined. A protein of similar molecular mass was also detected in copper-stressed cultures of P. aeruginosa and not in control cultures. Escherichia coli and Bacillus spp. did not produce CuBP-like proteins. The data show that CuBP-like proteins are not produced by all bacteria in response to copper stress and indicate that such proteins are common in marine Vibrio spp.
TI  - Bacteriological analysis of uncooked pork sausages in relation to public health.
AB  - One hundred and eighteen samples of uncooked pork sausages were analysed bacteriologically. The total aerobic plate count ranged from 1.8 x 10(8) to 9.2 x 10(8) CFU/g in the samples. High mean counts of Staphylococci, Enterococci, Micrococci, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella and Coliforms were observed. Staphylococcus aureus were encountered with count range 2.8 x 10(6) CFU/g to 7.4 x 10(6) CFU/g. The viable count of Escherichia coli ranged from 2.0 x 10(5) to 4.3 x 10(5) CFU/g. Clostridium perfringens were detected in 66.9% of samples with a count ranging from 3.9 x 10(2) to 1.1 x 10(7) Cl. perfringens/g. None of 118 samples contained Yersinia enterocolitica.
TI  - Insecticidal activity of the CryIIA protein from the NRD-12 isolate of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki expressed in Escherichia coli and Bacillus thuringiensis and in a leaf-colonizing strain of Bacillus cereus.
AB  - A 4.0-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment encoding the cryIIA operon from the NRD-12 isolate of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki was cloned into Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the 2.2-kb AccI-HindIII fragment containing the NRD-12 cryIIA gene was identical to the HD-1 and HD-263 cryIIA gene sequences. Expression of cryIIA and subsequent purification of CryIIA inclusion bodies resulted in a protein with insecticidal activity against Heliothis virescens, Trichoplusia ni, and Culex quinquefasciatus but not Spodoptera exigua. The 4.0-kb BamII-HindIII fragment encoding the cryIIA operon was inserted into the B. thuringiensis-E. coli shuttle vector pHT3101 (pMAU1). pMAU1 was used to transform an acrystalliferous HD-1 strain of B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki and a leaf-colonizing strain of B. cereus (BT-8) by using electroporation. Spore-crystal mixtures from both transformed strains were toxic to H. virescens and T. ni but not Helicoverpa zea or S. exigua.
TI  - Structure and expression of a gene coding for thermostable alpha-glucosidase with a broad substrate specificity from Bacillus sp. SAM1606.
AB  - We cloned an alpha-glucosidase gene from thermophilic Bacillus sp. SAM1606 to overexpress it in Escherichia coli transformants. Deletion of the 5'-noncoding region as well as expression of the alpha-glucosidase gene under the control of the icp promotor of the insecticidal crystal protein gene from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. sotto enhanced the enzyme productivity to 23.5 U/ml, which was 12,000-fold higher than that obtained by the strain SAM1606. The open reading frame corresponding to the alpha-glucosidase encoded 587 amino acid residues including a residue coded by the initiation codon TTG, and the molecular mass of the alpha-glucosidase from N-terminal serine was calculated to be 68,886 Da. Sequence analysis revealed that the SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase belonged to the alpha-amylase family. The SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase showed extremely high sequence identity (62-65%) to the Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thermoglucosidasius oligo-1,6-glucosidases, which were 72% identical to each other. Sequence identity in the suggested active site regions were essentially the same (80-82%) among these three enzymes. However, the substrate specificity of the SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase was significantly different from those of the oligo-1,6-glucosidases. The thermostability of these three alpha-glucosidases could be correlated with the increase in the number of proline residues, whose occurrence was predicted at beta turns and coils in the enzymes.
TI  - Hemolysin II is more characteristic of Bacillus thuringiensis than Bacillus cereus.
AB  - To investigate the distribution of the hemolysin II determinant among strains of  Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis, thirteen strains of B. cereus and fourteen strains of B. thuringiensis strains were tested for hybridization of their chromosomal DNAs with a DNA probe containing the B. cereus hemolysin II gene. In addition, the production of hemolysin II, whose activity is not inhibited by cholesterol, was tested. The presence (absence) of the hydridization response in the microorganisms's genome correlated with the presence (absence) of cholesterol-unaffected hemolysin production. Only four out of thirteen B. cereus strains were found to give a positive response in hybridization experiments, whereas thirteen out of fourteen B. thuringiensis strains responded positively. DNAs from ten B. thuringiensis strains contained a 3.5 kb EcoRV fragment, which hybridized with the B. cereus hemolysin II gene probe. The 3.5 kb EcoRV DNA fragment from one of these strains (B. thuringiensis VKM-B1555) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli cells. The hemolysin encoded by the cloned DNA fragment was not inhibited by cholesterol and possessed all other properties of B. cereus hemolysin II. The obtained data clearly show limited distribution of hemolysin II among B. cereus strains and demonstrate that hemolysin II is more characteristic of B. thuringiensis than B. cereus.
TI  - Cloning of the blasticidin S deaminase gene (BSD) from Aspergillus terreus and its use as a selectable marker for Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Pyricularia oryzae.
AB  - Aspergillus terreus produces a unique enzyme, blasticidin S deaminase, which catalyzes the deamination of blasticidin S (BS), and in consequence confers high resistance to the antibiotic. A cDNA clone derived from the structural gene for BS deaminase (BSD) was isolated by transforming Escherichia coli with an Aspergillus cDNA expression library and directly selecting for the ability to grow in the presence of the antibiotic. The complete nucleotide sequence of BSD was determined and proved to contain an open reading frame of 393 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 130 amino acids. Comparison of its nucleotide sequence with that of bsr, the BS deaminase gene isolated from Bacillus cereus, indicated no homology and a large difference in codon usage. The activity of BSD expressed in E. coli was easily quantified by an assay based on spectrophotometric recording. The BSD gene was placed in a shuttle vector for Schizosaccharomyces pombe, downstream of the SV40 early region promoter, and this allowed direct selection with BS at high frequency, following transformation into the yeast. The BSD gene was also employed as a selectable marker for Pyricularia oryzae, which could not be transformed to BS resistance by bsr. These result promise that the BSD gene will be useful as a new dominant selectable marker for eukaryotes.
TI  - Molecular characterization of an enterobacterial metallo beta-lactamase found in  a clinical isolate of Serratia marcescens that shows imipenem resistance.
AB  - A clinical isolate of Serratia marcescens (TN9106) produced a metallo beta-lactamase (IMP-1) which conferred resistance to imipenem and broad-spectrum beta-lactams. The blaIMP gene providing imipenem resistance was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli HB101. The IMP-1 was purified from E. coli HB101 that harbors pSMBNU24 carrying blaIMP, and its apparent molecular mass was calculated to be about 30 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Kinetic studies of IMP-1 against various beta-lactams revealed that this enzyme hydrolyzes not only various broad-spectrum beta-lactams but also carbapenems. However, aztreonam was relatively stable against IMP-1. Although clavulanate or cloxacillin failed to inhibit IMP-1, Hg2+, Fe2+, or Cu2+ blocked the enzyme's activity. Moreover, the presence of EDTA in the reaction buffer resulted in a decrease in the enzyme's activity. Carbapenem resistance was not transferred from S. marcescens TN9106 to E. coli CSH2 by conjugation. A hybridization study confirmed that blaIMP was encoded on the chromosome of S. marcescens TN9106. By nucleotide sequencing analysis, blaIMP was found to encode a protein of 246 amino acid residues and was shown to have considerable homology to the metallo beta-lactamase genes of Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Aeromonas hydrophila. The G+C content of blaIMP was 39.4%. Four consensus amino acid residues, His-95, His-97, Cys-176, and His-215, which form putative zinc ligands, were conserved in the deduced amino acid sequence of IMP-1. By determination of the amino acid sequence at the N terminus of purified mature IMP-1, 18 amino acid residues were found to be processed from the N terminus of the premature enzyme as a signal peptide. These results clearly show that IMP-1 is an enterobacterial metallo beta-lactamase, of which the primary structure has been completely determined, that confers resistance to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum beta-lactams.
TI  - Studies of one invasive and two noninvasive methods for detection of bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates.
AB  - Recently, a new method for noninvasive detection of bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates was described [Arpi et al.: Vox Sang 1993;65:335-336]. A CO2-sensitive label is applied on the outer surface of the plastic container of the platelet concentrate. When any contaminating bacteria have increased the pCO2 to a certain level the label changes color, indicating bacterial growth. We have studied this technique and applied such sensitive labels both directly onto PCs and onto plastic bags with culture medium into which platelet contents have been transferred. However, in both cases the sensitivity of the technique was found insufficient for practical quality control of PCs. There seem to be two problems with this principle: (1) platelets produce CO2 and (2) a considerable amount of the gas passes beside the detection label, in this way decreasing the sensitivity of detection by the label. This noninvasive technique was compared with an invasive method using automated bacterial culture, which was found sensitive and rapid.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and mutagenesis of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus: a potential staphylococcal virulence factor.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus secretes a phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) which is able to hydrolyze the membrane lipid PI and membrane protein anchors containing glycosyl-PI. The gene for PI-PLC (plc) was cloned from S. aureus into Escherichia coli. Oligonucleotide probes based on partial protein sequence and polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified protein were used to identify positive clones. E. coli transformed with a plasmid containing the plc gene expressed PI-PLC enzyme activity which was abolished by mutagenesis with a tetracycline resistance gene. The plc gene was present in all 15 S. aureus strains examined but not in any of 6 coagulase-negative staphylococcal species. The plc gene contained 984 bp and coded for a mature protein with a calculated molecular mass of 34,107 Da. Amino acid sequence comparisons indicated that the staphylococcal plc gene was similar (51 to 56%) to the PI-PLCs from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Listeria monocytogenes. The recombinant PI-PLC expressed in E. coli was purified and exhibited biochemical properties identical to those of the native PI-PLC from S. aureus. PI-PLC production was decreased in agr mutant strains of S. aureus. However, PI-PLC production by both agr+ and agr mutant strains exhibited a similar dependence on the type of medium used. These data suggested that PI-PLC production was regulated by both agr-dependent and agr-independent mechanisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured Indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  - Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus laterosporus, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. The effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3) cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by the agar incorporation method. Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. This study indicated the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of foods.
TI  - [Evidence of the existence of hemolysin II from Bacillus cereus: cloning the genetic determinant of hemolysin II].
AB  - The hemolysin genetic determinant distinct from cereolysin AB genetic determinant (lecithinase and sphingomyelinase genes) has been cloned in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis cells as an EcoRI fragment (2.9 kb) of Bacillus cereus VKM-B771 chromosome DNA. The hemolytic product encoded by the cloned DNA fragment possessed all the properties of hemolysin II known to date: it was not inhibited by cholesterol, exhibited the Arrhenius effect, and had a relatively long (in comparison with cereolysin) lag period in erythrocyte lysis. The cloned DNA fragment was concluded to contain the gene of hemolysin II from B. cereus. In contrast to previous suggestions that hemolitic activity ascribed to hemolysin II is due to the combined action of sphingomyelinase and lecithinase, the results obtained present convincing evidence that hemolysin II is an independent B. cereus hemolytic factor different from cereolysin AB.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of the hblA gene encoding the B component  of hemolysin BL from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Previous evidence suggests that hemolysin BL, which consists of a binding component, B, and two lytic components, L1 and L2, is the enterotoxin responsible for the diarrheal form of gastroenteritis caused by food-borne strains of Bacillus cereus. To prove that hemolysin BL and the enterotoxin are the same requires large amounts of these components free of other B. cereus proteins. For this purpose, we sought to clone the gene encoding the B component and to express it in Escherichia coli. A partial genomic library was constructed and a 29-base, 1,152-fold-degenerate oligonucleotide probe, designed from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the B component, was used to identify recombinant clones containing the gene. Detection of gene products reactive with a monoclonal antibody specific for the B component and analysis of the nucleotide sequence confirmed that isolated clones, reactive with the oligonucleotide probe, did contain the gene encoding the B component. The protein, expressed in E. coli, apparently from the B. cereus promoter, produces a ring-shaped zone of hemolysis when combined with purified L components from B. cereus, a reaction typical of hemolysin BL. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of B. cereus RNA showed a large (5.1-kb) transcript which hybridized with a 500-bp probe internal to the B-component-coding sequence, suggesting that the hblA gene encoding the B component may be transcribed as part of a polycistronic message, possibly including the structural genes for the two lytic components. Higher levels of expression and disruption of the hblA gene are being pursued to resolve whether hemolysin BL is indeed the enterotoxin.
TI  - Antitumor activities of a cephalosporin prodrug in combination with monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates.
AB  - 7-(Phenylacetamido)cephalosporin mustard (CM) and 7-(4-carboxybutanamido)cephalosporin mustard (CCM) were developed as anticancer prodrugs that could be activated site selectively by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates targeted to antigens present on tumor cell surfaces. Both CM and CCM were hydrolyzed by purified beta-lactamases from Escherichia coli (EC beta L), Bacillus cereus (BC beta L), and Enterobacter cloacae (ECl beta L). This resulted in the release of phenylenediamine mustard (PDM), a potent cytotoxic drug. The Km and kcat values of the reactions were determined, and it was found that ECl beta L effected the hydrolysis of CM and CCM more rapidly than the other enzymes. Conjugates of ECl beta L were prepared by reacting maleimide-substituted F(ab')2 fragments of the monoclonal antibodies L6 and P1.17 to ECl beta L that had been modified with sulfhydryl groups. In vitro experiments indicated that CCM (IC50 = 25-45 microM) was less toxic than PDM (IC50 = 1.5 microM) to H2981 lung adenocarcinoma cells (L6 antigen positive, P1.17 antigen negative) and that immunologically specific prodrug activation took place when the cells were treated with L6-ECl beta L. In vivo experiments in nude mice demonstrated that CCM was less toxic than CM, and that both prodrugs were much less toxic than PDM. Neither CCM nor PDM exerted antitumor activity on subcutaneous H2981 tumors in vivo. However, a significant antitumor effect was obtained in mice that received L6-ECl beta L 96 h prior to the administration of CCM. The effect was immunologically specific (P < 0.05), since a smaller degree of antitumor activity was obtained in mice that received the nonbinding control conjugate P1.17-ECl beta L prior to CCM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Production of a cloned xylanase in Bacillus cereus and its performance in kraft pulp prebleaching.
AB  - Xylanase production from a Bacillus subtilis gene cloned into a strain of Escherichia coli was monitored. Although this gene was expressed in E. coli at several temperatures, efficient xylanase secretion did not occur; the observed protein release apparently depended on cell leakage or lysis. Screening for a better microbial protein secretor free of cellulase selected Bacillus cereus No. 518. A bidirectional vector plasmid (pMK3) was employed to carry the cloned gene into this B. cereus strain. Transformation was carried out by electroporation. Total xylanase production by the new pMK3-borne gene in B. cereus was similar to that from E. coli but the xylanase was shown to be normally secreted. The xylanase gene products from the E. coli and B. cereus hosts were shown to function identically. Both xylanases improved the delignification of unbleached softwood and hardwood kraft pulps, thus reducing the Cl2 required to achieve a given degree of bleaching, without altering the physical properties of the fibers. Using a target kappa number (lignin content) of 5, xylanase pretreatment of aspen kraft (chemical) pulp led to a 22% savings of chlorine. Adsorbable organic halogens in the bleachery effluent were also lowered by more than 50%.
TI  - Dicranin, an antimicrobial and 15-lipoxygenase inhibitor from the moss Dicranum scoparium.
AB  - Extracts of nine mosses, collected in Switzerland, were screened for antimicrobial, antioxidative, and 15-lipoxygenase (15-lpo) inhibitory activities. The CH2Cl2 extract of Dicranum scoparium was found to possess pronounced antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. In addition, inhibition of soybean 15-lpo occurred at very low concentration. Phytochemical investigation of this extract afforded Z,Z,Z-octadeca-6-yne-9,12,15-trienoic acid [1] by a combination of chromatographic techniques. This compound, named dicranin [1], was found to be responsible for most of the biological activity. The strongest antimicrobial effect was observed against Streptococcus faecalis (disc diffusion assay). In contrast to the CH2Cl2 extract of D. scoparium, dicranin was inactive against E. coli. Dicranin was identified by ir, ms, and nmr spectroscopy. A 2D INADEQUATE experiment confirmed the structure and yielded the assignment of all 13C-nmr signals.
TI  - Nonspecific phospholipase C of Listeria monocytogenes: activity on phospholipids  in Triton X-100-mixed micelles and in biological membranes.
AB  - Listeria monocytogenes secretes a phospholipase C (PLC) which has 39% amino acid  sequence identity with the broad-specificity PLC from Bacillus cereus. Recent work indicates that the L. monocytogenes enzyme plays a role during infections of mammalian cells (J.-A. Vazquez-Boland, C. Kocks, S. Dramsi, H. Ohayon, C. Geoffroy, J. Mengaud, and P. Cossart, Infect. Immun. 60:219-230, 1992). The homogeneous enzyme has a specific activity of 230 mumol/min/mg when phosphatidylcholine (PC) is dispersed in sodium deoxycholate. With phospholipid-Triton X-100 mixed micelles, the enzyme had a broad pH optimum between 5.5 and 8.0, and the rates of lipid hydrolysis were in the following order: PC > phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) > phosphatidylserine > sphingomyelin >> phosphatidylinositol (PI). Activity on PC was stimulated 35% by 0.5 M NaCl and 60% by 0.05 mM ZnSO4. When Escherichia coli phospholipids were dispersed in Triton X-100, PE and phosphatidylglycerol, but not cardiolipin, were hydrolyzed. The enzyme was active on all phospholipids of vesiculated human erythrocytes including PI, which was rapidly hydrolyzed at pH 7.0. PI was also hydrolyzed in PI-PC-cholesterol liposomes by the nonspecific PLC from L. monocytogenes and by the homologous enzyme from B. cereus. The water-soluble hydrolysis product was identified as inositol-1-phosphate. For the hydrolysis of human erythrocyte ghost phospholipids, a broad pH optimum was also observed. 32P-labelled Clostridium butyricum protoplasts, which are rich in ether lipids, were treated with PLC. The enzyme hydrolyzed the plasmalogen form of PE, its glycerol acetal, and cardiolipin, in addition to PE. I-, Cl- and F- stimulated activity on either PC- Triton X-100 mixed micelles or human erythrocyte ghosts, unlike the enzyme from B. cereus which is strongly inhibited by halides. Tris-HCl, phosphate, and calcium nitrate had similar inhibitory effects on the enzyme on the enzymes from L. monocytogenes and B. cereus.
TI  - [Tyrosol--the autoregulatory d1 factor of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae].
AB  - The autoregulatory d1 factor of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that induces the transition of vegetative cells into refractory resting forms, has been isolated from the cell-free culture medium as an individual crystalline compound. It has been shown to be 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane-1-ol which is also known as tyrosol. When added to the producer culture at 5-15 microM concentration, tyrosol stimulated the endogenous respiration of cells, but inhibited at 20-80 microM concentration. At 200-800 microM concentration, it induced the occurrence of resting forms. The action of tyrosol was not specific, for it also inhibited the cell respiration of the bacteria, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus, at 64-86 microM concentration.
TI  - Biochemical and immunological properties of the C-terminal domain of the alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The C-terminal domain of the alpha-toxin (cpa247-370) of Clostridium perfringens  has been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Antiserum raised against cpa247-370 reacted in an identical manner to anti-alpha-toxin serum when used to map epitopes in the C-terminal domain, suggesting that cpa247-370 was immunologically and structurally identical to this region in the alpha-toxin. The isolated cpa247-370 was devoid of sphingomyelinase activity or haemolytic activity and was not cytotoxic for mouse lymphocytes. Haemolytic activity was detected when cpa247-370 was tested with the N-terminal domain of the alpha-toxin (cpa1-249), confirming that cpa247-370 confers haemolytic properties on the phospholipase C activity of the alpha-toxin. Haemolytic activity was not detected if cpa247-370 was tested with the Bacillus cereus phosphatidylcholine phospholipase C, nor if cpa1-249 and cpa247-370 were incubated sequentially with erythrocytes.
TI  - Sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium StyLT1 restriction-modification genes: homologies with EcoP1 and EcoP15 type-III R-M systems and presence of helicase domains.
AB  - The StyLT1 restriction-modification (R-M) system of Salmonella typhimurium has recently been suggested to belong to the type-III R-M systems [De Backer and Colson, Gene 97 (1991) 103-107]. The nucleotide sequences of StyLT1 mod and res have been determined. Two closely adjacent open reading frames were found 12 bp apart with coding capacities of 651 (Mod) and 982 (Res) amino acids (aa), respectively. The genes, lying in the same direction of transcription in the mod-res order, are transcribed as distinct units. The deduced aa sequences reveal homologies with known type-III enzymes from the Escherichia coli P1 prophage, E. coli P15 plasmid and Bacillus cereus chromosome. In addition, the StyLT1 restriction endonuclease (ENase), like other type-I and type-III ENases, contains sequence motifs characteristic of superfamily-II helicases, which may be involved in DNA unwinding at the cleavage site.
TI  - Effect of apigeninidin on the growth of selected bacteria.
AB  - Apigeninidin, a 3-deoxyanthocyanidin present in sorghum, was chemically synthesized and effectively purified by extracting impurities from aqueous 2 N HC1 into ethyl acetate. Apigeninidin (50mumol) applied to filter paper disks inhibited the growth on agar plates of selected gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, andStreptococcus faecalis) and to a lesser extent gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Serratia marcens, andShigella flexneri). Apigeninidin was not mutagenic based on the Ames assay. The ability of apigeninidin to precipitate proteins from plant extracts could be physiologically important if it can be shown to bind to specific plant proteins.
TI  - Biochemical properties of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae and cloning of the gene into Escherichia coli.
AB  - A clinical isolate of Enterobacter cloacae, strain NOR-1, exhibited resistance to imipenem and remained susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Clavulanic acid partially restored the susceptibility of the strain to imipenem. Two beta-lactamases with isoelectric points (pI) of 6.9 and > 9.2 were detected in strain E. cloacae NOR-1; the higher pI corresponded to AmpC cephalosporinase. Plasmid DNA was not detected in E. cloacae NOR-1 and imipenem resistance could not be transferred into Escherichia coli JM109. The carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene was cloned into plasmid pACYC184. One recombinant plasmid, pPTN1, harbored a 5.3-kb Sau3A fragment from E. cloacae NOR-1 expressing the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase. This enzyme (pI 6.9) hydrolyzed ampicillin, cephalothin, and imipenem more rapidly than it did meropenem and aztreonam, but it hydrolyzed extended-spectrum cephalosporins only weakly and did not hydrolyze cefoxitin. Hydrolytic activity was partially inhibited by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam, was nonsusceptible to chelating agents such as EDTA and 1,10-o-phenanthroline, and was independent of the presence of ZnCl2. Its relative molecular mass was 30,000 Da. Induction experiments concluded that the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase biosynthesis was inducible by cefoxitin and imipenem. Subcloning experiments with HindIII partial digests of pPTN1 resulted in a recombinant plasmid, designated pPTN2, which contained a 1.3-kb insert from pPTN1 and which conferred resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Hybridization studies performed with a 1.2-kb HindIII fragment from pPtN2 failed to determine any homology with ampC of E. cloacae, with other known beta-lactamase genes commonly found in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (bla(TEM-1)) and bla(SHV-3) derivatives), and with previously described carbapenemase genes such as those from Xanthomonas maltophilia, Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis (cfiA), and Aeromonas hydrophila (cphA). This work describing the biochemical properties of a novel chromosome-encoded beta-lactamase from E. cloacae indicates that this enzyme differs from all the previously described carbapenemases. This is the first reported cloning of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing gene from a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Genetic construction, expression, and characterization of a single chain anti-carcinoma antibody fused to beta-lactamase.
AB  - We report the genetic construction and expression of a fusion protein between an  antibody single chain-linked variable domain fragment specific for human carcinomas and beta-lactamase II from Bacillus cereus. Sequences encoding the variable regions of the L6 monoclonal antibody were assembled so as to be separated from each other by an 18-amino acid linker and from the mature form of beta-lactamase by a 6-amino acid linker. The construct was placed under the transcriptional regulation of the lac promoter, and the PelB signal sequence was used to direct export of the fusion protein to the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli. After induction, biologically active material was recovered from both culture supernatants and cell lysates. Affinity chromatography yielded about 2.5 micrograms of protein/ml of initial culture volume. The fusion protein was shown to bind to tumor cells at least as well as chemically prepared F(ab') and to maintain beta-lactamase activity at a level similar to that of the native enzyme. Tumor cells coated with the fusion protein were sensitive to a cephalosporin mustard prodrug in a dose-dependent fashion comparable to that of enzyme chemically conjugated to F(ab'). This article demonstrates the feasibility of using single chain-linked variable domain-enzyme fusion proteins for the activation of anticancer prodrugs.
TI  - Prokaryotic members of a new family of putative helicases with similarity to transcription activator SNF2.
AB  - Cloning and sequence analysis of a new open reading frame from Bacillus cereus reveals the relationship to a recently identified family of putative eukaryotic transcription activators similar to the yeast SNF2 gene product. As a result of comparative analysis of sequence features conserved in all members of this family, a gene from a chilo iridescent virus, as well as a putative helicase from Escherichia coli (hepA), can also be grouped into this family. The unexpected presence of prokaryotic and viral sequences in the previously purely eukaryotic SNF2 family suggests a defined subgroup of DNA helicases present in all species, with specific function in transcription activation.
TI  - Effect of three preservatives on the growth of Bacillus cereus, Vero cytotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, on plates with gradients of pH and sodium chloride concentration.
AB  - The effect of temperature, pH, sodium chloride concentration and a preservative (sodium benzoate, sodium nitrite or potassium sorbate) on the growth of three foodborne bacterial pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Vero cytotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) was studied using gradient gel plates. Growth, expressed in optical density units, was recorded using image analysis techniques, and was expressed as three-dimensional grids. These gave a visual indication of the effects of any three of the environmental factors on bacterial proliferation. Sorbate was completely effective against E. coli at all temperature/pH/NaCl combinations, and was the most effective preservative tested against B. cereus. Increase in the acidity and/or the NaCl concentration improved the effect of all the preservatives, except nitrite when used against St. aureus. Nitrite was the least effective preservative, particularly against St. aureus. At < 25 degrees C, sorbate was more effective than benzoate against St. aureus when used with higher concentrations of NaCl. At 35 degrees C benzoate was the most effective preservative against St. aureus, especially when used at pH < 6.
TI  - Cloning of the beta-amylase gene from Bacillus cereus and characteristics of the  primary structure of the enzyme.
AB  - The gene encoding the beta-amylase of Bacillus cereus BQ10-S1 (SpoII) was cloned  into Escherichia coli JM 109. A sequenced DNA fragment of 2,001 bp contains the beta-amylase gene. The N-terminal sequences (AVNGKG MNPDYKAYLMAPLKKI), the C-terminal sequences (SHTSSW), and the amino acid sequences of the five regions in the beta-amylase molecules were determined. The mature beta-amylase contains 514 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 57,885 Da. The amino acid sequence homology with those of known beta-amylases was 52.7% for Bacillus polymyxa, 52.0% for Bacillus circulans, 43.4% for Clostridium thermosulfurogenes, 31.8% for Arabidopsis thaliana, 31.5% for barley, 29.9% for sweet potato, and 28.9% for soybean. Ten well-conserved regions were found between the N terminus and the area around residue 430, but the C-terminal region of 90 residues has no similarity with those of the plant beta-amylases. The homology search revealed that this C-terminal region has homology with C-terminal regions of the beta-amylase from C. thermosulfurogenes, some bacterial alpha-amylases, cyclodextrin glucanotransferase, and glucoamylase. Some of these sequences are known as the raw-starch-binding domain. These results suggest that B. cereus beta-amylase has an extra domain which has raw-starch-binding ability and that the domain has considerable sequence homology with those of other amylases or related enzymes from a wide variety of microorganisms.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding a calcium-dependent exoproteinase from Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14581.
AB  - The gene nprM encoding the calcium-dependent extracellular proteinase from Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14581 was cloned in the vector pBR322 and expressed in Escherichia coli HB101. The DNA sequence of the cloned 3.7 kb fragment revealed only one open reading frame consisting of 1686 bp with a coding capacity of 562 amino acid residues. A predicted Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence was observed 9 bp upstream from the presumptive translation start site (ATG). A possible promoter sequence (TAGACG for the -35 region and TATAAT for the -10 region) was found about 69 bp upstream of the ATG start site. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited a 24 amino acid residue signal peptide and an additional polypeptide 'pro' sequence of 221 amino acids preceding the putative mature protein of 317 amino acid residues. Amino acid sequence comparison revealed 84.5% homology between the mature protein and that of a thermolabile neutral protease from B. cereus. It also shares 73% homology with the thermostable neutral proteases of B. thermoproteolyticus and B. stearothermophilus. The zinc-binding sites and the catalytic residues are completely conserved in all four proteases. NprM has a temperature optimum of 58 degrees C, a pH optimum of between 6.4 and 7.2, and is stimulated by calcium ions and inhibited by EDTA. These results indicate that the enzyme is a neutral (metallo-) protease.
TI  - Type selective inhibition of microbial fatty acid synthases by thiolactomycin.
AB  - The antibiotic, thiolactomycin, is known to selectively inhibit the Type II straight-chain fatty acid synthase (monofunctional enzyme system, e.g. Escherichia coli enzyme) but not Type I straight-chain fatty acid synthase (multifunctional enzyme system, e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme). We have studied the effect of thiolactomycin on the branched-chain fatty acid synthases from Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus insolitus. Fatty acid synthase from all three Bacilli was not inhibited or only slightly inhibited by thiolactomycin. E. coli synthase, as expected, was strongly inhibited by thiolactomycin. Branched-chain fatty acid synthase from Bacillus species is a monofunctional enzyme system but, unlike Type II E. coli synthase, it is largely insensitive to thiolactomycin.
TI  - [The nutritive effect of Bacillus cereus as a probiotic in the raising of piglets. 2. Effect and microbial count, composition and resistance determination of gastrointestinal and fecal microflora].
AB  - After a feeding trial of 42 days with 4 x 12 piglets 4 x 6 piglets were slaughtered and the influence of spores of the Bacillus cereus strain FH 1457 S added to the feed on the microorganism counts of Lactobacillus/Bifidobacterium, Eubacteria, Bacteroidaceae, E. coli, Enterococcus and passants (Bacillus cereus) in duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and colon was investigated. Beside a negative control the feed was supplemented with 10(7), 10(8) and 10(9) CFU Bacillus cereus/kg. The feeding trial included two periods each of 21 days. In each period faeces was collected from all animals and the influence on the microorganism counts and also the frequency of resistance of the E. coli and Enterococcus germs against selected antibiotics and chemotherapeutics investigated. The addition of 10(8) CFU Bacillus cereus decreased E. coli counts in duodenum and jejunum, however increased them in ileum, caecum and colon. In the highest dosage the counts of Bacillus cereus in duodenum, caecum, colon and faeces were significantly higher. The addition of Bacillus cereus reduced the counts of E. coli and Enterococcus in faeces in the first period. In the second period the dosage 10(8) CFU showed significant increased counts of E. coli and the sums of microorganisms of the main and satellite flora. The additions had no influence on the frequency of resistance of E. coli and enterococci against the tested antibiotics and synthetic chemotherapeutics. From the addition of Bacillus cereus in this case a selection of factors influencing resistance is not to be expected.
TI  - Cloning of a gene from Bacillus cereus with homology to the mreB gene from Escherichia coli.
AB  - We have cloned and sequenced a gene coding for a putative shape-determining protein (MreB) highly homologous to the mreB gene product of Escherichia coli. The amino acid (aa) identity was 53% and the similarity 72%. The gene is expressed early in the logarithmic phase. The aa sequence comparison showed that the protein, like the E. coli MreB, has structural similarity to actin and heat-shock protein Hsc70 encoded by a new super-gene family.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and deduced functions of a set of cotranscribed genes of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) including the polyketide synthase for the antibiotic actinorhodin.
AB  - A 5.3-kb region of the Streptomyces coelicolor actinorhodin gene cluster, including the genes for polyketide biosynthesis, was sequenced. Six identified open reading frames (ORF1-6) were related to genetically characterized mutations of classes actI, VII, IV, and VB by complementation analysis. ORF1-6 run divergently from the adjacent actIII gene, which encodes the polyketide synthase (PKS) ketoreductase, and appear to form an operon. The deduced gene products of ORF1-3 are similar to fatty acid synthases (FAS) of different organisms and PKS genes from other polyketide producers. The predicted ORF5 gene product is similar to type II beta-lactamases of Bacillus cereus and Bacteroides fragilis. The ORF6 product does not resemble other known proteins. Combining the genetical, biochemical, and similarity data, the potential activities of the products of the six genes can be postulated as: 1) condensing enzyme/acyl transferase (ORF1 + ORF2); 2) acyl carrier protein (ORF3); 3) putative cyclase/dehydrase (ORF4); 4) dehydrase (ORF5); and 5) "dimerase" (ORF6). The data show that the actinorhodin PKS consists of discrete monofunctional components, like that of the Escherichia coli (Type II) FAS, rather than the multifunctional polypeptides for the macrolide PKSs and vertebrate FASs (Type I).
TI  - Organization and nucleotide sequence of the glutamine synthetase (glnA) gene from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  - A 3.3-kb BamHI fragment of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus DNA was cloned and sequenced. It complements an Escherichia coli glnA deletion strain and hybridizes strongly to a DNA containing the Bacillus subtilis glnA gene. DNA sequence analysis of the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus DNA showed it to contain the glnA gene encoding class I glutamine synthetase, as judged by extensive homology with other prokaryotic glnA genes. The sequence suggests that the enzyme encoded in this gene is not controlled by adenylylation. Based on a comparison of glutamine synthetase sequences, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is much closer to gram-positive eubacteria, especially Clostridium acetobutylicum, than to gram-negative eubacteria and archaebacteria. The fragment contains another open reading frame encoding a protein of unknown function consisting of 306 amino acids (ORF306), which is also present upstream of glnA of Bacillus cereus. In B. cereus, a repressor gene, glnR, is found between the open reading frame and glnA. Two proteins encoded by the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus gene were identified by the maxicell method; the sizes of these proteins are consistent with those of the open reading frames of ORF306 and glnA. The lack of a glnR gene in the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus DNA in this position may indicate a gene rearrangement or a different mechanism of glnA gene expression.
TI  - An investigation of dye reduction by food-borne bacteria.
AB  - The rates of reduction of seven redox dyes by 13 bacterial strains were measured  and found to vary greatly between different bacterium/dye combinations. Phenazine ethosulphate and toluidine blue were the most rapidly reduced dyes by the majority of bacteria and resorufin and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone were reduced slowly, if at all. There was also considerable variation in the rates of reduction with any single dye/organism combination. Glucose stimulated the rates of endogenous dye reduction in about half of the organisms. For Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Escherichia coli, dye reduction was stimulated by a range of exogenous substrates but lactose, the primary available carbon and energy source in milk, had little effect. In Lactococcus lactis, dye reduction was stimulated by sugars but not by organic acids. Oxygen successfully competed with dye reduction in organisms containing respiratory chains, but with membrane fractions, dye reduction was more rapid than oxygen consumption. All the organisms showed little cytosolic dye reduction, except L. lactis which showed substantial rates of reduction of some dyes by this fraction. With the membrane fraction of E. coli and Ps. fluorescens, cyanide inhibited NADH and succinate-dependent dye reduction, Antimycin A inhibited lactate and succinate and rotenone had no significant effect, but inhibition was not always observed with membrane from both organisms.
TI  - Evaluation of the effect of 3 probiotics on experimental Escherichia coli enterotoxaemia in weaned piglets.
AB  - In this report the efficacy of 3 different probiotics (Bacillus cereus "toyoi", Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus faecium) was investigated. They were supplemented in the food of recently weaned piglets that were orally infected with E. coli O141 K85ab. Supplementation could not prevent mortality and clinical symptoms nor reduce the faecal excretion of hemolytic E. coli. The possible explanations for the unsatisfying results are various.
TI  - Formycins A and B and some analogues: selective inhibitors of bacterial (Escherichia coli) purine nucleoside phosphorylase.
AB  - Formycin B (FB), a moderate inhibitor (Ki approximately 100 microM) of mammalian  purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), and formycin A (FA), which is totally inactive vs. the mammalian enzyme, are both effective inhibitors of the bacterial (Escherichia coli) enzyme (Ki approximately 5 microM). Examination of a series of N-methyl analogues of FA and FB led to the finding that N(6)-methyl-FA, virtually inactive vs. the mammalian enzyme, is the most potent inhibitor of E. coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (Ki approximately 0.3 uM) at neutral pH. Inhibition is competitive not only with respect to Ino, but also relative to 7-methyl-Guo and 7-methyl-Ado, as substrates. Both oxoformycins A and B are relatively poor inhibitors. For the most potent inhibitor, N(6)-methyl-FA, it was shown that the enzyme preferentially binds the neutral, and not the cationic, form. In accordance with this the neutral, but not the cationic form, of the structurally related N(1)-methyl-Ado was found to be an excellent substrate. Reported data on tautomerism of formycins were profited from, and extended, to infer which tautomeric species and ionic forms are the active inhibitors. A commercially available (Sigma) bacterial PNP, of unknown origin, was shown to differ from the E. coli enzyme by its inability to phosphorylase Ado; this enzyme was also resistant to FA and FB. These findings have been extended to provide a detailed comparison of the substrate/inhibitor properties of PNP from various microorganisms.
TI  - Monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates for the activation of a cephalosporin mustard prodrug.
AB  - Cephalosporin mustard (CM) was designed as an anticancer prodrug that could be activated in a site-specific manner by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates targeted to antigens present on tumor cell surfaces. Purified beta-lactamases from Bacillus cereus (BC beta L) and Escherichia coli (EC beta L) catalyzed the release of phenylenediamine mustard (PDM) from CM through a fragmentation reaction which occurs after the beta-lactam ring of CM is hydrolyzed. The Km and Vmax values were 5.7 microM and 201 mumol/min per mg for BC beta L and 43 microM and 29 mumol/min per mg for EC beta L, respectively. Conjugates of BC beta L were prepared by combining the F(ab')2 fragments of the maleimide-substituted monoclonal antibodies L6 and 1F5 with thiolated BC beta L. The conjugates showed little loss in enzymatic activity and bound nearly as well as the unmodified F(ab')2 monoclonal antibodies to antigens expressed on the H2981 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (L6 positive, 1F5 negative). PDM was approximately 50-fold more cytotoxic than CM to H2981 cells. Treatment of the cells with L6-BC beta L followed by CM resulted in a level of cytotoxic activity that was comparable to that of PDM. This was most likely due to activation of CM by conjugate that bound to cell-surface antigens, since pretreatment of H2981 cells with BC beta L or 1F5-BC beta L enhanced the activity of CM to a lesser extent. Thus, we have shown that CM is a prodrug, and that it can be activated with immunological specificity by a monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugate.
TI  - Relationship between selected bacteria and the growth of immature house flies, Musca domestica, in an axenic test system.
AB  - To investigate the relationship between immature (maggot) house flies, Musca domestica, and bacteria, we compared the development of sterile first-instar maggots in each of 10 pure blood agar cultures of bacteria with growth on sterile blood agar (negative control) and on standard house fly rearing medium (positive control). Nine species of bacteria representing gram-negative and gram-positive rods, coccoid, and micrococcoid cell types supported house fly growth on blood agar. One bacterium, a strain of Bacillus cereus, inhibited maggot growth. The percent pupation for maggots that developed in the presence of eight of nine bacteria (range, 41-69%), was significantly greater than in sterile blood agar (0-5%), and did not differ significantly from maggot growth in the rearing medium (50-90%). Average pupal weight for maggots that developed on blood agar with bacteria ranged from 19 to 21 mg, a reflection of favorable growth conditions. Average pupal weight in the presence of three bacteria (19.9, 19.4, and 19.4 mg) was significantly less than respective pupal weights in house fly rearing medium (24.0, 22.3, and 22.1 mg), but there was no difference in average pupal weight with six bacteria and the house fly rearing medium. These findings illustrate that bacteria or their metabolic products are essential as nutrients for house fly maggot growth in blood agar; a wide variety of adventitious bacteria can contribute to the suitability of an organic substrate for maggot growth; and a naturally occurring isolate of B. cereus limits house fly maggot growth in blood agar, a relationship that has not been reported previously.
TI  - Critical micelle concentration and hemolytic activity--a correlation suggested by the marine sterol, halistanol trisulfate.
AB  - The marine natural product, halistanol trisulfate, has a relatively low critical  micelle concentration of 0.001% m/v (14.5 microM) and strong hemolytic potency with an EC50 of 0.00046% m/v (6.67 microM). As expected of a detergent, it inhibits the growth of gram-positive but not gram-negative bacteria. The hemolytic activity of halistanol trisulfate and other detergents has been shown to correlate with critical micelle concentration. This correlation may have important implications in the mechanism of membranolytic bioactivity.
TI  - Structure and mechanism of alkaline phosphatase.
AB  - Alkaline phosphatase was the first zinc enzyme to be discovered in which three closely spaced metal ions (two Zn ions and one Mg ion) are present at the active center. Zn ions at all three sites also produce a maximally active enzyme. These metal ions have center-to-center distances of 3.9 A (Zn1-Zn2), 4.9 A (Zn2-Mg3), and 7.1 A (Zn1-Mg3). Despite the close packing of these metal centers, only one bridging ligand, the carboxyl of Asp51, bridges Zn2 and Mg3. A crystal structure at 2.0-A resolution of the noncovalent phosphate complex, E.P, formed with the active center shows that two phosphate oxygens form a phosphate bridge between Zn1 and Zn2, while the two other phosphate oxygens form hydrogen bonds with the guanidium group of Arg166. This places Ser102, the residue known to be phosphorylated during phosphate hydrolysis, in the required apical position to initiate a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorous. Extrapolation of the E.P structure to the enzyme-substrate complex, E.ROPO4(2-), leads to the conclusion that Zn1 must coordinate the ester oxygen, thus activating the leaving group in the phosphorylation of Ser102. Likewise, Zn2 appears to coordinate the ester oxygen of the seryl phosphate and activate the leaving group during the hydrolysis of the phosphoseryl intermediate. Both of these findings suggest that there may be a significant dissociative character to each of the two displacements at phosphorous catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase. A water molecule (or hydroxide) coordinated to Zn1 following formation of the phosphoseryl intermediate appears to be the nucleophile in the second step of the mechanism. Dissociation of the product phosphate from the E.P intermediate is the slowest, 35 s-1, and therefore the rate-limiting, step of the mechanism at alkaline pH. Since the determination of the initial crystal structure of alkaline phosphatase, two other crystal structures of enzymes involved in phosphate ester hydrolysis have been completed that show a triad of closely spaced zinc ions present at their active centers. These enzymes are phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus (structure at 1.5-A resolution) (43) and P1 nuclease from Penicillium citrinum (structure at 2.8-A resolution) (74). Both enzymes hydrolyze phosphodiesters. Substrates for phospholipase C are phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine, while P1 nuclease is an endonuclease hydrolyzing single stranded ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides. P1 nuclease also has activity as a phosphomonoesterase against 3'-terminal phosphates of nucleotides. The Zn ions in both enzymes form almost identical trinuclear sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Microbial contamination of twenty drugs of plant origin].
AB  - Twenty drugs of plant origin were analysed in order to determine the microbial contamination level. A light homogenizing method was used to avoid an increase in the antimicrobial capacity of certain drugs, which would falsify the analytical results. The total viable aerobic count (TVC) varied from 10(1) to 10(7) CFU/g and in 11 samples out of 21 was equal to or higher than 10(5) CFU/g. The number of fungi varied from one drug to another, but was generally lower than the aerobic TVC to the power of 10. No cases containing Aspergillus flavus were found. The total viable anaerobic count consisted mainly of facultative anaerobic germs. Aerobic spores and facultative anaerobic bacteria were abundant. They often represented more than 50% of the aerobic TVC and among them, Bacillus cereus was found. Concerning specified micro-organisms, Escherichia coli was found 3 times, Staphylococcus aureus 2 times and Pseudomonas (not aeruginosa) a few times. Salmonella was never found. The Enterobacteriaceae, on the other hand, were often found and in some cases their number can be greater than 10(4) CFU/g. The typed bacteria corresponded to Enterobacter spp. Some drug samples in bags were analysed. The level of contamination was identical to that found in the bulk drugs. The analysis in parallel of a black tea sample showed an aerobic TVC of 4.10(3) CFU/g. Specified micro-organisms were not found in the infusions. In comparison with non-boiled drugs, the survivors can represent up to 30% of the aerobic TVC.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the lecithinase operon of Listeria monocytogenes and possible role of lecithinase in cell-to-cell spread.
AB  - The lecithinase gene of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, plcB,  was identified in a 5,648-bp DNA fragment which expressed lecithinase activity when cloned into Escherichia coli. This fragment is located immediately downstream of the previously identified gene mpl (prtA). It contains five open reading frames, named actA, plcB, and ORFX, -Y, and -Z, which, together with mpl, form an operon, since a 5.7-kb-long transcript originates from a promoter located upstream of mpl (J. Mengaud, C. Geoffroy, and P. Cossart, Infect. Immun. 59:1043-1049, 1991). A second promoter was detected in front of actA which encodes a putative membrane protein containing a region of internal repeats. plcB encodes the lecithinase, a predicted 289-amino-acid protein homologous to the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipases C of Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens (alpha-toxin). plcB mutants produce only small plaques on fibroblast monolayers, and an electron microscopic analysis of infected macrophages suggests that lecithinase is involved in the lysis of the two-membrane vacuoles that surround the bacteria after cell-to-cell spread. On the opposite DNA strand, downstream of the operon, three more open reading frames, ldh, ORFA, and ORFB, were found. The deduced amino acid sequence of the first one is homologous to lactate dehydrogenases. Low-stringency Southern hybridization experiments suggest that these three open reading frames lie outside of the L. monocytogenes virulence region: mpl and actA were specific for L. monocytogenes, sequences hybridizing to plcB were detected in L. ivanovii and L. seeligeri, and sequences hybridizing to ORFX, -Y, and -Z were found in L. innocua. In contrast to this, sequences hybridizing to ldh or ORFB were detected in all Listeria species (including the nonpathogenic ones).
TI  - A fluorescent substrate for the continuous assay of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C: synthesis and application of 2-naphthyl myo-inositol-1-phosphate.
AB  - A fluorescent water-soluble substrate for phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C was synthesized. The diacylglycerol moiety of the natural substrate, phosphatidylinositol, was replaced by the fluorescent moiety, 2-naphthol, resulting in the synthetic substrate, racemic 2-naphthyl myo-inositol-1-phosphate. The synthetic substrate provided a continuous fluorometric assay for the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus. Initial rates of the cleavage of the 2-naphthyl substrate by the phospholipase measured by fluorometry were linear with time and the amount of enzyme added. The specific enzyme activity at pH 8.5 and 25 degrees C was about 0.04 mumol/min mg protein at an initial substrate concentration of 0.8 mM. 31P NMR experiments suggest that, as with phosphatidylinositol itself, cleavage of the fluorescent substrate proceeds in two steps via a myo-inositol-1,2-cyclic phosphate intermediate, and that only the D-isomer is a substrate for the B. cereus phospholipase. The synthetic substrate was stable during long-term storage as a solid in the dark at -20 degrees C. It was also stable for several weeks when stored in the dark frozen in aqueous solution near neutral pH.
TI  - Overproduction, purification and crystallization of Bacillus cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase.
AB  - The gene coding for oligo-1,6-glucosidase from Bacillus cereus ATCC7064 has been  overexpressed in Escherichia coli MV1184 cells under the control of the lac promoter in the genetically engineered plasmid pBCE4-2. Oligo-1,6-glucosidase was purified in large quantities and was crystallized at 25 degrees C by using a hanging drop vapor diffusion method with 53% saturated ammonium sulfate. The crystals have the shape of hexagonal bipyramids and belong to the space group P6(2) or P6(4) with lattice constants of a = b = 106.1 A, c = 120.0 A and gamma = 120 degrees.
TI  - The Aeromonas hydrophila cphA gene: molecular heterogeneity among class B metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  - An Aeromonas hydrophila gene, named cphA, coding for a carbapenem-hydrolyzing metallo-beta-lactamase, was cloned in Escherichia coli by screening an Aeromonas genomic library for clones able to grow on imipenem-containing medium. From sequencing data, the cloned cphA gene appeared able to code for a polypeptide of 254 amino acids whose sequence includes a potential N-terminal leader sequence for targeting the protein to the periplasmic space. These data were in agreement with the molecular mass of the original Aeromonas enzyme and of the recombinant enzyme produced in E. coli, evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of crude beta-lactamase preparations followed by renaturation treatment for proteins separated in the gel and localization of protein bands showing carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase activity by a modified iodometric technique. The deduced amino acid sequence of the CphA enzyme showed regions of partial homology with both the beta-lactamase II of Bacillus cereus and the CfiA beta-lactamase of Bacteroides fragilis. Sequence homologies were more pronounced in the regions encompassing the amino acid residues known in the enzyme of B. cereus to function as ligand-binding residues for the metal cofactor. The CphA enzyme, however, appeared to share a lower degree of similarity with the two other enzymes, which, in turn, seemed more closely related to each other. These results, therefore, suggest the existence of at least two molecular subclasses within molecular class B metallo-beta-lactamases.
TI  - The occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  - Minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees C) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (Pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the pH of the mix to 4.5-4.7. Significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis. Micrococcus varians and Micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. Less growth was exhibited by Bacillus megaterium and yeasts. Pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (P. pentosaceus and L. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. The growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. Inoculated Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella sofia, and Staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. Lesser growth occurred for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with P. acidilactici.
TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis of dicarboxylic acids near the active site of Bacillus  cereus 5/B/6 beta-lactamase II.
AB  - An amino acid residue functioning as a general base has been proposed to assist in the hydrolysis of beta-lactam antibiotics by the zinc-containing Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase II [Bicknell & Waley (1985) Biochemistry 24, 6876-6887]. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of cloned Bacillus cereus 5/B/6 beta-lactamase II was used in an 'in vivo' study to investigate the role of carboxy-group-containing amino acids near the active site of the enzyme. Substitution of asparagine for the wild-type aspartic acid residue at position 81 resulted in fully functional enzyme. An aspartic acid residue at position 90 is essential for beta-lactamase II to confer any detectable ampicillin and cephalosporin C resistance to Escherichia coli. Conversion of Asp90 into Asn90 or Glu90 lead to the synthesis of inactive enzyme, suggesting that the spatial position of the beta-carboxy group of Asp90 is critical for enzyme function.
TI  - [Effects of sodium chloride on destruction of microorganisms by microwave heating in potatoes].
AB  - To assess the destructive effect of different sodium chloride concentrations (0,  0.3, 1.5, and 3%) on microorganisms with microwave heating, strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus were used to inoculate a mashed potato preparation. After microwave heating for 1 min at 800 W, resulted in temperatures and rate of destruction of bacteria significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in the core than on the surface of mashed potato when no salt was added. Except for B. cereus, microorganisms inoculated into mashed potato, with no added salt, could be completely destroyed by 2 min of microwave heating. Core temperatures and rate of destruction of microorganisms in the mashed potato decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) with increase in concentration of added salt. The results also indicate that bacterial species differ in their susceptibility to microwave inactivation. In particular, S. aureus, which exhibited a level of survival that was greater than that of any other species tested here, seemed notably resistant to microwave treatment for 2 min while V. parahaemolyticus was highly susceptible.
TI  - Envelope alteration of Escherichia coli HB101 carrying pEAP31 caused by Kil peptide and its involvement in the extracellular release of periplasmic penicillinase from an alkaliphilic Bacillus.
AB  - The plasmid pEAP31 contains the colicin E1 kil gene. Peptidoglycan and outer-membrane components (lipopoly-saccharide, proteins and phosphatidylethanolamine) decreased concurrently in the envelope fraction from Escherichia coli HB101 carrying pEAP31 during the stationary phase of growth. At almost the same time. D-alanine residues in peptidoglycan decreased. The Kil peptide is suggested to affect, directly or indirectly, the turnover of peptidoglycan in stationary phase and, as a result, to cause partial exfoliation of the outer membrane. Periplasmic proteins are liberated from E. coli HB101 (pEAP31) probably because of the exfoliation of outer membrane.
TI  - Hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin  are dependent on a domain homologous to that of an enzyme from the human arachidonic acid pathway.
AB  - The N-terminal domain of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin, homologous with the nontoxic phospholipase C of Bacillus cereus, was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to retain all of the phosphatidylcholine hydrolyzing activity of the alpha-toxin, but not the sphingomyelinase, hemolytic, or lethal activities. The C-terminal domain of alpha-toxin showed sequence and predicted structural homologies with the N-terminal region of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase, an enzyme from the human arachidonic acid pathway which plays a role in inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases in humans.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against Clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Four strains were isolated belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. The sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. Their resistance to phospholipase D indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. The inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. Their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
TI  - Further observations on enhancement of the infectivity of Fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  - It had already been shown with a single virulent strain (A42) of Fusobacterium necrophorum that suspension of the fusobacteria in sub-lethal doses of broth cultures of other bacteria reduced the minimum infective dose (greater than 10(6) organisms) for mice by subcutaneous inoculation, sometimes to less than 10 organisms. The present study extended the known range of bacteria with strong infectivity-enhancing properties to include Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella oxytoca and Staphylococcus aureus; and those with weaker effect to include Bacillus subtilis, 'Bacteroides melaninogenicus', Clostridium sporogenes, Pasteurella haemolytica, and Proteus mirabilis. The study also showed that five further virulent strains of F. necrophorum closely resembled A42 in respect of striking susceptibility to infectivity enhancement by Escherichia coli. Actinomyces (Corynebacterium) pyogenes and S. aureus. One further strain (A6) of F. necrophorum resembled A42 in respect of strong infectivity enhancement by A. pyogenes, S. aureus, B. cereus and K. oxytoca but differed from it and the other five strains in being only slightly affected by E. coli. This work was a necessary prelude to the development of a method, based on infectivity enhancement, for the detection and isolation of F. necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces.
TI  - Hyperexpression in Escherichia coli, purification, and characterization of the metallo-beta-lactamase of Bacillus cereus 5/B/6.
AB  - We used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce both a NdeI restriction endonuclease site and an initiator codon at the junction of the leader and structural gene sequences of the metallo-beta-lactamase of Bacillus cereus 5/B/6. This construct allowed us to clone just the beta-lactamase structural gene sequence into an Escherichia coli expression vector. E. coli cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmid, the B. cereus beta-lactamase was expressed, and these E. coli cells were disrupted by sonic oscillation. When the resultant suspensions were clarified by ultracentrifugation, the B. cereus beta-lactamase represented 15% of the total protein in the supernatant. Subsequent gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography allowed the first reported purification to homogeneity of the B. cereus beta-lactamase from E. coli with an 87% recovery and an overall yield of 17 mg of enzyme per liter of cell culture. The electrophoretic mobilities of the enzyme expressed in and purified from E. coli and the enzyme purified directly from B. cereus were identical in both native and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoreses. As with the B. cereus enzyme, Km and Vmax (using cephalosporin C as substrate) for the enzyme purified from E. coli were 0.39 mM and 1333 units/mg protein, respectively. Likewise, the Co(II)-reconstituted enzyme purified from E. coli, which retained 29% of the activity of the Zn(II) enzyme, had electronic absorption spectra with maxima at 347, 551, 617, and 646 nm with extinction coefficients of 900, 250, 173, and 150 M-1 cm-1, respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Microgard against food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Microgard, a commercially available fermented milk product containing antimicrobial metabolites, was a potent inhibitor for Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas, Salmonella, and Yersinia when 1% concentration was incorporated into agar media. Gram-positive Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes were insensitive to Microgard. Kluyveromyces marxianus, an unidentified black yeast, and Penicillium expansum were partially suppressed, whereas Aspergillus niger and a yogurt spoilage yeast were tolerant to 5% Microgard. Optimum activity of Microgard was at pH 5.3 and below; the concentration that gave complete inhibition depended upon the number of bacteria present as well as the genus tested. Blood agar base reversed the antagonistic activity of Microgard against Pseudomonas putida compared with plate count agar.
TI  - Effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  - Pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees C to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. Pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. Harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. Pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except Bacillus cereus spores. Gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than Gram-positive ones. Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. Only less than one-log cfu/g of B. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. Ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that E. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic RNA at lower pressure than S. aureus. From the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.
TI  - High-level expression in Escherichia coli and rapid purification of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  - The construction of four vectors for high-level expression in Escherichia coli of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus or Bacillus thuringiensis is described. In all constructs the coding sequence for the mature phospholipase is precisely fused to the E. coli heat-stable enterotoxin II signal sequence for targeting of the protein to the periplasm. In one set of plasmids expression of the B. cereus or B. thuringiensis enzyme is under control of the E. coli alkaline phosphatase promoter, while in a second set of plasmids expression is under control of a lac-tac-tac triple tandem promoter. A simple and rapid procedure for complete purification of the phospholipase C overproduced in E. coli, involving isolation of the periplasmic proteins by osmotic shock followed by a single column chromatography step, is described. The largest quantity of purified enzyme, 40-60 mg per liter culture, is obtained with the plasmid expressing the B. cereus enzyme under control of the lac-tac-tac promoter. Lower quantities are obtained with the plasmids containing the alkaline phosphatase promoter (15-20 and 4-6 mg/liter for the B. cereus and B. thuringiensis enzymes, respectively) and with the plasmid expressing the B. thuringiensis phospholipase under control of the lac-tac-tac promoter (15-20 mg/liter). A comparison of the functional properties of the recombinant phospholipases with the native enzymes isolated from B. cereus or B. thuringiensis culture supernatant shows that they are identical with respect to their catalytic functions, viz., cleavage of phosphatidylinositol and cleavage of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor of bovine erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase.
TI  - Identification of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activity in Listeria monocytogenes: a novel type of virulence factor?
AB  - A phospholipase C which cleaves phosphatidylinositol and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors was identified in Listeria monocytogenes. This 36 kDa protein is encoded by the gene plcA, and is homologous to the Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis and eukaryotic phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipases C (PI-PLC). Expression of the plcA gene in Escherichia coli correlates with the appearance of PI-PLC activity in the cells. In Listeria monocytogenes, the activity is secreted to the culture medium. PI-PLC activity was only found in the two pathogenic species of the genus Listeria, namely L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii. PI-PLC activity was lost and virulence decreased when the plcA gene was disrupted in the chromosome. This suggests that the PI-PLC of L. monocytogenes might be involved in virulence.
TI  - Travelers' diarrhea among United States military personnel during joint American-Egyptian armed forces exercises in Cairo, Egypt.
AB  - A study was conducted of travelers' diarrhea in a United States military population on deployment in Cairo, Egypt, during July and August 1987. Acute diarrhea requiring medical attention developed in 183 (4%) of 4,500 troops. A possible etiologic agent was identified in 49% of all diarrhea cases. Enteric pathogens associated with cases of diarrhea included: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (17% ST-producers, 13% LT-producers, and 3% LT/ST-producers); Shigella (9%); Campylobacter spp. (2%); Salmonella (2%); and Vibrio cholerae non-01 serogroup (2%). Other enteric pathogens isolated from one episode each of diarrhea included Aeromonas hydrophila group, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and Bacillus cereus. Yersinia enterocolitica, enteroinvasive E. coli, intoxications by Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, and pathogenic enteric parasites were not found in any of the 183 patients with diarrhea. A survey of military personnel not requesting medical care indicated that up to 40% of troops may have had diarrhea during this deployment. Acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in U.S. military personnel deployed to Egypt.
TI  - [The effect of a cationic surface-active substance (catamine AB) on the physiological-morphological properties of B. cereus and E. coli].
AB  - Catamine AB (0.05-0.5%) promotes transfer of B. cereus st 96, and E. coli st. 906 cell cultures into metabolic rest. Detergent-treated cells have no energetic metabolism and autolytic processes, have high light-scattering coefficient, and peculiar ultrastructural organization. Viable cells can be observed in the detergent-treated cell suspension after 1 year of incubation. Difference in action of different catamine AB concentrations on stationary and exponential B. cereus cells has been revealed.
TI  - [Effect of Escherichia coli on growth of Bacillus cereus].
AB  - The effect of 101 Escherichia coli strains on growth of 90 Bacillus cereus strains on solid media was investigated. Only 9 E. coli strains (in particular the colicin +-generating ones) were antagonistic towards B. cereus, giving distinct growth-inhibition zones around the colonies.
TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis of beta-lactamase I. Single and double mutants of Glu-166 and Lys-73.
AB  - Two single mutants and the corresponding double mutant of beta-lactamase I from Bacillus cereus 569/H were constructed and their kinetics investigated. The mutants have Lys-73 replaced by arginine (K73R), or Glu-166 replaced by aspartic acid (E166D), or both (K73R + E166D). All four rate constants in the acyl-enzyme mechanism were determined for the E166D mutant by the methods described by Christensen, Martin & Waley [(1990) Biochem. J. 266, 853-861]. Both the rate constants for acylation and deacylation for the hydrolysis of benzylpenicillin were decreased about 2000-fold in this mutant. In the K73R mutant, and in the double mutant, the rate constants for acylation were decreased about 100-fold and 10,000-fold respectively. All three mutants also had lowered values for the rate constants for the formation and dissociation of the non-covalent enzyme-substrate complex. The specificities of the mutants did not differ greatly from those of wild-type beta-lactamase, but the hydrolysis of cephalosporin C by the K73R mutant gave 'burst' kinetics.
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin (CI-978; AT-4140) against clinical isolates from cancer patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new quinolone, was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, greater than 90% of which were isolated from blood culture specimens of cancer patients. Sparfloxacin was extremely active against Acinetobacter species, Aeromonas hydrophila, Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens (inhibiting greater than 90% of these isolates at a concentration of 0.5 microgram/ml) and moderately active against Pseudomonas species, other Proteus species, and Citrobacter freundii. Sparfloxacin inhibited greater than 90% of staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant and coagulase-negative strains) at a concentration of 0.12 microgram/ml and greater than 90% of streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) at a concentration of 1.0 microgram/ml. It was also active against Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus species, and Corynebacterium jeikeium, organisms that have become fairly common in cancer patients.
TI  - Primary structure of the oligo-1,6-glucosidase of Bacillus cereus ATCC7064 deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene.
AB  - The gene coding for Bacillus cereus ATCC7064 (mesophile) oligo-1,6-glucosidase was cloned within a 2.8-kb SalI-EcoRI fragment of DNA, using the plasmid pUC19 as a vector and Escherichia coli C600 as a host. E. coli C600 bearing the hybrid plasmid pBCE4 accumulated oligo-1,6-glucosidase in the cytoplasm. The cloned enzyme coincided absolutely with B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase in its Mr (65,000), in its electrophoretic behavior on a polyacrylamide gel with or without sodium dodecyl sulfate, in its isoelectric point (4.5), in the temperature dependence of its stability and activity, and in its antigenic determinants. The nucleotide sequence of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase gene and its flanking regions was determined with both complementary strands of DNA (each 2838 nucleotides). The gene consisted of an open reading frame of 1674 bp commencing with a ATG start codon and followed by a TAA stop codon. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence predicted a protein of 558 amino acid residues with a Mr of 66,010. The amino acid composition and Mr were comparable with those of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase. The predicted N-terminal sequence of 10 amino acid residues agreed completely with that of the cloned ligo-1,6-glucosidase. The deduced amino acid sequence of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase was 72% and 42% similar to those from Bacillus thermoglucosidasius KP1006 (DSM2542, obligate thermophile) oligo-1,6-glucosidase and from Saccharomyces carlsbergensis CB11 alpha-glucosidase, respectively. Predictions of protein secondary structures along with amino acid sequence alignments demonstrated that B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase may take the similar (alpha/beta)8-barrel super-secondary structure, a barrel of eight parallel beta-strands surrounded by eight alpha-helices, in its N-terminal active site domain as S. carlsbergensis alpha-glucosidase and Aspergillus oryzae alpha-amylase.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a beta-lactamase-inhibitory protein from Streptomyces clavuligerus and cloning and analysis of the corresponding gene.
AB  - Culture filtrates of Streptomyces clavuligerus contain a proteinaceous beta-lactamase inhibitor (BLIP) in addition to a variety of beta-lactam compounds. BLIP was first detected by its ability to inhibit Bactopenase, a penicillinase derived from Bacillus cereus, but it has also been shown to inhibit the plasmid pUC- and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases of Escherichia coli. BLIP showed no inhibitory effect against Enterobacter cloacae beta-lactamase, and it also showed no activity against an alternative source of B. cereus penicillinase. BLIP was purified to homogeneity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave a size estimate for BLIP of 16,900 to 18,000. The interaction between purified BLIP and the E. coli(pUC) beta-lactamase was investigated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determined to be noncovalent, with an estimated 1:1 molar stoichiometry. The BLIP gene was isolated on a 13.5-kilobase fragment of S. clavuligerus chromosomal DNA which did not overlap a 40-kilobase region of DNA known to contain genes for beta-lactam antibiotic biosynthesis. The gene encoded a mature protein with a deduced amino acid sequence of 165 residues (calculated molecular weight of 17,523) and also encoded a 36-amino-acid signal sequence. No significant sequence similarity to BLIP was found by pairwise comparisons using various protein and nucleotide sequence data banks or by hybridization experiments, and no BLIP activity was detected in the culture supernatants of other Streptomyces spp.
TI  - Selection and application of antibodies modifying the function of beta-lactamase.
AB  - Nine monoclonal antibodies directed against class A beta-lactamases were detected and selected by a novel screening procedure based on assaying the modifications in the catalytic and stability properties of beta-lactamase in solution. Unlike conventional screening, e.g., ELISA or immunoprecipitation, the present method does not depend on firm binding and thus favors detection of low affinity antibodies. Individual antibodies were found to affect the enzymatic activity in various ways including stimulation, neutralization, protection and stabilization. Class A beta-lactamases show only 20% among members of this class. In contrast, two of our monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted with different beta-lactamases and thus demonstrate the presence of shared structural epitopes in this class of enzymes. One of the cross-reacting antibodies was elicited by sequential immunization with two different beta-lactamases. Taken together, our findings stress the importance of the screening method in antibody selection and illustrate the use of 'functional' monoclonal antibodies in the study of the structure-function relationship in an enzyme.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the class B beta-lactamase gene (ccrA) from Bacteroides fragilis TAL3636.
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis TAL3636 produces a class B, Zn2(+)-requiring beta-lactamase. The gene, ccrA, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene was sequenced and shown to share greater than 33% identity with the metalloenzyme from Bacillus cereus 569/H.
TI  - Purification and characterization of N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase from human serum.
AB  - Purification to homogeneity of the N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (mucopeptide amidohydrolase, EC 3.5.1.28) from human serum has been achieved with a high yield. By molecular sieving chromatography, a molecular weight of 120,000-130,000 has been found for the native enzyme. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under native conditions gave a unique band of Mr = 125,000. The same technique performed under denaturing conditions revealed that the protein is a dimer composed of one subunit of Mr = 57,000 and another of Mr = 70,000. In isoelectrofocalization assays, the amidase behaved as an acidic protein. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate inhibited the enzyme activity; the Mg2+ requirement was confirmed. The simultaneous presence of sulfhydryl groups and disulfide bonds in the protein was evidenced by the inhibitions produced by different thiol-blocking reagents and by several thiol-bearing substances. Direct measurements established the presence of two accessible thiol groups and the occurrence of nine disulfide bonds per protein molecule. Studies of substrate hydrolyzing capacities showed a marked preference for the muramoyl tripeptide derived from the Escherichia coli or Bacillus cereus mureins, the disaccharide tetrapeptide and the bis disaccharide tetra-tetrapeptide from E. coli were also good substrates. Activities on small muropeptides of other composition are also reported. Whole (insoluble) peptidoglycans representing the main bacterial chemotypes were submitted to the enzyme action; although with weak specific activities, the human amidase was nevertheless able to release soluble peptides from some of them. A bacteriolytic capacity on some microorganisms cannot be excluded. Results are discussed and the human enzyme is compared to presently known microbial muramoyl amidases.
TI  - [The multiple effect of plasmid RP4::Mu cts 62 in transcipient bacilli].
AB  - Transfer of conjugative hybrid plasmid RP4::Mu cts 62 from Escherichia coli into  Bac. cereus, Bac. thuringiensis, Bac. mesentericus and Bac. polymyxa cells led to the multiple effects on the structure and physiology of bacillus cells. It has resulted in a decrease of the bacillus vitality, in the accelerated autolytic decay of cells, in the delay of cell growth and reproduction rate in liquid and solid media, in the disruption of ultrastructure of the cell membrane and its surface layer.
TI  - Molecular analysis of a sphingomyelinase C gene from Leptospira interrogans serovar hardjo.
AB  - A thermolabile hemolysin from Leptospira interrogans serovar hardjo, strain Sponselee, was shown to specifically degrade sphingomyelin. Nucleotide sequence determination revealed that sphingomyelinase activity was encoded by an open reading frame of 1,668 nucleotides. Although a putative signal sequence could be identified, no evidence for protein export in either L. interrogans or Escherichia coli was obtained. The apparent molecular mass of the expression product in E. coli minicells was 41.2 kilodaltons, whereas open reading frame 1 encoded a protein of 63,268 daltons. The observed difference may be explained by processing at the carboxy-terminal part of the hemolysin in E. coli. A high degree of similarity on the DNA and protein levels with Staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin and sphingomyelinase C from three Bacillus cereus strains was observed. The presence of various sphingomyelinase genes within the L. interrogans species is demonstrated.
TI  - [The effect of glutaraldehyde on mycobacteria and on selected types of bacteria].
AB  - The author tested the action of 2% alkalinized glutaraldehyde on Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. kansasii, M. avium, M. xenopi and M. fortuitum, as well as Staphyloccocus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, B. megatherium and B. subtilis. After 5-minute exposure devitalization of M. tuberculosis, M. kansasii and vegetative forms of the tested bacteria occurred. A sporicide effect was recorded already after 30 minutes or after more than 120 minutes. Most resistant were potentially pathogenic M. fortuitum, M. xenopi and M. avium where the disinfectant effect (a drop of CFU by 99.99%) was recorded after 7-63 minutes and their complete devitalization occurred after 3 (M. fortuitum) to 20 hours' (M. avium) action. The author recommends therefore exposure for 24 hours for sterilization of objects contamined with the above species of mycobacteria. This pertains in particular to instruments which cannot be sterilized by heat (endoscopes, bronchoscopes, sigmoidoscopes etc.), used in the diagnosis of mycobacterioses in patients with compromised immunity, e.g. in AIDS.
TI  - Bacterial aetiology of infantile diarrhoea in Papua New Guinea.
AB  - Bacterial examination of stools of children with diarrhoea was carried out at Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, where little information is available concerning the causative bacteria of diarrhoea. Shigellae, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, and Aeromonas hydrophila were isolated with the decreasing frequency in that order. Among these, enterotoxigenic E. coli and C. jejuni were isolated for the first time in this country. Although Vibrio parahaemolyticus was recovered from sea water, no cases suffering from this organism were found.

TI  - Sequencing the gene for an imipenem-cefoxitin-hydrolyzing enzyme (CfiA) from Bacteroides fragilis TAL2480 reveals strong similarity between CfiA and Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase II.
AB  - Using a newly constructed Bacteroides fragilis-Escherichia coli cloning shuttle vector, pJST61, we have cloned the cefoxitin (FOX)-imipenem (IMP) resistance determinant from B. fragilis TAL2480. FOX-IMP resistance in this strain results from the production of a periplasmic, Zn2(+)-containing beta-lactamase which hydrolyzes carbapenems and cephamycins and whose activity is resistant to clavulanic acid but sensitive to Zn2(+)-binding reagents, including EDTA. The pJST61 vector permits efficient library construction in E. coli and allows for the transfer of the library to B. fragilis recipients for the screening or selection of specific phenotypes. The library clone containing the FOX-IMP resistance gene was detected after transfer to B. fragilis TM4000 (Fox-Imps) selecting for Foxr. One of the isolates carrying plasmid pJST241 is resistant to FOX and IMP and synthesizes a periplasmic protein with substrate and inhibitor properties identical to those of strain TAL2480. On the basis of deletion analysis, Tn1000 insertion mutations, and DNA sequencing, we have defined the 747-base cfiA (FOX-IMP resistance) gene within the 3.6-kilobase cloned insert in pJST241. The cfiA gene contains an open reading frame that could code for a precursor protein of 249 amino acids and with a molecular mass of 27,260 daltons. A potential signal sequence has been identified at the N terminus of this protein; cleavage within this sequence would result in a protein of 231 amino acids with a molecular mass of 25,249 daltons. The CfiA protein shows remarkable similarities to the exported, Zn2(+)-requiring, type II beta-lactamase Blm proteins from Bacillus cereus 569/H and 5/B/6. Although overall amino acid identity is only 32%, the Zn ligand-binding His and Cys residues are precisely conserved and the amino acids in the vicinity of these sites show strong similarities (greater than 80%) when the CfiA and Blm proteins are compared.
TI  - Synthesis of 3-aryl-2-substituted-4(3H)-quinazolines as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Three new series of 4(3H)-quinazolinone derivatives were synthesized, namely: [3-Aryl-4(3H)-quinazolinon-2-yl]-methylenehydrazino-(N- substituted)-thiocarbamides, 3-Aryl-2-(3-substituted-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydrothiazol-2-ylidenehy drazonomethyl)-4 (3H)-quinazolinones and 3-Aryl-2-(3-substituted-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidenehydrazonometh yl)-4(3H)-quinazolinones. The antimicrobial activities of the synthesized compounds were also studied.
TI  - Beta-lactamases as fully efficient enzymes. Determination of all the rate constants in the acyl-enzyme mechanism.
AB  - The rate constants for both acylation and deacylation of beta-lactamase PC1 from  Staphylococcus aureus and the RTEM beta-lactamase from Escherichia coli were determined by the acid-quench method [Martin & Waley (1988) Biochem. J. 254, 923-925] with several good substrates, and, for a wider range of substrates, of beta-lactamase I from Bacillus cereus. The values of the acylation and deacylation rate constants for benzylpenicillin were approximately the same (i.e. differing by no more than 2-fold) for each enzyme. The variation of kcat./Km for benzylpenicillin with the viscosity of the medium was used to obtain values for all four rate constants in the acyl-enzyme mechanism for all three enzymes. The reaction is partly diffusion-controlled, and the rate constant for the dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complex has approximately the same value as the rate constants for acylation and deacylation. Thus all three first-order rate constants have comparable values. Here there is no single rate-determining step for beta-lactamase action. This is taken to be a sign of a fully efficient enzyme.
TI  - Asymmetric distribution of the phosphatidylinositol-linked phospho-oligosaccharide that mimics insulin action in the plasma membrane.
AB  - We have investigated the topography of a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol implicated in insulin action by a combination of two complementary methods: (a) chemical labelling with a non-permeable (isethionyl acetimidate) and a permeable (ethyl acetimidate) probe; and (b) enzymatic modifications with beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.3). Using the first approach the majority of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol is found in the outer surface of intact hepatocytes, adipocytes, fibroblasts and lymphocytes, but not in erythrocytes which presented only a 20% of the total labelled glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol to the exterior. Upon insulin addition (10 nM), about 60% of the total glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol was hydrolysed in both hepatocytes and adipocytes but not in erythrocytes. In agreement with the extracellular localization in hepatocytes and with the proposed role of this glycolipid in insulin action, treatment of rat hepatocytes with beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli, an enzyme that hydrolyses the oligosaccharide moiety of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol, cleaved 65% of the total glycophospholipid and blocked the effect of insulin (but not of glucagon) on pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40). Similar treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus hydrolysed 62% of the total glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol. From the various approaches used it is concluded that the majority of this glycophospholipid is at the outer surface in a variety of insulin-sensitive cells.
TI  - [The genetic transfer, heredity and phenotypic expression of plasmid RP4::Mu cts  genes in Bacillus cereus].
AB  - The transcipients were obtained in intrageneric matings of E.coli donor harbouring the plasmid PR4::Mu cts 62 with Bac. cereus GP7 recipient cells with the frequency 10(-9). The transcipient clone Bac. cereus 682 was selected having stably inherited and expressed the hybrid plasmid PR4::Mu cts 62 genes for antibiotic resistance and temperature sensitivity. Production of the bacteriophage Mu cts 62 particles was not registered in the bacillary transcipient cells. The plasmid RP4::Mu cts 62 genes were localized in the chromosome of Bac. cereus 682 transcipient by the blot-hybridization technique with 32P-labelled DNA of the bacteriophage Mu cts 62 and the plasmid PR4. The transcipient of Bac. cereus 682 has the donor properties and transfers the RP4::Mu cts 62 genes to recipient cells of Bac. cereus DSM 318 with the frequency of 10(-6)-10(-7). The expression and transfer of the gram-negative plasmid genes in gram-positive bacterial cells are discussed.
TI  - Detective work in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - We report five cases of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in which the mechanisms and sources of infection were established. We show how diligent enquiry and environmental investigation can explain the pathogenesis of infection and help in prevention by motivation of the patient.
TI  - Mercury resistance determined by a self-transmissible plasmid in Bacillus cereus  5.
AB  - Inducible mercuric reductase activity in Bacillus cereus 5 was plasmid-encoded. Plasmid analysis revealed three plasmids with molecular masses of 2.6, 5.2 and 130 MDa. A mating system permitted transfer of the resistance determinant among strains of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis. Transfer of mercury resistance from B. cereus 5 to B. cereus 569 and B. thuringiensis occurred during mixed culture incubation on agar surfaces. The 130-MDa plasmid (pGB130) was responsible for transfer; frequencies ranged from 10(-5) to 10(-4). B. cereus 569 transconjugants inheriting pGB130 were also effective donors. High transfer frequencies and the finding that cell-free filtrates of donor cultures were ineffective in mediating transfer suggested mercury-resistance transfer was not phage-mediated. Transfer was also insensitive to DNase activity. Further evidence that pGB130 DNA carried the mercury-resistance determinant was transformation of B. cereus 569 by electroporation with pGB130 DNA isolated from B. cereus 5 and a mercury-resistant B. cereus 569 transconjugant. Mercury-resistant transconjugants and transformants exhibited mercuric reductase activity. Plasmid pGB130 also conferred resistance to phenylmercuric acetate.
TI  - Detection of common flagella antigen in Bacillus cereus by monoclonal antibody.
AB  - Bacillus cereus has been classified into 23 types by immunochemical analyses of flagella antigen, but a common antigenic determinant of flagella had not been determined. When the immunochemical method of classification had changed from "agglutination method" to "enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)," the cross-reactivity between each flagella type was increased. These results indicated that the application of ELISA method would enable detection of the common antigenic determinant of B. cereus. Therefore, we attempted to make monoclonal antibody against common flagella antigen that could be detected by ELISA. Monoclonal antibody provided was specific for B. cereus (H-1 to H-23) and did not show the cross-reactivity with Escherichia coli NIH and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Bacterial sorption of heavy metals.
AB  - Four bacteria, Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were examined for the ability to remove Ag+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and La3+ from solution by batch equilibration methods. Cd and Cu sorption over the concentration range 0.001 to 1 mM was described by Freundlich isotherms. At 1 mM concentrations of both Cd2+ and Cu2+, P. aeruginosa and B. cereus were the most and least efficient at metal removal, respectively. Freundlich K constants indicated that E. coli was most efficient at Cd2+ removal and B. subtilis removed the most Cu2+. Removal of Ag+ from solution by bacteria was very efficient; an average of 89% of the total Ag+ was removed from the 1 mM solution, while only 12, 29, and 27% of the total Cd2+, Cu2+, and La3+, respectively, were sorbed from 1 mM solutions. Electron microscopy indicated that La3+ accumulated at the cell surface as needlelike, crystalline precipitates. Silver precipitated as discrete colloidal aggregates at the cell surface and occasionally in the cytoplasm. Neither Cd2+ nor Cu2+ provided enough electron scattering to identify the location of sorption. The affinity series for bacterial removal of these metals decreased in the order Ag greater than La greater than Cu greater than Cd. The results indicate that bacterial cells are capable of binding large quantities of different metals. Adsorption equations may be useful for describing bacterium-metal interactions with metals such as Cd and Cu; however, this approach may not be adequate when precipitation of metals occurs.
TI  - Reactivation of peptidoglycan synthesis in ether-permeabilized Escherichia coli after inhibition by beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The recovery of peptidoglycan-synthesizing activity after inhibition by beta-lactam antibiotics was investigated in ether-permeabilized cells of Escherichia coli B. Such cells synthesize sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble peptidoglycan when provided with UDP-linked precursors and Mg2+. The ability of beta-lactam antibiotics to inhibit the synthesis of peptidoglycan was correlated with their affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1A and 1Bs. Penicillin-binding protein 1Bs is thought to be the major peptidoglycan synthetase in E. coli and is a major lethal target for beta-lactam antibiotics. Ether-treated bacteria were preincubated with concentrations of beta-lactams sufficient to completely inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis and then treated with beta-lactamases to inactivate free antibiotic prior to measurement of peptidoglycan synthesis. At 40 min after beta-lactamase treatment, the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis was about 74% of the control rate in cells pretreated with ampicillin, but only 15% of the control in cells pretreated with penicillin G or azlocillin. Reversal of inhibition by several other antibiotics fell between these extremes. When cross-linking of peptidoglycan was measured specifically, reversal of inhibition by ampicillin also occurred more readily than that by penicillin G. Reactivation of peptidoglycan synthesis was not due to de novo synthesis of penicillin-binding proteins since it occurred under conditions that did not allow incorporation of [14C]leucine. We conclude that there is considerable variation in the stability of the inactive acyl enzymes formed between various beta-lactams and penicillin-binding protein 1Bs, with those formed by penicillin G being relatively long-lived.
TI  - Specificity of Bacillus thuringiensis for lepidopteran larvae: factors involved in vivo and in the structure of a purified protoxin.
AB  - The relative LD50 values in two test Lepidoptera of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki HD1, which contains three crylA protoxin genes, was the same as a plasmid-cured derivative or a Bacillus cereus transcipient containing only one of the three genes. Differential rates of transcription of these genes in the original strain could account, at least partly, for this result. Strains containing only the single protoxin gene (crylA(b] produced inclusions when grown at 25 degrees C but not 32 degrees C, despite transcription of this gene at both temperatures. The instability of the crylA(b) protoxin was not found in the parental B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki HD1 strain grown at either temperature, however, so kurstaki HD1 strains with multiple protoxin genes must produce some stabilizing factor, perhaps another protoxin. The cryl protoxins contain a highly conserved carboxyl half which is proteolytically removed upon conversion to toxin. All of the protoxin cysteines are present in protease-sensitive regions and they are oxidized in inclusions. Most of the disulphides appear to be essential for specificity since their reduction in the crylA(b) protoxin resulted in loss of selectivity for one of the test insects. This lack of specificity was also found for this protoxin produced by an Escherichia coli clone, probably because of the reducing conditions in these cells. Specificity was restored by reoxidation of the pure protoxin, by removal of the carboxyl half of oxidized protoxin with trypsin, or by subcloning of the toxin portion. The oxidized form of protoxins must be important for specificity, for the formation of crystalline inclusions, and probably for interactions required for the stabilization of some protoxins.
TI  - Gene cloning shows the alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens to contain both sphingomyelinase and lecithinase activities.
AB  - The plc gene encoding the alpha-toxin (phospholipase C), an important virulence factor of Clostridium perfringens, has been cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. Transcriptional analysis of mRNAs produced in vivo by C. perfringens and E. coli, and in vitro using purified RNA polymerase from C. perfringens revealed that plc is transcribed constitutively from a single promoter situated about 100 nucleotides from the coding sequence. A T7 expression system was used to overproduce alpha-toxin in E. coli; enzymological studies with the amplified plc gene product unambiguously demonstrated that both lecithinase (phospholipase C) and sphingomyelinase activities were associated with this 43,000 dalton cytotoxin. The 370-residue alpha-toxin is haemolytic and shares sequence and functional homology with the two components of Bacillus cereus haemolysin, cereolysin AB, in which phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase activities are associated with different polypeptides.
TI  - Survival and growth of food poisoning bacteria following inoculation into cottage cheese varieties.
AB  - Following inoculation into cottage cheese varieties with and without sorbic acid, obtained directly from the manufacturer, strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and other E. coli survived but failed to multiply during storage at 7, 10 or 25 degrees C. In the absence of sorbic acid spoilage due to Pseudomonas fluorescens occurred after storage for 5-13 days at 7 or 10 degrees C and 1-2 days at 25 degrees C. Salmonella enteritidis, S. hadar, S. saint-paul, S. typhimurium and S. virchow survived but failed to multiply at 10 degrees C and, in the case of most strains, at 20 or 25 degrees C. S. typhimurium multiplied 100-fold in one batch of cottage cheese with peppers and onion in the absence of sorbic acid during storage at 25 degrees C for 2 days; spoilage of this batch occurred due to yeasts or yeasts and moulds after storage for 4-8 days at 10 degrees C and 0-2 days at 20 or 25 degrees C. Following inoculation into cottage cheese varieties, prepared in the laboratory and which did not contain sorbic acid, as contaminants of the added protein or vegetable ingredients the numbers of Staphylococcus aureus declined during storage at 10 and 20 degrees C, the numbers of Bacillus cereus and S. typhimurium increased at both temperatures, and the numbers of Yersinia enterocolitica increased at 10 degrees C, but declined at 20 degrees C. Spoilage occurred due to the growth of moulds and P. fluorescens after storage for 5-14 days at 10 degrees C, and due to P. fluorescens after storage for up to 2 days at 20 degrees C. In products inoculated in a similar way but which contained sorbic acid (500-530 mg/kg), the numbers of S. aureus and B. cereus declined and in most products the numbers of S. typhimurium and Y. enterocolitica remained constant. In cottage cheese with chicken, however, the numbers of Y. enterocolitica increased 100-fold during storage of the product for 14 days at 10 degrees and the numbers of S. typhimurium increased 100-fold during storage for 2 days at 20 degrees C. Spoilage of this product due to P. fluorescens occurred after storage for 8-14 days at 10 degrees C, but was not evident at 20 degrees C after 2 days.
TI  - Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C of Bacillus cereus: cloning, sequencing, and relationship to other phospholipases.
AB  - The phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific phospholipase C (PLC) of Bacillus cereus was cloned into Escherichia coli by using monoclonal antibody probes raised against the purified protein. The enzyme is specific for hydrolysis of the membrane lipid PI and PI-glycan-containing membrane anchors, which are important structural components of one class of membrane proteins. The protein expressed in E. coli comigrated with B. cereus PI-PLC in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as detected by immunoblotting, and conferred PI-PLC activity on the host. This enzyme activity was inhibited by PI-PLC-specific monoclonal antibodies. The nucleotide sequence of the PI-PLC gene suggests that this secreted bacterial protein is synthesized as a larger precursor with a 31-amino-acid N-terminal extension to the mature enzyme of 298 amino acids. From analysis of coding and flanking sequences of the gene, we conclude that the PI-PLC gene does not reside next to the gene cluster of the other two secreted phospholipases C on the bacterial chromosome. The deduced amino acid sequence of the B. cereus PI-PLC contains a stretch of significant similarity to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific PLC of Trypanosoma brucei. The conserved peptide is proposed to play a role in the function of these enzymes.
TI  - Studies on the cellular defense reactions of the Madeira cockroach, Leucophaea maderae: nodule formation in response to injected bacteria.
AB  - Nodules were formed in the Madeira cockroach, Leucophaea maderae, in response to  injections of low doses (3 x 10(4) bacteria/insect) of three strains of Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli K12 D31. The most pathogenic strain of bacteria used, B. cereus B1, produced the greatest cellular response, while the least pathogenic, E. coli K12 D31, injected at the same dose, caused little nodule formation. Similarly, nodules were generally found to be larger following injection of pathogenic bacteria such as B. cereus B1 than to the weak pathogen, E. coli K12 D31. There was, however, no difference in the extent of nodule formation with the four bacterial strains/species if they were heat killed prior to injection. Histologically, the nodules formed in response to all bacterial species employed were similar, with a central necrotic core enclosing cell debris and occasional bacteria, and an outer, thin sheath of plasmatocyte-like hemocytes. Possible reasons for the enhanced cellular reactivity observed in L. maderae to pathogenic bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the glutamine synthetase gene (glnA) and its upstream region from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of a 2.4 kb chromosomal EcoT22I-NspV fragment, containing the Bacillus cereus glnA gene (structural gene of glutamine synthetase). The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that the glutamine synthetase subunit consists of 444 amino acid residues (50,063 Da). Comparisons are made with reported amino acid sequences of glutamine synthetases from other bacteria. Upstrem of glnA we found an open reading frame of 129 codons (ORF129) preceded by the consensus sequence for a typical promoter. Maxicell experiments showed two polypeptide bands, with molecular weights in good agreement with that of glutamine synthetase and that of ORF129, in addition to vector-coded protein. It is possible that the product of this open reading frame upstream of glnA has a regulatory role in glutamine synthetase expression.
TI  - Mutations affecting the catalytic activity of Bacillus cereus 5/B/6 beta-lactamase II.
AB  - Random in vitro mutagenesis of a cloned Bacillus cereus 5/B/6 beta-lactamase II gene was used to select defective genes unable to confer ampicillin or cephalosporin C resistance to Escherichia coli. DNA sequencing of mutant genes identified histidine at position 28 as important to beta-lactamase II function. In addition, the isolation of six identical frameshift mutants established that the carboxyl-terminal end of beta-lactamase II is critical for enzyme function. Random mutagenesis also revealed that His88 (implicated previously as one of 4 residues acting as a zinc ligand) is crucial to enzymatic activity and that a glycine to glutamic acid substitution at position 148 produced a defective beta-lactamase. Oligonucleotide mutagenesis directed at Glu37 and Glu212 suggests that these residues are inconsequential to enzyme function but that histidine at position 28 may be involved in substrate binding or recognition.
TI  - Effect of exposure of Pieris brassicae larvae to 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid on the natural antibacterial activity of serum.
AB  - Larvae of the cabbage white butterfly, Pieris brassicae, were reared on a semisynthetic diet with or without 20 ppm of the herbicide 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) and using three assays the sera were subsequently tested for natural antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli K12, and Micrococcus luteus. These assays showed that exposure of larvae to 2,4,5-T lowered the antibacterial activity of the serum against E. coli and M. luteus compared with control animals. Spectrophotometric tests for the presence of a lysozyme-like principle in the serum also revealed similar trends with a significant loss of enzyme activity in 2,4,5-T-treated insects. Overall total serum protein levels of control and 2,4,5-T-treated insects were similar, suggesting a specific effect of the herbicide on certain serum components such as lysozyme. The possible mode of action of the herbicide on production of antibacterial factors is discussed.
TI  - Efficient transformation of Bacillus thuringiensis and B. cereus via electroporation: transformation of acrystalliferous strains with a cloned delta-endotoxin gene.
AB  - Electroporation was used as a method to transform intact cells of Bacillus thuringiensis and B. cereus. With our optimized method a range of plasmid vectors could be transformed into strains of B. thuringiensis at frequencies of up to 10(7) transformants/micrograms DNA. This high frequency allows cloning experiments to be done directly in B. thuringiensis. A bifunctional vector capable of replicating in Escherichia coli and in Bacillus spp. was constructed. The kurhd1 protoxin gene was cloned into this shuttle vector to produce plasmid pX193, then transformed into B. thuringiensis HD1 cryB and B. cereus 569K. The cloned protoxin gene was expressed in sporulating cultures of both strain HD1 cryB (pX193) and 569K (pXI93), producing crystal protein active in biotests against larvae of Heliothis virescens. This demonstrates the usefulness of the electroporation method for the introduction of cloned toxin genes, in either their native or modified form, into a variety of host strains.
TI  - Microbiological quality and public health significance of ice-cream.
AB  - Fifty samples of ice-cream were subjected to microbiological examination. Of these 72% had total viable count over 10(6)/g while 66% had coliform count between 10(2)-10(3)/g. The micro-organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (46%), Enterobacter aerogenes (34%), Staphylococcus aureus (26%), proteus species (16%), Streptococcus faecalis (12%), Citrobacter species (10%) and Bacillus cereus (4%). The results showed that commercially prepared ice-cream sold in the market was not satisfactory for human consumption and preventive measures should be enforced for the supply of satisfactory products.
TI  - Screening of isoquinoline alkaloids and their derivatives for antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - A screening test of antimicrobial activities for some of the isoquinoline alkaloids and their first and second Hofmann elimination products was conducted in this study. Results showed that (+)-actinodaphnine (1), (+)-N-Me-actinodaphnine (2), (+)-anonaine (17), (-)-xylopine (19) and (-)-N-Me-xylopine MeI (20), had the strongest inhibitory activities against three G(+) bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus sp. and Staphylococcus aureus) MIC greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml). Whereas anhydroushinsunine (34), anhydroushinsunine MeI (35), ushinsunine isomethine (38), dicentrine methine (23), roemerine methine (26), dicentrine bismethine (29) and O-Me-armepavine methine (48) also had antibacterial effects against these same three G(+) bacteria (MIC = 50-300 micrograms/ml). However, only (+)-actinodaphnine (1) and roemerine methine (26) showed weak effects against two G(-) bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia) (MIC = 300 micrograms/ml). (+)-Actinodaphnine(1), (+)-N-Me-actinodaphnine (2), (+)-anonaine (17), anhydroushinsunine (34), anhydroushinsunine MeI (35), ushinsunine isomethine (38), O-Me-armepavine methine (48) and O,O-di-Et-N-Me-coclaurine methine (49) had potent antifungal activities against Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and other Candida species (MIC = 62.5-1000 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Phospholipase C and haemolytic activities of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin  cloned in Escherichia coli: sequence and homology with a Bacillus cereus phospholipase C.
AB  - The Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin (phospholipase C) gene (cpa) has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The biological activities of the cloned gene product have been analysed and the complete nucleotide sequence of the cpa gene has been determined. The cloned cpa gene product, which is exported to the periplasm in E. coli, possesses both phospholipase C and haemolytic activities. Haemolysis is not apparent when cell extracts are incubated with isotonic suspensions of sheep erythrocytes, but can be detected and quantified readily when dilutions of the same extracts are placed in wells in sheep-blood agar plates. Like other sequenced clostridial genes, the cpa gene has a high AT content (66.4%), exhibits a strong bias for using codons with A or T in the wobble position, and the 350 base pairs upstream from the gene have a significantly higher AT content (79.5%) than the coding region. The cpa gene encodes a 398 amino acid polypeptide with a deduced molecular weight of 45,481 D. This is very similar to the estimated molecular weight (Mr) of the cpa primary gene product expressed in an in vitro transcription-translation system (Mr 46,000), but larger than the cpa gene product detected in E. coli minicells, E. coli whole cells or in C. perfringens cells (Mr 43,000), suggesting post-translational processing. The 28 N-terminal residues of the deduced alpha-toxin sequence possess the consensus features of a signal peptide and may be removed during secretion. The deduced alpha-toxin sequence shares significant structural homology with the phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase C of Bacillus cereus.
TI  - A Bacillus cereus cytolytic determinant, cereolysin AB, which comprises the phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase genes: nucleotide sequence and genetic linkage.
AB  - A cloned cytolytic determinant from the genome of Bacillus cereus GP-4 has been characterized at the molecular level. Nucleotide sequence determination revealed the presence of two open reading frames. Both open reading frames were found by deletion and complementation analysis to be necessary for expression of the hemolytic phenotype by Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli hosts. The 5' open reading frame was found to be nearly identical to a recently reported phospholipase C gene derived from a mutant B. cereus strain which overexpresses the respective protein, and it conferred a lecithinase-positive phenotype to the B. subtilis host. The 3' open reading frame encoded a sphingomyelinase. The two tandemly encoded activities, phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase, constitute a biologically functional cytolytic determinant of B. cereus termed cereolysin AB.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the alpha-toxin (phospholipase C) of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A fragment of DNA containing the gene coding for the phospholipase C (alpha-toxin) of Clostridium perfringens was cloned into Escherichia coli. The cloned DNA appeared to code only for the alpha-toxin and contained both the coding region and its associated gene promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA was determined, and an open reading frame was identified which encoded a protein with a molecular weight of 42,528. By comparison of the gene sequence with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein, a 28-amino-acid signal sequence was identified. The gene promoter showed considerable homology with the E. coli sigma 55 consensus promoter sequences, and this may explain why the gene was expressed by E. coli. The cloned gene product appeared to be virtually identical to the native protein. A 77-amino-acid stretch that was close to the N terminus of the alpha-toxin showed considerable homology with similarly located regions of the Bacillus cereus phosphatidylcholine, preferring phospholipase C and weaker homology with the phospholipase C from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The migration of bacteria through gels in the presence of IUCD monofilament tails.
AB  - An in vitro model was developed to investigate the migration of a variety of bacteria of different characteristics through a gel system in the presence or absence of a wide range of polymer monofilament threads. The bacteria were unable to migrate through the gel from the point of inoculation in the absence of a solid substrate. Migration occurred along all thread types tested, including those used as IUCD marker tails and the extent of bacterial migration appeared to be determined primarily by the motility of the microorganisms. The implications of these findings in relation to the development of pelvic infections in IUCD wearers is discussed.
TI  - The nucleotide sequence of the lipo-penicillinase gene of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 170.
AB  - The lipo-penicillinase (LIPEN) gene from an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 170  was cloned in Escherichia coli using the vector pHSG399. A plasmid, pFAP121, was isolated from an ampicillin resistant transformant and the cloned LIPEN gene was found to be in a 2.2 kb DNA fragment. The nucleotide sequence of a 1.9 kb segment encoding the LIPEN was determined. This segment showed an open reading frame which would encode a polypeptide of 310 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of this LIPEN gene product has strong homology with those of the Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase III and Bacillus licheniformis penicillinase.
TI  - Extracellular product of Nocardia amarae induces bacterial cell flocculation.
AB  - The fact that Nocardia amarae YK1 produced a bacterial flocculation-inducing substance (designated as FIX) was discovered. FIX had a function of flocculating proliferous cells. FIX-induced flocculation was inhibited by making cells resting, but not completely by adding chloramphenicol. FIX worked widely on Gram-positive to -negative bacteria. In the presence of FIX, Achromobacter cycloclastus IAM1013, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus IAM1517, Bacillus subtilis IAM1069, Escherichia coli C600-1, E. coli IAM1239, Flavobacterium lutescens IAM1667, Klebsiella pneumoniae IAM1102, Micrococcus luteus IAM1313 and Pseudomonas putida IAM1002 formed flocs. B. cereus IAM1029, however, exhibited no flocculation.

TI  - Beta-lactamase evaluation of the amoxycillin-clavulanate association.
AB  - The capability of potassium clavulanate to protect amoxycillin from destruction by three partially purified beta-lactamases (from E. cloacae, B. cereus 569/H9 and E. coli R-TEM) was evaluated. The enzymatic inhibition was determined spectrophotometrically by assessing the ability of either amoxycillin or potassium clavulanate or their combination (at a 7:1 ratio by weight) to prevent the hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate (nitrocefin) after different pre-incubation times, thus determining the IC50 and Ki values. Potassium clavulanate significantly reduced the IC50 values of amoxycillin for B. cereus and TEM enzymes by a factor ranging from 500 to 1200, by inhibiting these beta-lactamases at concentrations ranging from 4 to 0.008 microM. However, clavulanic acid was quite ineffective against type I enzymes (from E. cloacae), while amoxycillin was found to be sufficiently stable (IC50 of 0.8-1.4 microM).
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and expression in Escherichia coli of the gene coding for sphingomyelinase of Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Bacillus cereus secretes phospholipases C, which hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and phosphatidylinositol. A 7.5-kb HindIII fragment of B. cereus DNA cloned into Escherichia coli, with pUC18 as a vector, directed the synthesis of the sphingomyelin-hydrolyzing phospholipase C, sphingomyelinase. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the subfragment revealed that it contained two open reading frames in tandem. The upstream truncated open reading frame corresponds to the carboxy-terminal portion of the phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C, and the downstream open reading frame to the entire translational portion of the sphingomyelinase. The two phospholipase C genes form a gene cluster. As inferred from the DNA sequence, the B. cereus sphingomyelinase has a signal peptide of 27 amino acid residues and the mature enzyme comprises 306 amino acid residues, with a molecular mass of 34233 Da. The signal peptide of the enzyme was found to be functional in protein transport across the membrane of E. coli. The enzymatic properties of the sphingomyelinase synthesized in E. coli resemble those of the donor strain sphingomyelinase. The enzymatic activity toward sphingomyelin was enhanced 20-30-fold in the presence of MgCl2, and the adsorption of the enzyme onto erythrocyte membranes was accelerated in the presence of CaCl2.

TI  - Synthesis of some 5-azo(4'-substituted benzene-sulphamoyl)-8-hydroxyquinolines with antidotal and antibacterial activities.
AB  - 5-Azo(4'-substituted benzenesulphamoyl)-8-hydroxyquinolines(III) have been prepared by coupling of the appropriate p-substituted benzenesulphamoyldiazonium acetates with 8-hydroxyquinoline. The corresponding copper chelates(IV) and iron chelates(V) were also prepared in a 1:2 metal to ligand ratio. Structures of III, IV and V were confirmed by some representative UV, IR, and NMR spectrometry in addition to microanalysis. Antidotal activity of four ligands (IIIa, IIId, IIIf, and IIIi) has been evaluated in mice against the toxicity of lead acetate and copper sulphate. Study revealed that compound IIIf elicited significant antidotal activity against lead and copper poisoning, while IIIi was potent only against lead poisoning. Antibacterial activity of compounds III, IV, and V was also determined in comparison to sulphanilamide against Staph. aureus, Bacill. cereus, and Esch. coli. The test compounds showed variable bacteriostatic activities, and some of them (IIIc, IIId, IIIf, Ve, IIIg, and Vi) are more effective than the reference drug, especially against Bacill. cereus.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase C of Bacillus cereus.
AB  - A synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide probe was used to clone the gene encoding the phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase C of Bacillus cereus. The sequence of a 2050-bp restriction fragment containing the gene was determined. Analysis of the gene-derived amino acid (aa) sequence showed that this exoenzyme is probably synthesized as a 283-aa precursor with a 24-aa signal peptide and a 14-aa propeptide. The mature, secreted enzyme comprises 245 aa residues. Sonicates of Escherichia coli HB101 carrying the gene on a multicopy plasmid showed phospholipase C activity. This activity was inhibited by Tris, a known inhibitor of the B. cereus enzyme and also by antiserum raised against pure B. cereus phospholipase C. We conclude therefore that the gene is expressed in E. coli. The cloning and sequencing described here complete the first step toward using in vitro mutagenesis for investigations of the structure-function relationships of B. cereus phospholipase C.
TI  - Protection of cadmium toxicity to B. cereus, E. coli and A. niger by Na+, Mg++ and Ca++ ions.
AB  - 10ppm of cadmium apparently seem to extend the lag phase of Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli but in reality both 10 and 100ppm decreased the growth with differing intensity. 1.0ppm of cadmium decreased the growth of Aspergillus niger, and it failed to grow at 500ppm. However, addition of calcium, magnesium and sodium gave increasing protection against cadmium toxicity for the growth of B. cereus, E. coli an A. niger. It is inferred that environment pollution by cadmium is related to the cationic availability in the environment.

TI  - beta-lactamase I from Bacillus cereus. Structure and site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  - The sequence of the gene for beta-lactamase I from Bacillus cereus 569/H has been redetermined. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis has been carried out, and the effects of the changes on the ampicillin-resistance of Escherichia coli TG1 expressing the mutant genes have been studied. Lysine-73, close to the active-site serine-70 and a highly-conserved residue, has been converted into arginine. This change had a large effect on activity, but did not abolish it. An even larger effect was found in the mutant in which glutamate-166 had been converted into glutamine; this had little or no activity. On the other hand, the conversion of glutamate-168 into aspartate gave fully active enzyme. Glutamate-166 is an invariant residue, but glutamate-168 is not. Alanine-123 has been replaced by cysteine, to give active enzyme; this change forms part of the plan to introduce a disulphide bond into the enzyme.
TI  - Production of staphylococcal enterotoxin in mixed cultures.
AB  - Two Staphylococcus aureus strains were grown in brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth  and a meat medium with Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both S. aureus strains grew well and produced enterotoxin in the presence of S. faecalis in BHI broth; however, enterotoxin production was observable in the meat medium only when the S. aureus inoculum was greater than the S. faecalis inoculum. S. aureus FRI-100 grown with B. cereus produced enterotoxin in both media only when the S. aureus inoculum was much higher than the B. cereus inoculum (10 versus 10(4) CFU), whereas S. aureus FRI-196E produced enterotoxin in both media at all inoculum combinations except in the meat medium, when the inocula of the two organisms were the same. S. aureus grown with E. coli in BHI broth produced enterotoxin at all inoculum combinations except when the E. coli inoculum was greater than the S. aureus inoculum; however, in the meat medium, enterotoxin was produced only when the S. aureus inoculum was much greater than the E. coli inoculum (10 versus 10(4) CFU), S. aureus FRI-100 grown with P. aeruginosa in either medium produced enterotoxin only when the S. aureus inoculum was much greater than the P. aeruginosa inoculum (10 versus 10(3) or 10(4) CFU). It can be concluded from these results that enterotoxin production is unlikely in mixed cultures unless the staphylococci outnumber the other contaminating organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  - Egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including Listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of Clostridium botulinum. We also found that the food spoilage thermophile Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme and confirmed that the spoilage organisms Bacillus stearothermophilus and Clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. Several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. The results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes.
TI  - Oxygen profiles in, and in the agar beneath, colonies of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus albus and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The paper reports the use of microelectrodes to measure O2 penetration in different aged colonies of Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus albus. In young (18 h) colonies of B. cereus and E. coli O2 disappeared at depths of 25-30 micron and 35-40 micron respectively. In young S. albus colonies, O2 reached a minimum but was never completely absent. As colonies aged (24-168 h) the depth to which O2 penetrated increased.
TI  - [Experimental basis of principles for creating microbiologic standards for food products for children during the 1st year of life].
AB  - Standard media were designed simulating the gastro-intestinal contents of infants during the first year of life. These media were used in the in vitro tests to study the viability of a number of potentially-pathogenic microorganisms. It was shown that S. aureus, E. coli O-III, S. liquefaciens not only survived but also multiplied in the media with pH values similar to those of gastric juice in infants of the first year of life, in the presence of the mixture for child nutrition "Malysh". The results obtained necessitate strict requirements for the absence of potentially-pathogenic microorganisms in definite volumes of dry milk mixtures and their components intended for child nutrition.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the blaZ gene encoding beta-lactamase III, a lipoprotein of Bacillus cereus 569/H.
AB  - It has not been clear whether the membrane-bound beta-lactamase III of Bacillus cereus 569 is a separate enzyme or a modified form of the secreted beta-lactamase I. The membrane enzyme is an acyl-glyceride thioether-linked lipoprotein (J. B. K. Nielsen and J. O. Lampen, Biochemistry 22:4652-4656, 1983) and thus is probably a separate entity. We cloned the beta-lactamase III gene (blaZ) on a 4.9-kilobase-pair ClaI fragment from mutant strain 569/H (constitutive for high-level production of beta-lactamases I, II, and III), and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The structural gene was flanked by typical promoter, transcription termination, and translation initiation sequences. Expression of the cloned gene in Escherichia coli was low in exponential-phase cultures and increased only as the cultures reached the stationary phase. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates a pre-beta-lactamase III of 316 amino acid residues (35,021 daltons), with a 29-residue signal peptide and a mature lipoprotein form of approximately 32,500 daltons. The 12 NH2-terminal residues of a 21-kilodalton tryptic peptide from the B. cereus membrane enzyme were in agreement with the sequence deduced from the cloned gene. The amino acid sequence was highly homologous to the class A beta-lactamases, especially that of Bacillus licheniformis 749. beta-Lactamase III is a distinct class A enzyme and the product of a separate gene (blaZ).

TI  - [Effect of surface-active agents on the electrical properties of bacterial cells].
AB  - The work was aimed at studying the effect of cationic, anionic and non-ionogenic  surfactants on the frequency dependence of the electroorientation effect (EOE) and on the electrophoretic mobility (EPM) of rod-like bacteria. The character of concentration dependences was found to differ for EOE and EPM at a low frequency of the electric field (20 to 10(4) Hz). Analysis of EOE changes at a high frequency (4 X 10(5) to 3 X 10(7) Hz) showed that anionic and non-ionogenic surfactants at a concentration up to 10(-3) M did not damage Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative bacterium, in contrast to Bacillus cereus, a Gram-positive bacterium. Cationic surfactants affected the cells of the both species. The optical properties of bacterial cells were found to change under the action of cationic surfactants.
TI  - Lethal effect of butylated hydroxyanisole as related to bacterial fatty acid composition.
AB  - Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas fragi, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella "anatum" were challenged with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). Susceptibility was measured as the concentration of BHA required to cause a 90% reduction in bacterial survivors. Staphylococcus aureus LP and P. fragi were two of the most resistant species examined; C. perfringens and P. fluorescens were the most susceptible. Gram stain reaction was found not to be a strict indicator of bacterial susceptibility to BHA. There was no obvious relationship between individual fatty acids and susceptibility. The ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in the total lipid fraction of only the gram-positive species was related to susceptibility. The ratios of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids of other fractions were not related to susceptibility.
TI  - Differential scanning calorimetry of bacteria.
AB  - Thermograms obtained by differential scanning calorimetry of a range of bacteria  of different heat resistances were compared. Equations were derived to calculate the rate at which the numbers of viable organisms in a calorimeter decline as the temperature is raised at a constant rate. Vegetative bacteria scanned at 10 degrees C min-1 showed multi-peaked thermograms with four major peaks (denoted m, n, p and q) occurring in the regions 68-73, 77-84, 89-99 and 105-110 degrees C respectively. Exceptions were that peak m (the largest peak) occurred at 79-82 degrees C in Bacillus stearothermophilus and an additional peak, r, was detected in Escherichia coli at 119 degrees C. At temperatures below the main peak m there were major differences in thermograms between species. There was a direct relationship between the onset of thermal denaturation and the thermoresistance of different organisms. Heat-sensitive organisms displayed thermogram features which were absent in the more heat-resistant types. When samples were cooled to 5 degrees C and re-heated, a small endothermic peak, pr, was observed at the same temperature as p. Peaks p and pr were identified as the melting endotherms of DNA. In all vegetative organisms examined, maximum death rates, computed from published D and z values, occurred at temperatures above the onset of thermal denaturation, i.e. cell death and irreversible denaturation of cell components occurred within the same temperature range.

TI  - Intestinal carriage of Bacillus cereus: faecal isolation studies in three population groups.
AB  - The results of examinations of stools for Bacillus cereus among three unrelated groups of individuals are presented. The groups consisted of (1) healthy school-children aged 6-11 years in a rural region of South Africa examined during each of the four seasons of the year; (2) 15 healthy volunteers comprising staff of a London microbiology laboratory and their families examined on each of 3 consecutive weeks; (3) 75 unrelated young children, 2 months to 5 years of age, in a second rural region of South Africa examined during a pilot study of 1 week's duration on the aetiology of rural gastroenteritis. The stools of the last group were submitted as being related to present or recent diarrhoea in the respective children. In group 1, B. cereus isolation rates ranged from 24.3% at the autumn visit to 43% at the summer visit with a significantly higher rate of isolation in the summer than at other seasons of the year (P less than 0.05). B. cereus was isolated from 40% of group 2 volunteers on week 1, none on week 2 and 20% on week 3. The organism was detected in the 12 positive specimens at levels of approximately 10(2)/g and constituted 2.5-30% of the total aerobic spore-forming bacillus population in the stools. In group 3, B. cereus was recovered from 18.7% of the stool samples and was isolated consecutively with other pathogens (enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and rotavirus) on only five occasions. In groups 1 and 3, less than 5% of the stools had '3+' levels of B. cereus (greater than 10 colonies per direct plate culture). B. cereus was readily isolated from all of 10 food samples, representative of the typical diet of the group 1 individuals, and was present in substantial numbers (10(4) to 5.5 X 10(6)/g) in half of them. The isolation results, supported by serotyping, indicated that carriage of B. cereus in stools is transient and its presence at any one time reflects solely its intake with foods.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the metallothioprotein beta-lactamase II gene of Bacillus cereus 569/H in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The structural gene for beta-lactamase II (EC 3.5.2.6), a metallothioenzyme, from Bacillus cereus 569/H (constitutive for high production of the enzyme) was cloned in Escherichia coli, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. This is the first class B beta-lactamase whose primary structure has been reported. The amino acid sequence of the exoenzyme form, deduced from the DNA, indicates that beta-lactamase II, like other secreted proteins, is synthesized as a precursor with a 30-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide. The pre-beta-lactamase II (Mr, 28,060) is processed in E. coli and in B. cereus to a single mature protein (Mr, 24,932) which is totally secreted by B. cereus but in E. coli remains intracellular, probably in the periplasm. The expression of the gene in E. coli RR1 on the multicopy plasmid pRWHO12 was comparable to that in B. cereus, where it is presumably present as a single copy. The three histidine residues that are involved (along with the sole cysteine of the mature protein) in Zn(II) binding and hence in enzymatic activity against beta-lactams were identified. These findings will help to define the secondary structure, mechanism of action, and evolutionary lineage of B. cereus beta-lactamase II and other class B beta-lactamases.
TI  - The amino acid sequence of the zinc-requiring beta-lactamase II from the bacterium Bacillus cereus 569.
AB  - The amino acid sequence of the zinc-requiring beta-lactamase II from Bacillus cereus strain 569 has been determined. It consists of a single polypeptide chain of 227 residues. It is the only example so far fully characterized of a class B beta-lactamase, and is structurally and mechanistically distinct from both the widely distributed class A beta-lactamases (such as the Escherichia coli RTEM enzyme) and from the chromosomally encoded class C enzymes from Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Cloning and Expression of an Insecticidal k-73 Type Crystal Protein Gene from Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki into Escherichia coli.
AB  - A 75-kilobase plasmid from Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (HD-244) was associated with the k-73 type insecticidal crystal protein production by mating into B. cereus and subsequent curing of excess plasmids. This plasmid was partially digested with endonuclease R . Sau3A and the fragments were cloned into Escherichia coli (HB101) on vector pBR322. Candidate clones were screened for plasmid vectors which contained the expected insert size (at least 3 kilobases) and then with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using antisera prepared against electrophoretically purified, solubilized insecticidal crystal protein of 130,000 daltons. Several positive clones were isolated and were analyzed for expression, toxicity, and genetic content by restriction enzyme analysis. Electrophoretic transfer blots of proteins from a candidate E. coli clone, analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, demonstrated a predominant cross-reacting protein of about 140,000 daltons. Ouchterlony analysis also showed a single precipitin band. Extensive bioassays with Manduca sexta larvae revealed that the E. coli clones make toxin with a specific activity (50% lethal dose per microgram of cross-reacting protein) equivalent to that of the parental B. thuringiensis strain or a B. cereus trancipient carrying the toxin-encoding, 75-kilobase plasmid.
TI  - [Antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment].
AB  - This study was carried out to understand the antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment in boiling water. The samples included the core and the outer layers of onion, the white and the green parts of green onion, garlic bulb, ginger, ginger root, sweet pepper, chili pepper, brown pepper, and mustard. The test microorganisms included Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium phlei, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Micrococcus luteus. Raw garlic bulb could inhibit all of the test strains. The antibacterial activities of green onion are slightly weak than that of onion. However, green onion could inhibit P. aeruginosa and M. luteus, but onion could inhibit E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. faecalis, and B. cereus. Ginger and ginger root could only inhibit M. luteus. Chili pepper could inhibit V. parahaemolyticus and P. vulgaris. Brown pepper could also inhibit P. vulgaris. Sweet pepper and mustard showed no antibacterial activity to all of the test strains. In general, antibacterial components in the spice plants were heat labile. All the spices tested lost their antibacterial activities within 20 min at 100 degrees C.
TI  - Murine monoclonal anti-DNA autoantibodies bind to endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Several bacterial species (including Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli) were tested for their ability to react with monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies that were derived from MRL-lpr/lpr mice. S. faecalis reacted with 8/15 of such antibodies. The binding was unaffected by DNase, but it was competitively inhibited by DNA. F(ab')2 fragments of the monoclonal antibodies reacted with the bacteria, but Fc fragments did not. Phospholipids extracted from the bacterial cells were able to bind to three representative anti-DNA antibodies that also bound to whole bacteria. The results suggest that bacterial phospholipids might provide an immunogenic stimulus for the production of antibodies that cross-react with DNA. We propose that some anti-DNA auto-antibodies and anti-bacterial antibodies evolve from a restricted group of antibodies with high avidity for the phosphodiester groups that occur in DNA and bacterial cells walls.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the beta-lactamase I gene of Bacillus cereus 5/B and its expression in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The beta-lactamases of Bacillus cereus have attracted interest because they are secreted efficiently, because multiple enzymes are frequently present, and because their regulation has unusual features. beta-Lactamase I of strain 5/B is produced constitutively at a high level, and the exoenzyme appears to be several thousand daltons larger than the corresponding product of strain 569/H. We have cloned the gene for 5/B beta-lactamase I in Escherichia coli and B. subtilis and have sequenced the structural portion and the regulatory regions. The 5/B enzyme is produced at a low level in E. coli RR1(pRWY200) and remains cellbound. In B. subtilis it is formed in large amounts, and over 90% of it is released into the medium. There is a large degree of homology between the promoter and leader peptide regions of the 5/B and 569/H genes; both utilize UUG as the translation initiation codon (P. S. F. Mezes, R. W. Blacher, and J. O. Lampen, (J. Biol. Chem. 260:1218-1223, 1985). Although there are significant differences in the peptide segment where processing would be expected to occur, the NH2 terminus of the major 5/B product from B. subtilis BD170(pRWY215) is His-44, which is the same as the NH2 terminus of the major 569/H product from B. subtilis BD170(pRWM5).

TI  - Heterogeneity of 5S RNA in fungal ribosomes.
AB  - Neurospora crassa has at least seven types of 5S RNA genes (alpha, beta, gamma, epsilon, delta, zeta, and eta) with different coding regions. A high resolution gel electrophoresis system was developed to separate minor 5S RNA's from the major 5S RNA (alpha). A study of several Neurospora crassa strains, four other species in the genus Neurospora, members of two closely related genera, and three distantly related genera demonstrated that 5S RNA heterogeneity is common among fungi. In addition, different 5S RNA's are present in Neurospora ribosomes. The finding that fungal ribosomes are structurally heterogeneous suggests that ribosomes may be functionally heterogeneous as well.
TI  - Microbiological aspects of goat's milk. A Public Health Laboratory Service survey.
AB  - In a 12-month survey (June 1982-May 1983) 41 laboratories examined 2493 samples of goat's milk for colony counts and the presence of pathogens. The statutory tests for cow's milk were also applied. Surface counts of less than 10(5) organisms per ml of raw milk were given by 79% of samples at 37 degrees C and by 76% at 22 degrees C. There were less than 100 coliforms per ml in 71% of samples, less than 10 Escherichia coli per ml in 91%. Staphylococcus aureus was not detected in countable numbers in 96% of samples. Only one isolation of campylobacter was made and two of Yersinia enterocolitica. Salmonella was not detected in 2462 samples. The methylene blue test was carried out on 2368 samples and 86.7% were deemed satisfactory. No sample was Brucella ring-test-positive. Experiments on the survival and growth of six food poisoning organisms in stored goat's milk showed that Bacillus cereus, Staph. aureus, Salmonella typhimurium and Y. enterocolitica survived quite well and multiplied at the higher storage temperature of 30 degrees C. Clostridium perfringens only increased 10- to 100-fold while Campylobacter jejuni did not grow. The results of the survey indicate that any problems with goat's milk relate to poor hygiene during production rather than transmission of organisms from the goat herself.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine against 10 microbial strains was studied with an agar dilution method. The strains tested were Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), and one of each of the clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis (a multiresistant strain), Staphylococcus epidermidis (a sensitive strain), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (A), Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans. The antimicrobial effect of bupivacaine was tested at concentrations of 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/ml (0.05% 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.5%). Bupivacaine at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml inhibited the growth of the sensitive S. epidermidis strain, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae, and all of the others except P. aeruginosa at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Morphine 0.2 and 2 mg/ml (0.02 and 0.2%) did not inhibit any of the strains.
TI  - Processing of Bacillus cereus 569/H beta-lactamase I in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The gene for Bacillus cereus 569/H beta-lactamase I, penPC, has recently been cloned and sequenced (Mezes, P. S. F., Yang, Y. Q., Hussain, M., and Lampen, J. O. (1983) FEBS Lett. 161, 195-200). A typical prokaryotic signal peptide but with no lipoprotein modification site, as present in the Bacillus licheniformis 749/C beta-lactamase, was indicated by the DNA sequence for this secretory protein. We have here purified the beta-lactamase I products found in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis carrying penPC and have determined the first 20 NH2-terminal amino acids of each of the forms. Processing of the beta-lactamase I in E. coli occurs at a single site which is characteristic for cleavage by a signal peptidase. B. subtilis secreted two distinct products to the culture medium which were both smaller than the single product formed in E. coli. Sequencing of [35S]Met-labeled pre-beta-lactamase I from phenylethyl alcohol-treated cells of B. cereus 569/H indicated that UUG is being utilized as the initiation codon for penPC. The same result was obtained for the pre-beta-lactamase I from similarly treated cells of the closely related B. cereus 5/B strain.

TI  - A model for the secondary structure of beta-lactamases.
AB  - A 3-dimensional model, common for the secondary structures of four beta-lactamases obtained from Escherichia coli, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus, is proposed. The predictions of the structures were made by the hydrophobicity profiles method complemented by the modified Chou and Fasman's method. The model proposed presents 56% constancy and can be described as a 2-domain structure, in agreement with low resolution X-ray data reported for the E. coli enzyme. The model would explain how a common function can be performed by enzymes of very different sizes, composition and sequence.
TI  - Comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  - It is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. Although the effect of most of these toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. The resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. The biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase, leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. The duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. Subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. The heat-labile toxins of V. cholerae, E. coli, Salmonella spp., A. hydrophila and Y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. Similarly the heat-stable toxins of E. coli and Y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. Classified along with the enterotoxin of C. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by Sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of E. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. In another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by Staph. aureus until more is known. Surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological and structural differences. Evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. The structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. It is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like V. cholerae.

TI  - [Medical aspects of elaboration of microbiological criteria for evaluating the quality and principles of microbiological standards of dried milk and other mixtures for children in the first year of life].
AB  - The author demonstrates the ability of St. aureus, E. coli O III, B. cereus and other opportunistic microorganisms to multiply in model media similar to those in the alimentary tract of children of the first year of life. Describes the principal differences between microbiological criteria of evaluating the quality and safety of infant food mixtures and other products intended for children of the first year of life and these criteria for consumer goods. Emphasizes that food mixtures for infant nutrition should not contain potentially pathogenic and pathogenic microorganisms. At the present stage of manufacturing food for children of the first year of life the microbiological criteria are based on an assay of mesophilic aerobic microorganisms in 1 g (ml) and on the determination of the mass of the ready-made mixture or other product which should not contain E. coli that ferment glucose, coliform bacteria, lactose, E. coli, St. aureus, salmonella, yeast and mold.
TI  - beta-Lactamase-catalyzed hydrolysis of acyclic depsipeptides and acyl transfer to specific amino acid acceptors.
AB  - beta-Lactamases from all three classes, A, B, and C, catalyze the hydrolysis of specific acyclic depsipeptide (PhCH2CONHCR1R2CO2CHR3CO2H) analogs of acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine peptides. The depsipeptides investigated, which are chemically as reactive toward nucleophiles as penicillins, are in general poor substrates, although differences between the classes of beta-lactamases have been observed: the order of effectiveness seems to be C greater than B greater than A. Certain class A and C beta-lactamases also catalyze phenylacetylglycyl transfer between phenylacetylglycyl depsipeptides and specific amino acid acceptors, a type of reaction hitherto identified more closely with D-alanyl-D-alanine transpeptidases than with beta-lactamases. Preliminary indications of an acyl-enzyme intermediate in these reactions have been obtained. These results support the suggestion [Tipper, D.J. and Strominger, J.L. (1965) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 54, 1133-1141] that beta-lactamases are evolutionary descendants of bacterial cell wall D-alanyl-D-alanine transpeptidases.
TI  - [Effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  - Bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. Of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains, the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Streptococcus sanguis, S. saprophyticus, S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus flavus, Actinomyces viscosus, Veillonella sp., Enterobacter liquefaciens, Yersinia enterocolitica. Lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. Proteus vulgaris, Y. enterocolitica and Chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. The yeasts Endomyces lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. The kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.
TI  - The microbiology of selected retail food products with an evaluation of viable counting methods.
AB  - In an inter-laboratory survey, the pour plate, surface spread, agar droplet and spiral plate methods were used in parallel with the surface drop method for enumeration of micro-organisms in foods. Good agreement was obtained between all surface methods of enumeration, but there was poor agreement between molten agar methods and the surface drop method. A total of 1143 samples of food that were ready for consumption at the point of retail sale were examined. Eight types of food products were chosen: meat pasties, sausage rolls, real-cream slices, synthetic-cream slices, mayonnaise-based coleslaws, faggots, pates and continental sausages. The results of this survey suggest that the upper limit for an acceptable viable count should vary according to the food product. Salmonellae were not isolated on any occasion. Potentially harmful organisms were not isolated at levels expected to constitute a public health hazard. Information concerning the nature of the product, the total viable count, the presence or absence of pathogenic, toxigenic or indicator organisms, the spectrum of the bacterial flora and the relative predominance of each organism must all be considered when assessing the microbiological acceptability of retail 'ready to eat' products.
TI  - Postincision steps of photoproduct removal in a mutant of Bacillus cereus 569 that produces UV-sensitive spores.
AB  - An excision-defective mutant of Bacillus cereus 569 is normal in incision and repair synthesis, but rejoining of incision breaks is defective, resulting in accumulation of low-molecular-weight DNA after UV irradiation. The defect in removal of photoproducts by exonuclease after incision renders both vegetative cells and dormant spores of the mutant sensitive to UV. A similarity is indicated to the uvrD mutation described recently in Escherichia coli.

TI  - Bacillus cereus 569/H beta-lactamase I: cloning in Escherichia coli and signal sequence determination.
AB  - The gene, penPC, for beta-lactamase I of Bacillus cereus 569/H has been cloned and its expression studied in Escherichia coli. The protein product from the in vitro translation of penPC was shown by gel electrophoresis to have an Mr of 36 000 which is larger than the in vivo products found in B. cereus and E. coli. The DNA sequence of the signal region was determined. It revealed that the smallest known mature form present in B. cereus culture fluids is preceded by 45-48 amino acids in pre-beta-lactamase I, considering that there are 3 initiation codons in the same reading frame, one or more of which might be initiating translation. Unlike the Bacillus licheniformis 749/C beta-lactamase, which has a membrane-bound thioether lipoprotein form, the single Cys residue in the B. cereus beta-lactamase I signal sequence is unmodified and a single processed form of the enzyme is present in E. coli cells carrying penPC.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis of the hemolysin (cereolysin) determinant from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - From a cosmid gene bank of Bacillus cereus GP4 in Escherichia coli we isolated clones which, after several days of incubation, formed hemolysis zones on erythrocyte agar plates. These clones contained recombinant cosmids with B. cereus DNA insertions of varying lengths which shared some common restriction fragments. The smallest insertion was recloned as a PstI fragment into pJKK3-1, a shuttle vector which replicates in Bacillus subtilis and E. coli. When this recombinant plasmid (pJKK3-1 hly-1) was transformed into E. coli, it caused hemolysis on erythrocyte agar plates, but in liquid assays no external or internal hemolytic activity could be detected with the E. coli transformants. B. subtilis carrying the same plasmid exhibited hemolytic activity at levels comparable to those of the B. cereus donor strain. The hemolysin produced in B. subtilis seemed to be indistinguishable from cereolysin in its sensitivity to cholesterol, activation by dithiothreitol, and inactivation by antibodies raised against cereolysin. When the recombinant DNA carrying the cereolysin gene was used as a probe in hybridization experiments with chromosomal DNA from a streptolysin O-producing strain of Streptococcus pyogenes or from listeriolysin-producing strains of Listeria monocytogenes, no positive hybridization signals were obtained. These data suggest that the genes for these three SH-activated cytolysins do not have extended sequence homology.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the type I beta-lactamase gene from  Bacillus cereus.
AB  - The gene for the type I beta-lactamase from Bacillus cereus has been cloned in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. In B. subtilis, penicillinase activity is detected and the enzyme is secreted. In E. coli, the gene confers ampicillin resistance. The cloned insert is 4.3 kb in length and DNA sequencing has revealed the location of the gene, its promoter and signal peptide.
TI  - [Membrane-active properties of a preparation from a bacterial culture broth possessing autoregulation action].
AB  - The effect of a preparation obtained by butanol extraction of the culture fluid of B. cereus and Ps. carboxydoflava and previously termed an autoregulatory factor d1 on the respiration chain within intact bacterial cells and isolated membranes was investigated. In comparable concentrations this factor d1 inhibits the endogenous respiration of B. cereus and M. lysodeikticus as well as oxidase and dehydrogenase activities of isolated membranes from these bacteria and E. coli. The factor-induced decrease of the cell respiration rate is independent from disorders of the cell permeability osmotic barrier for respiration substrates. The factor d1 shows a higher effect at acidic pH values. It is concluded that the above preparation has membrane-active properties. It is also suggested that in the bacterial cell its target is the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of dissociated and undissociated sorbic acid at different pH levels.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration of sorbic acid has been determined for Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The inhibition was shown to be due to both undissociated and dissociated acid, and the effect of each has been calculated in accordance with a proposed mathematical model. Although the inhibitory action of undissociated acid was 10-600 times greater than that of dissociated acid, the latter caused more than 50% of the growth inhibition at pH levels above 6 for most of the organisms tested.
TI  - Bacterial enteritis.
AB  
TI  - Recent advances in management of bacterial diarrhea.
AB  - The number of recognized infectious causes of diarrhea potentially treatable with specific antibiotics has markedly increased within the past ten years. Laboratories are developing and expanding their abilities to deal with these new pathogens. Neither prophylaxis nor specific treatment of diarrhea in travelers is simple, practical, and safe. Although enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli is the most important cause of diarrhea in U.S. travelers to tropical areas, Campylobacter jejuni causes acute diarrhea in persons in the United States about as often as do Salmonella and Shigella. Vibrio parahemolyticus is an important cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis following ingestion of improperly cooked shellfish; Bacillus cereus is important in outbreaks of diarrhea after ingestion of improperly cooked and stored rice in Chinese restaurants. Although Yersinia enterocolitica is probably an important cause of severe enteritis in the United States, imperfect techniques for its isolation and lack of good serologic tests have hampered recognition of its importance. Practical means for diagnosing antibiotic-associated colitis and the role of Clostridium difficile toxins in this disease are now available. Vancomycin, metronidazole, bacitracin, and cholestyramine are useful in treatment of antibiotic-associated colitis.
TI  - Evaluation of the direct epifluorescent filter technique for assessing the hygienic condition of milking equipment.
AB  - The hygienic condition of 6 milking installations, 3 sanitized by circulation cleaning (CC) with chlorine-based chemicals and 3 by flushing with acidified boiling water (ABW), was tested using rinses of quarter strength Ringer's solution. The bacterial content of the rinses was determined using both colony counts and the direct epifluorescent filter technique (DEFT). A comparison of testing methods gave correlation coefficients between colony count and DEFT of 0.82 for plants using CC and 0.46 for plants using ABW. Five strains of bacteria belonging to different genera and commonly found on milking equipment were exposed to various degrees of heat and to various concentrations of chlorine. The effects of such treatments on the staining characteristics of the organisms were studied. It was observed that Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus lactis, although killed by heat treatment, stained a bright orange when treated with acridine orange dye. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Escherichia coli and vegetative cells of Bacillus cereus did not take up the orange stain after heat treatment, nor did any of the 5 strains stain orange after treatment with NaOCl. It is suggested that the DEFT is a useful and rapid means of counting bacteria in rinses of equipment where sterilization is due primarily to chlorination, but in the absence of a stain which can differentiate more accurately between dead and living organisms its use is limited where sterilization is carried out solely by heat.
TI  - What do beta-lactamases mean for clinical efficacy?
AB  - beta-Lactamases have proved to be extremely important in influencing therapy with penicillins and cephalosporins against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species. Both plasmid mediated beta-lactamases which are primarily of a constitutive penicillinase type and the inducible chromosomal enzymes which are primarily cephalosporinases are important. The use of penicillins to treat Haemophilus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Salmonella, Shigella and Pseudomonas infections must be based upon the relative incidence of beta-lactamase producing strains. In the same manner cephalosporins can be used to treat infections due to Enterobacter, Serratia and Bacteroides only if the compounds are beta-lactamase stable and not good inducers of beta-lactamase activity. Although altered permeability is important in the resistance of some Pseudomonas and Enterobacter to beta-lactams, the resistance really is due to a combination of reduced entry of molecules and strategically placed beta-lactamases. It is only in some Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis strains that altered penicillin-binding proteins make a significant contribution to the resistance to beta-lactams. beta-lactamases will continue to be the most important factor in clinically significant resistance of bacteria to both penicillins and cephalosporins.

TI  - [Effects of 5-bromouracil and 5-bromodeoxyuridine in combination with 8-aza-adenine on the UV sensitivity of bacteria].
AB  - The presence of 5-bromouracil (BU) as well as 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BUdR) in the cultivation media of bacteria results in the distinct increase of UV sensitivity. With the nucleic acid base analogue 8-azaadenine (8-AA) a similar effect was confirmed, however, not so pronounced. In the experiments reported here the combined action of BU or BUdR and 8-AA on Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus was investigated. The sensitization effect of BUdR does not increase if 8-AA is present additionally during cultivation. On the contrary, a decrease of sensibilization occurs. This result may be caused by the protective effect of the adenine derivative against UV irradiation, if it is present in the cell, but not incorporated into the DNA.
TI  - Penicillinase secretion in vivo and in vitro.
AB  
TI  - Ampicillin induced septum formation in Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Cells of Bacillus cereus grown in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of ampicillin at either 30 degrees or 45 degrees C exhibited an increase in the numbers of centres of septum formation per unit cell length. Under identical conditions of cultivation, cells of Escherichia coli grew as aseptate filaments. In general, untreated B. cereus cells grown at 45 degrees C were longer than those grown at 30 degrees C. The strain of E. coli used was unaffected in terms of filamentation by elevated growth temperature. Results are discussed in terms of the presence and availability of penicillin binding proteins and autolysins involved in cell growth, division and separation.
TI  - [In vitro study of the lipase activity of bacterial strains isolated from the rabbit cecum on C14-labeled triolein].
AB  - The lipase activity of bacterial species isolated from the caecum of conventional rabbits was studied by means of two groups of tests: (1) bacteriologic isolation and an identification of nine aerobic and anaerobic clones and (2) incubation of each of these clones in the appropriate medium in the presence of labelled triolein (oleyl 1-14C), a biochemical analysis of the radioactivity of the fractions obtained. The main results can be expressed in the following way: maximum hydrolysis of glycerides is achieved by two species: Bacillus licheniformis and Clostridium sporogenes. The reaction is proportional to the incubation time for incubations of less than 8 h. The release of fatty acids is concomitant to the synthesis of phospholipids and of fatty acid methyl esters.
TI  - Glyceride-cysteine lipoproteins and secretion by Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The membrane penicillinases of Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus cereus are lipoproteins with N-terminal glyceride thioether modification identical to that of the Escherichia coli outer membrane lipoprotein. They are readily labeled with [3H]palmitate present during exponential growth. At the same time, a few other proteins in each organism become labeled and can be detected by fluorography after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of total membrane proteins. We distinguish these proteins from the O-acyl proteolipids by demonstrating the formation of glyceryl cysteine sulfone after performic acid oxidation and hydrolysis of the protein. By this criterion, B. licheniformis and B. cereus contain sets of lipoproteins larger in average molecular weight than that of E. coli. Members of the sets probably are under a variety of physiological controls, as indicated by widely differing relative labeling intensity in different media. The set in B. licheniformis shares with membrane penicillinase a sensitivity to release from protoplasts by mild trypsin treatment, which suggests similar orientation on the outside of the membrane. At least one protein is the membrane-bound partner of an extracellular hydrophilic protein, the pair being related as membrane and exopenicillinases are. We propose that the lipoproteins of gram-positive organisms are the functional equivalent of periplasmic proteins in E. coli and other gram-negative bacteria, prevented from release by anchorage to the membrane rather than by a selectively impermeable outer membrane.

AB  - Synthesis of a series of 3,6-dinitro-1:8-naphthaloylamino acids (II-IX) and some  of their corresponding methyl esters (X-XVI) and 3,6-diamino-1:8-naphthaloylamino acid derivatives (XXIX-XXXVI) is described. Coupling of 3,6-dinitro-1:8-naphthaloylamino acids with amino acid methyl ester hydrochlorides in dioxane-DMF-Et3N medium using DCC method furnishes the desired 3,6-dinitro-1:8-naphthaloyldipeptide methyl esters (XVII-XXVIII). Most of the synthesized 3,6-dinitro-1:8-naphthaloylamino acids, esters and dipeptide derivatives (compounds III-VI, XI-XV, XVII, XIX-XXI, XXIII and XXV) and 3,6-diamino-1:8-naphthaloylamino acid derivatives (XXIX-XXXV) were found to be active against a number of microorganisms.
TI  - Microbial contamination of enteral feeds.
AB  
TI  - Membrane-bound penicillinases in Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The penicillinases of Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus are related in structure and cellular localization to one another more closely than they are to penicillinases from Gram-negative organisms. In the latter, penicillinases are almost exclusively found in the periplasm, while the Gram-positive bacteria retain a substantial proportion as hydrophobic membrane-bound forms. We recently showed (Nielsen, J. B. K., Caulfield, M. P., and Lampen, J. O. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 3511-3515) that B. licheniformis membrane attachment was achieved through a glyceride thioether modification identical to that in several Gram-negative outer membrane proteins. We now report that the membrane penicillinases of S. aureus and B. cereus also possess the modification. We do this by demonstrating isotopic labeling of these forms of [3H]palmitate, by showing that they exhibit the same response to the antibiotic globomycin which appears to inhibit processing steps specifically involving the glyceride thioether in Escherichia coli outer membrane proteins, and lastly by isolating glyceryl cysteine sulfone, the oxidation product of the modified cysteine residue. By comparing the modification-susceptible signal sequences of Gram-positive penicillinases and of Gram-negative outer membrane proteins with those of nonmodified Gram-negative penicillinases, we describe in increased detail the structural features within the signal sequence that allow modification and cleavage resulting in membrane anchorage.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the phospholipids of Escherichia coli k12.
AB  - Phospholipids from Escherichia coli K12 were converted to 1,2-diacylglycerols with phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus. High-pressure liquid chromatography of 1,2-diacylglycerol p-methoxybenzoates on LiChrosorb RP-18 using 2-propanol/acetonitrile (35:65) as eluant permitted separation of 14 molecular species. The main combinations of fatty acids were 1-16:0-2-16:1, 1-16:0-2-cyclo-17:0 and 1-16:0-2-18:1. Positional isomers were not present. The 1,2-di-16:0 compound was present at a significant level (7-10 mol%). Proportions of molecular species varied between phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. Phospholipid from the outer membrane of E. coli K12 contained a lower level of molecules with two unsaturated chains than was present in the cytoplasmic membrane. The method is sensitive, has good resolving power and employs readily available equipment.
TI  - Antibacterial substance from Carica papaya fruit extract.
AB  - Ripe and unripe Carica papaya fruits (epicarp, endocarp, seeds and leaves) were extracted separately and purified. All the extracts except that of leaves produced very significant antibacterial activity on Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Shigella flexneri. The MIC of the substance was small (0.2-0.3 mg/ml) for gram-positive bacteria and large (1.5-4 mg/ml) for gram-negative bacteria. The substance was bactericidal and showed properties of a protein. Other proteins previously found in C. papaya did not show antibacterial activity.
TI  - Penem derivatives: beta-lactamase stability and affinity for penicillin-binding proteins in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Penem derivatives, a new group of beta-lactam antibiotics with potent activities  against a wide range of bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested for their stability against hydrolysis by beta-lactamases purified from clinical isolates of Morganella morganii. Proteus vulgaris, and Escherichia coli and by a penicillinase from Bacillus cereus. Penems having 6 alpha substituents, such as hydroxyethyl, hydroxymethyl, and ethyl groups, were very stable against hydrolysis by each of the enzymes. Penems having no 6 alpha substituents were easily hydrolyzed by P. vulgaris and E. coli enzymes, whereas they were rather stable against hydrolysis by M. morganii and B. cereus enzymes, a typical cephalosporinase and penicillinase, respectively. Affinity of the penems for E. coli penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) was also tested. beta-Lactamase-stable penems having a 6 alpha-hydroxyethyl group showed high affinity for PBP-4, -5, and -6 as well as for PBP-1A, -1Bs, and -2. However, the penems having no 6 alpha substituents showed a far lower affinity for PBP-4, -5, and -6 than that shown by the corresponding 6 alpha-hydroxyethyl penems. Among the penems tested, affinity for PBP-4, -5, and -6 was closely related to their beta-lactamase stability, as was the case among cephamycins and cephalosporins. Effects of the penems on the morphology of a strain of E. coli are also described.
TI  - Specific chemical modification of the readily nitrated tyrosine of the RTEM beta-lactamase and of bacillus cereus beta-lactamase I. The role of the tyrosine in beta-lactamase catalysis.
AB  - The function of the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine residue readily nitrated by tetranitromethane (tyrosine-105) in the RTEM plasmid-derived beta-lactamase (penicillinase; penicillin amido beta-lactam-hydrolase, EC 3.5.1.6) from E. coli and in Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase I has been investigated by chemical modification methods. In the case of B. cereus beta-lactamase I the nitrated tyrosine can be acetylated by acetic anhydride without effect on beta-lactamase activity The nitrated tyrosine of the E. coli enzyme can also be acetylated but in this case beta-lactamase activity is lost in a manner which directly correlates with extent of acetylation. However, deacetylation of the nitrotyrosine does not restore activity. The dilemma created by the latter result has been resolved by development of a new method of tyrosine hydroxyl modification at low pH. The nitrated enzyme is reduced by dithionite and then treated with either carbonyldiimidazole or N-(2.2.2-trifluoroethoxycarbonyl)imidazole, both of which convert 3-aminotyrosine into benzoxazolinonylalanine. That the final modification has been achieved is demonstrated both by classical chemical methods and by employment of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to detect the characteristic benzoxazolinone carbonyl absorption. Further, it is shown that no significant loss of beta-lactamase activity is associated with this modification. Hence in neither the B. cereus or the E. coli enzyme does the readily nitrated tyrosine residue have a direct chemical function at the beta-lactamase active site.
TI  - Mode of antibiotic action of 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehyde from Streptomyces viridans.
AB  - The free ligand, deferroviridomycin A, and its iron(II) complex, viridomycin A, were detected in culture supernatant fluids of Streptomyces viridans 1671 and were structurally characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehyde and tris(4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehydato-N3,O4)ferrate(II), respectively. We investigated the antibiotic activity of the above compounds and of the chemically synthesized bis copper(II), tris cobalt(III), and tris nickel(II) complexes against Escherichia coli NIHJ, Salmonella typhimurium LT-2Z, Staphylococcus aureus 209P, Streptococcus faecium 10541, and Bacillus cereus, T. The free ligand and its kinetically labile copper(II) and nickel(II) complexes displayed activity against all of the above organisms, whereas the kinetically inert iron(II) and cobalt(III) complexes displayed activity only against S. aureus and B. cereus. The antibiotic activity of the substitutionally labile metal complexes was attributed to dissociation of the free ligand. The mode of antibiotic action of the free ligand against E. coli appears to be interference with the structural and functional integrity of the cell membrane.
TI  - [Evaluation of the bactericidal activity of chiral alkylammonium salts derived from N-benzoyl-amino acids with Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus. II. -- Adsorption mechanism and interpretation (author's transl)].
AB  - By testing the antibacterial activity of new long-chained alkylammonium salts with organic asymmetric anions (N-benzoyl-amino-acids) we have been able to precise the kind of interaction that would take place between the microorganisms and the two groups of the surfactant molecule. Evidence for anion participation to the bactericidal activity appeared through kind and configuration of the amino acid. A mechanism is proposed, that takes into account, hydrophobic and ionic interactions with cation and anion participation.
TI  - [Evaluation of the bactericidal activity of chiral alkylammonium salts derived from N-benzoyl-amino acids with Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus. I. -- Evaluation of the antibacterial activity (author's transl)].
AB  - Long-chained alkylammonium salts (C12 and C16) obtained from chiral N-benzoyl-amino acids were tested against Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus, to evaluate their antibacterial efficacy. The bactericidal activity (MBC) determined by the membrane filtration technique and the bacteriostatic activity values suggested anionic group participation. The participation of the anion moiety, depended on nature and configuration of the amino acid. Stereoselective interactions appeared between bacteria and the cationic surfactants tested.
TI  - Salt extends the upper temperature limit for growth of food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  - Inclusion of NaCl into the growth medium raised the upper temperature limit of growth of the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Salmonella senftenberg, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sporogenes, C. perfringens (two strains). The magnitude of the response varied with the culture, the largest being 3.5 degrees with B. cereus cells. The spores of B. cereus were not protected by salt but clostridial spores behaved as the vegetative cells (response of 2.5 degrees). The optimal salt concentration for the protective effect varied with the organism ranging from 0.2 M for the Gram-negative organisms to 1.0 M for S. aureus.
TI  - Specificity of translation of spore polypeptides in bacillus in vitro systems.
AB  - Cell free extracts prepared from exponentially growing Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus as well as from Bacillus cereus at the end of exponential growth were optimized for various factors required for amino acid incorporation when programmed with Bacillus ribonucleic acid. All three preparations synthesized glutamine synthetase antigen when ribonucleic acid from a Bacillus subtilis strain that overproduces glutamine synthetase was added. The post exponential Bacillus cereus extract, however, was most active for the synthesis of Bacillus cereus sport coat antigen when supplemented with the appropriate ribonucleic acid. There appears to be some specificity in the translation of at least this sporulation messenger RNA.
TI  - Enzymatic reduction of mercurous and mercuric ions in Bacillus cereus.
AB  - A strain of Bacillus cereus, which can grow in nutrient broth containing 50 microM HgCl2, was isolated from soil. Mercurous or mercuric ion dependent oxidation of reduced NADPH was demonstrated in crude extracts of cells grown in nutrient broth containing 10 microM HgCl2. The properties of this mercuric reductase were similar to those of the enzymes from R factor bearing Escherichia coli in substrate specificity, heat stability, requirement of sulfhydryl compounds, sensitivity to some heavy metal ions, and molecular weight.
TI  - Bacterial food-poisoning versus coliforms-faecal streptococci and gamma radiation survival/dose.
AB  - All the species tested were sensitive to gamma radiation treatment, even at a dose as low as 0.001 Mrad. The spore-former Bacillus cereus (PCJ 213) proved to be more resistant than the rest of the tested species, while the Gram-negative organisms were more susceptible to irradiation treatment. The tolerance among those organisms is depicted by the descending order: Proteus vulgaris, irregular VI, Escherichia coli I, E. coli III, and Salmonella typhi-murium. Yet all the tested faecal streptococci species, with the exception of Streptococcus bovis, may be regarded as holding an intermediate position between the more resistant B. cereus (PCJ 213) and the more sensitive Gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Behavior of pathogenic bacteria in the oyster, Crassostrea commercialis, during depuration, re-laying, and storage.
AB  - Oysters (Crassostrea commercials) harvested from major cultivation areas within the state of New South Wales, Australia, were commonly contaminated with low levels of the food-poisoning organisms Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Salmonella was found in oysters on only one occasion. These bacteria were cleansed from oysters during oyster purification by re-laying in a non-polluted waterway. Oysters were laboratory contaminated to levels in excess 1,000 cells per g with either B. cereus, C. perfringens, V. parahaemolyticus, Salmonella typhimurium, or S. senftenberg. These species were cleansed from such oysters during purification in a laboratory depuration unit that used ultraviolet light for sterilizing the depuration water. Escherichia coli was also cleansed from oysters under the same re-laying or depuration conditions so that its measurement alone could be used to indicate the cleansing of the above pathogenic species. The levels of these bacteria were also measured during the storage of oysters under conditions that occur during marketing. While B. cereus counts remained relatively stable during storage, the Salmonella spp. gradually decreased in numbers and C. perfringens rapidly died off. V. parahaemolyticus counts increased slightly during the first 4 days of storage, after which decreases occurred.
TI  - [Clofoctol binding by the bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - Clofoctol is an antibacterial agent which is active only on Gram + bacteria. The  clofoctol binding on bacteria is fast and the number of molecules bound is about 10(6) to 1,5 10(7) molecules per bacteria. Bacteria sensitivity towards clofoctol is the result of their ability to bind with it. Gram negative and Gram + protoplasts of bacteria bind the clofoctol. Binding of clofoctol by B. subtilis is obtained with viable cells and also with thermal inactivated cells. Binding of clofoctol by the cells is reversible and we showed that the 14C clofoctol used for the experiments and the unlabelled clofoctol have the same behaviour. ions as K+, Mg++, Ca++, Mn++, and Fe++, pH variation between 2 to 9, and urea have no influence on the binding of clofoctol by the bacteria, but, sodium lauryl sulfate is an inhibitor of the binding. These results mean that clofoctol bounds are made by hydrophobic links.

TI  - Commercial milk products and indigenous weaning foods in a rural West African Environment: a bacteriological perspective.
AB  - Two commercially available baby milks, one 'biologically acidified', the other 'non-acidified', and a traditional weaning food, millet gruel, were prepared and stored under village conditions in West Africa. Increases in total colony count and in number of Bacillus cereus, Clostridium welchii, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were determined in these products when stored as commonly practised at ambient temperatures over a period of 8 h. Poor hygiene during preparation was indicated by readily detectable numbers of coliforms and E. coli in freshly prepared samples of each of the milks, though the cooked local gruel seemed less vulnerable in this respect. The rate of increase in the numbers of these organisms was lower in the acidified milk when prepared with unboiled water containing high numbers of coliforms and E. coli. Increases in total colony count and in numbers of Staph. aureus were also less marked in the acidified milk. When food was not eaten soon after preparation the problem of bacterial overgrowth was as great with the local gruel as with the considerably more nutritious reconstituted milks.
TI  - Conjugation of enzymes to immunoglobulins using dimaleimides.
AB  - A method is described for coupling enzymes to immunoglobulins using sulphydryl derivatives of the proteins and a dimaleimide which is relatively water-soluble. Parameters affecting the performance of the conjugates have been examined including level of sulphydryl incorporation, ratio of enzyme/immunoglobulin and nature of dimaleimide used. Peroxidase-immunoglobulin conjugates made by the dimaleimide method have been compared with those made by the periodate oxidation method and found to have a superior performance. Immunoglobulin has been linked to peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase, EC 1.11.1.7), glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger, (EC 1.1.3.4), penicillinase from Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase I (EC 3.5.2.6), and beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli (EC 3.2.1.23).
TI  - Phenylpropynal, a specific, irreversible, non-beta-lactam inhibitor of beta-lactamases.
AB  - Phenylpropynal is a specific, irreversible, non-beta-lactam inhibitor of typical  beta-lactamases. In the presence of millimolar concentrations of phenylpropynal, the beta-lactamase I of Bacillus cereus and the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli become completely inactivated; the beta-lactamase II of B. cereus is not affected. The E. coli beta-lactamase is considerably more sensitive to the reagent than the gram-positive enzymes. A variety of structural analogs of phenylpropynal are much less effective inhibitors. Bovine alpha-chymotrypsin, bovine carboxypeptidase A, and the D,D-carboxypeptidase/transpeptidase of Streptomyces R-61 were not inactivated by phenylpropynal. The inactivation of the E. coli beta-lactamase can be significantly retarded when the good substrate benzylpenicillin is also present. The development of a characteristic chromophore (lambda max 318 nm) during beta-lactamase inactivation suggests that covalent modification of the enxymes is involved; arginine and/or lysine modification is indicated.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a DNA-dependent ATPase from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - A DNA-dependent ATPase (molecular weight 71 000) free of nuclease activity has been purified from Bacillus cereus. The enzyme shows similar characteristics as the enzyme isolated from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Heat denatured DNA stimulates the rate of ATP hydrolysis to ADP and Pi to an extent about tenfold higher than the native DNA. Double stranded DNA without single stranded regions is not a suitable cofactor for the enzyme. The ATPase is inhibited by adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)-diphosphate, while another ATP analogue, adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-methylene)-diphosphate has no effect on ATPase activity. KM for ATP is 0.38 mM, the apparent KM for nucleotide equivalent DNA is 1.2 microM. Evidence of the unwinding function of the enzyme is presented.

TI  - The growth and form of bacterial colonies.
AB  - A simple method is described for measuring the profile of bacterial colonies. Profiles were determined for colonies of Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus albus of different ages. In spite of differences in cell morphology, the colony profiles had a common basic structure consisting of steeply rising leading edge connected by a ridge to an interior region where height also rose, though less steeply, to a flat or domed centre. The colony mass increased exponentially through part of the growth phase. It is suggested that net colony growth consists of a combination of leading edge growth, which is unrestricted and approaches the maximum specific growth rate of the organism, and diffusion-limited growth in the colony interior. Common elements of profiles from each species may be a consequence of such differences in growth rate.
TI  - Predicted secondary structures of four penicillin beta-lactamases and a comparison with two lysozymes.
AB  - We have predicted the secondary structures of four beta-lactamases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli R-TEM) by the statistical method of Chou & Fasman as well as by the information theory method of Garnier et al. The secondary structures of all four beta-lactamases are of the alpha/beta type (Levitt & Chothia's nomenclature), with helices at N- and C-termini. There are about eight short regions each of alpha-helical (30--50%) and beta-strand (10--20%) structure separated by about 20 reverse turns. The conformation of the Gram-positive and Gram-negative beta-lactamases are generally similar although a few differences are predicted between the S.aureus and E.coli structures. Surprisingly, the two bacilli structures differ significantly in three short regions. In all four enzymes the region near the catalytically-implicated tyrosine has similar secondary structure. The secondary structure of hen egg white lysozyme, a penicillin-binding enzyme, as well as T4 phage lysozyme, has similarities to the N-terminal half of the penicillin-destroying beta-lactamases.

TI  - Septicemia in children with cancer.
AB  - Because of the persistently high mortality from sepsis in cancer patients, a retrospective study was designed to identify the causative organisms and to determine the factors affecting the outcome of sepsis. A total of 84 episodes of septicemia in 61 children with cancer were studied. The more frequently isolated organisms were: Staphylococcus aureus (21.4%); Escherichia coli (18%); Klebsiella (7.1%); Pseudomonas (6%); and Bacteroides fragilis (6%). Other isolates included Proteus, Serratia, Acinetobacter, hemolytic Streptococcus, and Bacillus cereus. In 10.7% of septic episodes, mixed bacterial infections were documented. Twenty-four (28.6%) resulted in death; in 13 (54%) death occurred within 24 hours after admission. The fatality rate was high in cases associated with absolute polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts of less than 100/cu mm, in neoplastic relapse, and when infection with gram-negative, anaerobic and mixed bacterial flora occurred.
TI  - [Microfloral study of bull seminal fluid stored at low temperatures].
AB  - Hundred twenty three samples of bull semen fluid frozen at 196 degrees C including 83 plastic ampules, 20 granules and 20 plastic straws obtained from the containers of the insemination stations of 10 farms from the Sofia district were investigated. Two hundred twelve strains were isolated and identified as: Escherichia coli--25 strains, Hafnia--16 strains, Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Proteus mirabilis--9 strains of each. The remaining Gram-negative genera and species were more rarely encountered. Gram positive bacteria: Micrococcus--19 strains, Staphylococcus aureus--17 strains, Staph. epidermidis--15 strains, Bacillus cereus--15 strains, B. subtilis--12 strains. Other representatives of Gram-positive bacteria were also found but in lower percentages. Least bacteria were observed in semen fluid frozen in plastic straws and most--in plastic ampules which were mainly used until recently for cow insemination. It was established that the same bacteria isolated by other authors from fresh sperm were encountered in semen fluid stored at minus temperatures. The conclusion is made that semen fluid stored at low temperature is contaminated with bacteria. It is only natural that these bacteria are introduced in cow genitals by insemination.
TI  - Infant foods as a potential source of diarrhoeal illness in rural West Africa.
AB  - It is common practice in rural areas of The Gambia to prepare infant foods in quantities which are sufficient to meet the needs of the day rather than one meal. These are then stored at ambient temperatures for periods up to 12 hours for feeding to the child on demand. The total viable counts and levels of Bacillus cereus, Clostridium welchii, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were determined in 294 infant foods samples from nought to eight hours after preparation. The presence of Salmonella was determined in 10 g samples of food. In the first hour after preparation the proportion of foods dangerously contaminated was high during the rainsy season, significantly more so than during the dry season. Foods not consumed fresh were very often hazardous and almost always so after 8 hours. This problem may be a causal factor in weanling diarrhoea which also shows marked seasonal variation in prevalence.

TI  - Interaction of phenosafranine with nucleic acids and model polyphosphates. III. Heterogeneity in phenosafranine interactions with DNA base pairs.
AB  - Fluorescence and circular dichroism spectral measurements, thermal denaturation studies and binding competition experiments with netropsin and actinomycin D were carried out in systems containing phenosafranine bound to DNA's differing in base composition. The investigated properties exhibit a heterogeneity related to the content of A.T and G.C pairs in DNA and to the nature of phenosafranine binding modes. At low level of saturation of binding sites (r less than 0.1) phenosafranine does not show strong preference for any of the DNA base pairs in the overall binding. However, the strong monomer non-cooperative binding outside the helix (mode I1) occurs predominantly, even though not exclusively in G.C rich regions. The strong binding modes involving intercalated dye molecules (mode I2 and eventually mode II1) prevail in A.T rich regions. These binding modes become the principal types of strong phenosafranine interaction with DNA when the level of saturation of binding sites increases, i.e. at r greater than 0.1.20
TI  - Toxicity of zinc to fungi, bacteria, and coliphages: influence of chloride ions.
AB  - A 10 mM concentration of Zn2+ decreased the survival of Escherichia coli; enhanced the survival of Bacillus cereus; did not significantly affect the survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Norcardia corallina, and T1, T7, P1, and phi80 coliphages; completely inhibited mycelial growth of Rhizoctonia solani; and reduced mycelial growth of Fusarium solani, Cunninghamella echinulata, Aspergillus niger, and Trichoderma viride. The toxicity of zinc to the fungi, bacteria, and coliphages was unaffected, lessened, or increased by the addition of high concentrations of NaCl. The increased toxicity of zinc in the presence of high concentrations of NaCl was not a result of a synergistic interaction between Zn2+ and elevated osmotic pressures but of the formation of complex anionic ZnCl species that exerted greater toxicities than did cationic Zn2+. Conversely, the decrease in zinc toxicity with increasing concentrations of NaCl probably reflected the decrease in the levels of Zn2+ due to the formation of Zn-Cl species, which was less inhibitory to these microbes than was Zn2+. A. niger tolerated higher concentrations of zinc in the presence of NaCl at 37 than at 25 degrees C.
TI  - Effect of hydrostatic tensile stress on the growth of Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus.
AB  - The specific growth rates of Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus were measured for growth media in a flask, a lens-plate arrangement simulating an isolated capillary space, and a lens-plate arrangement under hydrostatic tensile stress. The specific growth rates of the bacteria were the same for the flask and lens-plate arrangement without hydrostatic tensile stress, but were enhanced when the growth media were subjected to hydrostatic tensile stress. The enhanced specific growth rates reached steady values at a tensile stress of 40 pascals. The effect was observed up to tensile stresses of around 100 pascals. The maximum increase in specific growth rate was 25% for E. coli and 22% for B. cereus.

TI  - The growth and respiration of bacterial colonies.
AB  - Young colonies of two swarming organisms, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus vulgaris, grew about as quickly on solid media as in liquid culture whilst four non-swarming organisms, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus albus, all grew slower on solid than in liquid media. Oxygen uptake by young colonies of B. subtilis, followed manometrically, increased exponentially at about the same rate as unrestricted aerobic growth. All other colonies demonstrated accelerating respiration which was either not strictly exponential or, in the case of S. albus, definitely biphasic, with a fast then a slow exponential rate of increase. Actual and potential respiration was determined for each species by measuring oxygen uptake before and after resuspending the colony in liquid medium. The ratio of actual to potential respiration was largest in the flat, spreading B. subtilis and smallest in the small, hemispherical S. albus. Calculations suggest that oxygen penetrates between 31 and 41 micron into colonies of B. cereus, Ent. cloacae and E. coli and only 9 micron into colonies of S. albus.
TI  - Hydrolytic action of phospholipases on bacterial membranes.
AB  - Substrate specificities of phospholipases C[EC 3.1.4.3] from Clostridium novyi, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, and Pseudomonas aureofaciens were studied under the same conditions. Phospholipases C from Clostridium novyi and Bacillus cereus show wide substrate specificities while those of Clostridium perfringens and Pseudomonas aureofaciens show relatively narrow specificities. On the basis of these results, the hydrolytic actions of these phospholipases on membrane lipids of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium novyi were examined under the same conditions. The enzymes of Clostridium novyi and Bacillus cereus attacked all the membranes and their lipid extracts, hydrolyzing phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine, and o-aminoacylphosphatidylglycerol. Phospholipase C from Pseudomonas aureofaciens attacked these three membranes and their lipid extracts, hydrolyzing phosphatidylethanolamine. Phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens hardly attacked the phospholipids of these bacterial membranes. However, phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens hydrolyzed phosphatidylethanolamine in a mixture containing lipid extract from Escherichia coli membrane and purified phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk.

AB  - One hundred and thiry-three vanilla slices, purchased from shops in the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County, were examined to determine the numbers and types of bacteria present at the time of purchase. The surface colony count at 37 degrees C was greater than 10(3)/g in 67/133 (50%) of the samples examined, Bacillus cereus being found at that concentration in 21.8%, coliform bacilli including E. coli in 5.3%, Staphylococcus aureus in 3-0% and Streptococcus faecalis in 0-8%. Thirty-four strains of B. cereus were serotyped and 11 (32%) of these were typable with the sera available. Preparation of custard mixed in the laboratory suggests that the milk or milk powder used in the mix may be the major source of B. cereus in the final product. Many of the present methods of manufacture, distribution and storage allow organisms present in the custard at manufacture the opportunity to multiply and possibly reach numbers which present a risk of food poisoning.
TI  - Microbial production of vitamin B12 antimetabolites. III Compound 102804 from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - A basic compound with empirical formula C12H16N2O5 was isolated from Bacillus cereus 102804 fermentations of a soybean meal-glucose medium. The inhibitory activity of compound 102804 on growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria growing in a chemically defined medium was reversed by vitamin B12, by L-methionine, and by D-methionine. It has no inhibitory activity for Escherichia coli (Davis 113-3) when grown in media containing L-methionine. The biosynthesis of 102804 coincides with the sporulation of the B. cereus, and the compound is not produced in the absence of sporulation.
TI  - Enzymic assays for isomers of 2,6-diaminopimelic acid in walls of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus megaterium.
AB  - An enzymic assay for individual isomers (meso-, LL- and DD-) of 2,6-diaminopimelate was developed. The enzyme 2,6-diaminopimelate decarboxylase specifically attacked meso-diaminopimelate and was used to measure this isomer manometrically. The meso- and LL-isomers were measured together manometrically in a coupled assay with diaminopimelate decarboxylase and diaminopimelate epimerase (which converts LL-diaminopimelate into meso-diaminopimelate). The DD-isomer was not attacked by either enzyme and was measured, as residual diaminopimelate after the coupled assay, by a colorimetric method, which was also used to measure total diaminopimelate before enzymic treatments. The coupled enzymes were also used to prepare pure DD-isomer from chemically synthesized diaminopimelate. A mixture of diaminopimelate isomers was present in walls of four strains of Bacillus megaterium [in each about 75% (w/w) meso-, 18% LL- and 7% DD-] and in walls of two strains of Bacillus cereus (about 85% meso-, 8% LL- and 7% DD-). One strain of B. cereus contained at least 95% meso-diaminopimelate, with only traces of LL- and DD-isomers. Peptidoglycan from Escherichia coli was assayed as containing at least 95% meso-isomer. The proportion of isomers in the wall of a strain of B. megaterium remained constant after growth in a variety of different media.

AB  - The resistence of different microorganisms to formaldehyde was determined. As test objects served gram-negative and gram-positive vegetative germs (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella paratyphi-B, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis), bacterial spores (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis), fungi (Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans), bacteriophages (Escherichia coli phages, T1, T2, T3), and viruses (adenovirus, poliomyelitis virus, vaccinia virus). For the studies, suspensions of germs were exposed at identical temperature (20 degrees C) and pH (7.0). The microbicidal effect of formaldehyde was measured by the decrease of the proportion of germs capable of multiplication in the suspension (lg (N/N0); where: N0 equals initial number of germs capable of multiplication; N equals number of germs capable of multiplication after exposure to formaldehyde). For all germs the dependence of the microbicidal effect on the concentration of formaldehyde was determined. In all experiments, the duration of exposure was two hours. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella paratyphi-B were found to be more susceptible than Staphylococcus aureus (vf. Fig. 1 A). The strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa used were widely varying as to their susceptibility. To obtain equal microbicidal effects, concentrations of formaldehyde almost three times as high had to be used for the most resistant strain than were necessary for the most susceptible strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae examined were found to have an identical resistence to formaldehyde. Streptococcus faecalis was even more resistant to formaldehyde than Staphylococcus aureus. In the case of Streptococcus faecalis, a concentration of formaldehyde about three times as high had to be used to obtain microbicidal effects of identical magnitude. For the killing of Candida albicans cells concentrations of formaldehyde not higher than those needed for the killing of vegetative gram-negative bacteria were necessary. The conidia of Aspergillus niger were found to be more resistant than the cells of Candida albicans but did not require any higher concentrations than for the killing of Staphylococcus aureus (see Fig. 1 B). In the case of bacterial spores, a special phenomenon was observed. If the spores had been exposed to a temperature of 80 and 95 degrees C, respectively (depending on the species involved) for one or two hours following exposure to formaldehyde, a considerably higher number of spores was found to be capable of germination and colony formation than without such treatment (heat activation: cf. Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B). The spores of Bacillus cereus had only a relatively low resistance to formaldehyde. To reduce the proportion of the spores capable of colony formation to 1/10000, a 2.9% formaldehyde concentration was necessary without heat activation and one of 10.8% with heat activation...
TI  - [The effects of weak magnetic fields on bacteria].
AB  - A stationary device was constructed for conducting experiments in a weak magnetic field. A ferromagnetic screen was used to produce in the working volume a magnetic-field of 26 nT. The effect of a weak magnetic field on the following bacteria was studied: E. coli communior, B. prodigiosum, Staphylococcus aureus 209, and Bac. anthracoides. Cultivation of the bacteria in these conditions for a long time resulted in changes of their tinctorial, morphological, cultural, and biochemical properties.
TI  - Evidence for two immune inhibitors from Bacillus thuringiensis interfering with the humoral defense system of saturniid pupae.
AB  - Mutants of Bacillus thuringiensis lacking either beta-exotoxin or gamma-endotoxin were compared for their virulence using pupae of a giant silk moth. Known doses of viable log-phase bacteria were injected, and the response was followed as the number of viable bacteria in the hemolymph. The results obtained imply that, in the system used, neither the beta-exotoxin nor the gamma-endotoxin and the sporeforming ability are of importance for virulence. Results with sterile culture filtrate from B. thuringiensis have given evidence for the production of two inhibitors, A and B, which interfere with the humoral defense system in pupae of Hyalophora cecropia. Inhibitor A, which blocked the lysis of Escherichia coli,was precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and sensitive to heating. Inhibitor B, which blocked the killing of Bacillus cereus, was soluble in trichloroacetic acid and resistant to 90 degrees C for 5 min. Both inhibitors are believed to contribute to the insecticidal nature of B. thuringiensis.
TI  - Growth of Physarum gyrosum on agar plates and in liquid culture.
AB  - The physical and nutritional requirements of the antibiotic-producing slime mold  Physarum gyrosum were examined to develop a liquid medium for this myxomycete. Liquid culture is desired to expedite a useful scale of production of antibiotic materials for ease of isolation and structure study. Culture conditions were selected to favor antibiotic production rather than maximum growth. The medium devised consisted of 0.010 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 2% bakers' yeast, and 0.2% glucose and was supplemented with either 10(-7) M hemoglobin (preferred) or 2.0 ml of live Escherichia coli per 100 ml of culture medium grown to a steady-state population in nutrient broth. The slime mold, which contained some E. coli carried along with the inoculum, was allowed to grow as a surface plasmodium at 20 degrees C in the dark with weekly subculturing for stocks or for 10 days for antibiotic production. P. gyrosum produced the same antibiotic materials when grown in liquid medium as it did when grown on agar plates. A seeded plate disk assay against Bacillus cereus was employed to follow antibiotic activity.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of foodborne diseases.
AB  - Many bacterial species are responsible for sporadic cases and outbreaks of foodborne intoxication and infection. The foodborne diseases are classified on the basis of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved into four categories: performed toxin, enterotoxin formed in the colonized small intestine, mucosal invasion (enterocolitis) and mucosal invasion with bacteremia. Invasive and toxigenic strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli are discussed. In vivo test systems for the identification of enterotoxigenic organisms and tissue culture assays for the heat-labile enterotoxin of E. coli are described. Current laboratory methods for the diagnosis of foodborne diseases of major public health interest are reviewed - botulism, staphylococcal intoxication, Clostridium perfringens enteritis, salmonellosis, enteropathogenic E. coli infection, Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection and Bacillus cereus enteritis. The role of the laboratory in the epidemiologic surveillance and investigation of foodborne diseases is emphasized.

TI  - Effect of delayed evisceration on the microbial quality of meat.
AB  - The postomortem invasion of muscle and other tissues by bacteria from the intestinal tract was studied with the use of radioactive tracers. The injection of 14C-labeled bacteria or spores into the intestines of guinea pig carcasses within 24 h of death resulted in the rapid spread of 14C throughout carcasses. When live bacteria were injected along with the labeled cells, it was not possible to isolate viable organisms from the body tissues if the living animal had been exposed to the bacteria. It appears that animals are immune to their normal intestinal flora and that this immunity persists after death; thus passage of these bacteria into the lymphatic system does not necessarily result in the presence of live bacteria in carcass tissues. It therefore seems that a delay of up to 24 h before evisceration would not lead to deep tissue contamination of the carcass by organisms usually present in the intestines. Further evidence for this hypothesis was obtained by showing that muscle and lymph nodes from uneviscerated lamb carcasses hung for 24 h at 20 C remained sterile.
TI  - [Characterization by zymograms of R factor-determined beta-lactamases: plasmids of defined and undefined compatibility groups (author's transl)].
AB  - An easy biochemical method is described, discriminating the beta-lacta-mases coded by various R factors. Electrophoretic mobility and substrate affinity of beta-lactamases were studied simultaneously for 7 different penicillins and cephalosporins. They are I like R factors assigned into different compatibility groups (N, P, com6, com7, com8, X and com 9), five R factors isolated from piglets faeces and one R factor, RU1, originated from Enterobacter aerogenes. Three electrophoretic types of beta-lactamases were determinated: 1) beta-lactamase which migrates towards the anode (enzyme coded by Bacillus cereus chromosome); 2) beta-lactamase of weak cathodic mobility (e. g. R6K); 3) beta-lactamase which migrates rapidly towards the cathode (e. g. R46, R71). Escherichia coli K12 strains synthesize a penicillinase of this third type, destroying penicillin G. The enzymatic and physicochemical properties are not modified by host bacteria, suggesting the possibility to study the plasmid in wild bacteria.
TI  - [Possible relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune-adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis (author's transl)].
AB  - In the present study we attempted to determine the relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis. As shown in table 1 encapsulated bacteria (Klebsiella ozanae, K. pneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus pneumoniae), Mycoplasma pneumoniae and M. fermentans had a much lower immune adherence-activity than non-encapsulated bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Brucella abortus, Erysipelothrix insidiosa, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, S. typhi). Consequently, the former bacteria, in the absece of specific antibodies, activated complement via the C-3-bypass to a smaller extent than the latter. In modified Boyden chambers the encapsulated bacteria and the mycoplasmas were much less cytotaxigenic than the non-encapsulated bacteria (table 3). Corresponding to this was the chemotactic response in vivo. Finally the rates of phagocytosis were considerably lower with the encapsulated bacteria than with the non-encapsulated ones (fig. 1).
TI  - Morphological changes in Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus caused by external  histone.
AB  - It was found that the externally added histone changes remarkably both the surface and the internal ultrastructure of cells of Escherichia coli. The interaction of histone with surface structures results in thickening of the inner layer of the cell wall. Cytoplasm becomes condensed, contains extensive electrontransport zones and neither ribosomes nor the nuclear structure are differentiated. The addition of histone to germinating spores of Bacillus cereus decelerates germination and postgerminative development of this organism and changes ultrastructure of the external surface of the exosporium. The addition of Mg2+ ions reverting the effect of histone results in a renewal of the original ultrastructure of the exosporium.
TI  - Biological activity of hydroxyanthraquinones and their glucosides toward microorganisms.
AB  - Five mono- and dihydroxyanthraquinones as well as 12 of their glucosides (both free and acetylated) were tested with six different microbial species using the plate-diffusion method. None of the tested substances was active against Escherichia coli, 15 of the 17 substances displayed an activity toward Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Streptomyces aureofaciens. Relationships between the substance type and biological activity are discussed.
TI  - Dense growth of aerobic bacteria in a bench-scale fermentor.
AB  - Escherichia coli B, Escherichia coli MRE 600, Escherichia coli K 12-3300, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Aerobacter aerogenes were grown exponentially in a bench-scale fermentor to cell concentrations in the range of 20 to 41 g dry cells/liter at 30 degrees C and 30 to 55 g dry cells/liter at 25 degrees C. The high cell concentrations were achieved in a growth system previously described for growth of Escherichia coli W (Biotechnol. Bioeng., 16, 933 (1974); ibid. 17, 227 (1975)). Various enzyme activity levels in the high-concentration cells were compared to those in cells grown in conventional low-density cultures. No significant differences were found. The culture supernatants were found to be essentially free of high-molecular weight metabolic or cell lysis products. Yield constants for glucose, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus were also determined in the dense cultures and some of their relations to the growth conditions are discussed.

In cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonase aeruginosa, this cardiolipin-hydrolyzing enzyme had similar pH and Mg2+ requirements and displayed a specificity which excluded phosphatidyl glycerol and phosphatidyl ethanolamine as substrates.

TI  - Comparison of methods for extraction of bacterial adenine nucleotides determined  by firefly assay.
AB  - Adenine nucleotides in Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,  Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were extracted using 10 different methods. Extracts were assayed for adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) by the firefly method using an improved procedure. Analytical interference by bacterial enzymes not inactivated during the extraction was found to be a major problem. However, these enzymes were inactivated to a considerable extent by the inclusion of ethylenediaminetetraacetate in the extraction reagent. The 10 extraction methods were compared with respect to yield of adenine nucleotides, interference with the enzymic assay, reproducibility of the method, and stability of the extracts. Results indicated that extraction with trichloroacetic acid was the method most closely reflecting actual levels of ATP, ADP and AMP in intact bacterial cells. However, for the extraction of ATP in some bacterial strains several other methods may be used and may be advantageous from a practical point of view.
TI  - Thin-layer chromatographic technique for rapid detection of bacterial phospholipases.
AB  - Silica gel thin-layer chromatography was employed to detect lecithinase activity  induced from bacterial resting cell preparations induced from bacterial resting cell preparations incubated at 37 C for 4 h in the presence of purified egg yolk lecithin. Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa hydrolyzed lecithin with the formation of free fatty acids as the sole lipid-soluble product. In none of the Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii strains tested could lecithinase activity be detected. Four among eight strains of Enterobacter aerogenes and one among 12 strains of Proteus tested produced negligible amounts of free fatty acid.
TI  - Studies on a thermophilic RNA polymerase which is active only on poly d(A-T) and  poly dAdT.
AB  - Two types of RNA polymerases [EC 2.7.7.6], polymerases A and B, exist in thermophilic bacteria, Thermus thermophilus HB8. Polymerase B is apparently like the core enzyme of polymerase A but is active only when an alternating copolymer of deoxyadenylic and deoxythymidylic acids (poly d(A-T)) or a mixture of homopolymers of deoxyadenylic acid and deoxythymidylic acid (poly dAdT) is used as a template. Polymerase B was further characterized to elucidate its relation to polymerase A and to determine why it is inactive on natural DNA's. 1. Polymerase B did not show pyrophosphate exchange activity. Dinucleoside monophosphates did not activate the RNA-synthesizing activity. The results suggested that polymerase B had no initiation and presumably no elongation activities. 2. Polymerase B had about 6 times greater affinity to DNA than polymerase A. The binding of polymerase B to DNA was, however, reversible. The complex of DNA with polymerase A was stable and the polymerase was not removed from the initial complex even when a large amount of DNA was added. 3. E. coli sigma subunit could not stimulate the activity of polymerase B toward DNA's. 4. Polymerase B could utilize poly d(A-T) and poly dAdT as templates, but could not use Bacillus cereus DNA though the structure is reported to be similar to that of poly d(A-T).

TI  - Reactivation of the lipid-depleted pyruvate oxidase system from Escherichia coli  with cell envelope neutral lipids.
AB  - The pyruvate oxidase system of Escherichia coli is composed of a soluble flavoprotein, pyruvate oxidase (EC 1.2.2.2, pyruvate:ferricytochrome b1 oxidoreductase), and an electron transport system associated with the cell envelope-membrane fraction. The membrane particles contain 15% lipid by weight. Fractionation of the lipids revealed that abut one-third are neutral lipids and two-thirds are phospholipids. The relative ratio of ubiquinone to menaquinone within the neutral lipid fraction is 15:1 on a molar basis. Removal of the lipids from the membrane particles by extraction with aqueous acetone or hydrolysis of the phospholipids by treatment with Bacillus cereus phospholipase C results in a complete loss of electron transport activity. Analysis of the particles extracted with aqueous acetone revealed that practically all the neutral lipids and 65% of the phospholipids are removed by this treatment. Phospholipase treatment results in a loss of 75% of the membrane phospholipid phosphorus; however, the diglycerides and the neutral lipids produced by phospholipase hydrolysis remain associated with the particles. Addition of neutral lipid and a detergent, hepta-DL-alanyl dodecylamide to the acetone-extracted material results in a restoration of 37% of the original particle activity. Addition of neutral lipid and hepta-DL-alanyl dodecylamide to phospholipase-treated particles completely restores the original electron transport activity. Furthermore, addition of ubiquinone from either yeast (UQ6) or E. coli (UQ8) will restore pyruvate oxidase activity when the quinones are supplemented with photoinactivated neutral lipid. No restoration of activity to phospholipase-treated particles is noted upon the addition of either menaquinone 6 or menaquinone 8 to the reconstitution system. In fact, these compounds appear to suppress restoration of activity when they are added to reaction mixtures containing neutral lipid and phospholipase-treated particles.

TI  - Microflora of maize prepared as tortillas.
AB  - Very little is known of the microflora in tortillas, the major component in the diet of many Guatemalans and other Central Americans. Based in a Guatemalan highland Indian village, this study examined the types and amounts of bacteria, yeasts, and molds in tortillas and in their maize precursors. Coliforms, Bacillus cereus, two species of Staphylococcus, and many types of yeast were the main contaminants, but low concentrations of alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, facultative Clostridium, and other bacterial types were also found. When tortillas were first cooked, the bacterial counts dropped to 1,000 or fewer organisms per g, a safe level for consumption. Under village conditions, bacterial counts regained precooking levels (about 10(8) organisms/g) within 24 h and rose even higher after 48 h. Reheating caused very little change; hence, bacterial levels remained very high in old tortillas kept for later consumption. A search for the sources of contamination showed that most came from water used in preparation and from the soiled hands of women preparing the tortillas. As an attempt to correct certain nutritional needs of the population, the Institute of Nutrition for Central America and Panama initiated a tortilla fortification project in the Guatemalan village. The bacterial counts in fortified tortillas did not differ significantly from those in oridinary tortillas. Furthermore, the level of contamination was constant among tortillas of different sizes and among tortillas made from different types of maize.
TI  - Effects of cadmium on the growth and uptake of cadmium by microorganisms.
AB  - Six species of microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Actinomyces niger, were grown under suitable conditions in appropriate media. Cadmium chloride was added to provide 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mug of Cd per ml. At 40 and 80 mug of Cd per ml, E. coli and B. cereus grew well and the other species were repressed. Cd uptake patterns differed significantly among the species tested. The significance of these data with respect to Cd in food chains is discussed.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial biotin-proteins.
AB  - The biotin-protein populations in several bacterial strains were analyzed by solubilization of [3H]biotin-labeled cells with sodium dodecylsulfate followed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing the detergent. A variety of patterns of biotin-labeled polypeptide chains was seen, ranging from a single biotin-protein in Escherichia coli, corresponding to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein component of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, to multiple species in Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas citronellolis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium shermanii, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Mycobacterium phlei, which probably represent subunits of multiple biotin-dependent enzymes present in these organisms. In the case of Pseudomonas citronellolis two major biotin-containing polypeptides with approximate molecular weights of 65 000 and 25 000 were shown to correspond to the biotin carboxyl carrier components of pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, respectively. Thus in the case of Pseudomonas citronellolis two different biotin-dependent enzymes in the same cell do not share common biotin carboxyl carrier subunits.
TI  - The parenteral application of a new metacycline preparation, tri-metacycline.
AB  - Tri-metacycline, one of the new tetracycline complexes (tritetracyclines), is prepared by mere dissolution of metacycline hydrochloride in an aqueous solution of the complexing agent. In vitro and in vivo studies show a high antibiotic activity. Significantly lower MIC values were found for tri-metacycline than for the parent compound. Parenteral administration resulted in high sera and tissue values, without signs of accumulation; excretion via the kidneys was proved.
TI  - Determination of bacterial cell concentrations by electrical measurements.
AB  - An instrument was developed to measure the concentration of bacterial suspensions by their electrical characteristics. It employed a square-wave signal generator, a tetra-polar electrode probe, and a voltage detector in the form of an oscilloscope. When electrical measurements were made on washed bacteria obtained from cultures or urine specimens, there was a direct relationship between the concentration of the cells and the electrical characteristics of the system as reflected by voltage changes. As little as 10(3) organisms per ml could be detected. The resolution between readings taken on samples containing 10(3) to 10(9) cells per ml was found to be a function of the input frequency. The maximal resolution between concentration readings was obtained at a input frequency of 10 Hz. Thus, with relatively simple instrumentation, bacterial concentrations could be determined within a few minutes. This technique, therefore, eliminates the more lengthy laboratory procedures as plate counts or the accumulation of measurable metabolic changes (such as the utilization of radioactive or other substrates). This method can efficiently monitor clinical urine specimens when a bacteriuria is suspected.
TI  - Antimetabolites produced by microorganisms. XII (S)-alanyl-3-[alpha-(S)-chloro-3-(S)-hydroxy 2-oxo-3-azetidinylmethyl]-(S)-alanine, a new beta-lactam containing natural product.
AB  - (S)-Alanyl-3-[alpha-(S)-chloro-3-(S)-hydroxy-2-oxo-3-azetidinylmethyl]-(S)-alanin e was isolated from a fermentation broth of an unidentified Streptomyces species 372 A. The structure was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The substance inhibits the growth of several strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in a chemically defined medium but growth inhibition is relieved by addition of L-glutamine to the medium.
TI  - Photobiological behaviour of bacteria and phages supplemented with aza-analogoues of nucleic acid bases.

V. light of the wavelength 254 nm differs from the U. V. stability of the normal constituents. Changes of the U.V. inactivation of Escherichia coli K12 C600, E. coli B, Bacillus cereus, as well as E. coli phages gamma cb2 and gamma b2b5 supplemented with azaderivatives prior to irradiation were investigated. It was found that I, II, III, IV, and VII are more, V and VI less sensitive to U. V. light compared with corresponding natural nucleic acid bases. Their changed U. V. sensitivities are reflected in the survival curves after U. V. -irradiation in as far as azabases are incorporated into the nucleic acids in vivo. This explains the increase in U.V. sensitivity of E. coli K12 C600, E. coli B, and B. cereus supplemented with I, II, III, IV, and VII and the decrease in U.V. sensitivity of Streptococcus faecalis supplemented with V (the latter information was taken from Gunther and Prusoff 1967). The lack of any significant influence on inactivation curves of E. coli K12 C600 by V and VI, and on E. coli phages gamma cb2 and gamma c2b5 by II, is discussed in terms of too small incorporation rates. No discrimination was put forward with respect to DNA and RNA incorporation.

AB  - THE MINIMAL LETHAL CONCENTRATION OF OZONE IN WATER WAS DETERMINED FOR THREE BACTERIAL SPECIES: Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus megaterium. A contact period of 5 min was selected. The lethal threshold concentration for the cells of B. cereus was 0.12 mg/liter while that for E. coli and B. megaterium was 0.19 mg/liter. Low concentrations of ozone were ineffective when organic matter was present to interfere with the action of ozone on the bacterial cells. Also determined during the study was the sensitivity of spores of B. cereus and B. megaterium to ozone in water. The threshold concentration required to kill the spores of both species was 2.29 mg/liter. The cells and spores of these organisms exhibited the "all-or-none" die-away phenomenon normally associated with ozone treatment.
TI  - Isolation and purification of antibiotic material from Physarum gyrosum.
AB  - The myxomycete Physarum gyrosum was cultured in its plasmodial stage on agar plates containing 0.025 M phosphate buffer at pH 6.5, 2% bakers' yeast, and 0.2% glucose and was supplemented with live Escherichia coli. Extracts of these plasmodia contained several antibiotic substances. Antibiotic materials were partially purified by dialysis of the agar medium-mold mixture, evaporation of the dialyzate, and butanol extraction of the residue. Further purification in two paper and two thin-layer chromatographic systems gave one product which was pure in six thin-layer chromatographic systems. Antibiotic activity against some gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeasts was demonstrated with partially purified extracts and a paper-chromatographically separated fraction. One pure antibiotic was effective against Bacillus cereus.

TI  - Variation of type-B DNA x-ray fiber diagrams with base composition.
AB  - Eight natural DNAs of widely differing base composition have been studied by x-ray diffraction in fibers at high relative humidity. The resulting type B diffraction diagrams showed that all of the DNAs had a 34-A pitch and 3.4-A interbase pair separation. However, the intensity distribution on the inner three layer lines was a strong function of the base content. In diffraction diagrams of very AT-rich DNA, the intensity of the first and third layer line was 2- or 3-times stronger than in the patterns of GC-rich DNA. These high humidity diffraction patterns agree with x-ray scattering from solutions of DNA. The results are interpreted to imply that each AT base pair may have a different cross section than a GC pair. If this is so, it would appreciably alter the currently held ideas concerning DNA recognition.

In water, they were soluble at concentrations of 34 and 53 mug/ml, respectively. The minimal inhibitory concentrations against gram-positive bacteria and yeast were below 100 mug/ml. The compounds were not effective against gram-negative bacteria at 200 mug/ml or lower concentrations. With initial populations of cells greater than 10(6)/ml, the concentrations of these compounds required to prevent growth were greater than with lower cell populations. Changing the pH of the growth medium did not decrease the effectiveness of these two compounds in the pH range of 3 through 8. Both obtusastyrene and dihydro-obtusastyrene were rapidly bactericidal to Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus at 25 mug/ml.

TI  - Occurrence of lysophosphatides in bacteriophage T4rII-infected Escherichia coli S-6.
AB  - Hydrolysis of phospholipids was observed to start about 15 min after Escherichia  coli S/6 cells were infected with T4rII bacteriophage mutants. Hydrolysis continued through the latent period and well past the time when cell lysis occurs. The hydrolytic products that accumulated were free fatty acids, 2-acyl lysophosphatidylethanolamine, and various lysocardiolipins. These products indicated the action of phospholipase A(1). From 15 to 22 min after infection, there were equivalent amounts of fatty acids and lysophosphatides in extracts of cellular lipids. Thereafter, free fatty acids were produced in excess. This suggests that lysophospholipase was active at the later time. We also observed a stoichiometric relation between loss of phosphatidylglycerol and increase of cardiolipin plus lysocardiolipins. This continued well past the normal lysis time (25 min). The appearance of lipase activities during the latent period seems to be specific to infection with rII mutants. Neither the wild-type bacteriophage nor rI mutants produced similar activities by 22 min after infection.
TI  - Microstructure of colonies of rod-shaped bacteria.
AB  - Whole colonies of Bacillus cereus, B. megaterium, B. mycoides CN2495, Corynebacterium hofmanni NCTC1938, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCIB1899, Nocardia graminis NCTC4728, Pseudomonas viscosa, and Serratia marcescens were prepared for scanning electron microscopic examination by freeze-drying and metal-coating. The arrangement of individual cells within colonies could be seen. Cells of Bacillus colonies tended to be longer than in liquid culture and irregular in shape and to give the appearance of branching. B. megaterium colonies frequently had a dense covering film. Colonies of gram-negative bacteria consisted of fairly short rods covered by much adherent extracellular material. L. acidophilus had colonies comprised of densely packed, well-oriented rods. C. hofmanni colonies contained coccobacilli, packed together. Correlations were observed between plano-convex colony form and densely packed cells, rough colony form and random arrangement of well-separated microorganisms, and irregular colony edge and tendency of cells to grow out from the colony in filaments.
TI  - In vivo and in vitro action of new antibiotics interfering with the utilization of N-acetyl-glucosamine-N-acetyl-muramyl-pentapeptide.
AB  - Recent literature on the antibiotics enduracidin, moenomycin, prasinomycin, and 11.837 RP suggested an interaction with murein synthesis. Incubation of sensitive strains from Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus in a "wall medium" containing labeled l-alanine showed that all four antibiotics inhibited the incorporation of alanine into murein and gave rise to accumulation of radioactive uridine diphosphate-N-acetyl-muramyl (UDP-MurNAc)-pentapeptide. Peptidoglycan was synthesized when the particulate enzyme of B. stearothermophilus was incubated with the murein precursors UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. The newly formed polymer was less accessible for lysozyme and more strongly bound to the acceptor than the same product from the Escherichia coli particulate enzyme. After incubation in the presence of penicillin, a greater part of the peptidoglycan was lysozyme sensitive and more loosely bound to the acceptor. The antibiotics enduracidin, moenomycin, prasinomycin, and 11.837 RP inhibited peptidoglycan synthesis by the B. stearothermophilus particulate enzyme. The rate of synthesis of GlcNAc-MurNAc(-pentapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid was independent from the addition of these antibiotics, but its utilization was strongly inhibited. With the present results, it is not possible to distinguish the mechanisms of action of enduracidin, moenomycin, prasinomycin, and 11.837 RP from the mechanisms of action of vancomycin and ristocetin.

TI  - Evidence for a magnesium pump in Bacillus cereus T.
AB  - Unlike Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus T appears to accumulate Mg(2+) in its cell sap against a concentration gradient. Over a range of Mg(2+) in the growth medium from 5 x 10(-5) to 1.35 x 10(-2)m, the concentration of Mg(2+) in the cell sap of B. cereus T was maintained at about 6 x 10(-3)m, and ribosome-bound Mg(2+) and spermidine, as well as the spermidine concentration in the cell sap, appear to be unaffected by the concentration of Mg(2+) in the growth medium. Inhibition of growth of E. coli by streptomycin is progressively reversed by increasing the concentration of Mg(2+) in the growth medium above 5 mm. The finding that similar increases of Mg(2+) in the growth medium did not reverse the inhibition of B. cereus T is also consistent with the conclusion that B. cereus T, unlike E. coli, accumulates Mg(2+) to a constant concentration in its cell sap.

AB  - A chamber was constructed to create simulated Martian dust storms and thereby study the survival of airborne micro-organisms while exposed to the rigors of the Martian environment, including ultraviolet irradiation. Representative types of sporeforming and non-sporeforming bacteria present in spacecraft assembly areas and indigenous to humans were studied. It was found that daily ultraviolet irradiation of 2 to 9 X 10(7) erg cm-2 was not sufficient to sterilize the dust clouds. The soil particles protected the organisms from ultraviolet irradiation since the numbers of survivors from irradiated environments were similar to those from unirradiated environments. Pending further data of the Martian environment, the contamination and dissemination of Mars with terrestrial micro-organisms is still a distinct possibility.

TI  - Differential light scattering: a physical method for identifying living bacterial cells.
AB  - Differential light scattering techniques appear to represent an attractive physical method for the rapid identification of various microorganisms. Certain general results of inverse scattering theory suggest strongly that characteristic of each distinct microorganism that scatters light is an essentially unique scattering pattern, i.e., unique differential scattered intensity and polarization. Although a mathematically rigorous inversion procedure seems impractical at this time, the use of detailed differential scattered intensity data as an identification fingerprint shows considerable. promise. Published measurements on nonbiological scatterers confirm this possibility. A variety of calculations are presented that contrast the expected scattering characteristics of certain microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, B. anthracis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and the spores of B. mcgaterium and B. cereus. Experimental and instrumentation difficulties and possible procedures are discussed. A review and laboration of some applicable features of Rayleigh-Gans scattering are included as an appendix.

TI  - Rapid and sensitive detection of bacteria by gas chromatography.
AB  - A gas chromatograph fitted with electron capture and flame ionization detectors was employed for the rapid detection of bacteria by analysis for their metabolic products. The presence of Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, S. liquefaciens, Escherichia coli B, Bacillus cereus, and B. popilliae was detected in 2 to 4 hr in media inoculated with less than 10(4) cells per ml, whereas a 7- to 12-hr growth period was required for the detection of products formed in cultures of Serratia marcescens, Aerobacter aerogenes, E. coli K-12, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Metabolites elaborated by the equivalent of less than a single cell of B. cereus, S. faecalis, P. vulgaris, or E. coli B were sensed by the electron capture detector. The flame ionization detector was generally not as sensitive. Volatile metabolites were identified, and their concentrations were determined.
TI  - Effects in hyperoxia upon microorganisms. I. Membrane culture technique for exposing cells directly to test atmospheres.
AB  - A membrane culture technique was developed for directly exposing microorganisms to test atmospheres. Inhibition and killing were calculated from comparisons with air-grown cultures. Direct colony counts were used with low inocula. With mass inocula, plate colony counts and optical-density measurements were made on resuspended filter populations. Bacteria, including Escherichia coli, were more sensitive to oxygen than previously reported. With inocula of a few hundred cells per membrane, five of seven species failed to produce colonies while exposed to oxygen at one atmosphere. Upon reincubation in air, the survival of five species ranged from near 0 to 12% of the cells. Aerobacter aerogenes was neither inhibited nor killed. With this technique, bacteria are in direct contact with the test atmosphere and cells which survive are detected but do not obscure the response of other cells in the population.

AB  - The distribution of platinum ions within Escherichia coli after the induction of  filaments with cis-Pt(NH(3))(2)Cl(4), and after growth inhibition by PtCl(6) (2-), has been determined with radioactive metal compounds ((191)Pt, with a half-life of approximately 3 days) by the simple chemical procedure of Roberts et al. In the filamentous cells, the platinum metal is associated with metabolic intermediates, nucleic acids, and cytoplasmic proteins; whereas, in inhibited cells, the platinum is combined only with the cytoplasmic protein. Similar experiments with gram-positive cells of Bacillus cereus and Staphyloccus aureus, which show no filamentous growth in the presence of cis-Pt(NH(3))(2)Cl(4), reveal that the metal complex does penetrate the cell wall and subsequently becomes bound predominantly by metabolic intermediates.
TI  - Biosynthesis of biotin in microorganisms. V. Control of vitamer production.
AB  - Use of a yeast-lactobacillus differential microbiological assay permitted investigation into the synthesis of biotin vitamers by a variety of bacteria. A major portion of the biotin activity was found extracellularly. The level of total biotin (assayable with yeast) greatly exceeded the level of true biotin (assayed with lactobacillus). Values for intracellular biotin generally showed good agreement between the assays, suggesting the presence of only true biotin within the cells. Bioautographic analysis of the medium after growth of each organism revealed the presence of large amounts of a vitamer which corresponded to dl-desthiobiotin on the basis of Rf value and biological activity. Biotin, when detected at all, was at very low concentrations. Also, an avidin-uncombinable vitamer was synthesized by a majority of the bacteria. Addition of d-biotin to the growth medium prevented completely the synthesis of both vitamers of biotin. d-Biotin-d-sulfoxide had no effect on the synthesis of desthiobiotin or the avidin-uncombinable vitamer. Addition of dl-desthiobiotin did not prevent its own synthesis nor that of the other vitamer. Control of vitamer synthesis is therefore highly specific for d-biotin. The avidin-uncombinable vitamer was produced only at repressed levels in the presence of high concentrations of both d-biotin and dl-desthiobiotin, which suggested that it is not a degradation product of these substances. A possible mechanism for the overproduction of the biosynthetic precursors of biotin is presented.

TI  - Lysis of Escherichia coli by ethylenediaminetetraacetate and phospholipases as measured by beta-galactosidase activity.
AB  - A permeaseless mutant of Escherichia coli, which produces beta-galactosidase constitutively, was treated briefly with ethylenediaminetetraacetate and then with the phospholipases of Bacillus cereus. Cell lysis occurred, as indicated by an increase in beta-galactosidase activity and a decrease in absorbancy of the cell suspension. The susceptibility of the cells to attack by ethylenediaminetetraacetate and the phospholipases was markedly affected by the age of the cells when harvested. The results suggest that permeability changes may be associated with the activity of a phospholipase that specifically degrades phosphatidyl ethanolamine. A sonic-treatment method for determining the total beta-galactosidase content of E. coli cells, which is independent of their age when harvested, is described.
TI  - Aminopeptidase profiles of various bacteria.
AB  - The aminopeptidase specificity of 24 strains of bacteria was determined fluorometrically by use of a series of alpha-amino acid beta-naphthylamides as substrates. Provided that strict control over medium and growth time was adhered to, a reproducible profile of aminopeptidase activity was obtained which could be used for the identification of bacteria.
TI  - Ultraviolet irradiation of DNA in vitro and in vivo produces a 3d thymine-derived product.
AB  - A new thymine-derived product was separated from DNA irradiated with utlraviolet  light in vitro and in vivo. This compound was mistaken to be thymine homodiner (T=T) by other workers because it is chromatographically indistinguishable from T=T in most eluents. It has absorbancy maximums at 312, 312, and 300 millimicrons in neutral, pH 2, and pH 11 aqueous solutions, respectively. When it is irradiated in aqueous solution with wavelengths of 360 and 313 millimicrons its spectrum reverts to one similar to that of thymine. Therefore, at least three thymine-derived products can be detected in ultraviolet irradiated DNA, namely the homodimer, a material with absorbancy maximum at 312 millimicrons, and a "minor" product suggested by others to be a dimer of cytosine and thymine. In cells, the latter two are formed in aboult equal amounts. While these three products were shown to exist in the acid hydrolyzates of ultraviolet irradiated DNA, a material with absorbancy maximum at about 310 millimicrons was demonstrated to form in ultraviolet irradiated DNA without further treatment. The magnitude of this spectral increase varied directly with the incrcase in the adenine-thymine contents in the DNA as shlown by differential transmittance spectra of the irradiated Micrococcus lysodeikticus, calf thymus, Bacillus cereus, and Hemophilus influenzae DNA.
TI  - Improved assay method for phospholipase C.
AB  - A lecithin sol dispersed with deoxycholate was found to be attacked by phospholipase C in the presence of calcium ion more rapidly than were any other lecithin sols. The inorganic phosphate could be released quantitatively from the acid soluble phosphate liberated from lecithin by an excess amount of alkaline phosphatase present in phospholipase C reaction mixture. A simple and accurate assay method for phospholipase C was developed with the sol and the alkaline phosphatase.

AB  - 1. The penicillinase (beta-lactamase) from Escherichia coli strain TEM has been purified and its activity against a range of penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives measured. 2. The enzyme shows little resemblance to penicillinases from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis and Staphylococcus aureus. 3. The molecular weight of the enzyme is 16700+/-5%, which is about half the value obtained for other penicillinases. 4. The enzyme is most similar in properties to a crude preparation of a penicillinase from Klebsiella (Aerobacter) aerogenes, but clearly different from crude enzyme preparations from other strains of E. coli. 5. Since penicillinase synthesis in E. coli strain TEM is mediated by an R-factor known to infect many other species of Enterobacteriaceae, the appearance of similar enzymes in other Gramnegative species is not surprising.

Autolytic mechanism for spheroplast formation in Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 90:1355-1364. 1965.-Spheroplasts of Bacillus cereus strain T and Escherichia coli B were prepared by incubating early log-phase cells in appropriate buffers and stabilizers for 3 hr at 30 and 37 C, respectively. Upon incubation in 0.05 m tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer osmotically stabilized with 16% polyethylene glycol at pH 7.5, 99% of the B. cereus cells formed spheroplasts; 90% of the E. coli cells were converted to spheroplasts in 0.4 m sodium acetate buffer osmotically stabilized with 1.6 m sucrose at pH 6.0. The extent of spheroplast formation was determined by phase-contrast microscopic examination, by measuring the rate of fall of optical density in the reaction mixture when subjected to osmotic shock, and by viable intact cell counts. The effect of a selected group of metabolic inhibitors on the autolytic system of B. cereus and E. coli has been examined. B. cereus and E. coli wall components comprising 26% of the dry weight of the original cellular material were recovered from dialyzed fractions by precipitation in 70% ethyl alcohol. Chemical and chromatographic analysis of cell-wall hydrolysates from B. cereus and E. coli indicated the presence of glucosamine, alanine, lysine, glycine, aspartic acid, diaminopimelic acid, glutamic acid, and muramic acid.

Bacteriol. 90:384-390. 1965.-Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) fractions from various Bacillus species were tested for interspecies DNA-RNA hybrid formation. DNA preparations from B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. stearothermophilus, and B. macerans, whose base composition varied from 33 to 50% guanylate + cytidylate content, were used in the hybrid annealing mixtures with pulse-labeled RNA from sporulating cells and from log-phase cells of B. subtilis and B. cereus. Efficient hybridization in these cases was obtained only in homologous annealing situations. When heterologous DNA and RNA preparations were tested for hybrid formation, only 1 to 6% of the homologous hybridization was obtained. Although the efficiency of hybrid formation was low, the results were reproducible. No difference in efficiency of hybrid formation was observed between the messenger RNA from sporulating cells and that from log-phase cells. When B. subtilis ribosomal RNA was placed in annealing mixtures with heterologous DNA, 47.5 to 62.9% of the homologous hybridization was obtained. These results suggest that a small number of identical sequences are present among the Bacillus species. Furthermore, the ribosomal RNA cistrons appear to be more highly conserved relative to other genetic sequences.

AB  - Aronson, John N. (Arizona State University, Tempe), and Gerald R. Wermus. Effects of m-tyrosine on growth and sporulation of Bacillus species. J. Bacteriol. 90:38-46. 1965.-The aromatic amino acid analogue, dl-beta-(3-hydroxyphenyl)alanine (m-tyrosine), reduced sporulation of a strain of Bacillus subtilis to less than 5% of that of control cultures in a glucose-salts minimal medium. The mass-doubling time increased twofold, but maximal growth equivalent to that of control cultures was eventually attained. A decreased growth rate could be maintained in the presence of the analogue for more than 10 doublings, despite incorporation of m-tyrosine-2-C(14) in place of some of the protein phenylalanine. The organism proliferated to chain lengths of 10 to 15 cells. These cells persisted for many hours after maximal growth had been reached, in contrast to normal cultures which had begun to autolyze and sporulate. The response to m-tyrosine of strains of B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. megaterium was like that of B. subtilis. In addition, B. thuringiensis and B. cereus converted m-tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine, which was further oxidized to a melaninlike substance. Growth of a strain of B. stearothermophilus was not slowed by m-tyrosine, but a strain of Escherichia coli grew at a reduced rate.

TI  - PRODUCTION AND PARTIAL PURIFICATION OF ANTIBIOTIC MATERIALS FORMED BY PHYSARUM GYROSUM.
AB  - Pure cultures of Physarum gyrosum were grown on agar plates with autoclaved Escherichia coli suspensions as the growth medium. Portions of such agar, after growth of the slime mold, contained diffusible materials that inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Paper chromatography of extracts of such cultures revealed at least three different active fractions. Preliminary fractionations increased the specific activity by one order of magnitude, probably in part by removal of inactive material and in part by separating active components. The fractionations also demonstrated the multiplicity of the antibiotic activity. Fractions variously obtained always retarded the growth of the bacterial species listed above.
TI  - FATE OF BACTERIA IN CHICKEN MEAT DURING FREEZE-DEHYDRATION, REHYDRATION, AND STORAGE.
AB  - Total plate counts were determined on boneless cooked, cubed chicken meat obtained from a commercial processor. Survival of the natural flora was determined after the meat was freeze-dehydrated and rehydrated at room temperature for 30 min and 50, 85, and 100 C for 10 min. Total counts of bacteria in the rehydrated samples were determined during storage of the meat at 4, 22, and 37 C until spoilage odor was detectable. Meat samples were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, then dried, rehydrated, and stored at the same temperatures. Numbers of surviving organisms in the inoculated samples were determined with use of both selective and nonselective media. Representative genera surviving the various rehydration treatments were determined. Approximately 32% of the bacteria in the meat survived during dehydration and rehydration at room temperature. Many numbers and types of vegetative bacteria also survived rehydration at 50 C. When meat was rehydrated at 85 or 100 C, the initial count was less than one per gram. The only organisms isolated from samples rehydrated at 85 or 100 C were of the genus Bacillus. S. aureus in inoculated samples survived dehydration and rehydration at 60 C. Storage of all rehydrated samples at 4 C gave a good shelf life (18 or more days). The study indicates that freeze-dehydrated meat should be produced with adequate microbiological control and that such meat should be rehydrated in very hot water.

AB  - Rouf, M. A. (Washington State University, Pullman). Spectrochemical analysis of inorganic elements in bacteria. J. Bacteriol. 88:1545-1549. 1964.-Quantitative spectrochemical analyses of inorganic elements in the vegetative cells of Escherichia coli, Sphaerotilus natans, Micrococcus roseus, Bacillus cereus, and the spores of B. cereus were made. The following elements were found to be present in the ash samples: B, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, S, Ag, Sn, Ba, Pb, V, and Mo. These could be divided into major, minor, and trace elements, depending on the relative amounts in the cells. Mg, P, K, and S were considered as the major elements; Ca, Fe, Zn, and, perhaps, Cu and Mn as the minor elements, and the rest as trace elements. Mg concentrations were higher in the cells of the gram-positive M. roseus and B. cereus than in the gram-negative E. coli and S. natans. The latter organism contained 2.6% Fe(2)O(3) (dry weight basis). The vegetative cells of B. cereus were higher in Mg, P, K, Na, Ag, and lower in Si, Ca, Zn, Mn, and Cu than were its spores.

J. Bacteriol. 88:374-380. 1964.-The presence of an endogenous factor in Bacillus subtilis which could initiate sporogenesis in suspensions of washed vegetative cells was demonstrated. The inability to obtain a culture of vegetative cells, relatively free from spores, by the "active culture" technique necessitated the use of the "continuous culture" method. The investigations on the continuous cultivation of this organism, to obtain a steady-state population of actively growing vegetative cells, resulted in certain observations which gave an insight into the nature of sporogenesis. Growth studies of the organism under these conditions showed that there was a rise in viable cell numbers, until a maximal population was reached. This was maintained at a steady-state level for sometime; on further incubation, there was a reduction in cell numbers, and consequently the steady state could not be maintained any longer. Spore counts showed that the spore fraction of the total population increased on prolonged incubation. The commitment to sporulation appeared to have caused a reduction in the growth rate of the population, which was experimentally demonstrated by a decline in cell numbers. In contrast, when B. cereus strain T. was grown as a continuous culture, it could be maintained as a steady-state population of vegetative cells, for longer periods, like a nonsporeformer (e.g., Escherichia coli). This difference in behavior could be attributed to the fact that whereas B. subtilis can sporulate in the presence of nutrients, B. cereus strain T. cannot do so until the medium has been depleted of nutrients.

TI  - TETRACYCLINE FLUORESCENCE IN PERMEABILITY STUDIES OF MEMBRANES AROUND INTRACELLULAR PARASITES.
AB  - Certain protozoa, bacteria, and viruses when phagocytosed by host cells become surrounded by an intracytoplasmic boundary. This membrane prevents the fluorescent antibiotic tetracycline from entering the parasites when it is added to the medium, since they show no fluorescence, whereas extracellular parasites are immediately visible. As soon as the host cell dies, the intracellular parasites also become visible. This indicates that the boundary probably is of host origin. This phenomenon provides a means for selective permeability studies of such boundaries. A similar exclusion of tetracycline from certain extracellular parasites is seen in the presence of whole serum.

Other microbial cells, molds, yeasts, and bacteria were also capable of enhancing carotene production.

On the basis of spectrums and sensitivity to chloroform, heat, and proteolytic enzymes, five distinct bacteriocines can be defined. Type 1 is produced by all Streptococcus zymogenes (S. faecalis var. zymogenes) strains, is active against a wide variety of gram-positive bacteria, and is also a hemolysin. Type 2 is produced by some S. liquefaciens (S. faecalis var. liquefaciens) strains, and acts on many enterococci as well as on certain other lactic acid bacteria. Type 3 is produced by certain strains of both S. faecalis and S. faecium, and inhibits a wide variety of group D streptococci, but is inactive against all other lactic acid bacteria tested except Leuconostoc citrovorum. Type 4 is produced by certain S. faecium strains and resembles in certain ways the type 3 activity, but differs from it in other ways. Type 5 has been found to be produced by only one proteolytic strain of S. zymogenes, and this bacteriocine has a very narrow spectrum. The strain that produces this bacteriocine also produces type 1 activity. No strain is sensitive to a bacteriocine of the type it produces.

Inhibition was not caused by changes in pH, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. The concentrated antibiotic material from E. coli H-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.

TI  - Survival of bacteria in lyophilized plasma.
AB  - Although lyophilization reduces the bacterial population in plasma, some species  survive for several months. Sensitivity or resistance to lyophilization in plasma is a characteristic of each morphological type, with gram-negative species being more sensitive to destruction than cocci or sporulating gram-positive species. Reconstituted preparations of lyophilized plasma must be incubated for 24 hr to prevent false-negative sterility tests. The killing process in lyophilized plasma continues with time if the preparations are stored at room temperature. Strict asepsis must be realized during processing of plasma because lyophilization alone does not destroy the microorganisms present.
TI  - Repression of Staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. I. Effect of environmental  factors on inhibition.
AB  - The effects of environmental factors on the inhibition of an enterotoxin-producing strain of Staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria were investigated. Type of medium and temperature of incubation were important factors in determining the amount of inhibition. The pH range of maximal inhibition was found to be 7.4 to 6.2. Availability of oxygen was not a factor. As the ratios of inhibitor to staphylococcus were increased from 1:1 to 10:1 and 100:1, the amount of inhibition was markedly increased. Inhibition occurred in custard, where it increased with increasing ratios of effector to staphylococcus. The repression of the staphylococcus in all media usually was sufficient to be of practical significance.

Glycerol (10%) was used as a protective additive. Quantitative determinations showed from 10% to virtually 100% recovery in the various cases. Host specificity, plaque morphology, and, in one case, rate of inactivation of phage by homologous antiserum remained unchanged.

When ammonium acetate solutions were used a tendency for coiling and aggregation was observed. E. coli soluble RNA appears as small, sometimes elongated particles the smallest diameter being of about 10 A.
