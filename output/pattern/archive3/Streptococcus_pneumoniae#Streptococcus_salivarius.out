bacteriocin-producing oral streptococci and inhibition of respiratory pathogens.
the use of bacteria as probiotics is in continuous development, thanks to their capacity to maintain or restore a host's natural microbiome by interference with and/or inhibition of other microorganisms mediated by antimicrobial peptide production such as bacteriocins. in the oral cavity, streptococcus salivarius, a non-pathogenic and predominant oral species, is one of the major bacteriocin producers that is able to coexist in this environment and reduce the frequency of colonization of the main pathogens involved in upper respiratory tract infections. the aim of this study was to screen oral bacteria colonizing healthy children for their use as potential oral probiotics. eighty-one alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from nasal and/or pharyngeal swabs of 31 healthy children aged between two and twelve years were isolated. among them, 13 alpha-hemolytic streptococci were selected for their bacteriocin-like inhibitory activity against potential pathogens. these strains were tested for bacteriocin production and assayed for their capacity to adhere to hep-2 cell lines. our data showed that 13 bacteriocin producer strains were able to inhibit different gram-positive pathogens. among them one strain, s. salivarius 24smb, deposited as dsm 23307, was selected as a potential oral probiotic, thanks to its safety assessment, ability to inhibit streptococcus pneumoniae and the absence of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes.
bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) production by the normal flora of the nasopharynx: potential to protect against otitis media?
the normal bacterial flora of the upper airways provides an important barrier to  invading pathogens. this study investigated the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) by streptococci isolated from the nasopharyngeal flora of children who either do or do not experience recurrent acute otitis media (aom). twenty children with recurrent aom and 15 controls were tested. swabs from the nasopharynx were evaluated for streptococci having blis activity against two representative strains of each of the aom pathogens streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococci displaying strong blis activity were characterized further and tested for known streptococcal bacteriocin structural genes. sixty-five per cent of children had nasopharyngeal streptococcal isolates that were inhibitory to strains of one or more of the aom pathogens. six children (17 %) had streptococci that demonstrated strong blis activity against strains of at least three of the pathogenic species. three of these inhibitory isolates were streptococcus salivarius, two were s. pneumoniae and one was s. pyogenes. the inhibitory s. salivarius and s. pyogenes were shown to have structural genes for known streptococcal bacteriocins. no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups of children with respect to the presence of inhibitory streptococci in their nasopharyngeal floras. the finding of s. salivarius with strong inhibitory activity against several aom pathogens in the nasopharyngeal flora of children is unique. although there is no clear evidence from the present study that these organisms protect against aom, their low pathogenicity and strong in-vitro blis production capability indicate that they should be incorporated in future trials of bacteriotherapy for recurrent aom.
[significance of normal oral flora, particularly group oral streptococci as defense mechanism against infection in healthy individuals (normal defense mechanism by oral streptococcus group)].
the alpha-streptococci, consisted of normal oral flora mainly, with inhibitory activity against pathogenic microbes in healthy individuals was investigated by group a streptococcus (indicator strain 6-22 nonmucoid t-12). rate of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against group a streptococcus was increased as aging, and the rate in pre-school children was higher than that in school children. these results suggested that more than 90% of the tested alpha-streptococci with strong inhibitory activities (s. salivarius) against indicator strain had inhibitory activities against group a streptococcus (mucoid t-6), h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, group c streptococcus, and from 40% to 70% of the tested strains had also inhibitory activities against other pathogens. as there were many strains of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activities against pathogens, that usually detected in the upper respiratory infection, the problem on the strains in the future will explain significance of the defense mechanism against upper respiratory infection and this can be applied clinically.
exogenous thymidine and reversal of the inhibitory effect of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim on streptococci.
the practice of using sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (sxt) for the selective isolation of streptococcus pyogenes and as a taxonomic character in the presumptive identification of streptococci was applied to 17 strains of different groups of streptococci to determine their characteristic behaviour in the presence of exogenous thymidine. streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and group d enterococci utilized thymidine, the first two species obtaining a maximum reversal of the inhibitory effect of sxt at thymidine concentrations of 1.2 micrograms/ml and 0.6 micrograms/ml or higher, respectively. for group d enterococci, the degree of reversal of the inhibitory effect was proportional to the thymidine concentration. in contrast, the four viridans species studied (streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis ii) and streptococcus pneumoniae were unable to utilize thymidine from an exogenous source and thus growth remained inhibited even at the highest concentrations of thymidine tested. for selective isolation and identification of streptococci only stable media with batch-to-batch consistency are recommended together with a known quantity of thymidine.
purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
