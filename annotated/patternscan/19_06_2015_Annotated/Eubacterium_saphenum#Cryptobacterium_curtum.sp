TI  == new bacterial species associated with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == recent investigations of the human subgingival oral flora based on ribosomal 16s  cloning and sequencing have shown many of the bacterial species present to be novel species or phylotypes. the purpose of the present investigation was to identify potential periodontal pathogens among these newly identified species and phylotypes. species-specific ribosomal 16s primers for pcr amplification were developed for detection of new species. associations with chronic periodontitis were observed for several new species or phylotypes, including uncultivated clones d084 and bh017 from the deferribacteres phylum, au126 from the bacteroidetes phylum, megasphaera clone bb166, clone x112 from the op11 phylum, and clone i025 from the tm7 phylum, and the named species eubacterium saphenum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, and cryptobacterium curtum. species or phylotypes more prevalent in periodontal health included two uncultivated phylotypes, clone w090 from the deferribacteres phylum and clone bu063 from the bacteroidetes, and named species atopobium rimae and atopobium parvulum.

TI  == cryptobacterium curtum gen. nov., sp. nov., a new genus of gram-positive anaerobic rod isolated from human oral cavities.
AB  == novel eubacterium-like isolates, strains 12-3t and kv43-b, which were isolated from the periodontal pocket of an adult patient with periodontal disease and necrotic dental pulp, respectively, were studied taxonomically and phylogenetically. the morphological and differential biochemical characteristics  of these organisms are also described in this paper. these organisms were gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria that were inert  in most of the conventional biochemical tests and closely resembled members of asaccharolytic oral eubacterium species. on the other hand, protein profiles of whole cells in sds-page and western immunoblotting reaction analysis distinguished these isolates from strains of the previously described genus eubacterium. the g+c content of the dnas from the novel isolates was 50 and 51 mol%, respectively. the levels of dna-dna relatedness to other asaccharolytic oral eubacterium species, including eubacterium brachy, eubacterium lentum, eubacterium nodatum, eubacterium timidum, eubacterium saphenum, eubacterium minutum and eubacterium exiguum, was less than 11%. these organisms also exhibited a very low level of reassociation with the dna of eubacterium limosum,  the type species of the genus eubacterium. the results of 16s rdna sequence comparisons revealed that these organisms represent a novel lineage distinct from all previously described genera of gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria. on the basis of our results, it is suggested that strains 12-3t and kv43-b should be classified in a new genus and species, for which the name cryptobacterium curtum  gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain of cryptobacterium curtum is 12-3t (= atcc 700683t).
