TI  - Assessment of the Prevalence of Extended-Spectrum beta-Lactamase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae in Ready-to-Eat Salads, Fresh-Cut Fruit, and Sprouts from the Swiss Market.
AB  - Ready-to-eat (RTE) prepacked salads and fruit have been successfully marketed for the last decade in Switzerland and are increasingly important as a component of everyday diets. To determine whether extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are present in RTE salads, fresh-cut fruit, and sprouts on the Swiss market, samples of 238 mixed and unmixed RTE produce from a large production plant and 23 sprout samples from two sprout farms were analyzed. Further, four samples from the production plant's recycled wash water, which is used for crop irrigation, were analyzed. Twelve (5%) of the 238 RTE products and one of the recycled wash water samples yielded ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Strain identification and PCR analysis of the blaESBL genes revealed Kluyvera ascorbata isolated from a tomato sample harboring a blaCTX-M-2-like gene; multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacter cloacae detected in a chives sample imported from Spain harboring the clinically important blaCTX-M-15 gene; and 10 Serratia spp. isolated from mixed salads (blaFONA-2 and blaFONA-2-like genes were found in 6 [60%] and blaFONA-4-like and blaFONA-5-like genes were each found in 2 [20%] of the isolates). The recycled wash water sample tested positive for one extraintestinal pathogenic MDR Escherichia coli B2:ST131 harboring blaCTX-M-27 and for one MDR E. coli A:ST88 containing blaCTX-M-3. None of the sprout samples tested positive for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Overall, the majority of the Enterobacteriaceae detected in Swiss RTE produce were environmental strains producing minor ESBLs. The detection of an isolate producing a clinically important ESBL in a single sample and of an international circulating pathogenic strain (B2:ST131) in recycled wash water highlights the importance of surveillance of fresh produce and of recycled wash water that will be reused for irrigation purposes.
TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities from Jatropha dioica roots.
AB  - The antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of organic extracts obtained from roots of the medicinal plant Jatropha dioica (Euphorbiaceae) were investigated. In order to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, the organic extracts were tested against clinical isolates of the human pathogens Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis and Sporothrix schenckii. Results revealed that the hexane extract possess the stronger activity and a broader microbicide spectrum compared to the acetone and ethanol extracts. The activity of hexane extract may be attributed in part to the presence of beta-sitosterol, the major compound identified by bioautography. The hexane extract, as well as the bioactive fraction were not cytotoxic when assays were profiled against the normal cell lines Chang, OK and LLCPK-1 (IC50>1000 mug mL(-1)).
TI  - Molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae from humans in the community.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC)-resistant Enterobacteriaceae collected during a cross-sectional study examining the prevalence and risk factors for faecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in humans living in areas with high or low broiler density. METHODS: ESC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were identified by combination disc-diffusion test. ESBL/AmpC/carbapenemase genes were analysed using PCR and sequencing. For E. coli, phylogenetic groups and MLST were determined. Plasmids were characterized by transformation and PCR-based replicon typing. Subtyping of plasmids was done by plasmid multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS: 175 ESC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were cultured from 165/1,033 individuals. The isolates were Escherichia coli(n=65), Citrobacter freundii (n=52), Enterobacter cloacae (n=38), Morganella morganii (n=5), Enterobacter aerogenes (n=4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=3), Hafnia alvei (n=2), Shigella spp. (n=2), Citrobacter amalonaticus (n=1), Escherichia hermannii (n=1), Kluyvera cryocrescens (n=1), and Pantoea agglomerans (n=1). The following ESBL genes were recovered in 55 isolates originating from 49 of 1,033 (4.7 %) persons: blaCTX-M-1 (n=17), blaCTX-M-15 (n=16), blaCTX-M-14 (n=9), blaCTX-M-2 (n=3), blaCTX-M-3 (n=2), blaCTX-M-24 (n=2), blaCTX-M-27 (n=1), blaCTX-M-32 (n=1), blaSHV-12 (n=2), blaSHV-65 (n=1) and blaTEM-52 (n=1). Plasmidic AmpC (pAmpC) genes were discovered in 6 out of 1,033 (0.6 %) persons. One person carried two different E. coli isolates, one with blaCTX-M-1 and the other with blaCMY-2 and therefore the prevalence of persons carrying Enterobacteriaceae harboring ESBL and/or pAmpC genes was 5.2 %. In eight E. coli isolates the AmpC phenotype was caused by mutations in the AmpC promoter region. No carbapenemase genes were identified. A large variety of E. coli genotypes was found, ST131 and ST10 being most common. CONCLUSIONS: ESBL/pAmpC genes resembled those from patients in Dutch hospitals, indicating that healthy humans form a reservoir for transmission of these determinants to vulnerable people. The role of poultry in the transmission to humans in the community remains to be elucidated.
TI  - PCR detection and identification of bacterial contaminants in ocular samples from post-operative endophthalmitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening complication of ocular surgery which requires urgent medical consideration including comprehensive diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a sensitive molecular method has been extensively used for detection of microbial species in clinical specimens. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the causative organisms of endophthalmitis in our patient population using a procedure based on PCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vitreous samples from 32 patients with post-operative endophthalmitis were collected. Total vitreous DNA was extracted and then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using PCR with a pair of HAD2 universal primers. Library of PCR products from 16S rRNA, cloned into the pTZ57R/T vector. The ligated products were then transformed into E. coli DH5alpha strain and grown in the LB-ampicillin/X-Gal/IPTG plate. RESULTS: From the total of 32 vitreous samples, 18 specimens were positive, illustrating the presence of bacterial infection (56.4 %). Twelve species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus were identified using BLAST for known 16S rRNA sequences. CONCLUSION: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) accompanied with cloning and sequencing approved to be sensitive and specific. The rapid molecular technique was useful in detection of 12 major microbial species, in infectious endophthalmitis.
TI  - In Vitro Activity of Ceftolozane Alone and in Combination with Tazobactam Against Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase Harboring Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Ceftolozane formally, CXA-101, is a new antipseudomonal cephalosporin that is also active in vitro against Enterobacteriaceae, but is vulnerable to extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The addition of tazobactam is intended to broaden coverage of most ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumonia as well as other Enterobacteriaceae. The in vitro activities of ceftolozane/tazobactam combinations against 67 clinically and molecularly characterized ESBL producing isolates were examined by checkerboard MIC to evaluate its potential clinical feasibility and to assess the optimal tazobactam concentrations to be used in MIC determinations of ceftolozane. Isolates included Escherichia coli (n=32), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=19), Enterobacter cloacae (n=15) and 1 Citrobacter freundii. Checkerboard experiments were performed to study interactions over the range of 0.008-64 mg/L ceftolozane and 0.063-32 mg/L tazobactam using two-fold dilution series. The MIC50 and MIC90 of ceftolozane alone for all isolates were 16 and >/=64 mg/L respectively. Increasing concentrations of tazobactam resulted in decreasing MICs of ceftolozane. The 50th and 90th percentile concentrations of tazobactam required to reduce the MIC of ceftolozane to 8 mg/L for all organisms in this ESBL collection were 0.5 and 4 mg/L respectively. For E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae these values were 0.5 and 2, 1 and 16, and 0.5 and 4 mg/L respectively. When combined with a fixed amount of 4 mg/L tazobactam (current CLSI concentration used for susceptibility testing), 90% of the isolates would have an MIC of </=4 mg/L. The combination ceftolozane/tazobactam is a promising alternative option for treating infections due to ESBL harboring isolates.
TI  - Inhibition of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase resistance enzymes by metal salts.
AB  - Aminoglycosides (AGs) are clinically relevant antibiotics used to treat infections caused by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as Mycobacteria. As with all current antibacterial agents, resistance to AGs is an increasing problem. The most common mechanism of resistance to AGs is the presence of AG-modifying enzymes (AMEs) in bacterial cells, with AG acetyltransferases (AACs) being the most prevalent. Recently, it was discovered that Zn2+ metal ions displayed an inhibitory effect on the resistance enzyme AAC(6' )-Ib in Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli. In this study, we explore a wide array of metal salts (Mg2+, Cr3+, Cr6+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Au3+ with different counter ions) and their inhibitory effect on a large repertoire of AACs (AAC(2' )-Ic, AAC (3)-Ia, AAC (3)-Ib, AAC (3)-IV, AAC(6' )-Ib', AAC(6' )-Ie, AAC(6' )-IId, and Eis). In addition, we determine the MIC values for amikacin and tobramycin in combination with a zinc-pyrithione complex in clinical isolates of various bacterial strains (two strains of A. baumannii, three of Enterobacter cloacae, and four of Klebsiella pneumoniae) and one representative of each species purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.
TI  - Environmental monitoring of bacterial contamination and antibiotic resistance patterns of the fecal coliforms isolated from Cauvery River, a major drinking water source in Karnataka, India.
AB  - The present study focuses prudent elucidation of microbial pollution and antibiotic sensitivity profiling of the fecal coliforms isolated from River Cauvery, a major drinking water source in Karnataka, India. Water samples were collected from ten hotspots during the year 2011-2012. The physiochemical characteristics and microbial count of water samples collected from most of the hotspots exhibited greater biological oxygen demand and bacterial count especially coliforms in comparison with control samples (p </= 0.01). The antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed using 48 antibiotics against the bacterial isolates by disk-diffusion assay. The current study showed that out of 848 bacterial isolates, 93.51% (n = 793) of the isolates were found to be multidrug-resistant to most of the current generation antibiotics. Among the major isolates, 96.46% (n = 273) of the isolates were found to be multidrug-resistant to 30 antibiotics and they were identified to be Escherichia coli by 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Similarly, 93.85% (n = 107), 94.49% (n = 103), and 90.22% (n = 157) of the isolates exhibited multiple drug resistance to 32, 40, and 37 antibiotics, and they were identified to be Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas trivialis, and Shigella sonnei, respectively. The molecular studies suggested the prevalence of bla TEM genes in all the four isolates and dhfr gene in Escherichia coli and Sh. sonnei. Analogously, most of the other Gram-negative bacteria were found to be multidrug-resistant and the Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus spp. isolated from the water samples were found to be methicillin and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This is probably the first study elucidating the bacterial pollution and antibiotic sensitivity profiling of fecal coliforms isolated from River Cauvery, Karnataka, India.
TI  - Multidrug resistance found in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae from rural water reservoirs in Guantao, China.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been isolated from humans and animals across the world. However, data on prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae from rural water reservoirs is limited. This study aimed to isolate and characterize ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in rural water reservoirs in Guantao, China. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were found in 5 (16.7%) of 30 sampled rural water reservoirs. Sixty-six individual isolates expressing an ESBL phenotype were obtained in the present study. Species identification showed that 42 representatives of Escherichia coli, 17 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 Raoultella planticola, and 3 Enterobacter cloacae. Twenty isolates contained a single bla gene, including CTX-M (17 strains), TEM (2 strains), and SHV (1 strain). Forty-six isolates contained more than one type of beta-lactamase genes. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated in this study were all multidrug resistant. These findings indicated that the serious contamination of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in rural water reservoirs existed in Guantao, China.
TI  - Characterization of Multiple NDM-1-Producing Enterobacteriaceae Isolates from the Same Patient.
AB  - A male patient was admitted to a community hospital in Ontario, Canada, with an infected sacral ulcer after returning from India, where he was hospitalized. Carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (isolated from blood cultures), Enterobacter cloacae, and Providencia stuartii (from urine samples), all positive for blaNDM-1, were recovered. Comparative NDM-1 plasmid analysis suggests both lateral plasmid transfer and independent acquisition of the blaNDM-1 gene in these clinical isolates.
TI  - Ceftazidime-Avibactam Activity Tested against Enterobacteriaceae Isolates from U.S. Hospitals (2011 to 2013) and Characterization of beta-Lactamase-Producing Strains.
AB  - Ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) inhibited 99.9% (20,698/20,709) of Enterobacteriaceae isolates at </=8 mug/ml. This compound was active against resistant subsets, including ceftazidime-nonsusceptible Enterobacter cloacae (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype isolates. An ESBL phenotype was noted among 12.4% (1,696/13,692 isolates from targeted species) of the isolates, including 776 Escherichia coli (12.0% for this species; MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 721 Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.3%; MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 119 Klebsiella oxytoca (10.3%; MIC50/90, 0.06/0.25 mug/ml), and 80 Proteus mirabilis (4.9%; MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml) isolates. The most common enzymes detected among ESBL phenotype isolates from 2013 (n = 743) screened using a microarray-based assay were CTX-M-15-like (n = 307), KPC (n = 120), SHV ESBLs (n = 118), and CTX-M-14-like (n = 110). KPC producers were highly resistant to comparators, and ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml) and tigecycline (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml; 98.3% susceptible) were the most active agents against these strains. Meropenem (MIC50/90, </=0.06/</=0.06 mug/ml) and ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) were active against CTX-M-producing isolates. Other enzymes were also observed, and ceftazidime-avibactam displayed good activity against the isolates producing less common enzymes. Among 11 isolates displaying ceftazidime-avibactam MIC values of >8 mug/ml, three were K. pneumoniae strains producing metallo-beta-lactamases (all ceftazidime-avibactam MICs, >32 mug/ml), with two NDM-1 producers and one K. pneumoniae strain carrying the blaKPC-2 and blaVIM-4 genes. Therapeutic options for isolates producing beta-lactamases may be limited, and ceftazidime-avibactam, which displayed good activity against strains, including those producing KPC enzymes, merits further study in infections where such organisms occur.
TI  - Prospective multicenter study of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae from  83 hospitals in Spain reveals high in vitro susceptibility to colistin and meropenem.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the impact of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in Spain in 2013 by describing the prevalence, dissemination, and geographic distribution of CPE clones, and their population structure and antibiotic susceptibility. From February 2013 to May 2013, 83 hospitals (about 40,000 hospital beds) prospectively collected nonduplicate Enterobacteriaceae using the screening cutoff recommended by EUCAST. Carbapenemase characterization was performed by phenotypic methods and confirmed by PCR and sequencing. Multilocus sequencing types (MLST) were determined for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. A total of 702 Enterobacteriaceae isolates met the inclusion criteria; 379 (54%) were CPE. OXA-48 (71.5%) and VIM-1 (25.3%) were the most frequent carbapenemases, and K. pneumoniae (74.4%), Enterobacter cloacae (10.3%), and E. coli (8.4%) were the species most affected. Susceptibility to colistin, amikacin, and meropenem was 95.5%, 81.3%, and 74.7%, respectively. The most prevalent sequence types (STs) were ST11 and ST405 for K. pneumoniae and ST131 for E. coli. Forty-five (54.1%) of the hospitals had at least one CPE case. For K. pneumoniae, ST11/OXA-48, ST15/OXA-48, ST405/OXA-48, and ST11/VIM-1 were detected in two or more Spanish provinces. ST11 isolates carried four carbapenemases (VIM-1, OXA-48, KPC-2, and OXA-245), but ST405 isolates carried OXA-48 only. A wide interregional spread of CPE in Spain was observed, mainly due to a few successful clones of OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae (e.g., ST11 and ST405). The dissemination of OXA-48-producing E. coli is a new finding of public health concern. According to the susceptibilities determined in vitro, most of the CPE (94.5%) had three or more options for antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Detection and characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in high-risk patients in an Irish tertiary care hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) are Gram-negative, multi-drug-resistant organisms that are of major clinical significance among immunocompromised patients in high-risk areas in hospital settings. In Ireland, the number of ESBL-E bloodstream infections is increasing. AIMS: To conduct a prevalence study of ESBL-E among immunocompromised patients in high-risk areas [intensive care unit (ICU), liver transplantation and haematology/oncology wards], characterize any ESBL genes detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and perform epidemiological typing using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). METHODS: In total, 317 non-duplicate rectal swabs from patients in high-risk wards were screened anonymously for ESBL-E carriage. Positive isolates were characterized using PCR to detect blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaOXA-1 and blaSHV ESBL-E genes. Clonal relationships of these isolates were investigated using PFGE. FINDINGS: Fifty (15.8%) high-risk patients were found to harbour ESBL-E. Prevalence rates of 21.9% (N = 28), 14.3% (N = 15) and 8.3% (N = 7) of ESBL-E were isolated from patients on the liver transplantation, ICU and haematology/oncology wards, respectively. Seventy percent of ESBL-E isolates carried more than one resistance gene. Of the 25 ESBL-producing Escherichia coli isolates typed by PFGE, two pairs of two isolates demonstrated >80% homology, and four of the five ESBL-producing Enterobacter cloacae isolates typed by PFGE demonstrated >80% homology, suggesting clonal relatedness and potential cross-transmission from individual patients. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of the patients screened were found to be colonized with ESBL-E. Typing revealed three incidents of potential cross-infection. Therefore, timely detection of ESBL-E among patients in high-risk wards is critical for treatment and infection control.
TI  - The carbapenem inactivation method (CIM), a simple and low-cost alternative for the Carba NP test to assess phenotypic carbapenemase activity in gram-negative rods.
AB  - A new phenotypic test, called the Carbapenem Inactivation Method (CIM), was developed to detect carbapenemase activity in Gram-negative rods within eight hours. This method showed high concordance with results obtained by PCR to detect genes coding for the carbapenemases KPC, NDM, OXA-48, VIM, IMP and OXA-23. It allows reliable detection of carbapenemase activity encoded by various genes in species of Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae), but also in non-fermenters Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The CIM was shown to be a cost-effective and highly robust phenotypic screening method that can reliably detect carbapenemase activity.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - Special references to bacteria isolated between April 2011 and March 2012].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2011 to March 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. Five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Collinsella aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by P micra and L. acidophilus, in this order. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides caccae, B. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and B. wadsworthia, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.
TI  - The extract of Hypericum ascyron L. induces bacterial cell death through apoptosis pathway.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hypericum ascyron L. (H. ascyron L.) has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of wounds, swelling, headache, nausea, stomach ache, abscesses, dysentery and chronic bronchitis. Pharmacological studies are necessary to provide a scientific basis to substantiate their traditional use. In this study, antimicrobial effect and its mechanism of the H. ascyron L. extract was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of the H. ascyron L. extract was evaluated by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT). To confirm the antimicrobial mechanism of H. ascyron L. extract on bacterial cells, Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining, TUNEL, and DNA laddering analysis were performed. RESULTS: Antibacterial effects of the H. ascyron L. extract were tested on Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, and the results showed that the sensitive bacteria of H. ascyron L. extract mainly included E. coli, S. aureus and M. luteus, especially M. luteus. The MBC value of H. ascyron L. extract on M. luteus was equal to the MIC (20mg/mL). H. ascyron L. extract could induce cells death of M. luteus through apoptosis pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides scientific support for some of the traditional uses and the pharmacological activities of H. ascyron L. Our data provide a rational base for the folkloric use of H. ascyron L.
TI  - Carbapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae in Taiwan.
AB  - A total of 1135 carbapenem-resistant (nonsusceptible) Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) isolates were recovered between November 2010 and July 2012 (517 from 2010-2011 and 618 from 2012) from 4 hospitals in Taiwan. Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) comprised 5.0% (57 isolates), including 17 KPC-2 (16 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 1 Escherichia coli), 1 NDM-1 (K. oxytoca), 37 IMP-8 (26 Enterobacter cloacae, 4 Citrobacter freundii, 4 Raoultella planticola, 1 K. pneumoniae, 1 E. coli and 1 K. oxytoca), and 2 VIM-1 (1 E. cloacae, 1 E. coli). The KPC-2-positive K. pneumoniae were highly clonal even in isolates from different hospitals, and all were ST11. IMP-8 positive E. cloacae from the same hospitals showed higher similarity in PFGE pattern than those from different hospitals. A total of 518 CRE isolates (45.6%) were positive for blaESBL, while 704 (62.0%) isolates were blaAmpC-positive, 382 (33.6% overall) of which carried both blaESBL and blaAmpC. CTX-M (414, 80.0%) was the most common blaESBL, while DHA (497, 70.6%) and CMY (157, 22.3%) were the most common blaAmpC. Co-carriage of blaESBL and blaAmpC was detected in 31 (54.4%) and 15 (26.3%) of the 57 CPE, respectively. KPC-2 was the most common carbapenemase detected in K. pneumoniae (2.8%), while IMP-8 was the most common in E. cloacae (9.7%). All KPC-2-positive CRE were resistant to all three tested carbapenems. However, fourteen of the 37 IMP-8-positive CRE were susceptible to both imipenem and meropenem in vitro. Intra- and inter-hospital spread of KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae and IMP-8-producing E. cloacae likely occurred. Although the prevalence of CPE is still low, careful monitoring is urgently needed. Non-susceptibility to ertapenem might need to be considered as one criterion of definition for CRE in areas where IMP type carbapenemase is prevalent.
TI  - Separation and confirmation of nine Enterobacteriaceae strains that carry the gene.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to confirm the existence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae carrying the bla NDM-1 gene in clinics in Hainan province, China. Collected clinical bacterial isolates that were Enterobacteriaceae strains suspected of producing carbapenemase were used as experimental strains. Drug resistance to imipenem, meropenem and other antibacterial agents was tested. Imipenem/imipenem inhibitor (IP/IPI) E-testing was conducted to identify the bacterial strains that produced metallo-beta-lactamases. The bla NDM-1 drug resistance gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) and sequencing were conducted to identify the products. The species of the strains carrying the bla NDM-1 gene were determined using a biochemical identification system. Through the IP/IPI E-test, 21 of the 30 collected Enterobacteriaceae strains were found to be positive, indicating that 70% of the strains produced metallo-beta-lactamases. Following bla NDM-1 gene PCR amplification, AGE and sequencing tests confirmed that nine of the strains carried the bla NDM-1 drug resistance gene. The biochemical identification system indicated that four of the strains were Klebsiella pneumoniae, two were Escherichia coli, two were Enterobacter cloacae and one was Enterobacter aerogenes. Drug susceptibility testing in vitro demonstrated that the strains were 100% resistant to a broad spectrum antibiotic plus lactamase inhibitor, cephalosporins and carbapenems. However, they had high sensitivity rates to polymyxin B and tigecycline of 100 and 88.9%, respectively. The sensitivity rate to amikacin was also high at 77.8%, whereas sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin was moderate at rates of 44.4 and 33.3% respectively. This clinical study of Enterobacteriaceae strains that carry the bla NDM-1 gene in Hainan shows a bacterial tolerance that is different from that in previous studies, which requires further in-depth study.
TI  - Predominance of KPC-3 in a Survey for Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae  in Portugal.
AB  - Among the 2,105 Enterobacteriaceae tested in a survey done in Portugal, 165 were  nonsusceptible to carbapenems, from which 35 (26 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 Escherichia coli, 2 Enterobacter aerogenes, and 3 Enterobacter cloacae isolates and 1 Klebsiella oxytoca isolate) were confirmed to be carbapenemase producers by the presence of 30 Tn4401d-blaKPC-3, 4 intI3-blaGES-5, and one intI1-blaVIM-2 gene, alone or in combination with other bla genes. The dissemination of blaKPC-3 gene carried by an IncF plasmid suggests lateral gene transfer as a major mechanism of dissemination.
TI  - A statistical approach for determination of disk diffusion-based cutoff values for systematic characterization of wild-type and non-wild-type bacterial populations in antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - In this study, we introduce a new approach for determination of epidemiologic cutoffs (ECOFFs) and resistant-population cutoffs (RCOFFs) based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. As an example, the method was applied for determination of ECOFFs for seven different beta-lactam antibiotics and wild-type populations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae. In addition, RCOFFs were determined for bacterial populations with defined resistance mechanisms ("resistotypes"), i.e., extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-positive E. coli, ESBL-positive K. pneumoniae, and ESBL-positive E. cloacae; AmpC cephalosporinase-positive E. coli and AmpC-positive K. pneumoniae; and broad-spectrum beta-lactamase (BSBL)-positive E. coli. RCOFFs and ECOFFs are instrumental for a systematic characterization of associations between resistotypes and wild-type populations.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against European Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Recent clinical isolates of key Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four European countries (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/L avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. Against Enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. MIC90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90% of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. A two-fold reduction in the MIC90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/L was noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam, whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the MIC values of the test compounds when tested against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Haemophilus influenzae. It had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. This study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa but not against A. baumannii.
TI  - Extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated from vegetables imported from the Dominican Republic, India, Thailand, and Vietnam.
AB  - To examine to what extent fresh vegetables imported into Switzerland represent carriers of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, 169 samples of different types of fresh vegetables imported into Switzerland from the Dominican Republic, India, Thailand, and Vietnam were analyzed. Overall, 25.4% of the vegetable samples yielded one or more ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, 78.3% of which were multidrug resistant. Sixty isolates were obtained: Escherichia coli, 26; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 26; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Enterobacter aerogenes, 1; and Cronobacter sakazakii, 1. We found 29 isolates producing CTX-M-15, 8 producing CTX-M-14, 7 producing CTX-M-55, 3 producing CTX-M-65, 1 each producing CTX-M-1, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-27, and CTX-M-63, 5 producing SHV-2, 3 producing SHV-12, and 1 producing SHV-2a. Four of the E. coli isolates belonged to epidemiologically important clones: CTX-M-15-producing B2:ST131 (1 isolate), D:ST405 (1 isolate), and D:ST38 (2 isolates). One of the D:ST38 isolates belonged to the extraintestinal enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) D:ST38 lineage. Two of the K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to the epidemic clones sequence type 15 (ST15) and ST147. The occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic and commensal Enterobacteriaceae in imported agricultural foodstuffs constitutes a source of ESBL genes and a concern for food safety.
TI  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) directly from positive blood culture flasks allows rapid identification of bloodstream infections in immunosuppressed hosts.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In immunosuppressed hosts, rapid identification of microorganisms of bloodstream infections is crucial to ensuring effective antimicrobial therapy. Conventional culture requires up to 72 h from sample collection to pathogen identification. METHODS: We used the SepsiTyper Kit and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF; Microflex, Bruker) directly from positive blood culture (BacT/ALERT 3D, FN/FA vials; bioMerieux) in comparison to standard culture methodology (VITEK 2; bioMerieux) for species identification. RESULTS: A total of 62 consecutive positive blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients (solid organ or hematopoietic transplant recipients, or with febrile neutropenia) were analyzed. Culture yielded gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in 27/62 (43.5%) and gram-positive (GPB) in 35/62 (56.5%) vials. For GNB, the predominant species identified by MALDI-TOF and confirmed by VITEK were Escherichia coli (16/16 correctly identified) and Enterobacter cloacae (4/4), with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.6% and 100%, respectively. For GPB, predominant species were Staphylococcus aureus (3/3), coagulase-negative staphylococci (12/24), and Enterococcus faecium (6/6) with a sensitivity of 100%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. The median time from blood collection to species identification was 27.4 h with MALDI-TOF identification and 46.6 h with conventional methodology. CONCLUSION: Using MALDI-TOF directly from positive blood cultures allowed a shorter time to identification with high sensitivity and specificity in immunosuppressed patients.
TI  - Bacteriological Investigation of Chronic Wounds in a Specialized Wound Healing Department: A Retrospective Analysis of 107 Cases.
AB  - To investigate the information of chronic wounds, especially in the aspect of microbiological profile and to explore the relationship between the wound culture result and chronic wounds infection, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 107 patients with chronic wounds from January 2011 to December 2013. The sociodemographic data, wound-related information, therapeutic type, and wound infection status were extracted. Microbial specimens were obtained and processed using standard hospital procedure for wound culture. The predominant pathogen isolated was Staphylococcus aureus (n = 11, 26.2%), followed by Escherichia coli (n = 6, 14.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 3, 7.1%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3, 7.1%). Sixty percent of the infectious chronic wounds had positive culture, and 96.2% of the noninfectious wounds had negative culture. In conclusion, the microbial characteristics were mostly in the site of lower extremity, gram-negative bacteria, and monopathogen, respectively. Furthermore, the relationship between the wound culture result and chronic wound infection was not exactly coincident. It may be useful for guiding the empiric therapy of chronic wounds.
TI  - Enhanced biohydrogen production from beverage industrial wastewater using external nitrogen sources and bioaugmentation with facultative anaerobic strains.
AB  - In this work biohydrogen generation and its improvement possibilities from beverage industrial wastewater were sought. Firstly, mesophilic hydrogen fermentations were conducted in batch vials by applying heat-treated (80 degrees C, 30 min) sludge and liquid (LB-grown) cultures of Escherichia coli XL1-Blue/Enterobacter cloacae DSM 16657 strains for bioaugmentation purposes. The results showed that there was a remarkable increase in hydrogen production capacities when facultative anaerobes were added in the form of inoculum. Furthermore, experiments were carried out in order to reveal whether the increment occurred either due to the efficient contribution of the facultative anaerobic microorganisms or the culture ingredients (in particular yeast extract and tryptone) supplied when the bacterial suspensions (LB media-based inocula) were mixed with the sludge. The outcome of these tests was that both the applied nitrogen sources and the bacteria (E. coli) could individually enhance hydrogen formation. Nevertheless, the highest increase took place when they were used together. Finally, the optimal initial wastewater concentration was determined as 5 g/L.
TI  - Rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: Results from the Surveillance of Multicenter Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (ICUs) in Taiwan are lacking. METHODS: We surveyed the MIC distribution patterns of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) of major teaching hospitals throughout Taiwan in 2007. We also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. MIC breakpoints recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute in 2014 were applied. RESULTS: Colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates but moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. cloacae. The ceftobiprole MIC90 value was 4 mug/mL for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/mL for P. aeruginosa. The phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the MIC value of ceftobiprole among S. aureus isolates. Interestingly, the proportion of isolates that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among P. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three Enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of ICU pathogens to important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens against infections in the ICU.
TI  - Utilization of blood cultures in Danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  - This national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (BCs). A primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. From the Danish Microbiology Database, we retrieved all BCs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the National Patient Registry. In total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one BC was taken. Almost 50% of BCs were taken at admission. The chance of having a BC taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. Data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one BC was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. Ten species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. An increase in BCs and positive BCs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. BCs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for S. pneumoniae particularly. A predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to S. aureus, E. faecium and K. pneumoniae. Minor differences in BCs and positive BCs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. The study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.
TI  - In vitro fermentation of fructooligosaccharides with human gut bacteria.
AB  - Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are one of the most studied prebiotics, selectively  stimulating the growth of health-promoting bacteria in the host. However, there is increasing evidence that commensal gut bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium butyricum, Enterobacter cloacae, and even the pathogenic Escherichia coli BEN2908, are also able to metabolize FOS in vitro, and in some cases, FOS displayed adverse effects. Therefore, it is necessary to identify FOS-metabolizing species that are present in the gut. Unlike previous studies focusing on individual strains, this study used the traditional culture method combined with an alignment search on the gut bacteria database established from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). The alignment results showed that homologous proteins for FOS transporters and glycosidases were distributed in 237 of the 453 strains of gut bacteria. La506 msmK encoding the ATP-binding protein and Aec45 fosGH1 encoding glycoside hydrolase were most widely distributed, in 155 and 55 strains, respectively. Seven of eight strains with both transporters and glycosidases were proven to be capable of metabolizing FOS, while five strains without either transporters or glycosidases were not. Fifteen species isolated from human feces and 11 species from the alignment search were identified to be FOS-metabolizing, of which Cronobacter sakazakii, Marvinbryantia formatexigens, Ruminococcus gnavus, and Weissella paramesenteroides are reported here for the first time. Thus, alignment search combined with the culture method is an effective method for obtaining a global view of the FOS-metabolizing bacteria in the gut and will be helpful in further investigating the relationship between FOS and human gut bacteria.
TI  - [Antiadhesive potencial of Rhodococcus erythropolis IMB Ac-5017 biosurfactants].
AB  - The effect of Rhodococcus erythropolis IMB Ac-5017 biosurfactants (surface-active substances, SAS) with different degree of purification on attachment of bacteria (Escherichia coli IEM-1, Bacillus subtilis BT-2, Proteus vulgaris BT-1, Staphylococcus aureus BMC-1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa P-55, Enterobacter cloacae AC-22, Erwinia aroidaeae B-433), yeasts (Candida albicans D-6) and fungi (Aspergillus niger P-3, Fusarium culmorum T-7) to the abiotic surfaces (glass, plastic, ceramics, steel, linoleum) was studied. The dependence of microorganisms adhesion on degree of SAS purification (supernatant, purified SAS solution), SAS concentration (0,04-1,25 mg/ml), type of surface and test-cultures was established. The adhesion of majority investigated bacterial cells after treatment of abiotic surfaces with supernatant of cultural liquid with SAS concentration 0,06-0,25 mg/ml was on the average 20-45, yeasts C. albicans D-6--30-75% and was less than that purified SAS solution with the same concentration. Higher antiadhesive activity of supernatant as compared to purified SAS solution testifies to possibility of exception of the expensive stage of isolation and purification at obtaining of preparations with antiadhesive properties.
TI  - High prevalence of CTX-M-15 and first report of CTX-M-3, CTX-M-22, CTX-M-28 and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae causing urinary tract infections in Bosnia and Herzegovina in hospital and community settings.
AB  - AIM: To investigate molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase/ESBL and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase/pAmpC producing Gram-negative bacteria causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Zenica-Doboj Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the period Decembar 2009-May 2010. METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disc diffusion and broth microdilution according to CLSI guidelines. Double-disk synergy test was performed in order to screen for ESBLs/pAmpC beta-lactamases. PCR was used to detect bla(ESBL)/bla(ampC)/bla(carb) genes. Genetic relatedness of the strains was determined by pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: Among 85 patients with UTIs caused by ESBL producing isolates, 44 (51.8%) were from in-patients and 41 (48.2%) from outpatients. Klebsiella spp. was the most frequently isolated from in-patients, in 28 (63.6%) cases. Among outpatients, Klebsiella spp./Escherichia coli were the most frequently isolated, in 19 (46.3%)/16 (39.0%) cases. Twenty-one (75.0%) from hospital and nine (47.4%) from outpatient Klebsiella spp. isolates were positive for blaTEM, whereas 27 (96.4%) from in-patients and 6 (31.6%) from outpatient were bla(CTX-M) positive (18 hospital and five outpatient isolates were encoding bla(CTX-M-15)). One Klebsiella oxytoca and one Enterobacter cloacae inpatient isolates were positive for blaCTX-M-28. One Klebsiella pneumoniae outpatient isolate were positive for bla(CTX-M-22) and one E. coli for bla(CTX-M-3). One hospital Proteus mirabilis strain was positive for bla(CMY-2) and two Klebsiella spp. strains for blaDHA-1, whereas two E. coli, one K. oxytoca and one Proteus vulgaris outpatient strains were positive for bla(CMY-2). CONCLUSION: Identification of bla(CTX-M-3), bla(CTX-M-22) and bla(CTX-M-28) among Enterobacteriaceae is uncommon. In this study we report the emergency of CMY-2 and DHA-1 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.
TI  - Enterobacteriaceae Sepsis Outcome Programme annual report, 2013.
AB  - The Australian Group on Antimicrobial Resistance performs regular period-prevalence studies to monitor changes in antimicrobial resistance in selected enteric Gram-negative pathogens. The 2013 survey focussed for the first time on blood stream infections. Four thousand nine hundred and fifty-eight Enterobacteriaceae species were tested using commercial automated methods (Vitek(R) 2, BioMerieux; Phoenix, BD). The results were analysed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints (January 2014). Of the key resistances, non-susceptibility to the third-generation cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, was found in 7.5%/7.5% (CLSI/EUCAST criteria respectively) of Escherichia coli; 6.3%/6.3% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 7.4%/7.4% of K. oxytoca. Non-susceptibility rates to ciprofloxacin were 10.3%/11.3% for E. coli, 4.6%/7.5% for K. pneumoniae, 0.6%/0.6% for K. oxytoca, and 3.6%/6.1% in Enterobacter cloacae. Resistance rates to piperacillin-tazobactam were 3.1%/6.2%, 4.2%/7.0%, 11.9% /12.6%, and 17.3% /22.2% for the same 4 species respectively. Fourteen isolates were shown to harbour a carbapenemase gene, 9 blaIMP, 3 blaKPC, and 2 blaNDM.
TI  - Carbapenem susceptibility among Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae isolates obtained from patients in intensive care units in Taiwan in 2005, 2007, and 2009.
AB  - To investigate the evolutionary trends in non-susceptibility of carbapenems against the isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) of major teaching hospitals throughout Taiwan during 2005-2009, we applied the breakpoints of MICs recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing in 2013. Escalations in imipenem MIC levels for overall E. coli and E. cloacae isolates and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae isolates were noted during this period. The overall MIC levels against imipenem and meropenem for subgroups of ESBL producers of 3 Enterobacteriaceae species were significantly higher than those of respective overall groups in 2007 and 2009. Compared with meropenem, we found that significant evidence of imipenem MIC creep and evidence of extraordinarily high rates of non-susceptibility to ertapenem among isolates of 3 species in 2009 existed. The prominent rises in rates of ertapenem non-susceptibility for ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae during 2005-2009 and rate of ESBL positivity for E. cloacae between 4 years were notably found. Based on our findings, ertapenem should be used cautiously in management of the ICU infections caused by these potentially ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates in Taiwan.
TI  - In vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  - Pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. Bacterial isolates from the 2013 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (DFI) and Gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth. The MIC50 and MIC90 against all organisms tested from DFI were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MIC values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. Pexiganan MIC values among Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. Pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or P. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. Decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against S. aureus or E. faecium. Enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (MIC, 32 to 256 mug/ml). The "all organism" MIC90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.
TI  - Drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  - Puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. Bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in Bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). The most common species was Escherichia coli (n=98), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (n=54), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), Proteus mirabilis (n=32), Staphylococcus aureus (n=27), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and Enterobacter cloacae (n=21). S. aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while E. coli, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for Enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blaCTX-M-1 group beta-lactamases. The CTX-M gene in E. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blaCTX-M-15, and phylogroup B2 isolates with blaCTX-M-15 were classified into ST131 with O25b allele, harboring aac(6')-Ib-cr and various virulence factors. Carbapenemase genes blaNDM-1 and blaNDM-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup A E. coli. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates had type IV or V SCCmec, including isolates of ST361 (CC672), which is related to an emerging ST672 clone in the Indian subcontinent. This study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in Bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.
TI  - Emergence of New Sequence Type OXA-48 Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae  in Kuwait.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the infections due to OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing bacteria in tertiary hospitals in Kuwait (September 2011 to April 2013) and to determine the sequence types (STs) of the corresponding isolates. Eleven OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were recovered from patients treated in nine different hospitals in Kuwait. Susceptibility testing to eighteen antibiotics was done using the E-test. PCR assays were performed for the detection of genes encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) (blaCTX-M, blaSHV, and blaTEM) and carbapenemases (blaOXA-48, blaVIM, blaNDM, blaIMP, blaGIM, and blaKPC). STs were determined by Multilocus Sequence Typing. Seven Klebsiella pneumoniae, two Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter cloacae, and one Morganella morganii harbored the blaOXA-48 gene. The K. pneumoniae and E. coli belonged to seven and two different STs, respectively, which were not related to those reported from this region. The majority of the isolates carried either blaCTX-M or blaSHV genes and showed a multidrug-resistant phenotype, including resistance to tigecycline. Multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae harboring the blaOXA-48 gene are emerging in Kuwait with different STs compared to those identified in other countries of the region. Detection of OXA-48-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Kuwait is important to prevent its rapid spread.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - Evolution of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae at the global and national level: what should be expected in the future?
AB  - In recent years, Enterobacteriaceae isolates have increased their potential to become highly drug resistant by acquiring resistance to carbapenems, primarily due to the production of acquired carbapenemases. The carbapenemases detected in Enterobacteriaceae are largely of the KPC, VIM, NDM, IMP and OXA-48 types. Although the epidemiological origin and geographic distribution of carbapenemases are clearly different, they all first appeared in the late 20th Century. Only a decade later, these enzymes have already become established and have expanded globally. An important epidemiological change has occurred in Spain in recent years, characterized by a rapid increase in the number of cases of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), causing both nosocomial outbreaks and single infections. The impact of CPE in Spain is primarily due to OXA-48-producing and VIM-1-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, although other species such as Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae are also increasing. The emergence of CPE as a cause of community-onset infections is a matter of great concern. Taking into account recent experience, and considering the fact that increasing numbers of patients are becoming infected by CPE and reservoirs of carbapenemases are growing globally, the trend of the CPE epidemic points toward a rise in its incidence. To prevent a massive CPE pandemic, a well-coordinated response from all health professionals and national and supranational authorities is clearly needed.
TI  - Activity of eravacycline against Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii,  including multidrug-resistant isolates, from New York City.
AB  - Eravacycline demonstrated in vitro activity against a contemporary collection of  more than 4,000 Gram-negative pathogens from New York City hospitals, with MIC50/MIC90 values, respectively, for Escherichia coli of 0.12/0.5 mug/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae of 0.25/1 mug/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes of 0.25/1 mug/ml, Enterobacter cloacae 0.5/1 mug/ml, and Acinetobacter baumannii of 0.5/1 mug/ml. Activity was retained against multidrug-resistant isolates, including those expressing KPC and OXA carbapenemases. For A. baumannii, eravacycline MICs correlated with increased expression of the adeB gene.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of characterized beta-lactamase-producing strains tested  with avibactam combinations.
AB  - Avibactam, a broad-spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitor, was tested with ceftazidime, ceftaroline, or aztreonam against 57 well-characterized Gram-negative strains producing beta-lactamases from all molecular classes. Most strains were nonsusceptible to the beta-lactams alone. Against AmpC-, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-, and KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, avibactam lowered ceftazidime, ceftaroline, or aztreonam MICs up to 2,048-fold, to </=4 mug/ml. Aztreonam-avibactam MICs against a VIM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacter cloacae and a VIM-1/KPC-3-producing Escherichia coli isolate were 0.12 and 8 mug/ml, respectively.
TI  - [Trends in antibiotic resistance in Medellin and municipalities of the Metropolitan Area between 2007 and 2012: Results of six years of surveillance].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance programs. OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in Medellin and its Metropolitan Area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using WHONET 5.6 program. For interpretation of susceptibility results, CLSI standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. Using the Epi-Info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). In Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in Klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and Enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). K. pneumoniae , S. marcescens and E. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii . CONCLUSIONS: The resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of E. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae . It is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.
TI  - Characterization of Beta-lactamases in Faecal Enterobacteriaceae Recovered from Healthy Humans in Spain: Focusing on AmpC Polymorphisms.
AB  - The intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of Enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. Several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampC genes in species of Citrobacter, Enterobacter or Escherichia genera. In this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampC beta-lactamase genes. Fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 Enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 Escherichia coli, 4 Citrobacter braakii, 9 Citrobacter freundii, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Proteus vulgaris, 1 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Serratia sp. and 1 Cronobacter sp. A high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the AmpC phenotype in 22 isolates (31 %) and the ESBL phenotype in 3 isolates. AmpC molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla CMY and bla ACT genes from Citrobacter and Enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. The prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampC genes obtained in this study was 2 %. The unique plasmid-mediated bla AmpC identified in this study was the bla CMY-2 gene, detected in an E. coli isolate ascribed to the sequence type ST405 which belonged to phylogenetic group D. The hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the ISEcp1-bla CMY-2-blc structure was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable IncK plasmid. This study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in Enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. Extensive AmpC-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.
TI  - Genetic analysis of maintenance of pEC156, a naturally occurring Escherichia coli plasmid that carries genes of the EcoVIII restriction-modification system.
AB  - In the present study the role of the mechanisms responsible for maintenance of a  natural plasmid pEC156, that carries genes of the EcoVIII restriction-modification system was investigated. Analysis of this plasmid's genetic content revealed the presence of genetic determinants suggesting two such mechanisms. The first of them relies on site specific recombination utilizing the Xer/cer molecular machinery, while the second involves a restriction-modification system as an addiction module. Our analysis indicated that three factors affect the maintenance of pEC156: (i) a cis-acting cer site involved in resolution of plasmid multimers, (ii) a gene coding for EcoVIII endonuclease, and (iii) plasmid copy number control. The lowest stability was observed with pEC156 derivatives deprived of the cer site. Decreased stability of pEC156 derivatives was also observed in E.coli strains deficient in genes coding for proteins involved in plasmid multimer resolution (XerC, XerD, ArgR and PepA). A similar effect, but to a much lesser extent was observed for the pEC156 derivative without a functional gene coding for EcoVIII endonuclease. Our results indicate that the presence of the cer site is more important for pEC156 stable maintenance than the presence of a functional gene coding for EcoVIII endonuclease. In our work we also tested maintenance of pEC156 possessing a ColE1-type replicon in bacteria belonging to Enterobacteriaceae family. We have found that pEC156 was most stably maintained in Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca representing coli-type enterobacteria. We have found that in all enterobacteria tested pEC156 derivatives deficient in the cer site were significantly less stably maintained than cer(+) variants.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime-avibactam combination in in vitro checkerboard assays.
AB  - To evaluate the in vitro effects of the combination of ceftazidime and avibactam  on the MICs of both compounds, checkerboard assays were performed for 81 clinical strains, including 55 Enterobacteriaceae strains (32 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 19 Escherichia coli, 1 Citrobacter freundii, and 3 Enterobacter cloacae) and 26 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all with known resistance mechanisms such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases, phenotypically or molecularly determined. Phenotypically ceftazidime-resistant strains (n=69) were analyzed in more detail. For the Enterobacteriaceae strains, a concentration-dependent effect of avibactam was found for most strains with a maximum effect of avibactam at a concentration of 4 mg/liter, which decreased all ceftazidime MICs to </=4 mg/liter. Avibactam alone also showed antibacterial activity (the MIC50 and MIC90 being 8 and 16 mg/liter, respectively). For the ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa strains, considerable inhibition of beta-lactamases by avibactam was acquired at a concentration of 4 mg/liter, which decreased all ceftazidime MICs except one to </=8 mg/liter (the CLSI and EUCAST susceptible breakpoint). Increasing the concentration of avibactam further decreased the MICs, resulting in a maximum effect for most strains at 8 to 16 mg/liter. In summary, for most strains, the tested addition of avibactam of 4 mg/liter restored the antibacterial activity of ceftazidime to a level comparable to that of wild-type strains, indicating full inhibition, and strains became susceptible according to the EUCAST and CLSI criteria. Based on these in vitro data, avibactam is a promising inhibitor of different beta-lactamases, including ESBLs and carbapenemases.
TI  - Microbial evaluation of sandboxes located in urban area.
AB  - This paper presents the results of a study on the degree of bacteriological pollution of sandboxes situated in fenced and unfenced housing estates located in an urban area in Olsztyn, Poland. Heterotrophic plate counts (HPC22, HPC37), Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Clostridium perfringens determined by cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods were used as indicators of the sanitary state. Their maximum number in the sand samples reached values of up to 5.4x10(7), 2.6x10(6), 3.3x10(4), 2.1x10(3), 1.8x10(4), 1.9x10(1) and 1.2x10(4)CFU/g, respectively. It was found that values of culture-independent method were two-four orders greater than those obtained by the cultivation method. Among identified Enterobacteriaceae, Pantoea spp. and Enterobacter cloacae were the most numerous, whereas Escherichia cells were detected only occasionally. Pathogenic bacteria of the genus Salmonella sp. were isolated from sandboxes also when E. coli were absent. Bacteria from Staphylococcus genus were isolated irrespective of the site and time of sampling. Additionally, the presence of molds and yeasts was studied. Maximum counts of these microorganisms amounted to 1.0x10(5) and to 3.5x10(4)CFU/g. Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria and Trichoderma genera were most numerous among molds, whereas Trichosporon was detected most frequently among yeasts. Sandboxes in the fenced housing estate and those located in the area which is not close to trees were less polluted than the sand collected from sandboxes in the unfenced housing estate. Potentially pathogenic bacteria of the genus Salmonella spp. were identified in analyzed sandboxes, also when Toxocara and E. coli were absent. It seems that assessing the contamination of children's play areas basing only on fecal bacteria counts and by monitoring number of parasites' eggs may be insufficient to evaluate microbial pollution of sandboxes and may not fully reflect their safety for children.
TI  - Prevalence and diversity of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae from marine beach waters.
AB  - A total of 1,351 Enterobacteriaceae isolates from 144 seawater samples were collected over a four-year period from three public beaches in the eastern Adriatic Sea in Croatia. Approximately 35% of the strains were multidrug-resistant. BlaESBL genes were detected in 4.2% of the isolated Enterobacteriaceae, the main species of which were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. BlaTEM-1+SHV-12 was the most dominant genotype, followed by blaCTX-M-15.Raoultella terrigena and E. intermedius simultaneously harboured blaTEM-1,blaSHV-11/12 and blaCTX-M-15. Isolate fingerprinting revealed that marine E. coli isolates were clonally related to CTX-M-producing strains from a regional university hospital. These results indicate that marine beach waters are reservoirs of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and thus constitute a public health problem with further potential to act as mediators in gene flow between marine coastal areas and clinical settings.
TI  - Enterobacteria identification and detection of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli in  a Port Complex.
AB  - The Port Complex of Maranhao (PCM) is the second largest port complex in Brazil,  receiving ships with large volumes of ballast water. To evaluate the microbiological quality of its waters, physicochemical parameters (pH and salinity), the number of coliforms (thermotolerants and totals), and the presence of enterobacterias and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli strains were analyzed. In order to identify the presence of E. coli virulence genes target regions of the stx, elt, est, aggR, CVD432, ipaH and eae nucleotide sequences were studied. The presence of totals and thermotolerants coliforms were positive. Analyzing the salinity parameter, a significant increase in total coliforms was observed during the rainy season. We identified the species Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella ozaenae, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae and Edwardsiella tarda. Out of the 51 E. coli isolated, two were positive for the elt gene and one was positive for the CVD432 sequence, features of enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative strains, respectively. This study reveals that the PCM is contaminated by enterobacteria and diarrheagenic E.coli thus providing evidence regarding the risk of these bacteria being carried by ships to other countries, and draws attention to the input of fecal bacteria brought by ships in the port waters of Maranhao.
TI  - Countrywide spread of OXA-48 carbapenemase in Lebanon: surveillance and genetic characterization of carbapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae in 10 hospitals over a one-year period.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To detect, characterize, and assess the genetic clonality of carbapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae in 10 Lebanese hospitals in 2012. METHODS: Selected Enterobacteriaceae isolates with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems were subject to phenotypic study including antibiotic susceptibility, cloxacillin effect, modified Hodge test, and activity of efflux pump inhibitor. Carbapenemase genes were detected using PCR; clonal relatedness was studied by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Out of 8717 Enterobacteriaceae isolated in 2012, 102 (1.2%) showed reduced susceptibility to carbapenems. Thirty-one (70%) of the 44 studied clinical isolates harbored blaOXA-48, including 15 Klebsiella pneumoniae, eight Escherichia coli, four Serratia marcescens, three Enterobacter cloacae, and one Morganella morganii. The majority of OXA-48 producers co-secreted an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, while one had an acquired AmpC of the ACC type. In the non-OXA-48 producers, carbapenem resistance was attributed to the production of acquired AmpC cephalosporinases of MOX or CIT type, outer membrane impermeability, and/or efflux pump overproduction. DNA fingerprints revealed that OXA-48 producers were different, except for clonal relatedness among four K. pneumoniae, two E. coli, two E. cloacae, and three S. marcescens. CONCLUSIONS: Nosocomial carbapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae are moderately spread in Lebanon and the predominant mechanism is OXA-48 production.
TI  - Antimicrobial profiles of bacterial clinical isolates from the Gabonese National  Laboratory of Public Health: data from routine activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study is one of the first to provide a picture of antimicrobial resistance for a range of bacteria and antimicrobial classes in Gabon, Central Africa. METHODS: During the year 2010, 146 urine cytology, 143 blood cultures, 107 vaginal swabs, 23 urethral swabs, and 18 other culture examinations were positives. All isolates were tested for antibiotic sensitivity. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-seven microorganisms were isolated: 210 enterobacteria, 166 staphylococci, 38 streptococci, 14 Acinetobacter, and nine Stenotrophomonas. Of the Klebsiella isolates, 18% and 30% were found to be resistant to selected third-generation cephalosporins (3CG) and fourth-generation cephalosporins (4CG), respectively. Sixty-seven percent of Escherichia coli isolates were resistant to amoxicillin with clavulanic acid. Between 3% and 30% of E. coli isolates were resistant to selected 3CG. All Enterobacter cloacae isolates were sensitive to imipenem. Resistance to quinolones/fluoroquinolones was seen in 21-50% of E. coli isolates. Twenty-six percent of E. cloacae showed resistance to ceftazidime and 37% to cefotaxime. The resistance rate to quinolones ranged between 58% and 78%. Thirty-two percent of Staphylococcus isolates were resistant to gentamicin. Low resistance rates to teicoplanin (2-4%) were observed. Thirty-seven percent of isolated Staphylococcus aureus and 61% of isolated Staphylococcus saprophyticus were resistant to both penicillin G and oxacillin. Streptococcus isolates had low resistance rates to erythromycin, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin (5%, 7%, and 14%, respectively) and were highly resistant to tetracycline, gentamicin, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (92%, 91%, and 62%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial resistance profiles seen here are of concern. To control the spread of drug-resistant bacteria, clinicians should be cognizant of their local antimicrobial resistance patterns.
TI  - Evaluation of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in an Italian setting: report from the trench.
AB  - The spread of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has recently become a matter of concern in public health, mainly due to the wide distribution of carbapenemase genes. Italy is a country considered endemic for the spread of blaKPC Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP). The aim of this study was to depict the epidemiological trend of CRE in one Italian hospital over a long period (3 years surveillance, from May 2011 to April 2014). Based on defined MIC cut-off for specific carbapenems, 164 strains isolated from 146 different patients were analyzed both phenotypically and genotypically to establish the resistance genes. Molecular typing was performed using the RAPD technique. 77 strains were demonstrated to harbor the blaKPC gene (73 KP, 4 Escherichia coli - EC), 51 strains the blaVIM gene (44 KP, 3 EC, 2 Enterobacter cloacae and 2 Klebsiella oxytoca), 8 the blaNDM gene (3 KP, 4 EC and one Providencia stuartii), 3 the blaOXA-48 gene (2 KP, 1 EC), whereas 25 out of the 164 isolates (of different genera and species) had a negative multiplex-PCR amplification for all the targets tested. 39 out of the 164 strains analyzed (23.8%) revealed discrepancies between the MICs obtained with automated instrument and gradient MICs of more than two logs of difference; the broth microdilution provided a better agreement with the results obtained with the gradient MIC. The use of RAPD allowed to distinguish different clusters, closely related, both for blaKPC and for blaVIM KP.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of Enterobacter cloacae GGT036: a furfural tolerant soil bacterium.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae is a facultative anaerobic bacterium to be an important cause of nosocomial infection. However, the isolated E. cloacae GGT036 showed higher furfural-tolerant cellular growth, compared to industrial relevant strains such as Escherichia coli and Corynebacterium glutamicum. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of E. cloacae GGT036 isolated from Mt. Gwanak, Seoul, Republic of Korea. The genomic DNA sequence of E. cloacae GGT036 will provide valuable genetic resources for engineering of industrially relevant strains being tolerant to cellular inhibitors present in lignocellulosic hydrolysates.
TI  - Extreme furfural tolerance of a soil bacterium Enterobacter cloacae GGT036.
AB  - Detoxification process of cellular inhibitors including furfural is essential for production of bio-based chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass. Here we isolated an extreme furfural-tolerant bacterium Enterobacter cloacae GGT036 from soil sample collected in Mt. Gwanak, Republic of Korea. Among isolated bacteria, only E. cloacae GGT036 showed cell growth with 35 mM furfural under aerobic culture. Compared to the maximal half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of well-known industrial strains Escherichia coli (24.9 mM furfural) and Corynebacterium glutamicum (10 mM furfural) based on the cell density, IC50 of E. cloacae GGT036 (47.7 mM) was significantly higher after 24 h, compared to E. coli and C. glutamicum. Since bacterial cell growth was exponentially inhibited depending on linearly increased furfural concentrations in the medium, we concluded that E. cloacae GGT036 is an extreme furfural-tolerant bacterium. Recently, the complete genome sequence of E. cloacae GGT036 was announced and this could provide an insight for engineering of E. cloacae GGT036 itself or other industrially relevant bacteria.
TI  - Community-onset Gram-negative Surveillance Program annual report, 2012.
AB  - The Australian Group on Antimicrobial Resistance performs regular period-prevalence studies to monitor changes in antimicrobial resistance in selected enteric Gram-negative pathogens. The 2012 survey focussed on community-onset infections, examining isolates from urinary tract infections from patients presenting to outpatient clinics, emergency departments or to community practitioners. In 2012, 2,025 Escherichia coli, 538 Klebsiella species and 239 Enterobacter species were tested using a commercial automated method (Vitek 2, BioMerieux) and results were analysed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints from January 2012. Of the key resistances, non-susceptibility to the third-generation cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, was found in 4.2% of E. coli and 4.6%-6.9% of Klebsiella spp. Non-susceptibility rates to ciprofloxacin were 6.9% for E. coli, 0.0%-3.5% for Klebsiella spp. and 0.8%-1.9% in Enterobacter spp, and resistance rates to piperacillin-tazobactam were 1.7%, 0.7%-9.2%, and 8.8%-11.4% for the same 3 groups respectively. Only 1 Enterobacter cloacae was shown to harbour a carbapenemase (IMP-4).
TI  - A five-year experience of carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae causing neonatal septicaemia: predominance of NDM-1.
AB  - Treatment of neonatal sepsis has become a challenge with the emergence of carbapenemase-producing bacteria. This study documents the trend of carbapenem susceptibility in Enterobacteriaceae that caused septicaemia in neonates over a five year period (2007-2011) and the molecular characterisation of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to carbapenems and cephalosporins. Hundred and five Enterobacteriaceae including Escherichia coli (n = 27), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 68) and Enterobacter spp. (n = 10) were isolated from blood of septicaemic neonates followed by antibiotic susceptibility tests, determination of MIC values, phenotypic and genotypic detection of beta-lactamases. Carbapenem was the most active antimicrobial tested after tigecycline. CTX-M type was the most prevalent ESBL throughout the period (82%). New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1), which is a recent addition to the carbapenemase list, was the only carbapenemase identified in our setting. Fourteen percent of the isolates possessed blaNDM-1. Carbapenem non-susceptibility was first observed in 2007 and it was due to loss of Omp F/Ompk36 in combination with the presence of ESBLs/AmpCs. NDM-1 first emerged in E. coli during 2008; later in 2010, the resistance was detected in K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae isolates. NDM-1-producing isolates were resistant to other broad-spectrum antibiotics and possessed ESBLs, AmpCs, 16S-rRNA methylases, AAC(6')-Ib-cr, bleomycin resistant gene and class 1 integron. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis of the NDM-1-producing isolates indicated that the isolates were clonally diverse. The study also showed that there was a significantly higher incidence of sepsis caused by NDM-1-harbouring isolates in the male sex, in neonates with low birth weight and neonates born at an extramural centre. However, sepsis with NDM-1-harbouring isolates did not result in a higher mortality rate. The study is the first to review the carbapenem resistance patterns in neonatal sepsis over an extended period of time. The study highlights the persistence of ESBLs (CTX-Ms) and the emergence of NDM-1 in Enterobacteriaceae in the unit.
TI  - Blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in Warsaw.
AB  - Establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. A total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of two transplantation wards of a large hospital in Warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux, France). The 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. The highest proportion were bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with Escherichia coli (61 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and Enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. The non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), Achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and Acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). Most frequent Gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). Of 77 staphylococcal strains, 56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 Staphylococcus aureus. Other Gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). Obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). Among all Enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (ESBLs). Resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of S aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples, 2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. Both were Enterococcus faecium. Resistant strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.
TI  - Clinical epidemiological study on the incidence of Escherichia coli infections in the cancer patients admitted to Surgery Department II of the Iasi Regional Oncology Institute in 2013.
AB  - The aim of study was to identify pathogens involved in hospital-acquired or community-acquired infections in patients suffering from various types of cancers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A clinical epidemiological study included a group of 355 cancer patients admitted and operated at the Surgery Department II of the Iasi Regional Oncology Institute in 2013 was performed using data from hospital statistical service and the surgery and laboratory records, then processed by epidemi ological and statistical methods. RESULTS: In cancer patients the pathogen most commonly involved in infections was E. coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter. Analysis of bacterial resistance to antibiotics of the pathogen most commonly involved revealed that of the 29 E. coli strains 22 were tested for resistance/sensitivity to ampicillin; of these, 19 strains showed resistance, and only 3 were sensitive; 14 E. coli strains of were resistant to cephalosporins and 8 sensitive; all strains tested were sensitive to carbapenems, imipenem or meropenem and polypeptides (colistin); the 10 tested strains showed resistance to monobactams (aztreonam). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was incriminated in most urinary tract infections, the other pathogens being identified sporadically. Surgical wound infections were caused mostly by E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In our study we encountered increased resistance of E. coli to penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams (aztreonam), fluoro-quinolones and tetracyclines.
TI  - Fecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in community setting in Casablanca.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of community-acquired infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) has been increasingly recognized in recent years. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of intestinal carriage of ESBL-PE in the community in Casablanca, Morocco. METHODS: During 6 months (2013), 93 fecal samples were examined for ESBL-PE. Isolates expressing an ESBL phenotype were investigated for the presence of genes encoding beta-lactamases and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance. Conjugation experiments were done to determine the mobility of ESBL genes. RESULTS: The prevalence of fecal carriage of ESBL-PE was 4.3% (4/93; 95% CI, 0.2-8.4). Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 2), Escherichia coli (n = 1), and Serratia odorifera (n = 1) were the ESBL-producing species. Four (66.7%) of these isolates were multidrug-resistant. The blaSHV-12 (n = 5) was the most frequent ESBL gene detected, followed by blaCTX-M-15 (n = 3).The non-ESBL gene detected was blaTEM-1 (n = 5). One isolate harbored the qnrB1 variant. RESULTS of conjugation experiments indicated that blaSHV-12 + blaTEM-1 + qnrB1 and blaCTX-M-15 + blaTEM-1 genes were co-transferred and that these genes were carried by a conjugative plasmid of high molecular weight (125 kb). CONCLUSION: Our results show the importance of the intestinal tract as a reservoir for ESBL-PE in the community in Morocco.
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriological characteristic of infectious purulent complications in patients after related renal transplantation].
AB  - We investigated the frequency and characteristics of infectious purulent and non-infectious complications in living related renal transplant recipients in early postoperative period. It was identified the prevalent microorganisms in urinary tract infections and its antibiotic sensitivity: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans. 182 strains of bacteria and Candida were isolated from urine of renal graft patients in early postoperative period (from 2 days to 3 months). The prevention and treatment schemes, antimicrobial drugs dosing regimen were developed. It leads to decrease the infectious complications rate.
TI  - Antimicrobial co-resistance patterns of gram-negative bacilli isolated from bloodstream infections: a longitudinal epidemiological study from 2002-2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacilli (GNB) infections poses a serious threat to public health. Few studies have analyzed co-resistance rates, defined as an antimicrobial susceptibility profile in a subset already resistant to one specific antibiotic. The epidemiologic and clinical utility of determining co-resistance rates are analyzed and discussed. METHODS: A 10-year retrospective study from 2002-2011 of bloodstream infections with GNB were analyzed from three hospitals in Greater Vancouver, BC, Canada. Descriptive statistics were calculated for antimicrobial resistance and co-resistance. Statistical analysis further described temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance, correlations of resistance between combinations of antimicrobials, and temporal trends in co-resistance patterns. RESULTS: The total number of unique blood stream isolates of GNB was 3280. Increasing resistance to individual antimicrobials was observed for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. cloacae, and P. aeruginosa. Ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli peaked in 2006 at 40% and subsequently stabilized at 29% in 2011, corresponding to decreasing ciprofloxacin usage after 2007, as assessed by defined daily dose utilization data. High co-resistance rates were observed for ceftriaxone-resistant E. coli with ciprofloxacin (73%), ceftriaxone-resistant K. pneumoniae with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (83%), ciprofloxacin-resistant E. cloacae with ticarcillin-clavulanate (91%), and piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant P. aeruginosa with ceftazidime (83%). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing antimicrobial resistance was demonstrated over the study period, which may partially be associated with antimicrobial consumption. The study of co-resistance rates in multidrug resistant GNB provides insight into the epidemiology of resistance acquisition, and may be used as a clinical tool to aid prescribing empiric antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Supporting the ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam Enterobacteriaceae breakpoint determination using humanised in vivo exposures in a thigh model.
AB  - Previous in vivo studies using a human-simulated regimen of ceftaroline/avibactam 600/600mg every 8h (q8h) showed activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-, AmpC- and KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) </= 1 mug/mL. Here we sought to determine the efficacy of this human-simulated regimen against organisms with MICs >/= 1 mug/mL to help determine a breakpoint value that would reliability predict efficacy in humans. In total, 31 isolates (1 Escherichia coli, 9 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Citrobacter koseri, 2 Serratia marcescens, 1 Klebsiella oxytoca and 8 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) with ceftaroline/avibactam MICs of 1 to 16 mug/mL were tested in a murine immunocompromised thigh infection model; 15 isolates were also tested in an immunocompetent model. Doses were given to simulate human free drug exposures of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h over 24h as a 1-h infusion by targeting the fT>MIC profile. Efficacy was evaluated as the change in log10 CFU compared with 0-h controls after 24h. Reductions in bacterial CFU in the neutropenic model were seen against a majority of isolates tested with MICs </= 4 mug/mL, where fT>MIC was >55%. More variable efficacy was seen in isolates with MICs >/= 8 mug/mL, where fT>MIC drops below 40%. Overall activity was enhanced in the immunocompetent model. The humanised regimen of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h as a 1-h infusion showed predictable efficacy against isolates with various genotypic and phenotypic profiles and MICs </= 4 mug/mL. These data provide valuable information to help determine a ceftaroline/avibactam breakpoint for Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in a Tunisian hospital.
AB  - The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes (qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD, qnrS, aac(6')-Ib-cr, qepA, and oqxAB) in a collection of 120 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing enterobacteria and to characterize them. Overall, PMQR determinants were detected in 72 (60%) isolates (20 Escherichia coli, 32 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 20 Enterobacter cloacae). PMQR frequencies were as follows: qnr genes (25.8%), oqxAB (21.6%), and aac(6')-Ib-cr variant (19.2%). Four qnr alleles were identified as qnrB1 (83.8%), qnrB4 (6.4%), qnrB2 (3.2%), and qnrS1 (6.4%). qnr genes were mainly detected in E. cloacae (50%), aac(6')-Ib-cr in E. coli (47.5%), and oqxAB in K. pneumoniae (65%). Overall, blaCTX-M-15 (90.3%) was the most prevalent blaESBL type followed by blaSHV-12 (6.4%) and blaSHV-27 (2.7%). Rates of mutations in gyrA and parC genes were 75% for E. coli, 72.8% for K. pneumoniae, and 50% for E. cloacae. Isolates with mutations in their quinolone resistance-determining regions exhibited high fluoroquinolones resistance levels compared to those with wild ones. Genetic study of PMQR-harboring isolates revealed a great genomic diversity among each Enterobacteriaceae species. Our findings indicate the high prevalence of PMQR determinants among ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from our hospital and their diffusion in various unrelated CTX-M-15-producing clones.

TI  - Single-molecule sequencing to track plasmid diversity of hospital-associated carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Public health officials have raised concerns that plasmid transfer between Enterobacteriaceae species may spread resistance to carbapenems, an antibiotic class of last resort, thereby rendering common health care-associated infections nearly impossible to treat. To determine the diversity of carbapenemase-encoding plasmids and assess their mobility among bacterial species, we performed comprehensive surveillance and genomic sequencing of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center patient population and hospital environment. We isolated a repertoire of carbapenemase-encoding Enterobacteriaceae, including multiple strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Pantoea species. Long-read genome sequencing with full end-to-end assembly revealed that these organisms carry the carbapenem resistance genes on a wide array of plasmids. K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae isolated simultaneously from a single patient harbored two different carbapenemase-encoding plasmids, indicating that plasmid transfer between organisms was unlikely within this patient. We did, however, find evidence of horizontal transfer of carbapenemase-encoding plasmids between K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, and C. freundii in the hospital environment. Our data, including full plasmid identification, challenge assumptions about horizontal gene transfer events within patients and identify possible connections between patients and the hospital environment. In addition, we identified a new carbapenemase-encoding plasmid of potentially high clinical impact carried by K. pneumoniae, E. coli, E. cloacae, and Pantoea species, in unrelated patients and in the hospital environment.
TI  - MLST reveals potentially high-risk international clones of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To perform the first multinational Enterobacter cloacae clonality study, using the MLST scheme newly developed in Japan. METHODS: The analysis included 195 rectal carriage E. cloacae isolates resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs), collected from patients in 12 hospital units across Europe and Israel. All of the isolates were typed by PFGE and 173 isolates were subjected to MLST. ESC resistance was analysed phenotypically; genes encoding ESBLs and carbapenemases were identified by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: MLST distinguished 88 STs, which correlated with the PFGE data. PFGE was more discriminatory, producing 129 pulsotypes (169 patterns). Numerous STs were observed in several countries each. The most widespread were ST66, ST78, ST108 and ST114, each having at least 10 isolates from three to five countries, diversified into multiple pulsotypes, with clusters of related isolates in one or more centres. Analysis of the STs against the MLST database revealed several epidemic clonal complexes, such as those with central genotypes ST74 (including ST78) or ST114 (including ST66). ESC resistance was equally related to overexpression of the AmpC cephalosporinase and to ESBL production. Among ESBL producers some spreading subclones were identified, including specific ST66, ST78 and ST114 pulsotypes, associated with CTX-M-15 production. Several isolates produced carbapenemase VIM-1 or KPC-2. CONCLUSIONS: Together with the information available in the MLST database, our results suggest that, like Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. cloacae harbours clonal lineages of increased epidemic potential that may be associated with resistance spread.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of Lavandula coronopifolia essential oil against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the composition of the essential oil (EO) of Lavandula coronopifolia from Morocco and to evaluate its in vitro antibacterial activity against antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from clinical infections. The antimicrobial activity was assessed by a broth micro-well dilution method using multiresistant clinical isolates of 11 pathogenic bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Klebsiella ornithinolytica, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Hafnia alvei, Salmonella spp., Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The main compounds of the oil were carvacrol (48.9%), E-caryophyllene (10.8%) and caryophyllene oxide (7.7%). The oil showed activity against all tested strains with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging between 1% and 4%. For most of the strains, the MIC value was equivalent to the minimal bactericidal concentration value, indicating a clear bactericidal effect of L. coronopifolia EO.
TI  - Trends in bacterial wound isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility in a pediatric burn hospital.
AB  - The purpose of this retrospective study was to collate data dealing with organisms cultured from the burn patients and evaluate trends in antimicrobial susceptibility. All cultures collected from each acute admission patient between 2004 and 2011 in the 30-bed pediatric burn hospital were evaluated for their annual frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility. Duplicate cultures were excluded. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (25% of total isolates; range, 69-408 isolates/yr), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%; range, 40-202 isolates/yr), coagulase-negative staphylococci (9%; range, 2-188 isolates/yr), Enterobacter cloacae (8%; range, 22-128 isolates/yr), and Escherichia coli (6%; range, 19-91 isolates/yr). This rank order remained relatively consistent during the period of study. The emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus increased from 20% in 2004 to about 45% in 2009 to 2011. Susceptibility to vancomycin was still 100%. In comparing periods 2004 to 2007 and 2008 to 2011, P. aeruginosa showed increased susceptibility to cefepime (from 76% to 84%) and the aminoglycosides (from 68% to 81%), whereas susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam remained high (from 91% to 93%). E. cloacae demonstrated 90 to 100% susceptibility to aminoglycosides, cefepime, and imipenem. E. coli showed an increased rate of resistance to ceftazidime but was still susceptible to imipenem and amikacin. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa continue to be the most prevalent organisms cultured from our pediatric burn population. Almost half of the staphylococcal isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Despite widespread use of piperacillin-tazobactam, P. aeruginosa susceptibility remained high. Several classes of antimicrobials continued to demonstrate good to excellent activity against the majority of organisms cultured from the burn patients.
TI  - Genetic and kinetic characterization of the novel AmpC beta-lactamases DHA-6 and  DHA-7.
AB  - During a Spanish surveillance study, two natural variants of DHA beta-lactamases, DHA-6 and DHA-7, were found, with the replacements Ala226Thr and Phe322Ser, respectively, with respect to DHA-1. The DHA-6 and DHA-7 enzymes were isolated from Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae clinical isolates, respectively. The aim of this study was to genetically, microbiologically, and biochemically characterize the DHA-6 and DHA-7 beta-lactamases. The blaDHA-6 and blaDHA-7 genes were located in the I1 and HI2 incompatibility group plasmids of 87.3 and 310.4 kb, respectively. The genetic contexts of blaDHA-6 and blaDHA-7 were similar to that already described for the blaDHA-1 gene and included the qnrB4 and aadA genes. The MICs for cephalothin, aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime were 8- to 32-fold lower for DHA-6 than for DHA-1 or DHA-7 expressed in the same isogenic E. coli TG1 strain. Interestingly, the MIC for cefoxitin was higher in the DHA-6-expressing transformant than in DHA-1 or DHA-7. Biochemical studies with pure beta-lactamases revealed slightly lower catalytic efficiencies of DHA-6 against cephalothin, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime than those of DHA-1 and DHA-7. To understand this behavior, stability experiments were carried out and showed that the DHA-6 protein displayed significantly higher stability than the DHA-1 and DHA-7 enzymes. The proximity of Thr226 to the N terminus in the tertiary protein structure in DHA-6 may promote this stabilization and, consequently, may induce a slight reduction in the dynamic of this enzyme that primarily affects the hydrolysis of some of the bulkiest antibiotics.
TI  - ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in environmental water in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
AB  - Pathogens encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes represent a threat for failure of empirical antibiotic therapy and are associated with high mortality, morbidity and expenses. We examined surface water in Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh and isolated ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae, suggesting the potential role of water for the dissemination and transmission of resistant genes among microorganisms. E. coli found most prevalent among isolated Enterobacteriaceae from environmental water. Molecular and genetic analysis revealed CTX-M-type and SHV-type ESBL genes in isolates that may influence the spread of multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria causing human and animal infections in Bangladesh.
TI  - Interspecies transfer of blaIMP-4 in a patient with prolonged colonization by IMP-4-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - A patient was colonized by IMP-4-producing Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli strains for 7 months. IMP-4-producing E. cloacae strains were first and last isolated at day 33 and at 8 months after admission, respectively. IMP-4-producing E. coli strains were first and last isolated at days 88 and 181 after admission, respectively. The E. cloacae and E. coli isolates shared identical genetic features in terms of blaIMP-4, blaTEM-1, qnrB2, aacA4, HI2 plasmids, and ISCR1. This study shows the first prolonged colonization with in vivo interspecies transfer of blaIMP-4.
TI  - French regional surveillance program of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli: results from a 2-year period.
AB  - In February 2011, the CARB-LR group was created as a sentinel laboratory-based surveillance network to control the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (CR GNB) in a French Southern Region. We report the epidemiological results of a 2-year study. All the Gram-negative bacilli isolates detected in the different labs (hospital and community settings) of a French Southern Region and with reduced susceptibility to ertapenem and/or imipenem were characterised with regard to antibiotic resistance, bla genes content, repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) profiles and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). A total of 221 strains were analysed. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most prevalent carbapenemase-producing bacteria, with a majority of OXA-23 producers (n = 37). One isolate co-produced OXA-23 and OXA-58 enzymes. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) (OXA-48 producer: n = 29, KPC producer: n = 1), followed by Escherichia coli (OXA-48 producer: n = 8, KPC producer: n = 1) and Enterobacter cloacae (OXA-48 producer, n = 1). One isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa produced a VIM-1 carbapenemase. A clonal diversity of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli was noted with different MLSTs. On the other hand, almost all OXA-23-producing A. baumannii strains belonged to the widespread ST2/international clone II. The link between the detection of CR GNB and a foreign country was less obvious, suggesting the beginning of a local cross-transmission. The number of CR GNB cases in our French Southern Region has sharply increased very recently due to the diffusion of OXA-48 producers.
TI  - Antibiotic consumption and its influence on the resistance in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics is one of the most serious problems in current medicine. An important factor contributing to the growing prevalence of multiresistant bacteria is application of antibiotics. This study aimed at analyzing the development of resistance of Enterobacteriaceae to selected beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotics in the University Hospital Olomouc and assessing the effect of selection pressure of these antibiotics. METHODS: For the period between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2011, resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides was retrospectively studied. For the assessment of selection pressure of antibiotics, a parameter of defined daily dose in absolute annual consumption (DDDatb) based on the ATC/DDD classification and in relative annual consumption (RDDDatb) as the number of defined daily doses per 100 bed-days was used. The relationship between frequency of strains resistant to a particular antibiotic and antibiotic consumption was assessed by linear regression analysis using Spearman's correlation. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 113,027 isolates from the Enterobacteriaceae family were analyzed. There was a significant effect of selection pressure of the primary antibiotic in the following cases: piperacillin/tazobactam in Klebsiella pneumoniae, gentamicin in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli and amikacin in Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Also, there was significant correlation between resistance to ceftazidime and consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. No relationship was found between consumption of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and resistance to ceftazidime or between fluoroquinolone consumption and resistance to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The study showed the effects of both direct and indirect selection pressure on increasing resistance to gentamicin, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. Given the fact that no correlation was found between resistance to fluoroquinolones and consumption of either primary or secondary antibiotics, we assume that the increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones is probably due to circulation of resistance genes in the bacterial population and that this resistance was not affected by reduced use of these antibiotics.
TI  - Multiresistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae from humans, companion animals and horses in central Hesse, Germany.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are an emerging problem in human and veterinary medicine. This study focused on comparative molecular characterization of beta-lactamase and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from central Hesse in Germany. Isolates originated from humans, companion animals (dogs and cats) and horses. RESULTS: In this study 153 (83.6%) of the human isolates (n = 183) and 163 (91.6%) of the animal isolates (n = 178) were confirmed as ESBL producers by PCR and subsequent sequencing of the PCR amplicons. Predominant ESBL subtypes in human and animal samples were CTX-M-15 (49.3%) and CTX-M-1 (25.8%) respectively. Subtype blaCTX-M-2 was found almost exclusively in equine and was absent from human isolates. The carbapenemase OXA-48 was detected in 19 ertapenem-resistant companion animal isolates in this study. The Plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance (PMQR) gene aac('6)-Ib-cr was the most frequently detected antibiotic- resistance gene present in 27.9% of the human and 36.9% of the animal ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates. Combinations of two or up to six different resistance genes (penicillinases, ESBLs and PMQR) were detected in 70% of all isolates investigated. The most frequent species in this study was Escherichia coli (74%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.5%), and Enterobacter cloacae (4.2%). Investigation of Escherichia coli phylogenetic groups revealed underrepresentation of group B2 within the animal isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Isolates from human, companion animals and horses shared several characteristics regarding presence of ESBL, PMQR and combination of different resistance genes. The results indicate active transmission and dissemination of multi-resistant Enterobacteriaceae among human and animal populations.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from Pakistan.
AB  - The molecular epidemiology of 66 NDM-producing isolates from 2 Pakistani hospitals was investigated, with their genetic relatedness determined using repetitive sequence-based PCR (Rep-PCR). PCR-based replicon typing and screening for antibiotic resistance genes encoding carbapenemases, other beta-lactamases, and 16S methylases were also performed. Rep-PCR suggested a clonal spread of Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli. A number of plasmid replicon types were identified, with the incompatibility A/C group (IncA/C) being the most common (78%). 16S methylase-encoding genes were coharbored in 81% of NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Towards rapid on-site phage-mediated detection of generic Escherichia coli in water using luminescent and visual readout.
AB  - Wild-type T4 bacteriophage and recombinant reporter lac Z T4 bacteriophage carrying the beta-galactosidase gene were used for detection of generic Escherichia coli by monitoring the release of beta-galactosidase upon phage-mediated cell lysis. The reaction was performed on a paper-based portable culture device to limit the diffusion of reagents and, hence, increase the sensitivity of the assay, and to avoid handling large sample volumes, making the assay suitable for on-site analysis. Chromogenic (chlorophenol red-beta-D-galactopyranoside, CPRG) and bioluminescent (6-O-beta-galactopyranosyl-luciferin, Beta-Glo((R))) beta-galactosidase substrates were tested in the assay. Water samples were first filtered through 0.45-mum pore size filters to concentrate bacteria. The filters were then placed into the paper-based device containing nutrient medium and incubated at 37 degrees C for 4 h. Bacteriophage with the respective indicator substrate was added to the device, and signal (color, luminescence) development was recorded with a digital camera, luminometer, or luminescence imaging device. It was demonstrated that as low as 40 or <10 colony-forming units (cfu) ml(-1) of E. coli can be detected visually within 8 h when wild-type T4 bacteriophage or recombinant lacZ T4 bacteriophage were used in the assay, respectively. Application of the bioluminescent beta-galactosidase substrate allowed reliable detection of <10 cfu ml(-1) within 5.5 h. The specificity of the assay was demonstrated using a panel of microorganisms including Aeromonas hydrophila, Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli, and Salmonella Typhimurium.
TI  - Incidence rates of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates in France: a prospective nationwide study in 2011-12.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine proportions and incidence rates of Enterobacteriaceae producing carbapenemase among those non-susceptible (NS) to carbapenems in France. METHODS: From November 2011 to April 2012, 71 laboratories recorded non-duplicate Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates NS to at least one carbapenem and the total number of isolates of the different species. Carbapenem MICs were determined by broth microdilution and the beta-lactamase content by DNA microarray. RESULTS: During the study period, the 71 laboratories identified 133 244 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, of which 846 (0.63%) were NS to at least one carbapenem. Carbapenem-NS isolates accounted for 0.07% (61/90 148) among Escherichia coli isolates, 1.1% (111/10 436) among Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8.2% (492/5971) among Enterobacter cloacae and 4.0% (84/2104) among Enterobacter aerogenes. Among the 541 available carbapenem-NS isolates, 222 (including 63 randomly selected E. cloacae) were further analysed after confirmation of carbapenem non-susceptibility. None of the Enterobacter spp. isolates produced carbapenemase. Among the other species, 28 isolates produced carbapenemases (22 OXA-48, 4 KPC and 2 NDM), accounting for an estimated proportion of carbapenemase-producing isolates of 0.08% for all species, 0.01% for E. coli and 0.27% for K. pneumoniae. The incidence-density rate in the participating hospitals was 0.0041 per 1000 hospital-days and the incidence rate was 0.0027 per 100 admissions. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence-density rate of carbapenemase-producing isolates per 1000 hospital-days was low and 30-fold lower than that of carbapenem-NS isolates (0.125) and almost 300-fold lower than that of ESBL-producing isolates (1.104) in these French hospitals.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates in aerobic gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in Vietnam: report from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART 2009-2011).
AB  - Treatment options for multidrug-resistant pathogens remain problematic in many regions and individual countries, warranting ongoing surveillance and analysis. Limited antimicrobial susceptibility information is available for pathogens from Vietnam. This study determined the bacterial susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative pathogens of intra-abdominal infections among patients in Vietnam during 2009-2011. A total of 905 isolates were collected from 4 medical centers in this investigation as part of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends. Antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) rates among the appropriate species were determined by a central laboratory using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methods. Among the species collected, Escherichia coli (48.1% ESBL-positive) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (39.5% ESBL-positive) represented the majority (46.4%) of the isolates submitted for this study. Ertapenem MIC90 values were lowest for these 2 species at 0.12 and 0.25mug/mL and remained unchanged for ESBL-positive isolates. Imipenem MIC90 values were also the same for all isolates and ESBL-positive strains at 0.25 and 0.5mug/mL, respectively. Ertapenem MIC90 values for additional species with sufficient numbers for analysis, including Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 1, 0.06, >4, and >4mug/mL, respectively. Analysis of beta-lactamases in a subset of 132 phenotypically ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae demonstrated that CTX-M variants, particularly CTX-M-27 and CTX-M-15, were the predominant enzymes. High resistance rates in Vietnam hospitals dictate continuous monitoring as antimicrobial inactivating enzymes continue to spread throughout Asia and globally.
TI  - Preparation of melt-spun antimicrobially modified LDH/polyolefin nanocomposite fibers.
AB  - Layered double hydroxide (LDH) was synthesized and organically modified with camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) and ciprofloxacin. The thermal stability of CSA was improved remarkably under LDH shielding. A minimal inhibitory concentration of free CSA against tested bacteria was determined in order to define the essential quantity in LDH modification. The modified LDHs were melt-compounded with high density polyethylene and the prepared nanocomposites were further melt-spun using a piston-type spinning device. The melt-spun fibers were tested for their antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. CSA integrated fibers show susceptibility against Gram-positive bacteria and ciprofloxacin integrated fibers showed activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - A survey of five broad-host-range plasmids in gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To learn the prevalence of the primary classical broad-host-range (BHR) IncA/C, IncN, IncP, IncQ, and IncW plasmids in dominant gram-negative bacilli from inpatients in a teaching hospital in southern China. METHODS: A multiplex polymerase chain reaction based on the replicons of BHR IncA/C, IncN, IncP, IncQ, and IncW plasmids was developed and used to determine these BHR plasmids. The difference in prevalence rates among the different species from three specimens was evaluated by a binary logistic regression model and the differences between multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) and non-MDRO were assessed using a chi-square test. RESULTS: The average positive detection percentages of the replicons were 4.3%, 3.7%, 3.0%, 2.6%, and 1.9%, respectively, for IncN, IncP, IncQ, IncW, and IncA/C in descending order. The distribution of all five BHR plasmids did not differ significantly between specimens collected from wounds and urine, although both were significantly higher than those of sputum. The prevalence rates of all five BHR plasmids in MDROs were significantly higher than those in non-MDRO for Enterobacteriaceae; however, no significant difference was seen in non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB). CONCLUSIONS: BHR IncA/C, IncN, IncP, IncQ, and IncW plasmids, which occur more often in bacilli from wound and urine specimens than those of sputum, are widespread in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from inpatients. The prevalence rates in MDRO are higher than those in non-MDRO for Enterobacteriaceae but not significantly different for NFGNB.
TI  - Rapid detection of bacteria in green tea using a novel pretreatment method in a bioluminescence assay.
AB  - Tea is one of the most popular beverages consumed in the world, and green tea has become a popular beverage in Western as well as Asian countries. A novel pretreatment method for a commercial bioluminescence assay to detect bacteria in green tea was developed and evaluated in this study. Pretreatment buffers with pH levels ranging from 6.0 to 9.0 were selected from MES (morpholineethanesulfonic acid), HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid), or Tricine buffers. To evaluate the effect of pretreatment and the performance of the assay, serially diluted cultures of Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus were tested. The improved methods, which consisted of a pretreatment of the sample in alkaline buffer, significantly decreased the background bioluminescence intensity of green tea samples when compared with the conventional method. Pretreatment with alkaline buffers with pH levels ranging from 8.0 to 9.0 increased the bioluminescence intensities of cultures of E. cloacae and S. aureus. Strong log-linear relationships between the bioluminescence intensities and plate counts emerged for the tested strains. Furthermore, the microbial detection limit was 15 CFU in 500 ml of bottled green tea after an 8-h incubation at 35 degrees C and an assay time of 1 h. The results showed that contaminated samples could be detected within 1 h of operation using our improved bioluminescence assay. This method could be used to test for contamination during the manufacturing process as well as for statistical sampling for quality control.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of gram-negative bacilli isolated from pediatric patients with nosocomial bloodstream infections in a Mexican tertiary care hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-negative bacilli are the most common bacteria causing nosocomial bloodstream infections (NBSIs) in Latin American countries. METHODS: The antibiotic resistance profiles of Gram-negative bacilli isolated from blood cultures in pediatric patients with NBSIs over a 3-year period in a tertiary care pediatric hospital in Mexico City were determined using the VITEK-2 system. Sixteen antibiotics were tested to ascertain the resistance rate and the minimum inhibitory concentration using the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth micro-dilution method as a reference. RESULTS: A total of 931 isolates were recovered from 847 clinically significant episodes of NBSI. Of these, 477 (51.2%) were caused by Gram-negative bacilli. The most common Gram-negative bacilli found were Klebsiella pneumoniae (30.4%), Escherichia coli (18.9%), Enterobacter cloacae (15.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.9%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (4.6%). More than 45 and 60% of the K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates, respectively, were resistant to cephalosporins, and 64% of the E. coli isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones. A. baumannii exhibited low rates of resistance to antibiotics tested. In the E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa isolates, no rates of resistance higher than 38% were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that the proportion of NBSIs due to antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing in a tertiary care pediatric hospital of Mexico.
TI  - Detection of multiple potentially pathogenic bacteria in Matang mangrove estuaries, Malaysia.
AB  - The deltaic estuarine system of the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve of Malaysia is a site where several human settlements and brackish water aquaculture have been established. Here, we evaluated the level of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the surface water and sediments. Higher levels of FIB were detected at downstream sampling sites from the fishing village, indicating it as a possible source of anthropogenic pollution to the estuary. Enterococci levels in the estuarine sediments were higher than in the surface water, while total coliforms and E. coli in the estuarine sediments were not detected in all samples. Also, various types of potentially pathogenic bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae were isolated. The results indicate that the Matang estuarine system is contaminated with various types of potential human bacterial pathogens which might pose a health risk to the public.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility and distribution of beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae causing intra-abdominal infections in North America 2010-2011.
AB  - The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends has been monitoring the  activity of antimicrobials indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections since 2004. This report documents the in vitro activity of several recommended antimicrobials against 3449 gram-negative bacilli isolated from the 30 and 25 participating sites in North America in 2010-2011, respectively, and characterizes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) identified in ESBL-positive and ertapenem-non-susceptible isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Morganella morgannii were the most common species isolated. The incidence of beta-lactamase production was 8.8% and 8.9% for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Overall the most active antimicrobials were amikacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and ertapenem, although beta-lactamase production reduced the activity of most agents. Characterization of beta-lactamase genes determined that bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), bla(AmpC), and bla(KPC) were commonly found in most beta-lactamase-positive isolates.

TI  - [The genotype and epidemiological feature of the Enterobacteriaceae carrying carbapenemase in China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the genotype and molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. METHOD: A total of 201 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 14 hospitals in 11 cities. The MICs of 14 antimicrobial drugs were detected using agar dilution method. Phenotypes of carbapenemase were screened using modified Hodge test and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) test. Drug resistance genes were screened using PCR method. The strains carrying carbapenem resistance genes were confirmed by conjugation test. Homology analysis was carried out using pulsed-field gel electro-phoresis (PFGE) method and the epidemiological correlation is analyzed based on the Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) method in order to study the molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. RESULTS: Fifty-three strains among 201 carbapenem-insensitive Enterobacteriaceae were detected positive carbapenem-resistant genes, among which included 33 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Citrobacter freundii, 6 Escherichia coli and 5 Enterobacter cloacae. Among the 53 strains, 43 were from Beijing, 6 strains from Hangzhou, 3 strains from Nanjing and one from Fuzhou. Resistance genes-harboring plasmids were successfully transferred from 28 of 53 strains to Escherichia coli EC600. The PFGE spectrum showed that 33 Klebsiella pneumoniae were classified into three types, 9 Citrobacter freundii classified into four types, 5 Enterobacter cloacae classified into four types, while 6 Escherichia coli were the same type. Based on the results of MLST test, 29 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing KPC-2 type carbapenemase were all ST11, while among the four Klebsiella pneumonia carrying IMP-4 carbapenem resistant gene, three strains were ST876, one was ST147. CONCLUSIONS: Carbapenem-resistant genes were detected only in hospitals from Beijing, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Fuzhou, and type KPC-2 was the most common, followed by IMP-4 and IMP-8. High homology of resistant strains could be related to horizontal transfer of carbapenemase genes, which should cause great concern.
TI  - Mix and match of KPC-2 encoding plasmids in Enterobacteriaceae-comparative genomics.
AB  - We performed comparative sequence analysis of 3 blaKPC-2 encoding plasmids to examine evolution of these plasmids and their dissemination. We found that all of them have an IncN replicon with a newly determined IncN plasmid sequence type (ST), ST15. The 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPN) plasmids also harbor an IncF2A1-B1- replicon. The blaKPC-2 is located in the Tn4401c transposon with a newly discovered mutation in the P2 promoter. Screening of the 27 additional blaKPC-2 carrying plasmids from Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli (EC), and K. pneumoniae showed that: all KPN and EC plasmids are IncN plasmids belonging to ST15; 4/7 KPN and 1/6 EC plasmids contain an additional IncF2A1-B1- replicon; all Enterobacter plasmids belong to neither IncN nor IncF2A1-B1- replicon plasmids; 6/7 KPN and 2/5 EC plasmids carry the mutated P2 promoter. Study of the blaKPC-2 environment, transposon, pMLST, and Inc group suggests transposon and plasmid inter- and intra-species dissemination and evolution.
TI  - [Comparison of routine use of two chromogenic media ChromID CPS (bioMerieux) and  UriSelect4 (Bio-Rad) for the detection of Escherichia coli and major uropathogenics in urine].
AB  - Escherichia coli is the most common bacterial cause of urinary tract infections.  Its rapid and specific identification in urine samples represents a major challenge within the rendering results and optimizing the management of the patient. We aimed to compare the sensitivity and specificity of two commercially available chromogenic media for E. coli: ChromID CPS (Biomerieux) and UriSelect4 (Bio(-)Rad), without carrying out further tests. 99 consecutive and non-redundant urine samples considered to be infected were simultaneously plated onto blood agar and the two chromogenic media. Colony color and bacterial growth quantification were compared 18 and 48 hours after incubation. Bacteria were identified with mass spectrometry. A complementary analysis on 80 bacterial strains known to pose potential identification problems was performed. 43 urines samples grew E. coli, and 42 of them were pink-colored on the two chromogenic mediums, as expected (sensibility=97.7%). Growth quantification was significantly greater on blood agar than on chromogenic media (p<0.001).We noted specificity issues at the complementary analysis with the UriSelect4 medium: Citrobacter freundii and some strains of Citrobacter brakii, Enterobacter cloacae and Hafnia alvei were pink-colored, and could be misidentified as E. coli. ChromID CPS medium did not show such misidentification. In conclusion, the agar ChromID CPS proved to be greater than the UriSelect4 agar in our work in terms of specificity of direct identification of E. Coli, without the use of additional test.
TI  - Understanding the broad substrate repertoire of nitroreductase based on its kinetic mechanism.
AB  - The oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase from Enterobacter cloacae (NR) catalyzes two-electron reduction of nitroaromatics to the corresponding nitroso compounds and, subsequently, to hydroxylamine products. NR has an unusually broad substrate repertoire, which may be related to protein dynamics (flexibility) and/or a simple non-selective kinetic mechanism. To investigate the possible role of mechanism in the broad substrate repertoire of NR, the kinetics of oxidation of NR by para-nitrobenzoic acid (p-NBA) were investigated using stopped-flow techniques at 4 degrees C. The results revealed a hyperbolic dependence on the p-NBA concentration with a limiting rate of 1.90 +/- 0.09 s(-1), indicating one-step binding before the flavin oxidation step. There is no evidence for a distinct binding step in which specificity might be enforced. The reduction of p-NBA is rate-limiting in steady-state turnover (1.7 +/- 0.3 s(-1)). The pre-steady-state reduction kinetics of NR by NADH indicate that NADH reduces the enzyme with a rate constant of 700 +/- 20 s(-1) and a dissociation constant of 0.51 +/- 0.04 mM. Thus, we demonstrate simple transient kinetics in both the reductive and oxidative half-reactions that help to explain the broad substrate repertoire of NR. Finally, we tested the ability of NR to reduce para-hydroxylaminobenzoic acid, demonstrating that the corresponding amine does not accumulate to significant levels even under anaerobic conditions. Thus E. cloacae NR is not a good candidate for enzymatic production of aromatic amines.
TI  - CdiA from Enterobacter cloacae delivers a toxic ribosomal RNase into target bacteria.
AB  - Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is one mechanism of inter-bacterial competition. CDI(+) cells export large CdiA effector proteins, which carry a variety of C-terminal toxin domains (CdiA-CT). CdiA-CT toxins are specifically neutralized by cognate CdiI immunity proteins to protect toxin-producing cells from autoinhibition. Here, we use structure determination to elucidate the activity of a CDI toxin from Enterobacter cloacae (ECL). The structure of CdiA-CT(ECL) resembles the C-terminal nuclease domain of colicin E3, which cleaves 16S ribosomal RNA to disrupt protein synthesis. In accord with this structural homology, we show that CdiA-CT(ECL) uses the same nuclease activity to inhibit bacterial growth. Surprisingly, although colicin E3 and CdiA(ECL) carry equivalent toxin domains, the corresponding immunity proteins are unrelated in sequence, structure, and toxin-binding site. Together, these findings reveal unexpected diversity among 16S rRNases and suggest that these nucleases are robust and versatile payloads for a variety of toxin-delivery platforms.
TI  - Fosfomycin susceptibility in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from Germany.
AB  - Due to the increase in multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, the interest in older antimicrobial agents, like fosfomycin, has increased. In this study, we used agar dilution for testing susceptibilities to fosfomycin in a collection of 107 carbapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates, of which 80 produced various types of carbapenemases, including KPC, VIM, NDM, and OXA-48. Overall, 78% of the strains had fosfomycin MICs of </= 32 mg/liter and were thus considered to be susceptible according to the current EUCAST breakpoint. The MIC50 and MIC90 were 8 mg/liter and 512 mg/liter, respectively. Escherichia coli strains had significantly lower fosfomycin MICs than the Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae strains. Furthermore, comparisons of the susceptibility testing methods, like Etest and disk diffusion, were performed against agar dilution as the reference method. Essential agreement between Etest and agar dilution was 78.9%, and categorical agreement between the two methods was 92.5%, with 20% very major errors and 2.6% major errors. Disk diffusion was studied with 50-mug and 200-mug fosfomycin disks, but no inhibition zone breakpoint that reduced very major and major errors to an acceptable level was found. Etest and disk diffusion showed poor agreement with fosfomycin agar dilution.
TI  - Enterobacter cloacae with a novel variant of ACT AmpC beta-lactamase originating  from glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus) in Svalbard.
AB  - We aimed at Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae isolates resistant to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones and Salmonella isolates in wild birds in Arctic Svalbard, Norway. Cloacal swabs of little auks (Alle alle, n=215) and samples of faeces of glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus, n=15) were examined. Inducible production of AmpC enzyme was detected in E. cloacae KW218 isolate. Sequence analysis of the 1146 bp PCR product of the ampC gene from this isolate revealed 99% sequence homology with the blaACT-14 and blaACT-5 AmpC beta-lactamase genes. Four, respectively six of the identified single nucleotide polymorphisms generated amino acid substitutions in the amino acid chain. As the ampC sequence polymorphism in the investigated E. cloacae strain was identified as unique, we revealed a novel variant of the ampC beta-lactamase gene blaACT-23.
TI  - Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones in fresh culinary herbs imported from Southeast Asia.
AB  - Since multidrug resistant bacteria are frequently reported from Southeast Asia, our study focused on the occurrence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in fresh imported herbs from Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. Samples were collected from fresh culinary herbs imported from Southeast Asia in which ESBL-suspected isolates were obtained by selective culturing. Analysis included identification by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, susceptibility testing, XbaI-PFGE, microarray, PCR and sequencing of specific ESBL genes, PCR based replicon typing (PBRT) of plasmids and Southern blot hybridization. In addition, the quinolone resistance genotype was characterized by screening for plasmid mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes and mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of gyrA and parC. The study encompassed fifty samples of ten batches of culinary herbs (5 samples per batch) comprising nine different herb variants. The herbs originated from Thailand (Water morning glory, Acacia and Betel leaf), Vietnam (Parsley, Asian pennywort, Houttuynia leaf and Mint) and Malaysia (Holy basil and Parsley). By selective culturing 21 cefotaxime resistant Enterobacteriaceae were retrieved. Array analysis revealed 18 isolates with ESBL genes and one isolate with solely non-ESBL beta-lactamase genes. Mutations in the ampC promoter region were determined in two isolates with PCR and sequencing. The isolates were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=9), Escherichia coli (n=6), Enterobacter cloacae complex (n=5) and Enterobacter spp. (n=1). All isolates tested were multidrug resistant. Variants of CTX-M enzymes were predominantly found followed by SHV enzymes. PMQR genes (including aac(6')-1b-cr, qnrB and qnrS) were also frequently detected. In almost all cases ESBL and quinolone resistance genes were located on the same plasmid. Imported fresh culinary herbs from Southeast Asia are a potential source for contamination of food with multidrug resistant bacteria. Because these herbs are consumed without appropriate heating, transfer to human bacteria cannot be excluded.
TI  - Travel-related carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria in Alberta, Canada: the first 3 years.
AB  - We describe here the characteristics of Alberta, Canada, patients with infections or colonizations with carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria during 2010 to 2013 that were linked to recent travel outside Canada. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution, and isolates were characterized using PCR, sequencing, and multilocus sequencing typing. A broth mating study was used to assess the transferability of resistance plasmids, which were subsequently characterized. All the patients (n=12) included in our study had contact with a health care system while abroad. Most of the patients presented with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and were admitted to hospitals within weeks after their return to Alberta. Secondary spread occurred in 1 case, resulting in the death of another patient. The carbapenemase-producing bacteria (n=17) consisted of Escherichia coli (sequence type 101 [ST101], ST365, ST405, and ST410) with NDM-1, Klebsiella pneumoniae (ST15, ST16, ST147, ST258, ST340, ST512, and ST972) with NDM-1, OXA-181, KPC-2, and KPC-3, Acinetobacter baumannii with OXA-23, Providencia rettgeri with NDM-1, Enterobacter cloacae with KPC-2, and Citrobacter freundii with NDM-1. The blaNDM-1 gene was associated with various narrow- (i.e., IncF) and broad- (i.e., IncA/C and IncL/M) host-range plasmids with different addiction factors. Our results show that NDM-producing K. pneumoniae, belonging to a variety of sequence types with different plasmid scaffolds, are regularly imported from India into Alberta. Clinical microbiology laboratories should remain vigilant in detecting bacteria with carbapenemases.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic target attainment of intravenous pazufloxacin in the bile of patients undergoing biliary pancreatic surgery.
AB  - The study aimed to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pazufloxacin (PZFX) in bile and to identify optimal dosing regimens. Pazufloxacin 500 mg was administered via a 0.5-hour intravenous infusion to 10 patients with endoscopic nasal bile drainage before or after biliary pancreatic surgery. Both blood and bile samples were collected pre-dose and at the end of infusion (0.5 hours) and for up to 5 hours thereafter. Concentrations of PZFX were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Noncompartmental and compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated, and Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to evaluate the pharmacodynamic exposure of PZFX in bile. The bile/plasma ratios were 3.58+/-1.15 in the area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) and 2.13+/-0.74 in the maximum drug concentration (Cmax). The delay in the time to Cmax, from plasma to bile, was 0.75+/-0.18 hours The probability of attaining pharmacodynamic targets (both AUC/MIC = 100 and Cmax/MIC = 8) in bile against a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 mg/l was >90% when PZFX was administered by a 0.5-hour infusion with 500 mg every 8 hours or 1000 mg every 12 hours These regimens provided an adequate antibacterial effect against the most common pathogens of biliary tract infections, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae with their MICs<2 mg/l.
TI  - Spread of NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae in a neonatal intensive care unit in Istanbul, Turkey.
AB  - Twenty-two consecutive carbapenem-resistant enterobacterial isolates were recovered from patients hospitalized between January and April 2013 in different units at a university hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. These were Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates producing the carbapenemases OXA-48, NDM-1, and KPC-2, Enterobacter cloacae isolates producing NDM-1, and Escherichia coli isolates producing OXA-48. Most of the OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae and all the NDM-1-producing E. cloacae were clonally related. The NDM-1-producing E. cloacae isolates recovered from a single neonatal intensive care unit corresponded to a single cluster, highlighting the spread of that clone in that setting.
TI  - Drug resistance analysis of bacterial strains isolated from burn patients.
AB  - This study aimed to analyze the spectrum and drug resistance of bacteria isolated from burn patients to provide a reference for rational clinical use of antibiotics. Up to 1914 bacterial strain specimens isolated from burn patients admitted to hospital between 2001 and 2010 were subjected to resistance monitoring by using the K-B paper disk method. Retrospective analysis was performed on drug resistance analysis of burn patients. The top eight bacterium strains according to detection rate. A total of 1355 strains of Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria and 559 strains of Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria were detected. The top eight bacterium strains, according to detection rate, were Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterococcus. Drug resistance rates were higher than 90% in A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus, which accounted for 52.2, 21.7, 27.8, and 33.3%, respectively, of the entire sample. Those with drug resistance rates lower than 30% accounted for 4.3, 30.4, 16.7, and 16.7%, respectively. Multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) accounted for 49.2 and 76.4% of the S. epidermis and S. aureus resistance, respectively. Antibacterial drugs that had drug resistance rates to MRSE and MRSA higher than 90% accounted for 38.9 and 72.2%, respectively, whereas those with lower than 30% drug resistance rates accounted for 11.1 and 16.7%, respectively. The burn patients enrolled in the study were mainly infected with G(-) bacteria. These results strongly suggest that clinicians should practice rational use of antibiotics based on drug susceptibility test results.
TI  - Systematic metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for high-yield production of fuel bio-chemical 2,3-butanediol.
AB  - The production of biofuels by recombinant Escherichia coli is restricted by the toxicity of the products. 2,3-Butanediol (2,3-BD), a platform and fuel bio-chemical with low toxicity to microbes, could be a promising alternative for biofuel production. However, the yield and productivity of 2,3-BD produced by recombinant E. coli strains are not sufficient for industrial scale fermentation. In this work, the production of 2,3-BD by recombinant E. coli strains was optimized by applying a systematic approach. 2,3-BD biosynthesis gene clusters were cloned from several native 2,3-BD producers, including Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Enterobacter cloacae, inserted into the expression vector pET28a, and compared for 2,3-BD synthesis. The recombinant strain E. coli BL21/pETPT7-EcABC, carrying the 2,3-BD pathway gene cluster from Enterobacter cloacae, showed the best ability to synthesize 2,3-BD. Thereafter, expression of the most efficient gene cluster was optimized by using different promoters, including PT7, Ptac, Pc, and Pabc. E. coli BL21/pET-RABC with Pabc as promoter was superior in 2,3-BD synthesis. On the basis of the results of biomass and extracellular metabolite profiling analyses, fermentation conditions, including pH, agitation speed, and aeration rate, were optimized for the efficient production of 2,3-BD. After fed-batch fermentation under the optimized conditions, 73.8g/L of 2,3-BD was produced by using E. coli BL21/pET-RABC within 62h. The values of both yield and productivity of 2,3-BD obtained with the optimized biological system are the highest ever achieved with an engineered E. coli strain. In addition to the 2,3-BD production, the systematic approach might also be used in the production of other important chemicals through recombinant E. coli strains.
TI  - Plantaricin LD1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum LD1.
AB  - Plantaricin LD1, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LD1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. Bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees C for 20 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a pH range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. The crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase K showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. The molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kDa, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. It inhibited not only related strains but also other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B-4562, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis NRRL B-1821, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354, Enterobacter cloacae NRRL B-14298, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, urogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Vibrio sp. These properties of plantaricin LD1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
TI  - New hydrazines with sulphonamidic structure: synthesis,characterization and biological activity.
AB  - Infections caused by bacterial species are common in immunocompromised patients and carry significant treatment costs and mortality. The emerging resistance of microorganisms to some synthetic antimicrobial agents makes it necessary to continue the research for new antimicrobial drugs. AIM: To design new sulphonamide compounds with potential antibacterial and antioxidant activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: New N-hydrazino acetyl-sulphonamides were prepared by condensation of some sulphonamides with chloroacetyl chloride and amination of intermediate compounds with hydrazine hydrate. RESULTS: The synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram positive (Klebsiellapneumoniae. Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram negative bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli). Some of them were found to have good antibacterial activity. The antioxidant activity of these compounds was also tested using different methods: total antioxidant capacity, reducing power, and DPPH radical scavenging activity. CONCLUSIONS: Chemical modulations performed on sulphonamide structure have a good influence on the biological activity of the synthesized compounds, especially on their antioxidant effects.
TI  - Emergence of Carbapenemaseproducing Klebsiella Pneumoniae of Sequence type 258 in Michigan, USA.
AB  - The prevalence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in our hospital increased beginning in 2009. We aimed to study the clinical and molecular epidemiology of these emerging isolates. We performed a retrospective review of all adult patients with clinical cultures confirmed as CPE by positive modified Hodge test from 5/2009- 5/2010 at the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS). Clinical information was obtained from electronic medical records. Available CPE isolates were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the 16S rRNA encoding gene and bla KPC locus. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to characterize Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Twenty six unique CPE isolates were obtained from 25 adult patients. The majority were Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=17). Other isolates included K. oxytoca (n=3), Citrobacter freundii (n=2), Enterobacter cloacae (n=2), Enterobacter aerogenes (n=1) and Escherichia coli (n=1). Molecular characterization of 19 available CPE isolates showed that 13 (68%) carried the KPC-3 allele and 6 (32%) carried the KPC-2 allele. Among 14 available K. pneumoniae strains, 12 (86%) carried the KPC-3 allele and belonged to a common lineage, sequence type (ST) 258. The other 2 (14%) K. pneumoniae isolates carried the KPC-2 allele and belonged to two unique STs. Among these ST 258 strains, 67% were isolated from patients with prior exposures to health care settings outside of our institution. In contrast, all CPE isolates carrying the KPC-2 allele and all non ST 258 CPE isolates had acquisition attributable to our hospital. Molecular epidemiology of carbapenemase producing K. pneumoniae suggests that KPC-3 producing K. pneumoniae isolates of a common lineage, sequence type (ST 258), are emerging in our hospital. While ST 258 is a dominant sequence type throughout the United States, this study is the first to report its presence in Michigan.
TI  - Effect of proton pump inhibitors on in vitro activity of tigecycline against several common clinical pathogens.
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline against several species of clinical pathogens. Clinical non-duplicate isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and three species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Enterobacter cloacae) were collected from a tertiary hospital and their MICs of tigecycline alone and in combination with PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole) were determined. With one randomly selected isolate of each bacterial species, an in vitro time-kill study was performed for the confirmation of the effect of PPIs on tigecycline activity. The MIC changes after PPIs addition correlated with the PPIs concentrations in the test media. Compared with tigecycline alone, the addition of 5 mg/L PPIs could increase the MICs of tigecycline by 0 to 2-fold and the addition of 50 mg/L PPIs could increase the MICs of tigecycline by 4 to >128-fold. The time-kill study confirmed that the addition of PPIs could affect the in vitro activity of tigecycline. Even at low concentration (5 mg/L) of omeprazole and pantoprazole, antagonistic effect could be observed in E. cloacae and E. faecalis strains. We conclude that In vitro activity of tigecycline can be influenced by the presence of PPIs in a concentration-dependent manner.
TI  - Characterization of KPC-2-producing Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates from a Chinese Hospital.
AB  - Twelve nonduplicated KPC-2-producing enterobacterial isolates, including three Escherichia coli, two Citrobacter freundii, two Enterobacter cloacae, four Enterobacter aerogenes, and one Klebsiella oxytoca, were collected from various clinical samples within 18 months (March 2011 to September 2012). Two of the 12 patients died from infections caused by KPC-2-producing pathogens, while the rest of the patients with KPC-2-producing pathogens improved or were cured. The majority of the clinical isolates exhibited a high-level of resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and carbapenems, and possessed self-transferable bla(KPC-2)-carrying plasmids with sizes ranging from 20 to 120 kb. Most isolates carried bla(CTX-M) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, while some isolates produced 16S rRNA methylases (ArmA or RmtB). The genetic environment of bla(KPC-2) of most clinical strains was consistent with the genetic structure surrounding bla(KPC-2) on the plasmid pKP048, which contains an integration structure of a Tn3-based transposon and partial Tn4401 segment. Inserted fragments (truncated bla(TEM)) were detected upstream of the bla(KPC-2) gene for two E. aerogenes strains. In conclusion, the enterobacterial isolates exhibited sporadic emergence and did not arise by clonal spread at our hospital. The outcome of infections caused by KPC-producing enterobacterial isolates and their mortality were closely associated with the baseline condition of patients. The spread of bla(KPC-2) gene between different enterobacterial species in China was mainly mediated by horizontal transfer of the Tn3-based transposons and not the bla(KPC-2)-carrying plasmids.
TI  - Further in vitro evaluation of antiradical and antimicrobial activities of phytol.
AB  - The antiradical activity of phytol was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance towards hydroxyl radical (.OH), superoxide anion radical (.O2(-)), methoxy radical (.CH2OH), carbon-dioxide anion radical (.CO2(-)), as well as towards nitric-oxide radical (.NO) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (.DPPH) radical. It reduced the production of all tested radicals showing more promising activity against .CO2(-), .CH2OH and .DPPH radicals (56%, 50% and 48%, respectively) in comparison with .NO, .O2(-) and .OH radicals (38%, 23% and 15%, respectively). The antimicrobial activity of phytol was evaluated by the microdilution method against eight bacterial and eight fungal strains. To varying degrees, it was proven to be active against all tested bacteria and fungi (MIC 0.003-0.038 mg/mL and MBC 0.013-0.052 mg/mL, MIC 0.008-0.016 mg/mL and MFC 0.090-0.520 mg/mL, respectively). According to the obtained results, medical foods containing phytol may support development of new therapies for heart disease.
TI  - In vitro activity of colistin sulfate against Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - The widespread multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae pose a serious therapeutic  challenge. Colistin and tigecycline are potential antimicrobial agents for treating infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. We evaluated the in-vitro activity of colistin sulfate against 253 ESBL producers isolated from patients admitted to a medical center in southern Taiwan (Escherichia coli, n = 82; Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 102; Enterobacter cloacae, n = 34; and Serratia marcescens, n = 35). Colistin showed promising in-vitro activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae, but not S. marcescens. One ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strain with resistance to carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem) was selected for time-killing studies. A combination of colistin and tigecycline showed synergism, but there was an inoculum effect. In conclusion, colistin was active against most ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and a combination of colistin with tigecycline was synergistic against some highly resistant strains, even those with carbapenem resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime-avibactam against Gram-negative organisms collected from U.S. medical centers in 2012.
AB  - The activities of the novel beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination ceftazidime-avibactam and comparator agents were evaluated against a contemporary collection of clinically significant Gram-negative bacilli. Avibactam is a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits Ambler class A, C, and some D enzymes. A total of 10,928 Gram-negative bacilli-8,640 Enterobacteriaceae, 1,967 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 321 Acinetobacter sp. isolates-were collected from 73 U.S. hospitals and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods in a central monitoring laboratory (JMI Laboratories, North Liberty, IA, USA). Ceftazidime was combined with avibactam at a fixed concentration of 4 mug/ml. Overall, 99.8% of Enterobacteriaceae strains were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=4 mug/ml. Ceftazidime-avibactam was active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-phenotype Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem-nonsusceptible (MIC>/=2 mug/ml) K. pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-nonsusceptible Enterobacter cloacae. Among ESBL-phenotype K. pneumoniae strains, 61.1% were meropenem susceptible and 99.3% were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=4 mug/ml. Among P. aeruginosa strains, 96.9% were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=8 mug/ml, and susceptibility rates for meropenem, ceftazidime, and piperacillin-tazobactam were 82.0, 83.2, and 78.3%, respectively. Ceftazidime-avibactam was the most active compound tested against meropenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa (MIC50/MIC90, 4/16 mug/ml; 87.3% inhibited at </=8 mug/ml). Acinetobacter spp. (ceftazidime-avibactam MIC50/MIC90, 16/>32 mug/ml) showed high rates of resistance to most tested agents. In summary, ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated potent activity against a large collection of contemporary Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients in U.S. hospitals in 2012, including organisms that are resistant to most currently available agents, such as K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and meropenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [The frequency of bacteria in human gallstones].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Complications caused by lost gallstones within the abdominal cavity are well known. Abscesses, perforation of the gastro-intestinal tract were all described in the literature, but gallstones were found in hernial sac, or even in sputum after it penetrated through the diaphragm into the respiratory tract. These complications can develop between several weeks to several years postoperatively. Most complications can be treated surgically only. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty gallstones and bile samples were collected from 50 patients who underwent cholecystectomy (36 female / 14 male, avarge age: 60.8 +/- 6.8 years). All samples were sent for microbiological examination. RESULTS: bacterial colonization of the gallstone and the bile were found in 16 cases. Four of them showed acute inflammation in the gallbladder while pathological signs of chronic inflammation in the gallbladder wall were detected in eight cases. Empyema was found in four cases. Bacteria from enteral origin (Esherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae) was detected in 13 cases, while non-enteral (Klebsiella penumoniae, Streptococcus alfa-haemoliticus) colony were detected in three cases. Positive bacterial cultures were identified in twelve female and fourmale patients. CONCLUSIONS: Different types of bacteria can be found in the gallstones, which may cause various complications.
TI  - Risk factors associated with preoperative fecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in liver transplant recipients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify risk factors associated with pre-transplant fecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in liver transplant recipients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a 3-year period (January 2009-December 2011), 317 patients who underwent liver transplantation were screened preoperatively for fecal carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Risk factors for fecal carriage were investigated by univariate analysis and stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 317 patients screened, 50 (15.7%) harbored an ESBL-producing isolate. Previous infection with an ESBL-producing organism had developed during the last 6 months in 20% of fecal carriers versus in none of the non-carriers. Other variables associated with fecal carriage were a model for end-stage liver disease score >/=25, pre-transplant stay in the intensive care unit >/=48 h, hospital stay >/=10 days in the last 6 months, a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), exposure to a beta-lactam agent in the last month, and prophylaxis with norfloxacin. Independent predictors of fecal carriage in the multivariate logistic regression model were exposure to a beta-lactam agent in the month preceding transplantation (odds ratio [OR] = 7.8, confidence interval [CI] = 4-15.5, P < 0.001), and a history of SBP (OR = 2.4, CI = 1.1-4.9, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Previous infection with an ESBL-producing isolate, recent exposure to a beta-lactam agent, and a history of SBP are risk factors for preoperative fecal carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in liver transplant recipients. Patients at risk of fecal carriage should receive intraoperative prophylaxis and, when necessary, empiric postoperative antimicrobial treatment that includes coverage for these organisms.
TI  - An outbreak of CTX-M-15 -producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella in a children's hospital in Finland.
AB  - Four different extended-spectrum beta -lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria from a pediatric surgery ward were studied. The presence of TEM-, SHV-, and CTX-M-type beta -lactamases was analyzed and the relatedness of the isolates studied with a repetitive PCR system (DiversiLab) and pulsed-fi eld gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Molecular analysis showed that a clonal dissemination of CTX-M-15-producing Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae had occurred.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of geranium oil against Gram-negative bacteria isolated from difficult-to-heal wounds.
AB  - Hard-to-heal wounds represent a significant problem to patients, health care professionals, and health care system. They can be formed as a result of mechanical injuries and burns, and any co-existing chronic disease increases the risk of their emergence. Diabetics are at a greater risk of developing chronic wounds because of poor circulation, slow healing times, vascular disease and neuropathy. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of geranium oil against Gram-negative bacterial clinical strains. Clinical strains were isolated from patients with difficult-to-treat wounds and a comprehensive evaluation of their sensitivity to antibiotics was carried out. The constituents of geranium oil were specified by GC-FID-MS analysis. The micro-dilution broth method was used to check the inhibition of microbial growth at various concentrations of geranium oil. The tested geranium oil was efficacious against Gram-negative pathogens responsible for problems with wound treatment. The results suggest that geranium oil may be considered an effective component of therapy in the case of frequent recurrences of infections caused by resistant pathogens.
TI  - Characterization of a novel pyranopyridine inhibitor of the AcrAB efflux pump of  Escherichia coli.
AB  - Members of the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) family of efflux pumps, such  as AcrAB-TolC of Escherichia coli, play major roles in multidrug resistance (MDR) in Gram-negative bacteria. A strategy for combating MDR is to develop efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) for use in combination with an antibacterial agent. Here, we describe MBX2319, a novel pyranopyridine EPI with potent activity against RND efflux pumps of the Enterobacteriaceae. MBX2319 decreased the MICs of ciprofloxacin (CIP), levofloxacin, and piperacillin versus E. coli AB1157 by 2-, 4-, and 8-fold, respectively, but did not exhibit antibacterial activity alone and was not active against AcrAB-TolC-deficient strains. MBX2319 (3.13 muM) in combination with 0.016 mug/ml CIP (minimally bactericidal) decreased the viability (CFU/ml) of E. coli AB1157 by 10,000-fold after 4 h of exposure, in comparison with 0.016 mug/ml CIP alone. In contrast, phenyl-arginine-beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN), a known EPI, did not increase the bactericidal activity of 0.016 mug/ml CIP at concentrations as high as 100 muM. MBX2319 increased intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342 in wild-type but not AcrAB-TolC-deficient strains and did not perturb the transmembrane proton gradient. MBX2319 was broadly active against Enterobacteriaceae species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MBX2319 is a potent EPI with possible utility as an adjunctive therapeutic agent for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Risk factors of community-onset urinary tract infections caused by plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The AmpC beta-lactamase (AmpC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae emerged worldwide. This study was conducted to determine the risk factors of community-onset urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by plasmid-mediated AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed as community-onset UTIs caused by Enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary-care teaching hospital from December 2010 to January 2012 were included. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates were excluded. We identified plasmid-mediated AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae both phenotypically (by disk potentiation test and double-disk synergy test) and genotypically (by Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay). The demographic data, clinical characteristics, and risk factors of acquisition were described. RESULTS: Among the 323 non-ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae identified in community-onset UTIs, 50 isolates were phenotypically positive for AmpC. Escherichia coli was the most common AmpC-producing organism (60%), followed by Klebsiella pneumonia (8%), and Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (6% for each species). The independent risk factors for acquisition of AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae included prior history of cerebral vascular accident [odds ratio (OR) = 2.014; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.007-4.031; p = 0.0048], and prior use of fluoroquinolones (OR = 4.049; 95% CI = 1.759-9.319; p = 0.001) and cephamycin (OR = 9.683; 95% CI = 2.007-45.135; p = 0.004). AmpC-producing isolates were multidrug resistant. Carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam had the best in vitro efficacy. The most commonly identified plasmid-mediated AmpC gene was blaCIT, followed by blaDHA/blaEBC, and blaMOx. CONCLUSION: For community-onset UTIs, AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae should be suspected in those with prior history of cerebral vascular accident and prior use of antimicrobials. To treat these multiple-resistant isolates, carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam may be considered.
TI  - Change of antibiotic susceptibility testing guidelines from CLSI to EUCAST: influence on cumulative hospital antibiograms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied whether the change in antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) guidelines from CLSI to EUCAST influenced cumulative antibiograms in a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland. METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibilities of non-duplicate isolates collected within a one-year period before (period A) and after (period B) changing AST interpretation from CLSI 2009 to EUCAST 1.3 (2011) guidelines were analysed. In addition, period B isolates were reinterpreted according to the CLSI 2009, CLSI 2013 and EUCAST 3.1 (2013) guidelines. RESULTS: The majority of species/drug combinations showed no differences in susceptibility rates comparing periods A and B. However, in some gram-negative bacilli, decreased susceptibility rates were observed when comparing CLSI 2009 with EUCAST 1.3 within period B: Escherichia coli / cefepime, 95.8% (CLSI 2009) vs. 93.1% (EUCAST 1.3), P=0.005; Enterobacter cloacae / cefepime, 97.0 (CLSI 2009) vs. 90.5% (EUCAST 1.3), P=0.012; Pseudomonas aeruginosa / meropenem, 88.1% (CLSI 2009) vs. 78.3% (EUCAST 1.3), P=0.002. These differences were still evident when comparing susceptibility rates according to the CLSI 2013 guideline with EUCAST 3.1 guideline. For P. aeruginosa and imipenem, a trend towards a lower antibiotic susceptibility rate in ICUs compared to general wards turned into a significant difference after the change to EUCAST: 87.9% vs. 79.8%, P=0.08 (CLSI 2009) and 86.3% vs. 76.8%, P=0.048 (EUCAST 1.3). CONCLUSIONS: The change of AST guidelines from CLSI to EUCAST led to a clinically relevant decrease of susceptibility rates in cumulative antibiograms for defined species/drug combinations, particularly in those with considerable differences in clinical susceptibility breakpoints between the two guidelines.
TI  - Trend of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes at the Children's Hospital in Tunisia.
AB  - The prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes [qnr, aac(6')-Ib-cr and qepA] was sought among Enterobacteriaceae strains obtained from the Children's Hospital of Tunis (Tunisia). Non-duplicate isolates (n = 278) with resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and collected in 2003, 2007, 2008 and 2009 were screened for qnr genes. Forty (14.4 %) isolates were qnr positive and were screened for the presence of the aac(6')-Ib-cr and qepA genes. qnrB was detected in 21 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 11 Escherichia coli and 6 Enterobacter cloacae isolates. Sequence analysis of the qnrB amplicons revealed variants including 24 qnrB1, 11 qnrB2 and 3 qnrB6. qnrS (qnrS1 allele) was detected only in K. pneumoniae isolates, either alone (two isolates) or with the qnrB gene (one isolate). The qnrA, qnrC and qnrD genes were not found in any of the 278 isolates. No qnr-positive isolates carried the qepA gene. Pyrosequencing results showed that aac(6')-Ib-cr, a variant of the aac(6')-Ib gene, was present in 31 qnr-positive isolates (21 K. pneumoniae isolates, seven Escherichia coli isolates and three Enterobacter cloacae isolates). aac(6')-Ib was also found either alone (two isolates) or in association with aac(6')-Ib-cr (one isolate). Of the 40 qnr-positive isolates, 92.5, 82.5, 57.5, 85 and 82.5 % were non-susceptible to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin, respectively, and all were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers. Random amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR typing of these isolates showed 16, 8 and 5 different genotypes in K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively. Our study highlights the high prevalence of qnr in association with aac(6')-Ib-cr among Enterobacteriaceae isolates, even from children, who are patients not overtreated with quinolones.
TI  - Discordance in the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ertapenem for Enterobacter cloacae: Vitek 2 system versus Etest and agar dilution methods.
AB  - Our objective was to compare the ertapenem minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for Enterobacter cloacae isolates categorized intermediate or resistant to ertapenem when measured with the Vitek 2 system, with the MICs for these isolates when measured by two methods performed in agar medium: the Etest and agar plate dilution method (APDM). Overall, 50 E. cloacae isolates were included in the study. The mean MIC of ertapenem was 2.92+/-1.77mug/ml according to the Vitek 2 system, 0.94+/-0.84mug/ml according to the Etest strips, and 0.93+/-0.62mug/ml according to the APDM. Furthermore, the MICs determined by the Vitek 2 system were higher than the MICs determined by the two other methods for 96% of strains. Lastly, according to the Etest strips and APDM, 42% of E. cloacae were susceptible to ertapenem. No carbapenemase was identified by the screening method used. Using the Vitek 2 system to determine ertapenem MICs for E. cloacae can have potential consequences in terms of additional carbapenemase-detecting tests and antimicrobial therapy. It would be interesting to determine if the Vitek 2 system is more effective for the detection of carbapenemase producers with low-level carbapenem resistance than the two methods performed in agar medium.
TI  - First description of bla(NDM-1), bla(OXA-48), bla(OXA-181) producing Enterobacteriaceae strains in Romania.
AB  - We report the first isolation and characterization of several Enterobacteriaceae  strains harboring bla(NDM-1), bla(OXA-48) and/or bla(OXA-181) genes in a Romanian emergency teaching hospital. Between January 2010 and September 2012 nine carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains were identified. The bla(NDM-1) gene was present in two Enterobacter cloacae strains, an Escherichia coli and two Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. One of these K. pneumoniae strains also harbored the bla(OXA-181) gene. Three other K. pneumoniae strains and one Serratia marcescens carried bla(OXA-48).
TI  - An analog of the host-defense peptide hymenochirin-1B with potent broad-spectrum  activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria and immunomodulatory properties.
AB  - Hymenochirin-1B (IKLSPETKDN(10)LKKVLKGAIK(20)GAIAVAKMV.NH2) is a cationic, amphipathic, alpha-helical, host-defense peptide, first isolated from skin secretions of the Congo clawed frog Hymenochirus boettgeri (Pipidae). Structure-activity relationships were investigated by synthesizing analogs in which the Pro(5), Glu(6) and Asp(9) on the hydrophilic face of the alpha-helix are substituted by one or more l-lysine or d-lysine residues. Although replacement with l-lysine generates analogs with increased antimicrobial potency against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (up to 8-fold), the peptides are more hemolytic. Increasing the cationicity of hymenochirin-1B while reducing the helicity by substitutions with d-lysine generates analogs that are between 2 and 8 fold more potent than the native peptide and are equally or less hemolytic. [E6k,D9k]hymenochirin-1B represents a candidate for drug development as it shows high potency against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and a range of Gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC in the range 0.8-3.1 muM) and NDM-1 carbapenemase-producing clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii (MIC in the range 3.1-6.25 muM), and low hemolytic activity (LC50=302 muM). [E6k,D9k]hymenochirin-1B, at a concentration of 2.5 muM, significantly (P<0.05) stimulates the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells but is without significant effect on production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-17.
TI  - Prevention of biofilm colonization by Gram-negative bacteria on minocycline-rifampin-impregnated catheters sequentially coated with chlorhexidine.
AB  - Resistant Gram-negative bacteria are increasing central-line-associated bloodstream infection threats. To better combat this, chlorhexidine (CHX) was added to minocycline-rifampin (M/R) catheters. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of CHX-M/R catheters against multidrug resistant, Gram-negative Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was tested. M/R and CHX-silver sulfadiazine (CHX/SS) catheters were used as comparators. The novel CHX-M/R catheters were significantly more effective (P < 0.0001) than CHX/SS or M/R catheters in preventing biofilm colonization and showed better antimicrobial durability.
TI  - Avibactam reverts the ceftazidime MIC90 of European Gram-negative bacterial clinical isolates to the epidemiological cut-off value.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ceftazidime-avibactam consists of the beta-lactam ceftazidime and the novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam. The effect of avibactam on the ceftazidime MIC frequency distribution of Gram-negative European clinical isolates was observed and compared to European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) MIC frequency distributions and epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) listed for ceftazidime. METHODS: Ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam MICs were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) reference broth microdilution methods for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Enterobacter spp., and Proteus mirabilis isolates collected from medical centres in Europe during 2009. RESULTS: The MIC(90) values for ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam against P. aeruginosa isolates from a 2009 European surveillance programme were >32 and 8 mg/l, respectively. That is, the presence of avibactam reverted the ceftazidime MIC(90) for P. aeruginosa to the ECOFF. Similarly, the MIC(90) values for ceftazidime against E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., and P. mirabilis were also reduced to the ECOFF by the presence of avibactam. Avibactam reduced the ceftazidime MIC(90) value against collected Enterobacter spp. to 1 mg/l (>32-fold reduction). No ECOFF has been defined for Enterobacter spp. however, it is 1 mg/l for Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of avibactam reverted the ceftazidime MIC(90) for Gram-negative bacteria to the ECOFF.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and SAR study of new gemini imidazolium-based chlorides.
AB  - A series of 70 new 3,3'(alpha,omega-dioxaalkyl)bis(1-alkylimidazolium) chlorides  were synthesized. They were characterized with respect to surface active properties and antimicrobial activity against the following pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida krusei, and Candida albicans. In this article, besides description of the synthesis, we characterize a set of features of these compounds, concerning their structure (described by the length of the dioxaalkan spacer and the length of the alkyl substituent in the aromatic ring) and surface active properties (critical micelle concentration, value of surface tension at critical micelle concentration, value of surface excess, molecular area of a single particle, and free energy of adsorption of molecule). Then, we present a SAR study for Staphylococcus aureus, as one of the most widespread pathogenic strains, conducted with the help of the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA), that involves identification of relevant features and relevant combinations of features being in strong relationship with a high antimicrobial activity of the compounds. The SAR study shows, moreover, that the antimicrobial activity is dependent on the type of substituents and their position at the chloride moiety, as well as on the surface active properties of the compounds.
TI  - [The risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia in newborn and the changes of isolated pathogens].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in  newborn and the profiles of isolated pathogens. METHODS: The clinical data of 179 neonates in the previous group (from December 2005 to December 2008) and 331 neonates in the present group (from January 2009 to January 2012) admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and received mechanical ventilation for equal or longer than 48 hours were respectively reviewed and analyzed,and their isolated pathogen profile and drug sensitivity were also compared in two groups. RESULTS: The incidence of VAP in the previous group and the present group were 22.35% and 20.24% respectively, no significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05) was observed. Gram-negative bacteria was the main pathogens (93.40%), the first 5 common pathogens in the previous group were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. However, the first 5 of isolated gram-negative pathogens in the present group were somewhat different from the previous group, which were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. The drug sensitivity test showed that these pathogens had a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics, of which the carbapenem antibiotic drug sensitivity decreased significantly, there was statistically significant difference between the previous group and the present group (P < 0.05). The risk factors of VAP include the duration of mechanical ventilation (OR = 5.680, 95% CI: 2.867-11.253), the frequency of tracheal intubation (OR = 2.219, 95% CI: 1.037- 4.748), birth weight (OR = 2. 127, 95% CI: 1.067-4.238) and neonatal asphyxia (OR = 2.025, 95% CI: 1.079-3.799) as well as the duration of hospital stay (OR = 2.012, 95% CI: 1.215-3.967). CONCLUSIONS: According to the data in our hospital, the main pathogenic bacteria of VAP were gram-negative pathogens, which showed a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics. The incidence of VAP was closely related to the duration of mechanical ventilation, the frequency of intubation, birth weight and the hospitalization as well as the neonatal asphyxia.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of CTX-M producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated from bloodstream infections in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: emergence of CTX-M-15.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to evaluate the molecular epidemiology  of CTX-M producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli isolated from bloodstream infections at tertiary care hospitals in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 231 nonduplicate Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from five Brazilian hospitals between September 2007 and September 2008. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion method according to the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute. Isolates showing resistance to third-generation cephalosporins were screened for ESBL activity by the double-disk synergy test. The presence of blaCTX-M, blaCTX-M-15 and blaKPC genes was determined by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequencing. The molecular typing of CTX-M producing isolates was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Ninety-three isolates were screened as ESBL positive and 85 (91%) were found to carry CTX-M-type, as follows: K. pneumoniae 59 (49%), E. cloacae 15 (42%), and E. coli 11 (15%). Ten isolates resistant for carbapenems in K. pneumoniae were blaKPC-2 gene positive. Among CTX-M type isolates, CTX-M-15 was predominant in more than 50% of isolates for K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and E. cloacae. PFGE analysis of CTX-M producing isolates showed the predominance of CTX-M-15 in 10 of 24 pulsotypes in K. pneumoniae, 6 of 13 in E. cloacae and 3 of 6 in E. coli. CTX-M-15 was also predominant among KPC producing isolates. In conclusion, this study showed that CTX-M-15 was circulating in Rio de Janeiro state in 2007-2008. This data reinforce the need for continuing surveillance because this scenario may have changed over the years.
TI  - Development of indole-3-acetic acid-producing Escherichia coli by functional expression of IpdC, AspC, and Iad1.
AB  - Biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) via the indole-3-pyruvic acid pathway  involves three kinds of enzymes; aminotransferase encoded by aspC, indole-3-pyruvic acid decarboxylase encoded by ipdC, and indole-3-acetic acid dehydrogenase encoded by iad1. The ipdC from Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047, aspC from Escherichia coli, and iad1 from Ustilago maydis were cloned and expressed under the control of the tac and sod promoters in E. coli. According to SDS-PAGE and enzyme activity, IpdC and Iad1 showed good expression under the control of P(tac), whereas AspC was efficiently expressed by P(sod) originating from Corynebacterium glutamicum. The activities of IpdC, AspC, and Iad1 from the crude extracts of recombinant E. coli Top 10 were 215.6, 5.7, and 272.1 nmol/min/mg-protein, respectively. The recombinant E. coli DH5alpha expressing IpdC, AspC, and Iad1 produced about 1.1 g/l of IAA and 0.13 g/l of tryptophol (TOL) after 48 h of cultivation in LB medium with 2 g/l tryptophan. To improve IAA production, a tnaA gene mediating indole formation from tryptophan was deleted. As a result, E. coli IAA68 with expression of the three genes produced 1.8 g/l of IAA, which is a 1.6- fold increase compared with wild-type DH5alpha harboring the same plasmids. Moreover, the complete conversion of tryptophan to IAA was achieved by E. coli IAA68. Finally, E. coli IAA68 produced 3.0 g/l of IAA after 24 h cultivation in LB medium supplemented with 4 g/l of tryptophan.
TI  - In vivo efficacy of humanized ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam exposures in a polymicrobial infection model.
AB  - Although Gram-positive cocci are the most common pathogens in diabetic foot infections, these infections often are polymicrobial. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a simulated human dose of 600 mg ceftaroline fosamil-600 mg avibactam every 8 h as a 1-h infusion in a polymicrobial in vivo murine model. Seven isolates were used (3 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] isolates, 1 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA] isolate, 1 Escherichia coli isolate, 1 Enterobacter cloacae isolate, and 1 Bacteroides fragilis isolate) in various combinations in an immunocompromised polymicrobial tissue infection to assess the efficacy of the simulated regimen. Each infection was comprised of at least one S. aureus isolate with a MIC of 0.25 to 1 mug/ml and one Enterobacteriaceae isolate with a MIC of 1 or 4 mug/ml. Eight of 16 infections also included B. fragilis, with a MIC of 0.5 mug/ml, as a third organism. Efficacy was evaluated after 24 h as the change in log10 CFU from the level of 0-h controls. Efficacy was seen against all isolate combinations, with at least a 1-log kill against Enterobacteriaceae and a minimum of a 2-log kill against S. aureus and B. fragilis isolates. These bacterial reductions correlate with free drug concentration above the MIC (fT>MIC) produced by the humanized regimen of 100, 86, and 56% at MICs of 1, 2, and 4 mug/ml, respectively. The humanized regimen of 600 mg ceftaroline fosamil-600 mg avibactam every 8 h as a 1-h infusion showed predictable efficacy against all infections tested in this model. These data support further clinical investigation of ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam for the treatment of polymicrobial tissue infections.
TI  - Early-onset sepsis in a neonatal intensive care unit in Beni Suef, Egypt: bacterial isolates and antibiotic resistance pattern.
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the frequency of bacterial isolates in early-onset neonatal  sepsis (EONS) and their antimicrobial resistance pattern. METHODS: A retrospective study of EONS was conducted at the Beni Suef University Hospital from September 2008 to September 2012. A case of EONS was defined as an infant who had clinical signs of infection or who was born to a mother with risk factors for infection, and in whom blood culture obtained within 72 hours of life grew a bacterial pathogen. RESULTS: Of 673 neonates screened, there were 138 positive blood cultures (20.5%) (confirmed EONS). Of the recovered isolates, 86.2% were gram-negative pathogens. Klebsiella pneumoniae (42.8%), Enterobacter cloacae (22.5%), and Escherichia coli (13.8%) were the commonest isolated organisms. The most common gram-positive microorganism was Staphylococcus aureus accounting for only 12 isolates (8.7%). All Klebsiella isolates and 93% of Enterobacter isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Gram-negative pathogens had the maximum overall sensitivity to imipenem, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin; whereas, gram-positive isolates were most susceptible to vancomycin, imipenem, and piperacillin. CONCLUSION: K. pneumoniae was the predominant causative bacteria of EONS followed by E. cloacae and E. coli. There was a high resistance to ampicillin. Imipenem had the maximum overall activity against the causative bacteria. Continuous surveillance is needed to monitor the changing epidemiology of pathogens and antibiotic sensitivity.
TI  - Acquired carbapenemases in Enterobactericeae in Singapore, 1996-2012.
AB  - AIMS: To characterise carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) isolated in Singapore. METHODS: Carbapenemase genes and their flanking regions were amplified and sequenced by PCR. Isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multi-locus sequence typing. Plasmids bearing carbapenemase genes were sized by S1 nuclease digestion, Southern blotting, and DNA hybridisation with appropriate probes. Transfer of these plasmids was attempted by conjugation and transformation. Successfully transferred plasmids were characterised by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) replicon typing and restriction digestion. RESULTS: Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter species carried a variety of carbapenemase genes including blaIMP-1, blaIMP-4, blaNDM-1, blaNDM-7, blaOXA-181, blaOXA-48 and blaKPC-2. Apart from K. pneumoniae with blaOXA-181, and some K. pneumoniae with blaNDM-1, the other isolates were not clonal. However there appears to be some spread of plasmids with blaIMP-1, blaNDM-1,blaKPC-2, and blaOXA-48. CONCLUSIONS: The number of isolates of CRE has increased in Singapore, especially since 2010. There is a diversity of carbapenemase types that reflects the geographical proximity of other countries with CRE.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative aerobic bacilli from intra-abdominal pathogens to antimicrobial agents collected in the United States during 2011.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: During 2011, a total of 1442 gram-negative pathogens from intra-abdominal infections were collected as part of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) from 19 hospital sites within the United States. Susceptibility to ertapenem and comparators and molecular analysis of ertapenem resistant isolates was performed. METHODS: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ESBL (ESBL) isolates were determined using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute's recommended phenotypic test. Isolates were identified to the species level, and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using custom MicroScan dehydrated broth microdilution panels ESBLs and carbapenemases were characterized using the Check-Points microarray. Strain typing of Klebsiella pneumoniae was performed by rep-PCR on the DiversiLab System. RESULTS: The majority of isolates were Escherichia coli (36%), K. pneumoniae (18.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%) and Enterobacter cloacae (8.4%). Incidence of ESBL-positive isolates was 12.7%, 9.7%, 3.6% and 3.1% for K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella oxytoca, respectively. Against the majority of isolates and species tested, the most active antibiotics were amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem, with the carbapenems being the most active in vitro, including against ESBL-positive isolates of E. coli. All other antibiotics exhibited diminished activity. Against K. pneumoniae, the carbapenems were notably less active against ESBL-positive isolates though their activity against this sub-population was still the highest of all antibiotics tested; however, 41.1% (14 of 34) of the phenotypically ESBL-positive K. pneumoniae co-produced a carbapenemase (KPC2 or KPC3), and >90% of the isolates producing only an ESBL remained susceptible to ertapenem. CONCLUSIONS: Further monitoring of susceptibility of intra-abdominal isolates is warranted due to limited therapeutic options available to physicians.
TI  - Wound healing and antibacterial activities of chondroitin sulfate- and acharan sulfate-reduced silver nanoparticles.
AB  - For topical applications in wound healing, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have attracted much attention as antibacterial agents. Herein, we describe a green-synthetic route for the production of biocompatible and crystalline AgNPs using two glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin sulfate (CS) and acharan sulfate (AS), as reducing agents. The synthetic approach avoids the use of toxic chemicals, and the yield of AgNPs formation is found to be 98.1% and 91.1% for the chondroitin sulfate-reduced silver nanoparticles (CS-AgNPs) and the acharan sulfate-reduced silver nanoparticles (AS-AgNPs), respectively. Nanoparticles with mostly spherical and amorphous shapes were observed, with an average diameter of 6.16 +/- 2.26 nm for CS-AgNPs and 5.79 +/- 3.10 nm for AS-AgNPs. Images of the CS-AgNPs obtained from atomic force microscopy revealed the self-assembled structure of CS was similar to a densely packed woven mat with AgNPs sprinkled on the CS. These nanoparticles were stable under cell culture conditions without any noticeable aggregation. An approximately 128-fold enhancement of the antibacterial activities of the AgNPs was observed against Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli when compared to CS and AS alone. In addition, an in vivo animal model of wound healing activity was tested using mice that were subjected to deep incision wounds. In comparison to the controls, the ointments containing CS-AgNPs and AS-AgNPs stimulated wound closure under histological examination and accelerated the deposition of granulation tissue and collagen in the wound area. The wound healing activity of the ointments containing CS-AgNPs and AS-AgNPs are comparable to that of a commercial formulation of silver sulfadiazine even though the newly prepared ointments contain a lower silver concentration. Therefore, the newly prepared AgNPs demonstrate potential for use as an attractive biocompatible nanocomposite for topical applications in the treatment of wounds.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - Culture proven newborn sepsis with a special emphasis on late onset sepsis caused by Enterobacteriaceae in a level III neonatal care unit in Astana, Kazakhstan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Newborn sepsis is one of the major public health concerns worldwide.  Also in our neonatal care unit, it is one of the major problems and especially infections with Enterobacteriaceae were noted to pose an increasing problem in the last years. METHODS: Data collection was done retrospectively for 2011. Early onset sepsis was defined as having a positive blood culture within 72 h and late onset sepsis after 72 h of delivery. RESULTS: Out of 599 patients being admitted, 58 newborns were assessed having a neonatal sepsis. Of these 58 newborns with sepsis, 11 were diagnosed within 72 h post delivery (early onset) and 47 were diagnosed after 72 h post delivery (late onset). The percentage of Enterobacteriaceae causing late onset sepsis was 57.5 %. Among these, Klebsiella pneumoniae could be isolated in 29.8 %, Enterobacter cloacae in 12.8 %, Enterobacter aerogenes in 8.5 %, and Escherichia coli in 6.4 % of late onset sepsis. Majority of the strains showed a resistance to antibiotics used in empiric treatment. Antibiotic prophylaxis/treatment from birth until the onset of late onset sepsis could be analyzed in 20 out of 27 newborns with late onset sepsis caused by Enterobacteriaceae. A regimen of empirical antibiotic treatment containing aminopenicillin and/or gentamicin was administered in 16 newborns and that of cephalosporin in 14 out of 20 newborns for at least 5 days before onset of sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: The association of empiric long-term antibiotic treatment and the high number of late onset sepsis with often multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae might be causal and urges for a change in general antibiotic prophylaxis/treatment in newborns admitted to the neonatal care unit of our hospital.
TI  - Relationship between the distribution of cefepime minimum inhibitory concentrations and detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production among clinically important Enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained from patients in intensive care units in Taiwan: results from the Surveillance of Multicenter Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART) in 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The data on susceptibility of important cephalosporins against four Enterobacteriaceae members producing potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) collected from Taiwanese intensive care units are lacking. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime were determined using agar dilution method, against Escherichia coli (n = 344), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 359), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 103), and Proteus mirabilis (n = 78). Susceptibilities of these isolates to three cephalosporins were assessed according to MIC breakpoints recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) in 2013. The double-disk synergy test using disks containing cefepime (30 mug) with or without clavulanate (10 mug) was applied to confirm production of ESBL for isolates with cephalosporin MIC >/= 2 mug/mL. RESULTS: A total of 175 isolates were verified as ESBL producers. The rates of cefepime susceptibility among the ESBL-producing isolates, according to CLSI (EUCAST) criteria, were 56.7% (22.4%) for E. coli, 61.3% (12.0%) for K. pneumoniae, 57.9% (31.6%) for E. cloacae, and 71.4% (7.1%) for P. mirabilis. Using different cefepime MIC breakpoints (MICs >/= 16 mug/mL recommended by CLSI criteria and >/= 2 mug/mL by EUCAST criteria) to define nonsusceptibility, we found that both criteria were poorer at predicting ESBL producers among K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae than among the other two species. In addition, we also found that the cefepime MIC level of 1.0 mug/mL best distinguished non-ESBL- from ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae. CONCLUSION: To detect ESBLs, CLSI should revise the cefepime MIC breakpoint against Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  - This study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Urine samples from patients with UTIs (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. The urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. Bacterial species were identified by a combination of bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the BACT-IST microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. The most common seven species of bacteria in the study included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis (CE). Each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. The mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. Further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (CFU)/mL, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (R(2)=0.99). The effect of urine composition on CE results was also investigated. The results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. The results demonstrated that the bacteria in urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using CE. The "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from UTIs.
TI  - Intercontinental spread of OXA-48 beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae over a 11-year period, 2001 to 2011.
AB  - OXA-48 beta-lactamase producers are emerging as an important threat mostly in the Mediterranean area. We report here the molecular epidemiology of a collection of OXA-48 beta-lactamase-positive enterobacterial isolates (n=107) recovered from European and north-African countries between January 2001 and December 2011. This collection included 67 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 24 Escherichia coli and 10 Enterobacter cloacae. Using the EUCAST breakpoints, ninety-eight isolates (91.6%) were of intermediate susceptibility or resistant to ertapenem, whereas 66% remained susceptible to imipenem. Seventy-five per cent of the isolates co-produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, most frequently CTX-M-15 (77.5%). Susceptibility testing to non-beta-lactam antibiotics showed that colistin, tigecycline, amikacin, and fosfomycin remain active against most of the isolates. Multilocus sequence typing indicated that the most common sequence types (ST) were ST101 and ST38 for K. pneumoniae and E. coli, respectively. The bla(OXA-48) gene was located on a 62 kb IncL/M plasmid in 92.5% of the isolates, indicating that a single plasmid was mainly responsible for the spread of that gene. In addition, this study identified multiple cases of importation of OXA-48 beta-lactamase producers at least in Europe, and spread of OXA-48 beta-lactamase producers giving rise to an endemic situation, at least in France.
TI  - Resistance and inactivation kinetics of bacterial strains isolated from the non-chlorinated and chlorinated effluents of a WWTP.
AB  - The microbiological quality of water from a wastewater treatment plant that uses  sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant was assessed. Mesophilic aerobic bacteria were not removed efficiently. This fact allowed for the isolation of several bacterial strains from the effluents. Molecular identification indicated that the strains were related to Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli (three strains), Enterobacter cloacae, Kluyvera cryocrescens (three strains), Kluyvera intermedia, Citrobacter freundii (two strains), Bacillus sp. and Enterobacter sp. The first five strains, which were isolated from the non-chlorinated effluent, were used to test resistance to chlorine disinfection using three sets of variables: disinfectant concentration (8, 20 and 30 mg.L(-1)), contact time (0, 15 and 30 min) and water temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). The results demonstrated that the strains have independent responses to experimental conditions and that the most efficient treatment was an 8 mg.L(-1) dose of disinfectant at a temperature of 20 degrees C for 30 min. The other eight strains, which were isolated from the chlorinated effluent, were used to analyze inactivation kinetics using the disinfectant at a dose of 15 mg.L(-1) with various retention times (0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min). The results indicated that during the inactivation process, there was no relationship between removal percentage and retention time and that the strains have no common response to the treatments.
TI  - Kinetics of avibactam inhibition against Class A, C, and D beta-lactamases.
AB  - Avibactam is a non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor with a spectrum of activity that includes beta-lactamase enzymes of classes A, C, and selected D examples. In this work acylation and deacylation rates were measured against the clinically important enzymes CTX-M-15, KPC-2, Enterobacter cloacae AmpC, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AmpC, OXA-10, and OXA-48. The efficiency of acylation (k2/Ki) varied across the enzyme spectrum, from 1.1 x 10(1) m(-1)s(-1) for OXA-10 to 1.0 x 10(5) for CTX-M-15. Inhibition of OXA-10 was shown to follow the covalent reversible mechanism, and the acylated OXA-10 displayed the longest residence time for deacylation, with a half-life of greater than 5 days. Across multiple enzymes, acyl enzyme stability was assessed by mass spectrometry. These inhibited enzyme forms were stable to rearrangement or hydrolysis, with the exception of KPC-2. KPC-2 displayed a slow hydrolytic route that involved fragmentation of the acyl-avibactam complex. The identity of released degradation products was investigated, and a possible mechanism for the slow deacylation from KPC-2 is proposed.
TI  - Genetic characterization and emergence of the metallo-beta-lactamase GIM-1 in Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacteriaceae during a long-term outbreak.
AB  - Since the first isolation in 2002, the metallo-beta-lactamase GIM-1 has not been  detected outside Germany. The data presented here, for 50 clinical blaGIM-1-positive isolates, including Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter freundii), collected between 2007 and 2012 at the original site in an ongoing outbreak, demonstrate a diverse genetic background and dissemination of the gene conferring resistance to enteric bacteria.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and AmpC-producing enterobacteria in healthy broiler chickens, Germany.
AB  - During 2010, we evaluated the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and AmpC-producing enterobacteria in broiler chickens at slaughter. Samples (70 carcasses and 51 ceca) from 4 flocks were analyzed by direct plating and after enrichment. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers were found in 88.6% and 72.5% of carcasses and ceca, respectively; AmpC producers were found in 52.9% and 56.9% of carcasses and ceca, respectively. Most isolates were identified as Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae (cecum) and Proteus mirabilis (carcass) were found in 2 samples each. Molecular characterization revealed the domination of CTX-M genes; plasmidic AmpC was CIT-like. Phylogenetic grouping of E. coli showed types A (31.5%), B1 (20.2%), B2 (13.5%), and D (34.8%). These findings provide evidence that healthy broilers in Germany are a source for the dissemination of transmissible resistance mechanisms in enterobacteria brought from the rearing environment into the food chain during slaughtering.
TI  - [Dissemination of blaIMP-8 among Enterobacteriaceae isolates from a Buenos Aires  Hospital].
AB  - From August 2008 to December 2011, six metallo-beta-lactamase-producing isolates, four Enterobacter cloacae, one Klebsiella oxytoca and one Citrobacter freundii, were detected at Hospital Interzonal General de Agudos "Evita" in Lanus. All six isolates showed multiresistant profiles and the presence of the blaIMP-8 gene. Five isolates also expressed PER-2 extended spectrum beta-lactamase. The blaIMP-8 gene was found as the first cassette in a class 1 integron. However, the 3 conserved sequence could not be detected in three isolates. In all cases, blaIMP-8 was transferred by conjugation to azide-resistant Escherichia coli J53. PFGE analysis revealed that the four E. cloacae isolates were not genetically related. These are the first metallo-beta-lactamases detected in this institution and our results suggest a possible intra- and inter-species horizontal dissemination of blaIMP-8.
TI  - Detection of the common resistance genes in Gram-negative bacteria using gene chip technology.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To design a resistance gene detection chip that could, in parallel, detect common clinical drug resistance genes of Gram-negative bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy clinically significant Gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii) were collected. According to the known resistance gene sequences, we designed and synthesized primers and probes, which were used to prepare resistance gene detection chips, and finally we hybridized and scanned the gene detection chips. RESULTS: The results between the gene chip and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were compared. The rate was consistently 100% in the eight kinds of resistance genes tested (TEM, SHV, CTX-M, DHA, CIT, VIM, KPC, OXA-23). One strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa had the IMP, but it was not found by gene chip. CONCLUSION: The design of Gram-negative bacteria-resistant gene detection chip had better application value.
TI  - Rapid bacterial whole-genome sequencing to enhance diagnostic and public health microbiology.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The latest generation of benchtop DNA sequencing platforms can provide an accurate whole-genome sequence (WGS) for a broad range of bacteria in less than a day. These could be used to more effectively contain the spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens. OBJECTIVE: To compare WGS with standard clinical microbiology practice for the investigation of nosocomial outbreaks caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, the identification of genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance, and typing of other clinically important pathogens. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A laboratory-based study of hospital inpatients with a range of bacterial infections at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, a secondary and tertiary referral center in England, comparing WGS with standard diagnostic microbiology using stored bacterial isolates and clinical information. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Specimens were taken and processed as part of routine clinical care, and cultured isolates stored and referred for additional reference laboratory testing as necessary. Isolates underwent DNA extraction and library preparation prior to sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Bioinformatic analyses were performed by persons blinded to the clinical, epidemiologic, and antimicrobial susceptibility data. RESULTS: We investigated 2 putative nosocomial outbreaks, one caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and the other by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae; WGS accurately discriminated between outbreak and nonoutbreak isolates and was superior to conventional typing methods. We compared WGS with standard methods for the identification of the mechanism of carbapenem resistance in a range of gram-negative bacteria (Acinetobacter baumannii, E cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). This demonstrated concordance between phenotypic and genotypic results, and the ability to determine whether resistance was attributable to the presence of carbapenemases or other resistance mechanisms. Whole-genome sequencing was used to recapitulate reference laboratory typing of clinical isolates of Neisseria meningitidis and to provide extended phylogenetic analyses of these. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The speed, accuracy, and depth of information provided by WGS platforms to confirm or refute outbreaks in hospitals and the community, and to accurately define transmission of multidrug-resistant and other organisms, represents an important advance.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a GH43 beta-xylosidase from Enterobacter sp. identified and cloned from forest soil bacteria.
AB  - The use of lignocellulosic biomass for second generation biofuels requires optimization of enzymatic breakdown of plant cell walls. In this work, cellulolytic bacteria were isolated from a native and two cultivated forest soil samples. Amplification of glycosyl hydrolases was attempted by using a low stringency-degenerate primer PCR strategy, using total soil DNA and bulk DNA pooled from positive colonies as template. A set of primers was designed based on Acidothermus cellulolyticus genome, by search of conserved domains of glycosyl hydrolases (GH) families of interest. Using this approach, a fragment containing an open reading frame (ORF) with 98% identity to a putative GH43 beta-xylosidase coding gene from Enterobacter cloacae was amplified and cloned. The full protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as N-terminal or C-terminal His-tagged fusions and purified under native conditions. Only N-terminal fusion protein, His-Xyl43, presented beta-xylosidase activity. On pNPX, optimal activity was achieved at pH 6 and 40 degrees C and Km and Kcat values were 2.92 mM and 1.32 seg(-1), respectively. Activity was also demonstrated on xylobiose (X2), with Km 17.8 mM and Kcat 380 s(-1). These results demonstrated that Xyl43 is a functional beta-xylosidase and it is the first evidence of this activity for Enterobacter sp.
TI  - Complete sequence of pSAM7, an IncX4 plasmid carrying a novel blaCTX-M-14b transposition unit isolated from Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae from cattle.
AB  - The same plasmid carrying blaCTX-M-14b was identified from an Escherichia coli isolate and an Enterobacter cloacae isolate collected from cattle in the United Kingdom by complete plasmid sequencing. This 35,341-bp plasmid, pSAM7, had an IncX4 backbone that is 99% identical to that of pJIE143 from a human isolate in Australia. PCR screening identified pSAM7-like plasmids in three other E. coli isolates of different multilocus sequence types isolated from cattle on different farms in the United Kingdom.
TI  - Multiclonal dispersal of KPC genes following the emergence of non-ST258 KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae clones in Madrid, Spain.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse the ongoing epidemiology of KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae after a non-ST258 KPC-3-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae outbreak in a university hospital in Madrid, Spain. METHODS: Enterobacterial isolates (one per patient based on bacterial identification and typing patterns) with carbapenem MICs higher than the EUCAST epidemiological cut-off values, a positive modified Hodge test and carbapenem/boronic acid combination disc test results were studied (16 March 2010 to 31 January 2012) and compared with KPC-producing isolates previously described in our institution (September 2009 to February 2010). The bacterial population structure (PFGE and multilocus sequence typing), carbapenemase genes and KPC plasmids were studied. Patients' clinical records were reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-four KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae (20 K. pneumoniae, 2 Escherichia coli and 2 Enterobacter cloacae) from 23 patients (13 males, median age 72 years) were studied. Most KPC-producer strains were considered as colonizers. Six K. pneumoniae clones (ST11, ST20, ST384, ST454, ST659 and ST971), two E. coli clones (ST224 and ST357) and one E. cloacae clone were identified. blaKPC-3 was located on IncFIIK plasmids of approximately 100 kb (E. coli ST357 and K. pneumoniae ST384, ST454, ST659 and ST971 clones) and on IncN plasmids of approximately 40 kb (K. pneumoniae ST11 clone). Non-typeable plasmids of approximately 20 kb containing blaKPC-2 were detected in scarcely represented clones (K. pneumoniae ST20, E. coli ST224 and E. cloacae). CONCLUSIONS: During the 2 year period following the emergence of non-ST258 KPC-3-producing K. pneumoniae isolates in our institution, the blaKPC-3 and blaKPC-2 genes efficiently penetrated other Enterobacteriaceae lineages. Non-ST258 K. pneumoniae isolates were mostly responsible for the dissemination of KPC enzymes, producing a complex epidemiological picture.
TI  - Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase 1 in Enterobacteria, Ontario, Canada.
AB  
TI  - New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, United States.
AB  - We characterized 9 New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae  (5 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Salmonella enterica serovar Senftenberg) isolates identified in the United States and cultured from 8 patients in 5 states during April 2009-March 2011. Isolates were resistant to beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides, demonstrated MICs </=1 microg/mL of colistin and polymyxin, and yielded positive metallo-beta-lactamase screening results. Eight isolates had blaNDM-1, and 1 isolate had a novel allele (blaNDM-6). All 8 patients had recently been in India or Pakistan, where 6 received inpatient health care. Plasmids carrying blaNDM frequently carried AmpC or extended spectrum beta-lactamase genes. Two K. pneumoniae isolates and a K. pneumoniae isolate from Sweden shared incompatibility group A/C plasmids with indistinguishable restriction patterns and a common blaNDM fragment; all 3 were multilocus sequence type 14. Restriction profiles of the remaining New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase plasmids, including 2 from the same patient, were diverse.
TI  - Internalisation potential of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus in lettuce seedlings and mature plants.
AB  - The internalisation potential of Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium in lettuce was evaluated using seedlings grown in vermiculite in seedling trays as well as hydroponically grown lettuce. Sterile distilled water was spiked with one of the four human pathogenic bacteria (10(5) CFU/mL) and used to irrigate the plants. The potential for pathogen internalisation was investigated over time using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and viable plate counts. Additionally, the identities of the pathogens isolated from internal lettuce plant tissues were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction with pathogen-specific oligonucleotides. Internalisation of each of the human pathogens was evident in both lettuce seedlings and hydroponically grown mature lettuce plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. aureus internalisation in lettuce plants. In addition, the levels of background microflora in the lettuce plants were determined by plate counting and the isolates identified using matrix-assisted laser ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF). Background microflora assessments confirmed the absence of the four pathogens evaluated in this study. A low titre of previously described endophytes and soil inhabitants, i.e., Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Lysinibacillus fusiformis, Rhodococcus rhodochrous, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis were identified.
TI  - Intravenous colistin for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections in critically ill pediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Nosocomial infection due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens in ICUs is a challenge for clinicians and microbiologists and has led to the resurgence of IV colistin use in the last decade. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of IV colistin in the treatment of critically ill children with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective descriptive study conducted in the PICU of Maulana Azad Medical College and associated Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, Delhi, India, during the period of January 2010 to December 2011. PATIENTS: The records of critically ill children with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections treated with IV colistin were reviewed. RESULTS: Fifty critically ill children received IV colistin; their median age was 36 months (range: 1 mo-12 yr), with male:female ratio of 3:2. The isolated pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae. Mean duration of colistin therapy was 14.3 days (range, 7-21). A favorable clinical outcome occurred in 36 children (72%), and 14 children (28%) died due to severe sepsis with multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome. Renal toxicity occurred in five children and was associated with multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome in three and coadministration of vancomycin in two. No neurotoxic adverse effects due to colistin therapy were reported. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that IV colistin may have a role in the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in critically ill children, but further prospective and randomized control trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in children.
TI  - Evaluation of brilliance CRE agar for the detection of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the performance of the new chromogenic medium BrillianceTM CREAgar (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for determining the limit of detection of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteria (CRE). A total of 70 clinical isolates were studied. Of these, 30 were well-characterized CRE, including Klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing KPC-, VIM-, and OXA-type enzymes, VIM-positive Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli, NDM-positive E. coli, and enterobacterial isolates characterized by porin loss associated with ESBL production or AmpC hyperproduction. Ten carbapenem-resistant non-fermentative isolates were also included as well as 30 carbapenem-susceptible isolates. Carbapenem-resistant strains were inoculated at three different concentrations onto Brilliance CRE Agar (from 1.5x101 CFU/ml up to 1.5x104 CFU/ml) whereas carbapenem-susceptible isolates were inoculated at a concentration of 1.5x102 CFU/ml. The medium sustained the growth of carbapenem-resistant isolates, showing detection limits from 1.5x101 CFU/ml (in 31/40 cases) to 1.5x104 CFU/ml. No growth was observed with carbapenem-sensitive control strains. Our results indicate that the Brilliance CRE Agar allows the growth of carbapenem-resistant isolates with low detection limits and could represent a useful screening medium for both enterobacteria and non-fermentative Gram-negative strains resistant to carbapenems.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in patients with or without cancer in a large community hospital.
AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer is associated with an increased risk of acquiring bloodstream infection (BSIs). Most knowledge on pathogens and outcome are derived from specialised cancer centres. We here sought to compare causative micro-organisms in BSIs in patients with or without cancer in a 600-bed teaching community hospital. METHODS: We analysed all positive blood cultures from adult patients between January 2005 and January 2011. RESULTS: A total of 4,918 episodes of BSI occurred in 2,891 patients, of whom 13.4% had a diagnosis of cancer (85.5% with a solid tumour). In both patient groups, Gram-positive isolates were more prevalent (58.7 and 61.4% in patients with and without cancer, respectively) than Gram-negative isolates (31.8 and 32.3%, respectively). Amongst Gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci were the most frequently isolated in both patient groups; in cancer patients, twice as many BSIs were caused by Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Amongst Gram-negative organisms, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate; in cancer patients, twice as many BSIs were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. Yeasts were grown from 3.0% of blood cultures from cancer patients compared to 1.5% of cultures from non-cancer patients. Cancer patients had a 90-day mortality of 35.8% following BSI compared to 23.5% in patients without cancer. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate distinct BSI pathogens and impaired outcomes in patients with cancer in the setting of a large community teaching hospital.
TI  - High prevalence of VIM-4 and NDM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase among carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify the mechanisms leading to carbapenem resistance among multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from hospitalized patients with nosocomial infections in Mubarak Al Kabeer Hospital, Kuwait. Fourteen carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates were obtained from inpatients in different wards and intensive care units between April 2009 and February 2011. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using the E-test method. Genes encoding beta-lactamases were characterized by specific PCR amplification, sequencing and conjugation assays. All isolates were identified as metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) producers using phenotypic and molecular methods. Eleven of the 14 isolates produced VIM-4 (six Klebsiella pneumoniae, three Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter cloacae and one Klebsiella oxytoca). Three K. pneumoniae isolates produced the MBL NDM-1 and co-produced the plasmid-encoded AmpC CMY-4. The VIM-4-producing isolates co-produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases including CTX-M-15 and some SHV derivatives. The VIM-4 gene was not transferable by conjugation studies of six selected strains. We demonstrated here the emergence of VIM-4- and NDM-1-producing isolates in the largest teaching hospital in Kuwait.
TI  - [Investigation of the presence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) by PCR in carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates].
AB  - Bacteria producing New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. This broad-spectrum resistance limits treatment options for infections caused by NDM-1 producers. NDM-1 was first isolated from an Indian patient in Sweden; since then, NDM-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including Turkey. In this study, we investigated the presence of NDM-1 by PCR method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in Samsun, Turkey. A total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 Acinetobacter baumannii, 54 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 Pseudomonas putida, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 3 Enterobacter aerogenes, 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Providencia rettgeri, 2 Escherichia coli and 1 Citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. Identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using Vitek-2 Compact (bioMerieux, France) and BD Phoenix (BD Diagnostic Systems, MD) automated systems. The results of antibiotic susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the CLSI recommendations. In our study, NDM-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by PCR. There was only one case study that reported the presence of NDM-1 in clinical isolates from Turkey [Poirel L et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2012;56:2784]. Our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of NDM-1 in clinical isolates is not common in Turkey. However, since NDM-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. Therefore, continuous surveillance and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of NDM-1 may enable to identify NDM-1 producing isolates. Meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of NDM-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.
TI  - Appropriateness of empirical treatment and outcome in bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
AB  - We studied clinical characteristics, appropriateness of initial antibiotic treatment, and other factors associated with day 30 mortality in patients with bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria in eight Dutch hospitals. Retrospectively, information was collected from 232 consecutive patients with ESBL bacteremia (due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae) between 2008 and 2010. In this cohort (median age of 65 years; 24 patients were <18 years of age), many had comorbidities, such as malignancy (34%) or recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) (15%). One hundred forty episodes (60%) were nosocomial, 54 (23%) were otherwise health care associated, and 38 (16%) were community acquired. The most frequent sources of infection were UTI (42%) and intra-abdominal infection (28%). Appropriate therapy within 24 h after bacteremia onset was prescribed to 37% of all patients and to 54% of known ESBL carriers. The day 30 mortality rate was 20%. In a multivariable analysis, a Charlson comorbidity index of >/= 3, an age of >/= 75 years, intensive care unit (ICU) stay at bacteremia onset, a non-UTI bacteremia source, and presentation with severe sepsis, but not inappropriate therapy within <24 h (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 3.45), were associated with day 30 mortality. Further assessment of confounding and a stratified analysis for patients with UTI and non-UTI origins of infection did not reveal a statistically significant effect of inappropriate therapy on day 30 mortality, and these results were insensitive to the possible misclassification of patients who had received beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations or ceftazidime as initial treatment. In conclusion, ESBL bacteremia occurs mostly in patients with comorbidities requiring frequent hospitalization, and 84% of episodes were health care associated. Factors other than inappropriate therapy within <24 h determined day 30 mortality.
TI  - Changes in fluoroquinolone resistance over 5 years (CANWARD 2007-11) in bacterial pathogens isolated in Canadian hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyse Canadian national surveillance data, specifically fluoroquinolone resistance, from 2007 to 2011 inclusive, to determine trends in resistance over time and to assess correlations with patient demographic factors. METHODS: All isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae collected by the 10 sites that participated in the annual CANWARD surveillance studies in each of the 5 years were included in this analysis. A multifactorial logistic regression model was used to determine the variables with significant impact on fluoroquinolone resistance. RESULTS: The proportion of E. coli isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin increased significantly (P = 0.0005) between 2007 (20.0%) and 2011 (29.2%), although similar increases were not seen in K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae (tested against levofloxacin) (P > 0.05). Among isolates of S. aureus, there was a significant decrease in ciprofloxacin resistance from 34.4% in 2007 to 24.6% in 2011 (P < 0.0001). Resistance to ciprofloxacin was a component of most multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli, primarily among urine isolates, and a significant decrease in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus occurred between 2007 and 2011. Notably, MDR isolates were frequently fluoroquinolone resistant for all organisms studied, except S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Influence of clinical breakpoint changes from CLSI 2009 to EUCAST 2011 antimicrobial susceptibility testing guidelines on multidrug resistance rates of Gram-negative rods.
AB  - Multidrug resistance (MDR) rates of Gram-negative rods were analyzed comparing CLSI 2009 and EUCAST 2011 antibiotic susceptibility testing guidelines. After EUCAST 2011 was applied, the MDR rates increased for Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.7%), and Escherichia coli (0.4%). A total of 24% of Enterobacteriaceae MDR isolates and 12% of P. aeruginosa MDR isolates were categorized as MDR due to breakpoint changes.
TI  - Distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases among Enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections in the Asia-Pacific region: results of the study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART).
AB  - The increasing trend of beta-lactam resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide threat. Enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections (IAI) from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) collected in 2008 and 2009 from the Asia-Pacific region were investigated. Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases was performed by multiplex PCR. A total of 699 Enterobacteriaceae isolates with positive genotypic results, included Escherichia coli (n = 443), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 45), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), Citrobacter freundii (n = 5), Proteus mirabilis (n = 3), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2), Morganella morganii (n = 2), and one each of Enterobacter asburiae, Proteus vulgaris, and Providencia rettgeri were analyzed. Nearly 20% of these beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were from community-associated IAI. CTX-M (588 isolates, including 428 [72.8%] with CTX-M-15) was the most common ESBL, followed by SHV (n = 59) and TEM (n = 4). CMY (n = 110, including 102 [92.7%] with CMY-2) was the most common AmpC beta-lactamase, followed by DHA (n = 46) and ACT/MIR (n = 40). NDM (n = 65, including 62 [95.4%] with NDM-1) was the most common carbapenemase, followed by IMP (n = 7) and OXA (n = 7). Isolates from hospital-associated IAI had more complicated beta-lactamase combinations than isolates from the community. Carbapenemases were all exclusively detected in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from India, except that IMP beta-lactamases were also detected in Philippines and Australia. CTX-M beta-lactamases were the predominant ESBLs produced by Enterobacteriaceae causing IAI in the Asia-Pacific region. Emergence of CTX-M-15-, CMY-2-, and NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in this area.
TI  - Emergence and spread of NDM-1 producer Enterobacteriaceae with contribution of IncX3 plasmids in the United Arab Emirates.
AB  - Among 28 clinically relevant, carbapenem non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected in 2009-2011 in the United Arab Emirates three Klebsiella pneumoniae, two Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter cloacae and one Citrobacter freundi were identified to produce NDM-1 carbapenemase. Unexpectedly, with the exception of a K. pneumoniae strain, sequence type ST11, originally acquired in India and subsequently spread nosocomially in the UAE, the majority of the strains could not be directly linked to foreign travel. All isolates harboured the blaNDM-1 gene on plasmids of IncA/C, IncHI1b and IncX3 types, or were untypable. IncX3 type plasmids with a mass of 50 kb and with the same or highly similar restriction patterns, with regions flanking the blaNDM-1 gene identical to the IncX3 NDM plasmids described from China were present in three different species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and C. freundii. Our findings strongly support the assumptions that, beyond the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East is an important reservoir of NDM-producing organisms. Furthermore, we also provide evidence that IncX3 plasmids, recently implicated in the spread of blaNDM-1 in China, have been widely distributed and are important vehicles of the inter-species spread of the NDM-1 gene.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of new 2-azetidinones with sulfonamide structures.
AB  - New series of N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamides 4a1-6, 4b1-6 and N-(4-aryl-3-chloro-2-oxoazetidin-1-yl)aminoacetyl sulfonamides 5a1-6, 5b1-6 were synthesized. The structures of the new derivatives was confirmed using spectral methods (FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR). The antibacterial activities of these compounds against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6583, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 25912) and Gram negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae CIP 53153, Proteus vulgaris CIP 104989, Citrobacter freundii CIP 5732, Enterobacter cloacae CIP 103475, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa CIP 82118) bacterial strains were evaluated using the broth micro-dilution method. Compound 4a2 displayed the highest antibacterial activity, especially against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antioxidant potential of the synthesized compounds was also investigated according to ferric reducing power, total antioxidant activity and DPPH radical scavenging assays. All tested compounds showed excellent antioxidant activity in comparison with sulfadiazine and sulfisoxazole which were used as parent sulfonamides. Moreover, some of them showed an antioxidant activity comparable with that of ascorbic acid. In general, the compounds designed based on a sulfadiazine skeleton (compounds 4a1-6, 5a1-6) are more active than those obtained from sulfisoxazole (compounds 4b1-6, 5b1-6), and the N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamide derivatives 4a1-6, 4b1-6 are more active than their azetidionone analogues 5a1-6, 5b1-6.
TI  - Microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute COPD exacerbation in daily clinical practice: comparison to current guidelines.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate current microbiological approaches, microbiology, and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in clinical practice and to compare them with current international guidelines. METHODS: A total of 362 patients with suspected CAP were enrolled in 14 European centers in a prospective multicenter study. RESULTS: A total of 279 inpatients (CAP, n = 222; AECOPD, n = 57) were evaluated. A total of 83 (37 %) CAP patients and 25 (44 %) AECOPD patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. In patients with CAP/AECOPD, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. The most frequent pathogens in CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter cloacae; in AECOPD they were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. All CAP patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of AECOPD patients (mean = 8.9 days) received antibiotics. CAP patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and AECOPD patients were given mostly cephalosporins. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens isolated in CAP and AECOPD and the antibiotic therapy used are in good accordance with the guidelines. Blood culture, recommended for all CAP patients, was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. Therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. This duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. Therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens in first febrile urinary tract infection affect breakthrough  infections in infants with vesicoureteral reflux treated with prophylactic antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in infants with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and whether bacterial pathogen affected breakthrough UTI or not. METHODS: We compared children with infantile VUR with recurrent UTI (33 males, 11 females, mean age 3.2 months) and without recurrent UTI (40 males, 7 females, mean age 4.8 months). The following were compared between the 2 groups: sex, timing of UTI episode, bacterial growth on urine culture, degree and bilaterality of the reflux, hydronephrosis, renal scar, and delayed ureteral excretion of refluxed contrast on voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). RESULTS: Univariate Cox survival-time regression showed that younger age at first UTI, a non-Escherichia coli strain, bilateral and VUR, high-grade VUR, and hydronephrosis on initial ultrasonography (USG) significantly increased the risks of recurrent UTI (P <.05 each). In multivariate analysis, timing of the UTI episode (P = .015), a non-E. coli strain (P = .003), high grade (P = .012), and bilateral VUR (P = .002) were independently associated with increased risk of recurrent UTI. Non-E. coli strains were identified in 60% and 33% of infants with and without recurrent UTI, respectively. CONCLUSION: During the first year of life, the earlier the first UTI then the higher the chance is for recurrent UTIs. Higher grades of reflux, bilateral VUR, and the first infection by a non-E. coli strain all significantly increase the risk of recurrent UTIs.
TI  - In vitro activity of doripenem plus fosfomycin against drug-resistant clinical blood isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of doripenem in combination with fosfomycin was evaluated against a wide range of clinical blood isolates. Bacterial isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 39), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 18), multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli (n = 10), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 3) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 5) were investigated. For synergism testing the checkerboard test was applied and determined by calculation of the fractional inhibitory concentration index. Checkerboard results were verified by time-kill curve tests on selected isolates. Among MRSA, E. coli and K. pneumoniae, 94.9, 80 and 100% of isolates demonstrated synergism, respectively. Selected isolates demonstrated synergism in time-kill curve tests. P. aeruginosa isolates demonstrated no interaction in all isolates. Doripenem plus fosfomycin shows high efficacy with promising results in vitro.
TI  - The management gram-negative bacterial haematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis: a case series of diagnosis, treatment and therapeutic outcomes.
AB  - PURPOSE: The incidence of gram-negative bacterial haematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis (GNB HVO) is increasing. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with this type of infection in an effort to gain an improved understanding of the current clinical presentation, management and outcome. METHODS: Between May 2007 and May 2010, all patients, over the age of 18 years, suffering from GNB HVO were identified and their microbiological diagnoses were evaluated. RESULTS: This study identified seventy-nine patients with haematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis (HVO). Of these seventy-nine patients, 10 patients (12.66%) had Gram-negative organisms isolated. These organisms included Escherichia coli (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Klebsiella pneumonia (1), Haemophilus influenza (1) and Enterobacter cloacae (1). Eight patients were successfully treated with antibiotics and/or surgery. Of the eight patients whose HVO was cured, five had Ciprofloxacin as part of their definitive antibiotic regime. CONCLUSION: The treatment of GNB HVO is often challenging because of unpredictable resistance patterns and limited published data on effective treatment regimens. Our study has highlighted the need for prompt microbiological sampling and initiation of early appropriate antibiotic regime. The most effective treatment for GNB HVO was with oral Ciprofloxacin over a period of 6-8 weeks.
TI  - Carbapenem susceptibilities and non-susceptibility concordance to different carbapenems amongst clinically important Gram-negative bacteria isolated from intensive care units in Taiwan: results from the Surveillance of Multicentre Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART) in 2009.
AB  - To investigate the in vitro susceptibilities to various carbapenems amongst clinical Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients in intensive care units of ten major teaching hospitals in Taiwan in 2009, a survey was conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem and doripenem against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n = 594), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 185), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 192) and Burkholderia cepacia (n = 23) using the agar dilution method. Susceptibilities were determined according to 2009, 2011 and 2012 MIC breakpoints recommended by the CLSI as well as 2012 MIC breakpoints recommended by EUCAST. Based on CLSI 2012 criteria, the ertapenem susceptible rate was 93%, 81%, 68% and 92% for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, respectively. All Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii isolates were susceptible to ertapenem; however, 64% of P. mirabilis and all M. morganii isolates were non-susceptible to imipenem. Meropenem and doripenem had better activities than imipenem against ertapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates. E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae with ertapenem MICs>/=4 mg/L were synchronously not susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem. Imipenem susceptibility was 65% and 29% for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, respectively. Additionally, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates with imipenem MICs>/=8 mg/L were also not susceptible to meropenem and doripenem. These data provide a better understanding of choosing appropriate carbapenem agents to treat infections caused by ertapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae as well as P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates with imipenem MICs>/=4 mg/L.
TI  - Serum in vivo and in vitro activity of single dose of ertapenem in surgical obese patients for prevention of SSIs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite progress made in the control of post-operative infections, the incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) is still high. An improper perioperative antibiotic use can expose patients to the risk of resistant microorganisms, and, in surgical obese patients, the drug dosage and infusion time are critical points. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ertapenem in the prophylaxis of SSIs in obese patients undergoing general or bariatric surgery. METHODS: A total of 63 obese patients, candidates for several surgical interventions, were enrolled and divided into two groups. Patients received antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery: the case group received venous infusion of ertapenem; the control group received standard prophylaxis. Serum samples were tested for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. RESULTS: After single-dose ertapenem in obese patients, we registered in vitro activity of sera against the growth of non-extended beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and non-ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Moreover, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans were also inhibited. We found in vivo efficacy according to clinical monitoring: at the weekly and monthly follow-ups, one patient in the case group and six patients in the control group presented superficial incisional SSIs. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results are suggestive of the efficacy of ertapenem in perioperative prophylaxis of SSIs in obese patients; however, they need to be confirmed by further investigations and more defined trials.
TI  - Prevalence and epidemiological relationship of CMY-2 AmpC beta-lactamase and CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli isolates from broiler farms in Japan.
AB  - To evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC)-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in broiler chickens, 41 rectal samples taken from 4 commercial farms were examined. Desoxycholate hydrogen sulfide lactose agars, supplemented with either 4 mug/ml cefotaxime or 16 mug/ml ceftazidime, were used to screen ESC-resistant bacteria. ESC-resistant bacteria were isolated from all samples. Of the 164 ESC-resistant bacteria (included 4 isolates per a sample), 163 were Escherichia coli, while 1 isolate was identified as Enterobacter cloacae. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase genes in the isolates were determined by PCR and sequencing. One AmpC beta-lactamase gene, bla(CMY-2) (66%), and 4 ESBL genes, bla(CTX-M-1) (26%), bla(CTX-M-55) (10%), bla(SHV-5) (4%) and bla(CTX-M-2) (3%), were detected in the E. coli isolates. The epidemiological relationship of the CMY-2 and CTX-M beta-lactamase-producing isolates among the farms was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using the XbaI restriction enzyme. Forty-one (Y1-Y41) and 14 (X1-X14) clusters were found in the CMY-2 and CTX-M-carrying E. coli isolates, respectively. Some clusters included isolates derived from more than 1 farm, indicating some cross-contamination of clonal strains and spread of CMY-2 AmpC beta-lactamase or CTX-M ESBL among the farms.
TI  - "Down the drain": carbapenem-resistant bacteria in intensive care unit patients and handwashing sinks.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinical utility of carbapenem antibiotics is under threat because of the emergence of acquired metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) genes. We describe an outbreak in an intensive care unit (ICU) possibly associated with contaminated sinks. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Four clusters of gram-negative bacteria harbouring the MBL gene blaIMP-4 were detected in the ICU at Dandenong Hospital between November 2009 and July 2012. Epidemiological investigations were undertaken in order to identify a common point source. During September 2012, screening using rectal swabs for all ICU patients, and environmental swabs targeting all ICU handwashing sinks and taps were collected. Samples were cultured onto selective carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) agar. Suspected CRE isolates were further characterised using the modified Hodge test and VITEK 2 and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing of MBL genes. Clinical and environmental CRE isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Ten clinical isolates and one screening isolate of CRE (consisting of Klebsiella pneumoniae [5], Serratia marcescens [4], Enterobacter cloacae [1] and Escherichia coli [1]) were detected with the blaIMP-4 gene over the 30-03 period. S. marcescens was isolated persistently from the grating and drain of eight central sinks. Molecular typing confirmed that clinical and environmental isolates were related. Tap water cultures were negative. Several attempts to clean and decontaminate the sinks using detergents and steam cleaning proved unsuccessful. CONCLUSION: This report highlights the importance of identification of potential environmental reservoirs, such as sinks, for control of outbreaks of environmentally hardy multiresistant organisms.
TI  - Faecal carriage of oxyiminocephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae among paediatric units in different hospitals in the south of France.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the presence of oxyiminocephalosporin-resistant (OCR) Gram-negative bacilli and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates in stool specimens obtained from paediatric patients hospitalised for acute diarrhoea. We conducted a prospective, multicentre study over a period of 6 months in seven hospitals in the south of France. Samplings were carried out from infants admitted for acute diarrhoea with no previous antibiotic treatment in the last week. Bacteria in stool specimens were screened for the presence of OCR Gram-negative bacilli on Drigalski agar supplemented with ceftazidime and ESBL CHROMagar(R) media, and confirmed by the Rosco tablets test. Genetic detection was performed by the Check MDR(R) microarray and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing with bacterial DNA extracted from isolates. The presence of OCR enterobacteria was markedly high (177/1,118 patients, 15.2 %), with an important community origin (66.1 %). The majority of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria were Enterobacter cloacae (106, 59.9 %) and Escherichia coli (61, 34.5 %). The prevalence of ESBL and CTX-M producers represented 5.2 and 4.3 % of the isolates, respectively. The main proportion of these ESBL carriers was found in children less than 1 year of age (53.4 %). One carbapenemase (IMP-1) was detected. The study revealed the wide dissemination of MDR bacteria in infants attending hospitals in the south of France during a non-outbreak situation, in particular, the spread of cefotaximase and the detection of a carbapenemase. This worrisome situation must reinforce the use of hygiene procedures and appropriate antibiotics to control the emergence and spread of OCR organisms.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria convert glucosinolates to nitriles efficiently yet differently from enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Glucosinolates from the genus Brassica can be converted into bioactive compounds  known to induce phase II enzymes, which may decrease the risk of cancers. Conversion via hydrolysis is usually by the brassica enzyme myrosinase, which can be inactivated by cooking or storage. We examined the potential of three beneficial bacteria, Lactobacillus plantarum KW30, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis KF147, and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, and known myrosinase-producer Enterobacter cloacae to catalyze the conversion of glucosinolates in broccoli extract. Enterobacteriaceae consumed on average 65% glucoiberin and 78% glucoraphanin, transforming them into glucoiberverin and glucoerucin, respectively, and small amounts of iberverin nitrile and erucin nitrile. The lactic acid bacteria did not accumulate reduced glucosinolates, consuming all at 30-33% and transforming these into iberverin nitrile, erucin nitrile, sulforaphane nitrile, and further unidentified metabolites. Adding beneficial bacteria to a glucosinolate-rich diet may increase glucosinolate transformation, thereby increasing host exposure to bioactives.
TI  - Characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and carbapenemase-producing  Enterobacteriaceae Isolates from rivers and lakes in Switzerland.
AB  - One of the currently most relevant resistance mechanisms in Enterobacteriaceae is the production of enzymes that lead to modern expanded-spectrum cephalosporin and even carbapenem resistance, mainly extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases. A worrisome aspect is the spread of ESBL and carbapenemase producers into the environment. The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and to further characterize ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in rivers and lakes in Switzerland. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 21 (36.2%) of the 58 bodies of water sampled. One river sample tested positive for a carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strain. Seventy-four individual strains expressing an ESBL phenotype were isolated. Species identification revealed 60 Escherichia coli strains, seven Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strains, five Raoultella planticola strains, one Enterobacter cloacae strain, and one Enterobacter amnigenus strain. Three strains were identified as SHV-12 ESBL producers, and 71 strains carried genes encoding CTX-M ESBLs. Of the 71 strains with CTX-M ESBL genes, 8 isolates expressed CTX-M-1, three produced CTX-M-3, 46 produced CTX-M-15, three produced CTX-M-55, one produced CTX-M-79, six produced CTX-M-14, and four produced CTX-M-27. Three of the four CTX-M-27 producers belonged to the multiresistant pandemic sequence type E. coli B2:ST131 that is strongly associated with potentially severe infections in humans and animals.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus- the predominant pathogen in the neonatal ICU of a tertiary care hospital in amritsar, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An early treatment and the appropriate and the rational use of antibiotics would minimize the risk of severe morbidity and mortality in neonatal sepsis, and reduce the emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms in intensive care units. For the success of an early empiric treatment, a periodic review of the cases to assess any changing trends in the infecting organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility is important. AIM: To study the most commonly encountered bacterial pathogens which caused neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity patterns, so that guidelines could be prepared for a rational antibiotic therapy. SETTING AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective study which was conducted in the Department of Microbiology and the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at SGRDIMSAR, Amritsar, during June 2011 to June 2012. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Blood specimens for culture were drawn from 311 newborns who were admitted in an NICU with sepsis. The specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth. Subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. The isolates were identified by doing standard biochemical tests. The antibiotic resistance patterns of the isolates were studied by the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: A total of 131 organisms were isolated from the 311 blood cultures. These included Staphylococcus aureus (n=68), Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (n=30), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=10), Acinetobacter baumannii (n=9), Escherichia coli (n=05), Enterobacter cloacae (n=04), Citrobacter diversus (n=02), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=02) and Candida (n=01). Staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen in both early and late-onset sepsis. On antibiotic sensitivity testing, 57.35% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. More than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to amikacin. The resistance to the third generation cephalosporins varied between 50-55%. The resistance to ciprofloxacin was quite high; however, most of the isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin. A majority of the isolates were susceptible to piperacillin- tazobactum and imipenem. CONCLUSION: The present study emphasized the importance of periodic surveys on the microbial flora which was encountered in particular neonatal settings to recognize the trend.
TI  - Enterobacteriaceae infections of very low birth weight infants in Polish neonatal intensive care units: resistance and cross-transmission.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims of our study were analysis of the occurrence of infections by members of the Enterobacteriaceae family in 6 Polish neonatal intensive care units in 2009, their drug resistance, the epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains and the possibility of using modern tools of microbiology diagnosis in infection control, especially for the reduction of antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: A prospective surveillance covered 910 newborns. Case patients were defined as neonates with very low birth weight who had clinical signs of septicemia, pneumonia or necrotizing enterocolitis. Early-onset infection was defined as infection diagnosed within 3 days after delivery. RESULTS: The incidence of Enterobacteriaceae infections was 2.6/1000 patient-days. The risk of Enterobacteriaceae pneumonia increased with the length of hospitalization (P = 0.0356). The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli (12.4% of all strains, in early-onset infection 18.5%) and Klebsiella spp. (9.1% of all). The ESBL phenotype was found in 37% of isolates, of which 89.3% were producing CTX-M-type, 70.2% TEM-type and 8.5% SHV-type. Epidemic clones were detected in the 2 studied neonatal intensive care units: 6 of the 9 ESBL-positive Enterobacter cloacae and 16 of the 18 ESBL-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae strains were classified into 1 epidemic clone, which showed resistance to penicillin without inhibitors, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, cephalosporins, aztreoname, aminoglycosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSIONS: Enterobacteriaceae bacilli are a significant problem in neonatal intensive care units, especially in early-onset infection and for long hospitalized very low birth weight infants. The observed high drug resistance was in large part related to the dominance of epidemic strains as a result of horizontal transmission. The best way to reduce drug resistance would be adequate procedures of isolation and hand hygiene.
TI  - Surveillance of hospital-acquired central line-associated bloodstream infections  in pediatric hematology-oncology patients: lessons learned, challenges ahead.
AB  - Across 36 US pediatric oncology centers, 576 central line-associated bloodstream  infections (CLABSIs) were reported over a 21-month period. Most infections occurred in those with leukemia and/or profound neutropenia. The contribution of viridans streptococci infections was striking. Study findings depict the contemporary epidemiology of CLABSIs in hospitalized pediatric cancer patients.
TI  - Susceptibility patterns to extended-spectrum cephalosporins among Enterobacteriaceae harbouring extended-spectrum beta-lactamases using the updated Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute interpretive criteria.
AB  - We examined the effect of applying the updated 2010 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) susceptibility breakpoints for extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. In total, 202 ESBL-producing, plasmidic AmpC- and carbapenemase-negative isolates derived from separate patients were collected from three Greek hospitals during 2007-2011, including 150 Escherichia coli, 43 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 9 Enterobacter cloacae clinical isolates. ESBLs were detected using the ESBL CLSI confirmatory test and PCR assays. Sequencing analysis showed that 91 (45.0%) of the ESBL-producers carried the bla(CTX-M-3) gene, 66 (32.7%) carried the bla(CTX-M-15) gene and the remaining 45 (22.3%) carried the bla(SHV-5) gene. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefepime were determined by the agar dilution method. Based on the new CLSI breakpoints, 13 (6.4%) of the ESBL-producers were susceptible to cefotaxime, 90 (44.6%) to ceftazidime and 112 (55.4%) to cefepime; as many as 145 (71.8%) were susceptible to at least one ESC. Among the 150 E. coli, 12 (8.0%), 87 (58.0%) and 79 (52.7%) were susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefepime, respectively, whilst among the 43 K. pneumoniae, 1 (2.3%), 3 (7.0%) and 25 (58.1%) were susceptible to the above ESCs, respectively. None of the nine E. cloacae were susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but all except one were susceptible to cefepime. By implementation of the new 2010 CLSI breakpoints, a considerable proportion of ESBL-possessing Enterobacteriaceae would be reported as susceptible, mostly to ceftazidime and cefepime, leading to possible infection control and therapeutic implications.
TI  - Pathogen diagnosis of children sepsis by LAMP technology.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore a rapid diagnostic method in neonatal sepsis and bacterial  meningitis. METHODS: The primers were designed and synthesized based on 16S rRNA gene of Staphylococcus aureus. Four specimens of Staphylococcus aureus, 16 specimens of coagulase-negative Staphylococci, 2 specimens of Enterococci, 3 specimens of Streptococcus, 1 specimen of Micrococcus, 3 specimens of Escherichia coli, 4 specimens of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 specimens of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 specimens of Enterobacter cloacae, and 5 specimens of Acinetobacter were tested by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. A total of 118 clinical specimens of sepsis and non-sepsis were collected and detected with both LAMP assay and blood culture. RESULTS: By designing primers specific for Staphylococcus aureus, specimens containing different kinds of pathogens were carried out by LAMP assay, and our data showed LAMP technology for the specific detection of Staphylococcus aureus in samples was successfully established. All clinical specimens of sepsis and non-sepsis were tested by both blood cultures and LAMP, and our data showed that compared wit blood culture method, the LAMP technology showed significantly high detection rate (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: As a quick and easy detection of Staphylococcus aureus, the LAMP technology was successfully established, laid the foundation for the diagnosis and treatment of children Staphylococcus aureus sepsis, and showed great promotion and application value.
TI  - Treatment options for New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-harboring enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase gene (bla(NDM-1)) has emerged as a worldwide concern among isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. Its epidemiology is been strongly associated with travel and healthcare on the Indian Subcontinent. We report two cases of urinary tract infection with Enterobacteriaceae harboring a bla(NDM-1). Both cases presented as infection in community-dwelling individuals in Australia and were associated with travel to the Indian Subcontinent. One isolate of Escherichia coli harbored the previously undescribed enzyme variant bla(NDM-3), differing from bla(NDM-1) by a single nonsynonymous SNP conferring a putative peptide sequence change at the 95th position (ASP-->ASN). The second was an Enterobacter cloacae harboring bla(NDM-1). Further genetic characterization included identification of additional beta-lactamase and aminoglycoside resistance genes. Legacy antimicrobials were used for treatment. Oral therapy with nitrofurantoin was successful in one case, while combination of colistin and rifampicin was required in the second patient. Such infection, due to extensively drug-resistant pathogens, poses significant challenges in balancing the efficacy and toxicity of potential antimicrobial therapies.
TI  - Microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in Central Alabama.
AB  - Urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. They are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. The purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in Central Alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. This was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile at this Central Alabama hospital. The survey period was between July 2009 and June 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed and susceptibility testing was determined using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) microdilution method. The results indicated that Escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), Proteus mirabilis (7.8%), Enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (3.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca and Citrobacter freundii (1.5%), Morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). For the 215 E. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, P < 0.05). In contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, P < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this Central Alabama hospital. Additionally, this study found that E. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (Lee et al. 2010; Rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. It is imperative to monitor the resistance of P. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.
TI  - Molecular and epidemiological characterization of enterobacterial multidrug-resistant strains in Tlemcen Hospital (Algeria) (2008-2010).
AB  - Seventy-one isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (17 Escherichia coli, 50 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 4 Enterobacter cloacae) producing extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were collected between April 2008 and March 2010 in an intensive care unit and surgical ward of Tlemcen Hospital (West of Algeria). Sequencing identified the bla(CTX-M-15) determinant in 69 isolates and bla(CTX-M-3) in 2 isolates. None of the studied strains produced the class D carbapenemase OXA-48. Repetitive Extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction showed a high degree of genotypic diversity among E. coli strains and two major clonal populations of K. pneumoniae (CKp1 n=11 and CKp5 n=25) which were further identified as members of the multilocus sequence typing types (ST931) and (ST15), respectively. The ST15 isolates harbored more resistance genes and virulence factors than the ST931 isolates. The characterization of the spacer region between ISEcp1 and bla(CTX-M) for CTX-M-15 producers individualized two populations. One that derived from the CTX-M-3 under Algerian clinical context and one that is universally found. The dissemination of ESBLs in the studied Enterobacteriaceae isolates was mainly due to the epidemic clones of K. pneumoniae and to genetic transit of plasmids among unrelated strains.
TI  - Identification of the Enterobacteriaceae in Montasio cheese and assessment of their amino acid decarboxylase activity.
AB  - The aim of the study was to identify the species of Enterobacteriaceae present in Montasio cheese and to assess their potential to produce biogenic amines. Plate count methods and an Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR) approach, combined with 16S rDNA sequencing, were used to investigate the Enterobacteriaceae community present during the cheesemaking and ripening of 6 batches of Montasio cheese. Additionally, the potential decarboxylation abilities of selected bacterial isolates were qualitatively and quantitatively assessed against tyrosine, histidine, ornithine and lysine. The most predominant species detected during cheese manufacturing and ripening were Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Hafnia alvei. The non-limiting physico-chemical conditions (pH, NaCl% and a(w)) during ripening were probably the cause of the presence of detectable levels of Enterobacteriaceae up to 120 d of ripening. The HPLC test showed that cadaverine and putrescine were the amines produced in higher amounts by almost all isolates, indicating that the presence of these amines in cheese can be linked to the presence of high counts of Enterobacteriaceae. 44 isolates produced low amounts of histamine (<300 ppm), and four isolates produced more than 1000 ppm of this amine. Only 9 isolates, belonging to the species Citrobacter freundii, Esch. coli and Raoultella ornithinolytica, appeared to produce tyramine. These data provided new information regarding the decarboxylase activity of some Enterobacteriaceae species, including Pantoea agglomerans, Esch. fergusonii and R. ornithinolytica.
TI  - Intestinal Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli populations in Japanese adults demonstrated by the reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and the clone library analyses.
AB  - A primer set specific for Escherichia coli/Shigella 16S rRNA was developed and used for RT-qPCR analysis of fecal samples from 35 healthy adult volunteers in combination with the previously reported primer set specific for Enterobacteriaceae. Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli were present in the 29 out of 35 volunteers tested as intestinal commensals at the average population levels of 10(7.1+/-0.9) and 10(6.8+/-0.7)cellsg(-1) of stools (mean+/-standard deviation), respectively. Among the 7 volunteers, the significant deviation between the count of Enterobacteriaceae and that of E. coli was observed, suggesting non-E. coli/Shigella species were predominant in their Enterobacteriaceae populations. The clone library analysis revealed that the non-E. coli/Shigella populations included Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae/variicola and Morganella morganii. These data suggested that the RT-qPCR method with the primer sets specific to both Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli/Shigella enabled the accurate enumeration of intestinal E. coli populations and the other Enterobacteriaceae species populations.
TI  - [Common pathogens and clinical characteristics of neonatal pneumonia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study common pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility as well  as clinical characteristics of neonatal pneumonia. METHODS: A retrospective study on neonatal pneumonia was performed. The study investigated antibiotic susceptibility of four common pathogens (339 strains) that caused neonatal pneumonia. Clinical characteristics of the newborns with pneumonia were analyzed. Of the 339 strains, 185 were isolated from bronchial secretions, 72 from blood samples, and 82 with positive results of both samples. RESULTS: Four hundred and seventy-four neonates with pneumonia presented positive results of bacterial culture. the most common pathogens Staphylococcus aureus (21.9%), Escherichia coli (19.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.0%) and Enterobacter cloacae (11.4%). The birth weight of newborns infected with Staphylococcus aureus was generally normal, and the time of hospital admission was later (after 24 hours of life). In contrast, the newborns with gram-negative bacterial infection, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, had lower birth weights and early time of hospital admission (within 24 hours of life). Nearly more than 50% gram-negative bacteria were resistant to second, third and forth generation cephaloporins. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacteria are predominant pathogens of neonatal pneumonia. Neonatal pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria is common in newborns with low birth weight and its onset time is relatively earlier. Gram-negative bacteria that cause neonatal pneumonia are highly resistant to cephaloporins.
TI  - Diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in North-Western Iran.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by Leishmania spp. Little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. Particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. This information is important for development of vector control strategies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: FIVE SAND FLY SPECIES: Phlebotomus papatasi, P. sergenti, P. kandelakii, P. perfiliewi and P. halepensis were caught in Bileh Savar and Kaleybar in North-Western Iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. A total of 35 specimens were processed. Bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. We characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. They belong to six different genera including Penicillium (17 isolates), Aspergillus (14), Acremonium (5), Fusarium (1), Geotrichum (1) and Candida (1). We identified 33 Gram-negative bacteria: Serratia marcescens (9 isolates), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Pseudomonas fluorescens (6), Klebsiella ozaenae (4), Acinetobacter sp. (3), Escherichia coli (3), Asaia sp. (1) and Pantoea sp. (1) as well as Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis (5) and Micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of Asaia sp. in sand flies. We have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. Interestingly Pantoea sp. and Klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in Old World sand fly species. The presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. Further experiments are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand flies.
TI  - Metagenomic cloning and characterization of Na(+) transporters from Huamachi Salt Lake in China.
AB  - Moderately halophilic bacteria are a kind of extreme environment microorganism that can tolerate moderate salt concentrations ranging from 0.5M to 2.5M. Here, via a metagenomic library screen, we identified four putative Na(+) transporters, designated H7-Nha, H16-Mppe, H19-Cap and H35-Mrp, from moderately halophilic community in the hypersaline soil of Huamachi Salt Lake, China. Functional complementation observed in a Na(+)(Ca(2+))/H(+) antiporter-defective Escherichia coli mutant (KNabc) suggests that the four putative Na(+) transporters could confer cells a capacity of Na(+) resistance probably by enhancing Na(+) or Ca(2+) efflux, but not Li(+) or K(+) exchange. Blastp analysis of the deduced amino-acid sequences indicates that H7-Nha has 71% identity to the NhaG Na(+)/H(+) antiporter of Bacillus subtilis, while H19-Cap shows 99% identity to Enterobacter cloacae Ca(2+) antiporter. Interestingly, H16-Mppe shares 59% identity to the metallophosphoesterase of Bacillus cellulosilyticus and H35-Mrp shows 68% identity to multidrug resistance protein of Lysinibacillus sphaericus. This is the first report that predicts a potential role of metallophosphoesterase in Na(+) resistance in halophilic bacteria. Furthermore, everted membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli cells harboring H7-Nha exhibit Na(+)/H(+) antiporter activity, but not Li(+) (K(+))/H(+) antiporter activity, confirming that H7-Nha supports Na(+) resistance mainly via Na(+)/H(+) antiport. Our report also demonstrates that metagenomic library screen is a convenient and effective way to explore more novel types of Na(+) transporters.
TI  - Characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  - A total of 788 clinical Enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (AME genes) and to characterize the plasmids that carry these genes. Among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 Escherichia coli (80%), 33 Proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six K. oxytoca (1.8%), five Enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three Morganella morganii (0.9%), three Providencia stuartii (0.9%), two Salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each Citrobacter freundii, C. koseri, Proteus vulgaris, and Shigella sonnei. The most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). The AME genes found were aph(3'')-Ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-Ia (37.5%), aph(3')-Ia (13.9%), aac(3)-IIa (12.4%), aac(6')-Ib (4.2%), ant(2'')-Ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-IIa (1.2%). Thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. The most frequent association was ant(3'')-Ia plus aph(3'')-Ib (35 strains). From 66 selected AME genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-IIa, six aph(3')-Ia, three ant(3'')-Ia, two ant(2'')-Ia, and one aac(6')-Ib. These genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups F, FIA, FIB, or HI2. In conclusion, the AME genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-IIa, aac(6')-Ib, and ant(2'')-Ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.
TI  - Prevalence of and risk factors for biliary carriage of bacteria showing worrisome and unexpected resistance traits.
AB  - Data on biliary carriage of bacteria and, specifically, of bacteria with worrisome and unexpected resistance traits (URB) are lacking. A prospective study (April 2010 to December 2011) was performed that included all patients admitted for <48 h for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a Spanish hospital. Bile samples were cultured and epidemiological/clinical data recorded. Logistic regression models (stepwise) were performed using bactobilia or bactobilia by URB as dependent variables. Models (P < 0.001) showing the highest R(2) values were considered. A total of 198 patients (40.4% males; age, 55.3 +/- 17.3 years) were included. Bactobilia was found in 44 of them (22.2%). The presence of bactobilia was associated (R(2) Cox, 0.30) with previous biliary endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (odds ratio [OR], 8.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.96 to 27.06; P < 0.001), previous admission (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.10 to 7.24; P = 0.031), and age (OR, 1.09 per year; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.12; P < 0.001). Ten out of the 44 (22.7%) patients with bactobilia carried URB: 1 Escherichia coli isolate (CTX-M), 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate (OXA-48), 3 high-level gentamicin-resistant enterococci, 1 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus isolate, 3 Enterobacter cloacae strains, and 1 imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain. Bactobilia by URB (versus those by non-URB) was only associated (R(2) Cox, 0.19) with previous ERCP (OR, 11.11; 95% CI, 1.98 to 62.47; P = 0.006). For analyses of patients with bactobilia by URB versus the remaining patients, previous ERCP (OR, 35.284; 95% CI, 5.320 to 234.016; P < 0.001), previous intake of antibiotics (OR, 7.200; 95% CI, 0.962 to 53.906; P = 0.050), and age (OR, 1.113 per year of age; 95% CI, 1.028 to 1.206; P = 0.009) were associated with bactobilia by URB (R(2) Cox, 0.19; P < 0.001). Previous antibiotic exposure (in addition to age and previous ERCP) was a risk driver for bactobilia by URB. This may have implications in prophylactic/therapeutic measures.
TI  - Interference in quorum sensing signal transmission amongst microbial species.
AB  - Antibiotics are usually studied on pure cultures of a single bacterial strain, whereas multi-species communities that inhabit human niches and the biosphere are generally ignored. The modification of quorum sensing (QS) is investigated in a system involving a co-existing signal producer and sensor bacterial cells. A pure culture of merely one bacterial species is quite rare in any niche. The interactions of different bacterial species may therefore be of special importance in pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance and signal transmission.In the present study the authors investigated the QS in model experiments involving several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species isolated from human infections or laboratory strains. The effects of various compounds on QS were studied in mixed bacterial populations during the incubation period of 24-48 h. As the simplest example of co-existing cell populations, the N-acyl homoserine lactone producing Ezf 10-17 was applied with Chromobacterium violaceum 026 as sensor.The signal of QS transmission between the co-existing QS system and pathogenic bacteria isolated from various patients was found to be modified by certain bacterial cells. The bacterial-bacterial interactions in a mixed flora can change the classical signal transmission in the microbial community and should therefore be taken into consideration in rational chemotherapy.
TI  - [Urinary tract infection in infants (376 cases) in a Moroccan hospital (2009-2010)--etiologic frequency and prevalence of resistance].
AB  
TI  - The target of daptomycin is absent from Escherichia coli and other gram-negative  pathogens.
AB  - Antistaphylococcal agents commonly lack activity against Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli owing to the permeability barrier presented by the outer membrane and/or the action of efflux transporters. When these intrinsic resistance mechanisms are artificially compromised, such agents almost invariably demonstrate antibacterial activity against Gram negatives. Here we show that this is not the case for the antibiotic daptomycin, whose target appears to be absent from E. coli and other Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel incompatibility group X3 plasmid carrying bla NDM-1 in Enterobacteriaceae isolates with epidemiological links to multiple geographical areas in China.
AB  - The New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) is one of the most important resistance traits in Enterobacteriaceae. We characterized nine bla NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae recovered from seven patients who have recently travelled or been treated in India (n=1) or mainland China (n=6) during December 2010-May 2012. All the China-linked patients had no links to the Indian subcontinent. The bla NDM-1 carrying plasmids belonged to the novel IncX3 ( approximately 50 kb, in seven isolates including two Escherichia coli, two Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Citrobacter freundii, one Enterobacter aerogenes and one E. cloacae), IncA/C2 ( approximately 140 kb, in one E. coli) or FII-F1B groups ( approximately 110 kb, in one E. coli). Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the seven IncX3 plasmids revealed identical pattern in six and two bands difference in the remaining one. The IncX3 plasmids carrying bla NDM-1 were epidemiologically linked to Guangzhou (n=1), Hunan (n=4), Haifeng (n=1) and Dongguan (n=1) in mainland China. Complete sequencing of the IncX3 plasmid pNDM-HN380 revealed that it was 54 035 bp long and encoded 52 open reading frames. The bla NDM-1 gene was found in a transposon-like structure flanked by ISAba125 and IS26, inserted into the plasmid genetic load region. The sequences of the bla NDM-1 containing module within the two IS elements were identical to those previously described for bla NDM-1-positive Tn125 in the plasmids or chromosome of Acinetobacter isolates. In summary, this is the first description of IncX3 plasmids carrying bla NDM-1. The findings indicate the worrisome involvement of an epidemic plasmid in the dissemination of NDM-1 in China.
TI  - Four new sesquiterpenoids from Ligularia cymbulifera.
AB  - Four new highly oxygenated bisabolane sesquiterpenoids were obtained from the EtOH extract from Ligularia cymbulifera, and their structures were elucidated by interpretation of spectroscopic data. Their relative configurations were clarified by a detailed analysis of (1)H NMR coupling constants, nuclear overhauser effect (NOE) experiments and two-dimensional NMR spectra. These four new compounds were assayed for their antimicrobial activities against four Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as against one human pathogenic fungus.
TI  - Human serum albumin stabilized gold nanoclusters as selective luminescent probes  for Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - In this work, human serum albumin (HSA) stabilized gold nanoclusters (HSA-AuNCs)  with reddish photoluminescence were used as sensing probes for pathogenic bacteria including Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli J96, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (PDRAB), Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). We discovered that HSA-AuNCs have unique affinity with S. aureus and MRSA. In addition to demonstrating the selective sensing ability of HSA-AuNCs toward S. aureus and MRSA, the binding peptide motifs identified from HSA-AuNCs were characterized by mass spectrometry. The identified binding peptides were further used as the reducing and stabilizing agents for generation of peptide-bound AuNCs (Pep-AuNCs). The generated Pep-AuNCs were demonstrated to have the binding affinities with S. aureus and MRSA.
TI  - Antibiotics involved in the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria: a nationwide multilevel study suggests differences within antibiotic classes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the antibiotics potentially the most involved in the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from an ecological perspective in French healthcare facilities (HCFs). METHODS: This study was based on data from the French antimicrobial surveillance network (ATB-RAISIN, 2007-09). Antibiotics were expressed in defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were considered as count data adjusted for patient-days. These were third-generation cephalosporin (3GC)- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli, cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacter cloacae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and ceftazidime-, imipenem- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Three-level negative binomial regression models were built to take into account the hierarchical structure of data: level 1, repeated measures each year (count outcome, time, antibiotics); level 2, HCFs (type and size); and level 3, regions (geographical area). RESULTS: A total of 701 HCFs from 20 French regions and up to 1339 HCF-years were analysed. The use of ceftriaxone, but not of cefotaxime, was positively correlated with incidence rates of 3GC- and ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli. In contrast, both 3GCs were positively correlated with the incidence rate of cefotaxime-resistant E. cloacae. Higher levels of use of ciprofloxacin and/or ofloxacin, but not of levofloxacin, were associated with higher incidence rates of 3GC- and ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli, cefotaxime-resistant E. cloacae, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and ceftazidime- and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests differences within antibiotic classes in promoting antibiotic resistance. We identified ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin as priority targets in public health strategies designed to reduce antibiotic use and antibiotic-resistant bacteria in French HCFs.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Salvia x jamensis essential oil.
AB  - This is the first report about the composition of the essential oil of Salvia x jamensis. The major compounds identified by GC-MS were beta-caryophyllene (14.8 %), beta-pinene (6.8 %), caryophyllene oxide (6.0 %), delta-cadinene (5.5 %), alpha-pinene (5.2 %) and spatulenol (5.2 %). The oil showed antimicrobial activity against three Gram (+) bacteria: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis, and three Candida strains: C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, while it was inactive against three Gram (-) bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - Activity of moxifloxacin, imipenem, and ertapenem against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis in monocultures and mixed cultures in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model simulating concentrations in the human pancreas.
AB  - The activities of moxifloxacin, imipenem, and ertapenem against pathogens causing severe necrotizing pancreatitis were studied in an in vitro pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis were exposed in monocultures and mixed cultures to concentrations of the three agents comparable to those in the human pancreas. Moxifloxacin was more active than the two carbapenems in monocultures and mixed cultures, reducing the numbers of CFU more drastically and more rapidly.
TI  - Identification and characterization of two novel bla(KLUC) resistance genes through large-scale resistance plasmids sequencing.
AB  - Plasmids are important antibiotic resistance determinant carriers that can disseminate various drug resistance genes among species or genera. By using a high throughput sequencing approach, two groups of plasmids of Escherichia coli (named E1 and E2, each consisting of 160 clinical E. coli strains isolated from different periods of time) were sequenced and analyzed. A total of 20 million reads were obtained and mapped onto the known resistance gene sequences. As a result, a total of 9 classes, including 36 types of antibiotic resistant genes, were identified. Among these genes, 25 and 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) appeared, of which 9 and 12 SNPs are nonsynonymous substitutions in the E1 and E2 samples. It is interesting to find that a novel genotype of bla(KLUC), whose close relatives, bla(KLUC-1) and bla(KLUC-2), have been previously reported as carried on the Kluyvera cryocrescens chromosome and Enterobacter cloacae plasmid, was identified. It shares 99% and 98% amino acid identities with Kluc-1 and Kluc-2, respectively. Further PCR screening of 608 Enterobacteriaceae family isolates yielded a second variant (named bla(KLUC-4)). It was interesting to find that Kluc-3 showed resistance to several cephalosporins including cefotaxime, whereas bla(KLUC-4) did not show any resistance to the antibiotics tested. This may be due to a positively charged residue, Arg, replaced by a neutral residue, Leu, at position 167, which is located within an omega-loop. This work represents large-scale studies on resistance gene distribution, diversification and genetic variation in pooled multi-drug resistance plasmids, and provides insight into the use of high throughput sequencing technology for microbial resistance gene detection.
TI  - Discrimination of selected species of pathogenic bacteria using near-infrared Raman spectroscopy and principal components analysis.
AB  - ABSTRACT. A method, based on Raman spectroscopy, for identification of different  microorganisms involved in bacterial urinary tract infections has been proposed. Spectra were collected from different bacterial colonies (Gram-negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, and Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp.), grown on culture medium (agar), using a Raman spectrometer with a fiber Raman probe (830 nm). Colonies were scraped from the agar surface and placed on an aluminum foil for Raman measurements. After preprocessing, spectra were submitted to a principal component analysis and Mahalanobis distance (PCA/MD) discrimination algorithm. We found that the mean Raman spectra of different bacterial species show similar bands, and S. aureus was well characterized by strong bands related to carotenoids. PCA/MD could discriminate Gram-positive bacteria with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and Gram-negative bacteria with sensitivity ranging from 58 to 88% and specificity ranging from 87% to 99%.
TI  - Dissemination of IncFII(K)-type plasmids in multiresistant CTX-M-15-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from children in hospital paediatric oncology wards.
AB  - In this study, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates in children with malignancies hospitalised at a paediatric oncology department in the Czech Republic were investigated. From June 2009 to January 2010, a total of 50 ESBL-producing faecal isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were obtained from 28 patients. These isolates were characterised with regard to ESBL enzymes, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and plasmids conferring resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. ESBL-producing isolates included Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=36), Escherichia coli (n=7), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), Enterobacter cloacae (n=2) and Citrobacter freundii (n=2). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates belonged to 7 MLST types, including sequence types ST280, ST321, ST323 and ST416 as well as the novel types ST626, ST627 and ST628. The multiresistant epidemic clone E. coli B2-O25b-ST131 was detected in one patient. The gene bla(CTX-M-15) was found on large conjugative IncFII(K) plasmids along with bla(TEM-1), bla(OXA-1), qnrB1, aac(6')-Ib-cr, strA, sul2, aac(3')-II and tet(A) genes in most isolates. Dissemination of IncFII(K) plasmids among various Enterobacteriaceae isolates was considered an important aspect of nosocomial colonisation in the wards by Enterobacteriaceae species producing ESBLs. This is the first study documenting multiple antibiotic resistance elements, including qnr genes, in IncFII(K) plasmids in various bacterial species isolated in a single hospital department. The results highlight the evolution of IncFII(K) plasmids into new variants containing novel antibiotic resistance elements and their important role in spreading ESBL-producing bacteria among hospitalised patients.
TI  - The effect of a wound care solution containing polyhexanide and betaine on bacterial counts: results of an in vitro study .
AB  - Polyhexanide and betaine topical solution is used in the management of infected wounds as a cleaning agent. An in vitro study was conducted to examine the antimicrobial effects of a solution containing 0.1% of the antimicrobial agent polyhexanide and 0.1% of the surfactant betaine. Three batches of each product were tested, and culture results of 13 microorganisms were evaluated after 7, 14, and 28 days using USP <51> methodology. Growth reduction was identical at each day following exposure to the solution in all micro-organisms except Aspergillus brasiliensis. A range of 5.3-log to 5.8-log reduction was seen for the following micro-organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Candida albicans, S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. faecalis. For A. brasiliensis, reductions were 2.1-log, 2.3-log and 2.8-log at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. The results of this study indicate a 4+ log inhibition of activity in 12 of 13 micro-organisms exposed to the solution. Research to elucidate the potential clinical effects of these observations is needed.
TI  - Artemisia capillaris extracts as a green factory for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles with antibacterial activities.
AB  - We report a green synthesis of silver nanoparticles that uses extracts from the aerial part of Artemisia capillaris. Both water and 70% ethanol extracts successfully generated silver nanoparticles. The formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance bands, Fourier transform-infrared spectra, high resolution-transmission electron and atomic force microscopic images. Various shapes of silver nanoparticles were generated with an average diameter of 29.71 nm with water extract and 29.62 nm with 70% ethanol extract. An improvement in antibacterial activity (MIC 8.35-16.7 microg/mL) was observed against a total of twenty different strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. A remarkable enhancement (approximately 12-fold) was observed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Klebsiella areogenes when compared with the extract alone. Silver nanoparticles produced by the 70% ethanol extract showed slightly higher antibacterial activity than those generated with the water extract. The correlation between total flavonoid content of each extract and the antibacterial activity did not exert any significant relationships. This report suggests that plant extracts have the potential to be used as powerful reducing agents for the production of biocompatible silver nanoparticles possessing enhanced antibacterial activities.

TI  - Effect of transcriptional activators SoxS, RobA, and RamA on expression of multidrug efflux pump AcrAB-TolC in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Control of membrane permeability is a key step in regulating the intracellular concentration of antibiotics. Efflux pumps confer innate resistance to a wide range of toxic compounds such as antibiotics, dyes, detergents, and disinfectants in members of the Enterobacteriaceae. The AcrAB-TolC efflux pump is involved in multidrug resistance in Enterobacter cloacae. However, the underlying mechanism that regulates the system in this microorganism remains unknown. In Escherichia coli, the transcription of acrAB is upregulated under global stress conditions by proteins such as MarA, SoxS, and Rob. In the present study, two clinical isolates of E. cloacae, EcDC64 (a multidrug-resistant strain overexpressing the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump) and Jc194 (a strain with a basal AcrAB-TolC expression level), were used to determine whether similar global stress responses operate in E. cloacae and also to establish the molecular mechanisms underlying this response. A decrease in susceptibility to erythromycin, tetracycline, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol was observed in clinical isolate Jc194 and, to a lesser extent in EcDC64, in the presence of salicylate, decanoate, tetracycline, and paraquat. Increased expression of the acrAB promoter in the presence of the above-described conditions was observed by flow cytometry and reverse transcription-PCR, by using a reporter fusion protein (green fluorescent protein). The expression level of the AcrAB promoter decreased in E. cloacae EcDC64 derivates deficient in SoxS, RobA, and RamA. Accordingly, the expression level of the AcrAB promoter was higher in E. cloacae Jc194 strains overproducing SoxS, RobA, and RamA. Overall, the data showed that SoxS, RobA, and RamA regulators were associated with the upregulation of acrAB, thus conferring antimicrobial resistance as well as a stress response in E. cloacae. In summary, the regulatory proteins SoxS, RobA, and RamA were cloned and sequenced for the first time in this species. The involvement of these proteins in conferring antimicrobial resistance through upregulation of acrAB was demonstrated in E. cloacae.
TI  - Catheter-related complications in cancer patients on home parenteral nutrition: a prospective study of over 51,000 catheter days.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is often indicated in cancer patients, many physicians are concerned about the risks potentially associated with the use of central venous access devices (VADs) in these patients. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the actual incidence of VAD-related complications in cancer patients on HPN. METHODS: All adult cancer patient candidates for VAD insertion and HPN were enrolled. The incidence of complications associated with 4 types of VADs (peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC], Hohn catheter, tunneled Groshong catheter, and port) was investigated, as well as the most significant risk factors. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-nine VADs in 254 patients were studied, for a total of 51,308 catheter-days. The incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) was low (0.35/1000 catheter-days), particularly for PICCs (0/1000; P < .01 vs Hohn and tunneled catheters) and for ports (0.19/1000; P < .01 vs Hohn and P < .05 vs tunneled catheters). Mechanical complications were uncommon (0.8/1000), as was VAD-related venous thrombosis (0.06/1000). Ultrasound-guided venipuncture was associated with a decreased risk of CRBSI (P < .04) and thrombosis (P < .001). VAD securement using sutureless devices reduced the risk of CRBSI and dislocation (P < .001). Hohn catheters had no advantage over PICCs (higher complication rate and shorter dwell time; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In cancer patients, HPN can be safely carried out with a low incidence of complications. Also, VADs are not equal in terms of complication rates, and strict adherence to meticulous insertion policies may effectively reduce catheter-related complications.
TI  - Bloodstream infections caused by IMP-8-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates: the need for clinical laboratory detection of metallo-beta-lactamases?
AB  - A retrospective study was conducted at a Taiwanese medical center to characterize bloodstream infections caused by IMP-8 metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates and to assess the need for laboratory detection of IMP producers. We analyzed 37 patients infected with IMP-8 producers (two Escherichia coli, nine Klebsiella pneumoniae, 25 Enterobacter cloacae, and one Citrobacter freundii) and 107 patients infected with non-IMP-8 producers (eight E. coli, 26 K. pneumoniae, 70 E. cloacae, and three C. freundii) that were interpreted as carbapenem-nonsusceptible based on the updated Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2010 guidelines. Only 18 (48.6 %) of the IMP-8 producers were regarded as potential carbapenemase producers based on the CLSI 2012 guidelines. The production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) was more common in the MBL group (73.0 %) than in the non-MBL group (41.1 %). There were no significant differences in carbapenem susceptibilities, clinical characteristics, carbapenem use for empirical and definitive treatment, and mortality rates between the two groups. Eighteen IMP-8 producers could be deemed as resistant to all carbapenems [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of any carbapenem >/=2 mug/mL]; patients with these isolates had a lower, but non-significant, 28-day mortality rate (27.8 %) than patients infected with non-MBL producers having similar carbapenem MICs (39.0 %) (p = 0.41). A multivariate analysis revealed severity of acute illness as the single independent variable associated with both 7-day and 28-day mortality rates (p < 0.01) for infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae with decreased carbapenem susceptibilities. Our findings suggest that the clinical detection of IMP-producing Enterobacteriaceae is not required even when the "old" CLSI criteria are used.
TI  - Characterization of fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance mechanisms in Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a Dutch teaching hospital reveals the presence of an Escherichia coli ST131 clone with a specific mutation in parE.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae from a Dutch teaching hospital in 2008. METHODS: We sequenced gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE. The presence of plasmid-encoded genes qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, aac(6')-Ib, qepA, bla(TEM), bla(SHV,) bla(OXA), bla(CTX-M) and bla(AmpC) was studied by PCR. Escherichia coli isolates were further characterized by AFLP and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: In total, 49 E. coli, 16 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 3 Enterobacter cloacae isolates were investigated. Mutations in gyrA were found in all E. coli isolates. Forty-five (92%) E. coli isolates carried at least one point mutation in parC. Most E. coli isolates (59%) also carried mutations in parE, of which I529L was the most prevalent. I529L was unequivocally associated with E. coli sequence type (ST) 131. This single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was later also found in eight out of nine ST131 strains from another collection. Twenty-nine E. coli isolates carried extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes, predominantly bla(CTX-M-15). In E. coli, aac(6')-Ib-cr was the predominant plasmid-mediated resistance mechanism, whereas in K. pneumoniae qnr genes were found mostly. In K. pneumoniae isolates, qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr co-occurred with ESBL genes (n = 13; bla(CTX-M) and bla(SHV)) and/or bla(AmpC) (n = 3; bla(DHA-1)). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli ST131 was the predominant clone, which accumulated a high number of chromosomal mutations. The I529L SNP in parE was a signature of most, but not all, ST131 strains. In contrast to E. coli, fluoroquinolone resistance mechanisms were predominantly plasmid-encoded in K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Real-time PCR for detection of blaOXA-48 genes from stools.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Outbreaks of OXA-48-like carbapenemase producers are increasingly reported in many European countries and are often the result of difficulties in detection, especially for isolates with MICs of carbapenems that remain in the susceptibility range. METHODS: An in-house real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay using TaqMan chemistry to detect bla(OXA-48-like) genes was compared with bacterial culturing on ChromID ESBL and SUPERCARBA media of spiked stool samples with several species producing OXA-48 variants. RESULTS: qPCR amplification using plasmid DNA was linear over 10 log dilutions (r(2) = 0.998 and slope = -3.14), with an amplification efficiency of 1.10, and the detection limit of the assay was reproducibly estimated at 10 plasmid molecules/PCR. No cross-reaction was detected with DNA extracted from several multidrug-resistant bacteria harbouring other beta-lactam resistance genes. The bla(OXA-48) qPCR assay was capable of detecting 10-50 cfu of OXA-48 producers/100 mg of faeces. ChromID ESBL was capable of detecting OXA-48 producers (1 x 10(1) to 3 x 10(2) cfu/100 mg of faeces), as long as the isolates exhibited a high level of resistance to cephalosporins due to an associated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. The SUPERCARBA screening medium was capable of detecting all the OXA-48-like producers (1-3 x 10(1) cfu/100 mg of faeces), except those producing OXA-163, a variant lacking carbapenem-hydrolysing activity. CONCLUSIONS: The qPCR is likely to shorten the time for bla(OXA-48) detection from 48 to 4 h and will be a valuable tool for outbreak follow-up in order to rapidly isolate colonized patients and assign them to cohorts.
TI  - High load of multi-drug resistant nosocomial neonatal pathogens carried by cockroaches in a neonatal intensive care unit at Tikur Anbessa specialized hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cockroaches have been described as potential vectors for various pathogens for decades; although studies from neonatal intensive care units are scarce. This study assessed the vector potential of cockroaches (identified as Blatella germanica) in a neonatal intensive care unit setup in Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 400 Blatella germanica roaches were aseptically collected for five consecutive months. Standard laboratory procedures were used to process the samples. RESULTS: From the external and gut homogenates, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia rettgeri, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter aeruginosa, Salmonella C1, Non Group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter spp. and Shigella flexneri were isolated. Multi-drug resistance was seen in all organisms. Resistance to up to all the 12 antimicrobials tested was observed in different pathogens. CONCLUSION: Cockroaches could play a vector role for nosocomial infections in a neonatal intensive care unit and environmental control measures of these vectors is required to reduce the risk of infection. A high level of drug resistance pattern of the isolated pathogens was demonstrated.
TI  - [Investigation of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants in Enterobacteriaceae: a multicenter study].
AB  - Fluoroquinolones which are in use since 1986, are effective agents both against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Quinolones show bactericidal effect as a result of inhibition of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV enzymes. Main quinolone resistance mechanisms are chromosomal mutations in these enzymes and decreased intracellular accumulation due to efflux pumps or decreased membrane uptake. Recently a new quinolone resistance mechanism mediated by plasmids has been defined. These plasmids carry genes called as qnr. Qnr genes do not cause quinolone resistance but they cause decreased quinolone susceptibility and lead to higher minimum inhibitory concentrations. Currently there are qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD and qnrS genes. This study was aimed to investigate the presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants in Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected from four different centers in Turkey. A total of 647 isolates (387 from Trabzon, Black Sea region; 82 from Canakkale, Trace region; 96 from Ankara, Central Anatolia region; 82 from Tokat, Black Sea region) belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family collected between May-July 2009, were included in the study. Presence of qnrA, qnrB, qnrS and qnrC genes were investigated by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and confirmed by gene sequencing. The results of the PCR amplification revealed that 2 isolates were positive for qnrA, 12 isolates were positive for qnrB, 4 isolates were positive for qnrC and 10 isolates were positive for qnrS. However, the number of positive strains decreased with the use of gene sequencing, and this method led to the identification of qnrA1 in two isolates [Enterobacter cloacae (code. 796), Salmonella group B (code. 491)], qnrB1 in two isolates [Salmonella group B (code. 491), Citrobacter freundii (code. 768)], qnrB6 in one isolate [Escherichia coli (code. CC1800)], qnrB9 in one isolate [E.coli (code. CC1873)], qnrB24 in one isolate [Citrobacter koseri (code. MP5200)], qnrB27 in one isolate [C.freundii (code. 842)], qnrS1 in two isolates [E.coli (code. CC1705), E.coli (code.159)] and qnrB2 in one isolate [E.coli (code. 843)]. One of the isolates that carried the qnr gene was ciprofloxacin-resistant and two isolates were nalidixic-acid resistant. Transferable quinolone resistance due to the dissemination of qnr genes may have important impacts in terms of infection control and treatment problems. Survey of plasmid mediated quinolone resistance will help to determine the size of the issue and guide the measures that should be taken to avoid escalation of resistance and dissemination problem.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of Salmonella bacteriophage SS3e.
AB  - A Salmonella lytic bacteriophage, SS3e, was isolated, and its genome was sequenced completely. This phage is able to lyse not only various Salmonella serovars but also Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens, indicating a broad host specificity. Genomic sequence analysis of SS3e revealed a linear double-stranded DNA sequence of 40,793 bp harboring 58 open reading frames, which is highly similar to Salmonella phages SETP13 and MB78.
TI  - Detection of Amp C genes encoding for beta-lactamases in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - PURPOSE: Amp C beta-lactamase are Ambler class C enzymes that confer resistance to extended spectrum cephalosporins and are not inhibited by beta-lactamase inhibitors. Their detection is crucial, since the phenotypic tests are not standardised leading to ambiguity in interpretation of results. This study was done to detect the types of Amp C prevalent in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-seven consecutive cefoxitin resistant clinical isolates of E. coli (n = 25) and K. pneumoniae (n = 52) were included in the study. Antibiotic susceptibility testing to various classes of antibiotics was performed by disc diffusion using Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to cefoxitin, imipenem and meropenem were determined by broth microdilution method. Isolates were screened for production of Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL). Multiplex PCR was performed for the detection of Amp C genes after phenotypic testing (Hodge test and inhibitor based test). RESULTS: Cefoxitin Hodge test was positive in 40 isolates which included 20 E. coli and 20 K. pneumoniae. There was zone enhancement with boronic acid in 55 isolates, of which 36 were K. pneumoniae and 19 were E. coli. Multiplex PCR detected Amp C in 11/25 E. coli and 12/52 K. pneumoniae isolates. The Amp C genes detected were CIT (Amp C origin - Citrobacter freundii), DHA (Dhahran Hospital, Saudi Arabia), ACC (Ambler class C), EBC (Amp C origin - Enterobacter cloacae) groups. ESBL was co-produced in 54 isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Amp C was detected in 29.87% of the study isolates. Majority of them co-produced ESBL. The most common Amp C was the CIT family. Screen tests for cefoxitin resistance may be falsely positive due to production of carbapenamases.
TI  - Is there a direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type A?
AB  - Study Type--Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence 4. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Several studies describe a reduction of symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity after intradetrusor injections of botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A). It was, however, unclear if a direct antibacterial effect of BoNT/A plays a role in this clinical observation. This is the first study to investigate a potential antibacterial effect of two frequently used BoNT/A formulations (i.e. Botox(R) and Dysport(R)), providing evidence that BoNT/A does not exert an antibacterial effect on lower urinary tract pathogens. OBJECTIVE: * To determine a potential direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A). MATERIALS AND METHODS: * A prospective study was carried out using onabotulinumtoxin A (Botox(R)) and abobotulinumtoxin A (Dypsort(R)) in agar diffusion and broth microdilution assays with various clinical urinary tract isolates (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella oxytoca and Bacillus subtilis). * Inhibition zones (mm) of bacteria around a disc containing 20 microL saline with 4 IU of Botox(R) were measured in the agar diffusion assay. * Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs, IU/mL) of both toxins for all bacteria were determined in the broth microdilution assay after overnight incubation at 35 degrees C. RESULTS: * There was no inhibition zone in the agar diffusion assays with any bacterial strain. * The microdilution test using Botox(R) and Dysport(R) showed bacterial growth in all dilutions, i.e. MICs > 20 and >100 IU/mL for Botox(R) and Dysport(R), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: * BoNT/A has no direct antimicrobial effect. * The reduced frequency of symptomatic urinary tract infections (sUTIs) in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) after BoNT/A intradetrusor injections seems to be caused by different indirect mechanisms, which are still not completely understood.
TI  - Characterization of two mobilizable plasmids isolated from enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - We isolated two plasmids, pS51A and pS51B which were 5782 bp and 4854 bp in size, respectively, from the third generation cephalosporin-resistant E. cloacae suspected to express metallo-beta-lactamase, and analyzed their structures. These two plasmids encode RNA I/RNA II genes for replication origin, relaxase genes of mobABCD for plasmid transfer, and several open reading frames. According to the classification of mobilizable plasmids by gene organization of the relaxases, pS51A and pS51B belong to the ColE1 superfamily of mobilizable plasmids, commonly detected in Enterobacteriaceae. The metallo-beta-lactamase gene was not identified in either pS51A or pS51B by homology search of the putative open reading frames. Open reading frames encoded in pS51A include E. coli protein L-like, E. coli heat shock protein-like, and E. coli plasmid replication initiation protein-like, and those encoded in pS51B include helix-turn-helix protein-like, E. coli plasmid replication initiation protein-like, and Salmonella replication initiation protein-like. These plasmids are stably maintained in one strain of E. cloacae, thus, the encoded gene functions may confer growth advantage to the host cell.
TI  - Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Finland: the first years (2008-11).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are becoming a global problem; they are often resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. Here we report details on all Finnish CPE isolates found until the end of 2011: carbapenemase genes, travel history and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data. METHODS: Enterobacteriaceae sent to the Antimicrobial Resistance Unit of the National Institute for Health and Welfare were tested for susceptibility to carbapenems, screened for carbapenemases by PCR and isolates with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems were tested for hydrolysis of imipenem. Carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were typed by MLST. RESULTS: In all, 26 CPE strains were found from 25 patients: 10 with OXA-48-like enzymes, 5 with KPC, 4 with VIM, 3 with NDM, 3 with IMI/NMC-A and 1 with GES-14. The species were K. pneumoniae (n = 16), E. coli (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 3) and Raoultella planticola (n = 1). Of the 25 patients, 18 had a known travel history/hospital transfer from abroad. Local spread/transmission was suspected in 2011, but there were no hospital outbreaks. The K. pneumoniae multilocus sequence types ST258, ST182, ST147, ST244, ST14, ST13, ST383, ST101 and ST15, and the E. coli sequence types ST38 and ST90 were found. Many of these are global epidemic clones. CONCLUSIONS: CPE strains are increasingly found in Finland, but still at a very low prevalence.
TI  - Kinetics and stereochemistry of hydrolysis of an N-(phenylacetyl)-alpha-hydroxyglycine ester catalyzed by serine beta-lactamases and DD-peptidases.
AB  - The alpha-hydroxydepsipeptide 3-carboxyphenyl N-(phenylacetyl)-alpha-hydroxyglycinate (5) is a quite effective substrate of serine beta-lactamases and low molecular mass DD-peptidases. The class C P99 and ampC beta-lactamases catalyze the hydrolysis of both enantiomers of 5, although they show a strong preference for one of them. The class A TEM-2 and class D OXA-1 beta-lactamases and the Streptomyces R61 and Actinomadura R39 DD-peptidases catalyze hydrolysis of only one enantiomer of at any significant rate. Experiments show that all of the above enzymes strongly prefer the same enantiomer, a surprising result since beta-lactamases usually prefer L(S) enantiomers and DD-peptidases D(R). Product analysis, employing peptidylglycine alpha-amidating lyase, showed that the preferred enantiomer is D(R). Thus, it is the beta-lactamases that have switched preference rather than the DD-peptidases. Molecular modeling of the P99 beta-lactamase active site suggests that the alpha-hydroxyl 5 of may interact with conserved Asn and Lys residues. Both alpha-hydroxy and alpha-amido substituents on a glycine ester substrate can therefore enhance its productive interaction with the beta-lactamase active site, although their effects are not additive; this may also be true for inhibitors.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates to tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the in vitro susceptibility of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDRE) isolates to tigecycline. METHODS: Clinical isolates of MDRE tested in this study were obtained from 91 hospitals in Belgium during the period January 2010 to April 2010. MICs of tigecycline were determined by Vitek 2 (VTK) and by the reference broth microdilution (BMD) method, and the results were interpreted based on the 2011 MIC interpretative criteria recommended by EUCAST. RESULTS: A total of 501 non-duplicate MDRE isolates were tested. These comprised 284 isolates of Escherichia coli [255 (89.7%) were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates], 72 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae [53 (73.6%) were ESBL-producing isolates], 72 isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes, 33 isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, 19 isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca and 21 miscellaneous others. The MIC(90) values of tigecycline for E. coli and non-E. coli ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were 0.5 and 2 mg/L by BMD, and 0.5 and 8 mg/L by VTK, respectively. The highest essential and categorical agreement rates between VTK and BMD results using EUCAST breakpoints were observed in E. coli isolates (97.2%), while lower and unacceptable essential and categorical agreement rates were obtained for isolates belonging to species other than E. coli (81.1% and 59.4%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: VTK appears to be a suitable method for routine susceptibility testing of tigecycline only for E. coli isolates, while BMD should be preferred for other Enterobacteriaceae species isolates.
TI  - Volatile compound profiling for the identification of Gram-negative bacteria by ion-molecule reaction-mass spectrometry.
AB  - AIMS: Fast and reliable methods for the early detection and identification of micro-organism are of high interest. In addition to established methods, direct mass spectrometry-based analysis of volatile compounds (VCs) emitted by micro-organisms has recently been shown to allow species differentiation. Thus, a large number of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, which comprised Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Serratia marcescens, were subjected to headspace VC composition analysis using direct mass spectrometry in a low sample volume that allows for automation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ion-molecule reaction-mass spectrometry (IMR-MS) was applied to headspace analysis of the above bacterial samples incubated at 37 degrees C starting with 10(2) CFU ml(-1) . Measurements of sample VC composition were performed at 4, 8 and 24 h. Microbial growth was detected in all samples after 8 h. After 24 h, species-specific mass spectra were obtained allowing differentiation between bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: IMR-MS provided rapid growth detection and identification of micro-organisms using a cumulative end-point model with a short analysis time of 3 min per sample. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Following further validation, the presented method of bacterial sample headspace VC analysis has the potential to be used for bacteria differentiation.
TI  - Class 1 integron gene cassettes in multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in  southern China.
AB  - Non-duplicate multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (n=1447) isolated from January 2008 to December 2009 were investigated for the presence of integrons as well as characterisation of gene cassettes. Among 825 strains carrying the class 1 integrase gene intI1, 461 gene cassette-positive isolates were found. Thirty-eight distinct gene cassette arrays were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing analyses. In addition, several novel gene cassette arrays detected in this study were reported for the first time in some species: one in Escherichia coli, six in Klebsiella pneumoniae, six in Enterobacter cloacae, three in Enterobacter aerogenes, one in Proteus mirabilis, one in Acinetobacter spp., one in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and one in Pseudomonas putida. Among them, three cassettes, including HAD-like, DeltaMFS-1 and qnrVC-like genes, were originally detected in integrons.
TI  - Risk factors associated with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae nosocomial bloodstream infections in a tertiary care hospital: a clinical and molecular analysis.
AB  - AIM: To describe the risk factors and molecular epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: Patients with enterobacteria-positive blood cultures were included. ESBL expression in the isolates was detected using the combination disk method. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method. bla(SHV), bla(TEM), and bla(CTX-M) genes were identified in the isolated strains by PCR and sequencing. Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were genotyped by PFGE. RESULTS: Of the 90 isolates recovered, half were found to express ESBLs. Twenty-eight (62%) of these isolates were K. pneumoniae, 8 (18%) were Escherichia coli, 6 (13%) were Enterobacter cloacae, and 3 (7%) were Serratia marcescens. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the only independent risk factor associated with infection by ESBL-producing strains was use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins. None of the isolates was resistant to imipenem. The bla(SHV5) gene was detected in 84% of isolates, followed by bla(CTX-M15) (27%), bla(SHV2) (9%), and bla(SHV12) (7%). PFGE identified six clones among the 28 ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates. CONCLUSIONS: ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae clones were detected throughout the hospital. Use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins is the most important risk factor associated with the proliferation of ESBL-producing strains.
TI  - Characterization and purification of a bacteriocin from Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BMK2005, an intestinal isolate active against multidrug-resistant pathogens.
AB  - A strain of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BMK2005 isolated from healthy infant faeces has shown a remarkable antibacterial activity against 32 bacterial pathogenic strains of human clinical isolates. Among them, 13 strains belonging to species of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to Cefotaxime (CTX) and Ceftazidime (CAZ), and 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to Methicillin (MRSA). This antibacterial activity was attributed to a bacteriocin designated as Paracaseicin A. It was heat-stable up to 120 degrees C for 5 min and active within the pH range of 2-5. Its activity was lost when treated with proteases, which reveals its proteinaceous nature. This bacteriocin was successfully purified only by two steps of reversed phase chromatography. Its molecular mass, determined by mass spectrometry analysis, was 2,462.5 Da. To our knowledge, the present study is the first report on characterization and purification of a bacteriocin, produced by a L. paracasei subsp. paracasei strain exhibiting an antibacterial activity against various multidrug-resistant species of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, which reveals its potential for use in prevention or treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant species especially in cases of antibiotics-associated diarrhea (AAD).
TI  - Horizontal gene transfer of stress resistance genes through plasmid transport.
AB  - The horizontal gene transfer of plasmid-determined stress tolerance was achieved  under lab conditions. Bacterial isolates, Enterobacter cloacae (DGE50) and Escherichia coli (DGE57) were used throughout the study. Samples were collected from contaminated marine water and soil to isolate bacterial strains having tolerance against heavy metals and antimicrobial agents. We have demonstrated plasmid transfer, from Amp(+)Cu(+)Zn(-) strain (DGE50) to Amp(-)Cu(-)Zn(+) strain (DGE57), producing Amp(+)Cu(+)Zn(+) transconjugants (DGE(TC50-->57)) and Amp(+)Cu(-)Zn(+) transformants (DGE(TF50-->57)). DGE57 did not carry any plasmid, therefore, it can be speculated that zinc tolerance gene in DGE57 is located on chromosome. DGE50 was found to carry three plasmids, out of which two were transferred through conjugation into DGE57, and only one was transferred through transformation. Plasmid transferred through transformation was one out of the two transferred through conjugation. Through the results of transformation it was revealed that the genes of copper and ampicillin tolerance in DGE50 were located on separate plasmids, since only ampicillin tolerance genes were transferred through transformation as a result of one plasmid transfer. By showing transfer of plasmids under lab conditions and monitoring retention of respective phenotype via conjugation and transformation, it is very well demonstrated how multiple stress tolerant strains are generated in nature.
TI  - Outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2-producing K. pneumoniae sequence type 11 in Taiwan in 2011.
AB  - From June to September 2011, a total of 305 ertapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates (MICs of ertapenem >/= 1 mug/ml) were collected from 11 hospitals in different parts of Taiwan. The MICs of 12 antimicrobial agents against these isolates were determined using the broth microdilution method, and genes for carbapenemases were detected using PCR. Genotypes of isolates possessing carbapenemase genes were identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing. The ertapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates included Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 219), Escherichia coli (n = 64), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 15), and other species (n = 7). Seven (2.3%) of the ertapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates exhibited colistin MICs of >4 mug/ml, and 24 (7.9%) were not susceptible to tigecycline (MICs > 2 mug/ml). A total of 29 (9.5%) isolates carried genes encoding carbapenemases, namely, K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (KPC-2) in 16 (7.3%) isolates of K. pneumoniae (KPC-2-KP) and IMP-8 in 5 (2.3%) isolates of K. pneumoniae, 5 (33.3%) isolates of E. cloacae, 1 isolate of E. coli, 1 isolate of Klebsiella oxytoca, and one isolate of Citrobacter freundii. The 16 KPC-2-KP isolates were isolated from patients at four different hospitals in northern Taiwan. All 16 of the KPC-2-KP isolates were susceptible to amikacin and colistin and had a similar pulsotype (pulsotype 1) and the same sequence type (sequence type 11). Infections due to KPC-2-KP mainly occurred in severely ill patients in the intensive care unit (n = 14, 88%). Four patients with infections due to KPC-2-KP died within 14 days of hospitalization. The findings are the first to demonstrate intrahospital and interhospital dissemination of KPC-2-KP in northern Taiwan.
TI  - Seasonality in Gram-negative and healthcare-associated infections.
AB  - To assess seasonal variations in Gram-negative and healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs), a literature search was performed with combinations of the keywords 'seasonality', 'seasonal variations', 'Gram-negative bacilli', 'infections', 'nosocomial infections', and 'health care associated infections', to retrieve articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals from 1 January 1970 to 29 February 2012. Seasonality was demonstrated for infections, mostly bloodstream infections (BSIs), caused by Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with higher rates of infection during the summer months in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Australia, and Asia. Correlations were observed between temperature increase and rates of BSI for Acinetobacter spp., P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. A significant correlation between lower urinary tract infections and higher temperature and decreased relative humidity could explain the seasonality of some BSIs. Regarding HCAI, seasonality is intrinsically present in most viral respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, because viruses are introduced into hospitals during seasonal community outbreaks. Other HCAIs subject to seasonal variations include surgical wound infections, with winter peaks in the USA and summer peaks in Finland, central-line-associated BSIs in haematology/oncology paediatric outpatients, and dialysis-associated peritonitis. In summary, seasonal variations have been shown for infections caused by many Gram-negative bacilli, as well as for a few HCAIs, but many studies remain to be performed in order to better understand the mechanisms of these variations.
TI  - Characterization of carbapenemase genes in Enterobacteriaceae species exhibiting  decreased susceptibility to carbapenems in a university hospital in Chongqing, China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our study was to investigate the prevalence of carbapenemase genes in strains of Enterobacteriaceae species exhibiting decreased susceptibility to carbapenems in our hospital. METHODS: The carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae species were confirmed by modified Hodge test (MHT) and EDTA-disc synergy test which indicating the production of class B carbapenemases. PCR and sequencing analysis were used to identify the drug-resistant genes. DNA fingerprinting based on enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR was applied to investigate the homology of Enterobacteriaceae species. RESULTS: From a collection of 1,472 Enterobacteriaceae species, 18 isolates with decreased susceptibility to carbapenem treatment were identified and 9 of which were positive by MHT, and 6 of which produced class B carbapenemases. PCR and sequencing analysis of the 18 isolates revealed 4 different carbapenemase genes (bla(IMP-8), bla(oxa-1), bla(IMP-26), and bla(oxa-47)) in 10 isolates, with the bla(IMP-8) and bla(oxa-1) genes being the most common (60-70% prevalence). ERIC-PCR showed 5, 2, and 2 unique genotypes for Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. Three E. coli strains isolated from different patients from the urologic surgery department exhibited the same DNA banding pattern, suggesting a possible clonal dissemination. Majority (17/18) of the carbapenem-unsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae species isolates was obtained from the surgery department of our hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The main carbapenemase genes of Enterobacteriaceae species in our hospital were bla(IMP-8) and bla(oxa-1). Prevalence of carbapenem resistance may be existed in surgery department and infection control should be taken for preventing further dissemination of drug-resistant strains.
TI  - CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae in the intensive care unit of Tlemcen Hospital, Algeria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in Enterobacteriaceae isolates in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Tlemcen hospital in north-western Algeria. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, molecular typing, characterization of ESBL-encoding genes and the genetic environment, conjugation experiments and plasmid analysis were carried out. In all, 28 Enterobacteriaceae isolates were isolated from specimens recovered from patients in the ICU and 2 from surfaces of the unit. Of these, 11 isolates (4 Escherichia coli, 5 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 2 Enterobacter cloacae) produced ESBL of the CT-X-M-15 type. Molecular typing of the isolates showed the clonal nature of 4 K. pneumoniae isolates. The bla(CTXM-15) gene was genetically linked to insertion sequence lSEcp1B and was transferable by conjugation from 3 isolates. Regular monitoring of resistance mechanisms, the establishment of a prevention strategy, and more rational and appropriate use of antibiotics are needed.
TI  - Causative bacteria and antibiotic resistance in neonatal sepsis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is characterised by bacteraemia and clinical symptoms caused by microorganisms and their toxic products. Gram negative bacteria are the commonest causes of neonatal Sepsis. The resistance to the commonly used antibiotics is alarmingly high. The major reason for emerging resistance against antibiotics is that doctors often do not take blood cultures before starting antibiotics. We have carried out this study to find out various bacteria causing neonatal sepsis and their susceptibility to antibiotics for better management of neonatal sepsis. METHODS: A total of 130 neonates with sepsis who were found to be blood culture positive were taken in this study. Culture/sensitivity was done, isolated organisms identified and their sensitivity/resistance was noted against different antibiotics. Data were arranged in terms of frequencies and percentage. RESULTS: Out of 130 culture proven cases of neonatal sepsis, gram negative bacteria were found in 71 (54.6%) cases and gram positive bacteria in 59 (45.4%) cases. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common bacteria found in 35 (26.9%) cases followed by Escherichia coli in 30 (23.1%) cases. Acinetobacter species, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebseila, Streptococci, Enterobacter cloacae and Morexella species were found in 17 (13.1%), 17 (13.1%), 13 (10%), 7 (5.4%), 6 (4.6%), and 5 (3.8%) cases respectively. In most of the cases causative organisms were found to be resistant to commonly used antibiotics like ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone (77.7%, 81.5%, 63.1%, and 66.9% respectively). There was comparatively less (56.9%) resistance to ceftazidime. Gentamicin had resistance in 55.1% cases, while amikacin and tobramycin had relatively less resistance (17.4% and 34.8% cases respectively). Quinolones and imipenem had relatively less resistance. Vancomycin was found to be effective in 100% cases of Staphylococcus group. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus aureus are the most common gram positive bacteria and Escherichia coli are the most common gram negative bacteria causing neonatal sepsis. Resistance to commonly used antibiotics is alarmingly increasing. Continued surveillance is mandatory to assess the resistance pattern at a certain level.
TI  - The variability of bacterial aerosol in poultry houses depending on selected factors.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study is aimed at evaluation of bacterial air contamination in intensive poultry breeding. The evaluation was based on the determined levels of bacterial concentrations and qualitative identification of isolated microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study covered 5 poultry houses: two hatcheries and three hen houses with the litter bed system. The air was sampled in three measurement series in the central part of the investigated workplace at the height of about 1.5 m over the ground, using portable measuring sets consisting of a GilAir 5 (Sensidyne, USA) pump and a measuring head filled with a glass microfibre filter (Whatman, UK). For the quantitative and qualitative analysis of microorganisms were used appropriate microbiological media. RESULTS: The total concentrations of airborne mesophilic bacteria inside the poultry breeding houses ranged from 4.74 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.89 x 10(8) cfu/m(3). For Gram-negative bacteria, the range comprised the values from 4.33 x 10(2) cfu/m(3) to 4.29 x 10(6) cfu/m(3). The concentrations of the cocci of Enterococcus genus ranged from 1.53 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.09 x 10(7) cfu/m(3), whereas those of other Gram-positive bacteria from 3.78 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 6.65 x 10(7) cfu/m(3). The lowest concentrations of each group of the examined microorganisms were noted in the second measurement series when the air exchange in the breeding houses was over twice higher than in first and third measurement series because the mechanical ventilation was supported by natural ventilation (opened gates in the buildings). The lowest concentrations of total bacteria were obtained in those buildings where one-day old chickens were kept. Gram-positive bacteria of the genera: Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Corynebacterium, Brevibacterium, Micrococcus, Cellulomonas, Bacillus, Aerococcus, and Gram-negative bacteria of the genera: Pseudomonas, Moraxella, Escherichia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Pasteurella, Pantoea were isolated. It was shown that for most of the investigated livestock premises the total bacteria concentrations exceeded the reference value of 1.0 x 10(5) cfu/m(3). Furthermore, pathogenic microorganisms which are a potential threat to human health (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. ozaenae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium) were found among the identified bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the hygienic conditions of the working environment connected with litter bed system production of poultry are affected by changes of the efficiency of ventilation and create a direct health risk to employees. They should use personal protective measures to protect their respiratory tract, especially when the gates in the hen houses are closed.
TI  - Infections from CVC in the pediatric neoplastic patient. Single institution experience.
AB  - AIM: The present clinical study was carried out in order to evaluate in a perspective way the incidence of the infections caused by CVC, the micro-organisms mostly involved in the infectious process, the condition of aplasia in patients when blood cultures show positiveness and the incidence of removals expressed as number of performed removals/number of positive blood culture. METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2009 452 blood cultures from CVC were carried out on 120 patients affected by acute lymphoblastyic and myelougenous leukemia (38), Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (17) and solid tumors (65), with an average of 65 blood cultures per year showing an average positiveness of 21 cases/year. The blood cultures were performed, in hyperpyrexia, when there was a clinical suspicion of infection from CVC. RESULTS: On 452 blood cultures from CVC carried out (31.4% positive per Gram +, 53.7% per Gram-, 14.9% per miceti) 128 (28.3%) resulted positive, excluding presumed contaminations. They were divided as follows: 21 of Staphylococcus epidermidis (16%), 10 of Escherichia coli (8%), 10 of Klebsiella pneumoniae (8%), 8 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), 8 of Staphylococcus aureus (6%), 6 of Enterobacter cloacae (5%), 4 of Candida parapsilosis (3%) and 61 of other micro-organisms (48%). It was necessary to perform 27 CVC removals. The micro-organisms most frequently involved in removals of the CVC were finally analyzed and the resulting frequency percentages are: - 85% for Gram- germs; -8% for Gram + germs; -7% for Mycete. CONCLUSION: Our clinical study has confirmed that in pediatric age neoplastic individuals there is a prevalence of CVC-correlated infections from Gram- and an elevated association of removals of the CVC caused by infections from Pseudomonas and Klebsiella, germs more frequently associated to clinical conditions of marked aplastic anemia.
TI  - Spread of an OmpK36-modified ST15 Klebsiella pneumoniae variant during an outbreak involving multiple carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae species and clones.
AB  - We aim to characterise multiple ertapenem-resistant (ERT-R, n = 15) Enterobacteriaceae isolates identified as presumptive carbapenemase producers in a Portuguese hospital in a short period of time (March-July 2010). Antibiotic susceptibility patterns, beta-lactamases, genetic relatedness [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)], plasmid content and major enterobacterial porins were investigated. Ertapenem resistance was associated with deficiencies in major porins and, in some cases, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or AmpC beta-lactamase production among outbreak and non-outbreak clones. Most isolates (n = 8) corresponded to two ERT-R Klebsiella pneumoniae ST15 PFGE-types: (i) a sporadic variant (Kp-A-ERT, n = 1) presenting a premature stop codon in ompK36 and (ii) an epidemic variant (Kp-B-ERT, n = 7) exhibiting a new OmpK36 porin variant, which differed additionally in plasmid and antibiotic susceptibility profiles. ST14 (n = 1) and ST45 (n = 1) K. pneumoniae, ST131 (n = 1) and ST354 (n = 1) Escherichia coli, Enterobacter asburiae (n = 1), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1) ERT-R clones were also sporadically detected. Porin changes in these isolates included non-sense mutations [ompK35, ompK36, ompF; minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 4-32 mg/l], IS-mediated porin disruptions (ompK36, ompC; MIC = 12->32 mg/l) or alterations in the L3 loop (ompK36; MIC = 4-16 mg/l). We describe, for the first time in Portugal, the simultaneous emergence of multiple ERT-R Enterobacteriaceae species and clones in a short period of time. Moreover, our results support that a CTX-M-15-producing ST15 K. pneumoniae with an OmpK36-modified porin might successfully spread in the nosocomial setting.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of meropenem against main bacterial species isolated from patient blood in 2010].
AB  - We investigated antimicrobial activities of meropenem and other antibiotics against 164 isolates (41 Escherichia coli, 16 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Enterobacter cloacae, 21 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 18 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 47 Staphylococcus epidermidis) from blood of the patients admitted to Keio University Hospital between January and October in 2010. Meropenem showed the potent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria especially and it maintained good broad spectrum antimicrobial activity including resistant strains through 13 years since when we started the investigation. These results indicated the validity of choosing meropenem as a first line antimicrobial agent for serious infectious diseases.
TI  - Epidemiological study of Enterobacteriaceae resistance to colistin in Sfax (Tunisia).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The authors had for aim to monitor Enterobacteriaceae resistance to colistin, during 6 years (2005-2010), and to study the epidemiology of Enterobacteriaceae resistant strains isolated in the Sfax region (Tunisia). DESIGN: This retrospective study was carried out in the microbiology laboratory, at the Habib Bourguiba teaching hospital in Sfax. All strains of colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients were studied. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty one strains of colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 93 patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent species (60.2%), followed by Enterobacter cloacae (26.9%), and Escherichia coli (12.9%). Thirteen strains (E. cloacae) were heteroresistant to colistin. Eighty one isolates (87.1%) were resistant to third generation cephalosporins. The rate of resistance to colistin ranged from 0.09% for E. coli to 1.2% for K. pneumoniae, and 1.5% for E. cloacae. A progressively increasing colistin resistance was observed for K. pneumoniae. Most resistant strains were isolated from urine in the urology department. Previous exposure to colistin was reported in 59.2% of patients. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis typing revealed different clones. CONCLUSIONS: Colistin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is a worrying phenomenon in Sfax. It is related to polyclonal diffusion. Continuous epidemiological monitoring and a rational use of colistin are necessary to limit the spreading of these colistin resistant strains and to maintain this antibiotic's effectiveness.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial activity of Salvia officinalis and Cichorium intybus extracts and antibiotics.
AB  - Synergistic activity of Salvia officinalis and Cichorium intybus extracts and commonly used antibiotics, amoxicillin and chloramphenicol, were evaluated. Interactions between plant extracts and antibiotics were tested by checkerboard method and interpreted as FIC index. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and clinical isolates Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were used. Salvia officinalis showed better synergistic capacity than Cichorium intybus. Synergistic interactions were observed between amoxicillin and acetone or ethyl acetate extract of Salvia officinalis and between chloramphenicol and ethyl acetate extract of Salvia officinalis. In the presence of sub-inhibitory concentration (1/4 MIC to 1/32 MIC) of sage extracts, the MIC values of antibiotics were decreased by 2- to 10-fold. Synergism was observed against all test bacteria, except Escherichia coli. The combinations of acetone and ethyl acetate extract from Cichorium intybus and antibiotics resulted in additive and indifferent effects against tested bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of the modified Hodge test-positive isolates of Enterobacteriaceae in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The modified Hodge test is a phenotypic test to detect KPC-type carbapenemase producers among Enterobacteriaceae, as recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. However, false positive results were reported. In this study, we aimed to large-scale investigate the characterization of the modified Hodge test-positive isolates of Enterobacteriaceae collected between 2006 and 2010 in Taiwan. METHODS: Fifty-six isolates, including 24 Enterobacter cloacae, 17 Escherichia coli, 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 5 Citrobacter freundii, tested positive with the modified Hodge test. The in vitro activities of 10 antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. Boronic acid combined-disk test was used to further confirm the KPC producers. Phenotype of ESBL, AmpC, class B carbapenemases, and profile of outer membrane proteins were investigated by the confirmatory test, boronic acid disk method, 2-mercaptopropionic acid double-disk method, and urea/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), respectively. beta-lactamase genes were examined by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: These isolates were resistant to ceftazidime (100%), aztreonam (82.1%), ertapenem (64.3%), gentamicin (53.6%), ciprofloxacin (50%), levofloxacin (48.2%), cefepime (19.6%), imipenem (16.1%), meropenem (12.5%), and amikacin (8.9%). Phenotypic testing among isolates revealed the production of ESBLs, metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs), and AmpC in 10 (17.9%), 16 (28.6%), and 12 (44.4%) isolates, respectively. Carbapenemase and non-carbapenemase beta-lactamase genes bla(TEM-1), bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), bla(IMP-8), bla(CMY-2), and bla(DHA-1) were found in 32 (57.1%), 19 (33.9%), 4 (7.1%), 16 (28.6%), 14 (25%), and 5 (8.9%) of the strains, respectively. No class A and D carbapenemase genes were detected. Outer membrane protein profile showed obviously decreased expression in 49 (87.5%) isolates with positive result of modified Hodge test. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that ESBLs, AmpC, and imipenemase-8 (IMP-8) carbapenemase coupled with decreased expression of outer membrane protein were prevalent in Enterobacteriaceae isolates testing positive for the modified Hodge test in Taiwan.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. In this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). RESULTS: It was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to rosuvastatin. On the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. Furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. CONCLUSION: Our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.
TI  - Nonrecovery of varying proportions of viable bacteria during spread plating governed by the extent of spreader usage and proposal for an alternate spotting-spreading approach to maximize the CFU.
AB  - AIMS: To elucidate the cause of high variations and inconsistencies in bacterial  CFU observed within and between different experiments while assessing viable bacterial counts through spread plating (SP). METHODS AND RESULTS: Following the inconsistent results, CFU estimations were undertaken through conventional SP using the spreader, or a modified approach that did not use spreader employing four organisms. The latter approach involving spotting-and-tilt-spreading of inoculum on agar surface [spotting spreading (SS)] yielded higher CFU by 11-120% over the weighted average depending on the organism and diluent. The adverse effect owing to the spreader was the most obvious in Escherichia coli followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus pumilus. Plate attributes that determined the surface moisture levels of agar medium and the spreading practice adopted by the personnel formed two other major influencing factors. Plating for shorter periods (<60 s) using fresh 15/20 ml plates caused loss of 3-12% CFU owing to inoculum adhesion to spreader irrespective of glass or polypropylene make. On the other hand, prolonging the plating brought down the CFU significantly. Spreader movement on agar surface subsequent to the exhaustion of free moisture, which was marked by the experiencing of some friction to smooth spreader movement, was detrimental to vegetative cells, while Bacillus spores were less affected. CONCLUSIONS: The study brings out that the way SP is carried out exerts significant effects on CFU influenced by plate conditions. Prolonged use of spreader on dry agar surface could be highly detrimental to bacterial cells. A mild use of spreader accounting for spreader-adhering inoculum or the practice of SS not involving the spreader is recommended. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study unravels the effects owing to the spreader on bacterial cells and the CFU and recommends an alternate approach of SS to minimize CFU inconsistencies and to maximize the viable bacterial counts.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of platelet (PLT)-poor plasma, PLT-rich plasma, PLT gel, and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate biomaterials against wound bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) gels exhibit antimicrobial activity useful for wound healing. The nature of the antibacterial component(s) is unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PLT-poor plasma (PPP), PLT-rich plasma (PRP), PLT gel (PG), and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate (S/D-PL) from two donors were evaluated either native or after complement heat inactivation. Materials were spiked at a 10% ratio (vol/vol) with approximately 10(7-8) colony-forming units/mL with four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria of the wound flora. Bacterial count was determined by plate assays at time of spiking and after 3 and 48 hours at 31 degrees C. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were also performed. RESULTS: There was no viable Escherichia coli colony for 48 hours after spiking to the plasma and PLT materials from both donors, corresponding to greater than 7.51 to greater than 9.05 log inactivation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus were inactivated (approx. 4.7, 7, and 2 log, respectively) 3 hours after spiking to PRP, PPP, or S/D-PL from the first donor but less (1.1, 4.6, and 0.2 log, respectively) in PG, before a regrowth at 48 hours in all materials. Similar data were obtained with the second donor. No plasma and PLT material had antimicrobial activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Complement-inactivated samples had no antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: Plasma complement is mostly responsible for the activity of plasma and PLT biomaterials against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. Activation of the coagulation to prepare PG may reduce antimicrobial activity. These findings may help optimize the control of wound infections by blood biomaterials.
TI  - Characterization of Enterobacteriaceae producing OXA-48-like carbapenemases in the UK.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize UK clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae producing  OXA-48-like carbapenemases and to compare their resistance plasmids. METHODS: Twenty-six enterobacteria producing OXA-48-like enzymes were studied. These were from 22 diverse hospitals in the UK. Isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were assigned to clonal lineages by multilocus sequence typing. Carbapenemase genes and their genetic environments were characterized by PCR and sequencing. Resistance plasmids were transferred by transformation or conjugation and compared by restriction analysis and PCR for genes encoding critical plasmid functions. RESULTS: Thirteen isolates of K. pneumoniae, 10 E. coli and 2 Enterobacter cloacae harboured a classical bla(OXA-48) gene; the K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to 11 sequence types (STs) and the E. coli to 7 STs, including ST131 and ST38. The bla(OXA-48) genes were located within either Tn1999 or Tn1999.2 transposons on related approximately 50 kb or approximately 62 kb plasmids, which lacked other resistance genes or, in one isolate, on an approximately 140 kb plasmid that also encoded OXA-9 and CTX-M group-9 beta-lactamases. One India-linked K. pneumoniae isolate had a bla(OXA-181) gene in association with an ISEcp1 insertion sequence on a 7 kb plasmid. CONCLUSIONS: Horizontal transfer of related plasmids has facilitated the spread of OXA-48 carbapenemase into multiple strains of several Enterobacteriaceae species. The clonal diversity of the producers suggests repeated introduction into the UK. Low carbapenem MICs for some producers complicates detection and creates a risk for unrecognized spread.
TI  - Globally dispersed mobile drug-resistance genes in gram-negative bacterial isolates from patients with bloodstream infections in a US urban general hospital.
AB  - Mobile drug-resistance genes with identical nucleic acid sequences carried by multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strains that cause community-acquired infections are becomingly increasingly dispersed worldwide. Over a 2-year period, we analysed gram-negative bacterial (GNB) pathogens from the blood of inpatients at an urban public hospital to determine what proportion of these isolates carried such globally dispersed drug-resistance genes. Of 376 GNB isolates, 167 (44 %) were Escherichia coli, 50 (13 %) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 25 (7 %) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 25 (7 %) were Proteus mirabilis and 20 (5 %) were Enterobacter cloacae; the remainder (24 %) comprised 26 different GNB species. Among E. coli isolates, class 1 integrons were detected in 64 (38 %). The most common integron gene cassette configuration was dfrA17-aadA5, found in 30 (25 %) of 119 drug-resistant E. coli isolates and in one isolate of Moraxella morganii. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes were found in 16 E. coli isolates (10 %). These genes with identical sequences were found in nearly 40 % of bloodstream E. coli isolates in the study hospital, as well as in a variety of bacterial species from clinical and non-clinical sources worldwide. Thus, a substantial proportion of bloodstream infections among hospitalized patients were caused by E. coli strains carrying drug-resistance genes that are dispersed globally in a wide variety of bacterial species.
TI  - Role of IncHI2 plasmids harbouring blaVIM-1, blaCTX-M-9, aac(6')-Ib and qnrA genes in the spread of multiresistant Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in different units at Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain.
AB  - Seven Enterobacter cloacae isolates and seven Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates harbouring a phenotype compatible with the production of a metallo-beta-lactamase were recovered between 2009 and 2011 in three Intensive Care Units of Hospital Vall d'Hebron (Barcelona, Spain). The presence of bla(VIM), bla(IMP), bla(NDM), bla(CTX-M), aac(6')-Ib, qnrA, qnrB and qnrS genes was screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Clonal relatedness of the isolates was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and, in the case of K. pneumoniae isolates, by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). PCR-based replicon typing, Southern hybridisation, plasmid double-locus sequence typing and MOB relaxase classification methods were used to identify and characterise the plasmids carrying the resistance genes. Transferability of the identified plasmids was tested by conjugation assays. All 14 isolates were found to carry bla(VIM-1), bla(CTX-M-9) (except one isolate), aac(6')-Ib and qnrA genes. Clonality assessment demonstrated that E. cloacae isolates were distributed in three clonal clusters, whereas all of the K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to one unique clone, identified as sequence type ST252. All studied isolates harboured a large conjugative IncHI2 MOB(H11) plasmid carrying all of the detected resistance genes. Plasmid DNA analysis showed that all of them belonged to the ST1 IncHI2 plasmid cluster and shared the same relaxase partial sequence. In conclusion, the present study describes the dissemination within a hospital of multiresistant E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae isolates producing VIM-1. A complex clonal epidemiology of the E. cloacae isolates was observed and plasmid DNA analysis strongly supports horizontal exchanges of the same IncHI2 plasmid between different strains and species.
TI  - Use of intravesicular amikacin irrigations for the treatment and prophylaxis of urinary tract infections in a patient with spina bifida and neurogenic bladder: a case report.
AB  - This case report describes the use of intravesicular amikacin irrigations to treat and prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in a pediatric patient with spina bifida and neurogenic bladder. A 15 year old Hispanic female was admitted for a UTI caused by Enterobacter cloacae and multiple-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A 7 day course of daily intravenous amikacin and ceftazidime was initiated along with twice daily intravesicular amikacin irrigations (15 mg/30 mL) with a dwell time of 2 hours. The patient improved and was discharged on prophylactic Bactrim SS (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) 1 tablet daily and intravesicular amikacin irrigations (15 mg/30 mL) once every other day. Approximately 2 months after discharge, the patient developed another UTI from multidrug resistant Escherichia coli and was treated with a 14 day course of daily intravenous ciprofloxacin accompanied by daily intravesicular amikacin irrigations. Adjunctive therapy with either once daily or twice daily intravesicular amikacin irrigations successfully treated the patient's UTI. However, prophylactic treatment with intravesicular amikacin failed to prevent future UTIs in this patient.
TI  - A 9-Year retrospective review of antibiotic cycling in a surgical intensive care  unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Six years after initiating a monthly antibiotic cycling protocol in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), we retrospectively reviewed antibiogram-derived sensitivities of predominant gram-negative pathogens before and after antibiotic cycling. We also examined susceptibility patterns in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) where antibiotic cycling is not practiced. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibiotic cycling protocol was implemented in the SICU starting in 2003, with monthly rotation of piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastin, and ceftazidime. SICU antibiogram data from positive clinical cultures for years 2000 and 2002 were included in the pre-cycling period, and those from 2004 to 2009 in the cycling period. RESULTS: Profiles of SICU pseudomonal isolates before (n = 116) and after (n = 205) implementing antibiotic cycling showed statistically significant improvements in susceptibility to ceftazidime (66% versus 81%; P = 0.003) and piperacillin/tazobactam (75% versus 85%; P = 0.021), while susceptibility to imipenem remained unaltered (70% in each case; P = 0.989). Susceptibility of E. coli isolates to piperacillin/tazobactam improved significantly (46% versus 83%; P < 0.0005), trend analysis showing this improvement to persist over the study period (P = 0.025). Similar findings were not observed in the MICU. Review of 2004-2009 antibiotic prescription practices showed monthly heterogeneity in the SICU, and a 2-fold higher prescribing of piperacillin/tazobactam in the MICU (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Six years into antibiotic cycling, we found either steady or improved susceptibilities of clinically relevant gram-negative organisms in the SICU. How much of this effect is from cycling is unknown, but the antibiotic heterogeneity provided by this practice justifies its ongoing use.
TI  - Characterization of beta-lactamase and porin mutants of Enterobacteriaceae selected with ceftaroline + avibactam (NXL104).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ceftaroline + avibactam (NXL104) is a novel inhibitor combination active against Enterobacteriaceae with class A and C beta-lactamases. We investigated its risk of mutational resistance. METHODS: Single- and multi-step mutants were sought and characterized from Enterobacteriaceae with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC beta-lactamases and KPC beta-lactamases. RESULTS: Overgrowth occurred on agar with low MIC multiples of ceftaroline + avibactam, but frequencies for single-step mutants were <10(-9). Most mutants were unstable, with only three remaining resistant on subculture. For one, from an CTX-M-15-positive Escherichia coli, the ceftaroline + avibactam MIC was raised, but the organism had reduced resistance to ceftaroline and lost resistance to other oxyimino-cephalosporins, with this profile retained when the mutant bla(CTX-M-15) was cloned into E. coli DH5alpha. Sequencing identified a Lys237Gln substitution in the CTX-M-15 variant. The other two stable single-step mutants were from an AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter cloacae strain; these had unaltered or slightly reduced resistance to other beta-lactams. Both had amino acids 213-226 deleted from the Omega loop of AmpC. Further stable mutants were obtained from AmpC-inducible and -derepressed E. cloacae in multi-step selection, and these variously had reduced expression of OmpC and OmpF, and/or Asn366His/Ile substitutions in AmpC. CONCLUSIONS: Stable resistant mutants were difficult to select. Those from AmpC-derepressed E. cloacae had porin loss or AmpC changes, including Omega loop deletions. A Lys237Gln substitution in CTX-M-15 conferred resistance, but largely abolished ESBL activity.
TI  - Antibacterial and antimycobacterial lignans and flavonoids from Larrea tridentata.
AB  - Three lignans and four flavonoids were isolated and characterized from Larrea tridentata and compounds were tested against 16 bacterial species/strains. Results showed that: dihydroguaiaretic acid (1) had activity towards methicillin resistant (MR) Staphylococcus aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 50 microg/mL) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC 12.5-50 microg/mL); 4-epi-larreatricin (2) was active against Enterobacter cloacae (MIC 12.5 microg/mL), as well as sensitive (MIC 50 microg/mL) and MDR strains of M. tuberculosis (MIC 25 microg/mL). 3'-Demethoxy-6-O-demethylisoguaiacin (3) displayed activity against sensitive and resistant S. aureus (MIC 25 microg/mL), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC 12.5 microg/mL), Escherichia coli (MIC 50 microg/mL), E. cloacae (MIC 12.5 microg/mL) and MDR strains of M. tuberculosis (MIC 12.5 microg/mL). 5,4'-Dihydroxy-3,7,8,3'-tetramethoxyflavone (4) and 5,4'-dihydroxy-3,7,8-trimethoxyflavone (5) were active against M. tuberculosis MDR strains having MIC values of 25 and 25-50 microg/mL, respectively, while 5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (6) was active against S. aureus (MIC 50 microg/mL) and E. faecalis (MIC 50 microg/mL). We concluded that lignan 3 is the main compound responsible for the antibacterial activity of L. tridentata. Lignans 1 and 2 as well as flavonoid 6 contribute with some degree of antibacterial activity. On the other hand, compounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 contributed to the antimycobacterial activity found in L. tridentata.
TI  - Pathogen identification with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy: the effect of  bacterial and biofluid specimen contamination.
AB  - In this paper, the potential use of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) for the rapid discrimination and identification of bacterial pathogens in realistic clinical specimens is investigated. Specifically, the common problem of sample contamination was studied by creating mixed samples to investigate the effect that the presence of a second contaminant bacterium in the specimen had on the LIBS-based identification of the primary pathogen. Two closely related bacterial specimens, Escherichia coli strain ATCC 25922 and Enterobacter cloacae strain ATCC 13047, were mixed together in mixing fractions of 10:1, 100:1, and 1000:1. LIBS spectra from the three mixtures were reliably classified as the correct E. coli strain with 98.5% accuracy when all the mixtures were withheld from the training model and classified against spectra from pure specimens. To simulate a rapid test for the presence of urinary tract infection pathogens, LIBS spectra were obtained from specimens of Staphylococcus epidermidis obtained from distilled water and sterile urine. LIBS spectra from the urine-harvested bacteria were classified as S. epidermidis with 100% accuracy when classified using a model containing only spectra from other Staphylococci species and with 88.5% accuracy when a model containing five genera of bacteria was utilized. Bacterial specimens comprising five different genera and 13 classifiable taxonomic groups of species and strains were compiled in a library that was tested using external validation techniques. The importance of utilizing external validation techniques where the library is tested with data withheld from all previous testing and training of the model was revealed by comparing the results against "leave-one-out" cross-validation results. Last, the effect of using sequential models for the classification of a single unknown spectrum was investigated by comparing the misclassification of two closely related bacteria, E. coli and E. cloacae, when the classification was first performed using the five-genus bacterial library and then with a smaller model consisting only of E. coli and E. cloacae specimens. This result shows the utility of using successively more targeted analyses and models that use preliminary classifications from more general models as input.
TI  - Fecal carriage of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae: a hidden reservoir  in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients.
AB  - Fecal carriage of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) has not been extensively investigated, except in the cases of selected patients at risk, mostly during outbreaks. A total of 1,100 fecal samples randomly collected in our institution in two different periods in 2006 (n = 600) and 2009-2010 (n = 500) from hospitalized (26.8%) and nonhospitalized (73.2%) patients were screened for CPE. The first period coincided with an outbreak of VIM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and the second one coincided with the emergence of KPC enzymes in our hospital. Diluted samples in saline were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth with 1 mug/ml imipenem and subcultured in MacConkey agar plates with 4 mug/ml ceftazidime. Growing colonies were screened for CPE (modified Hodge test and EDTA and boronic acid synergy tests). Carbapenemase genes, plasmids in which they are located, and clonal relatedness were determined. Individuals who exhibited fecal carriage of CPE (11/1,043, 1.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 1.88) included 8 hospitalized (carriage rate, 2.9%; 95% CI, 1.24 to 5.55) and 3 nonhospitalized patients (carriage rate, 0.4%; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.14), the latter being identified in 2009. Eighty-two percent of colonized patients were not infected with CPE. Isolates harboring bla(VIM-1) with or without bla(SHV-12) were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 8; ST39, ST688, ST253, and ST163), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 3; two pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] types), Escherichia coli (n = 2; ST155 and ST2441), and Citrobacter freundii (n = 1). Some of these lineages had previously been detected in our institution. The bla(VIM-1) gene was a member of the class 1 integrons In110 (bla(VIM-1)-aacA4-aadA1) and In113 (bla(VIM-1)-aacA4-dhfrII) located on plasmids IncN (n = 11; 30 to 50 kb) and IncHI2 (n = 3; 300 kb), respectively. Dissemination of bla(VIM-1) class-1 integrons within highly transferable plasmids in a polyclonal population has potentially contributed to the maintenance and spread of CPE.
TI  - Occurrence and characteristics of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase- and AmpC-producing clinical isolates derived from companion animals and horses.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the occurrence and characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates in clinical samples of companion animals and horses and compare the results with ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates described in humans. METHODS: Between October 2007 and August 2009, 2700 Enterobacteriaceae derived from clinical infections in companion animals and horses were collected. Isolates displaying inhibition zones of </= 25 mm for ceftiofur and/or cefquinome by disc diffusion were included. ESBL/AmpC production was confirmed by combination disc tests. The presence of resistance genes was identified by microarray, PCR and sequencing, Escherichia coli genotypes by multilocus sequence typing and antimicrobial susceptibility by broth microdilution. RESULTS: Sixty-five isolates from dogs (n = 38), cats (n = 14), horses (n = 12) and a turtle were included. Six Enterobacteriaceae species were observed, mostly derived from urinary tract infections (n = 32). All except 10 isolates tested resistant to cefotaxime and ceftazidime by broth microdilution using clinical breakpoints. ESBL/AmpC genes observed were bla(CTX-M-1, -2, -9, -14, -15,) bla(TEM-52), bla(CMY-2) and bla(CMY-)(39). bla(CTX-M-1) was predominant (n = 17). bla(CTX-M-9) occurred in combination with qnrA1 in 3 of the 11 Enterobacter cloacae isolates. Twenty-eight different E. coli sequence types (STs) were found. E. coli carrying bla(CTX-M-1) belonged to 13 STs of which 3 were previously described in Dutch poultry and patients. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study among a large collection of Dutch companion animals and horses characterizing ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates. A similarity in resistance genes and E. coli STs among these isolates and isolates from Dutch poultry and humans may suggest exchange of resistance between different reservoirs.
TI  - Functional consequence of covalent reaction of phosphoenolpyruvate with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase (MurA).
AB  - The enzyme MurA has been an established antibiotic target since the discovery of  fosfomycin, which specifically inhibits MurA by covalent modification of the active site residue Cys-115. Early biochemical studies established that Cys-115 also covalently reacts with substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to yield a phospholactoyl adduct, but the structural and functional consequences of this reaction remained obscure. We captured and depicted the Cys-115-PEP adduct of Enterobacter cloacae MurA in various reaction states by X-ray crystallography. The data suggest that cellular MurA predominantly exists in a tightly locked complex with UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (UNAM), the product of the MurB reaction, with PEP covalently attached to Cys-115. The uniqueness and rigidity of this "dormant" complex was previously not recognized and presumably accounts for the failure of drug discovery efforts toward the identification of novel and effective MurA inhibitors. We demonstrate that recently published crystal structures of MurA from various organisms determined by different laboratories were indeed misinterpreted and actually contain UNAM and covalently bound PEP. The Cys-115-PEP adduct was also captured in vitro during the reaction of free MurA and substrate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine or isomer UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine. The now available series of crystal structures allows a comprehensive view of the reaction cycle of MurA. It appears that the covalent reaction of MurA with PEP fulfills dual functions by tightening the complex with UNAM for the efficient feedback regulation of murein biosynthesis and by priming the PEP molecule for instantaneous reaction with substrate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine.
TI  - Comparison of the genetic structures surrounding qnrA1 in Korean Enterobacter cloacae and Chinese Escherichia coli strains isolated in the early 2000s: evidence for qnrA mobilization via Inc HI2 type plasmid.
AB  - The flanking genetic structure of qnrA1 in Korean Enterobacter loacae was identical to that of the Chinese Escherichia coli strain, the first qnrA1-carrying strain reported in Asia. Analysis of restriction enzyme sites and Southern blot hybridization results showed that qnrA1 was transferred between E. cloacae and E. coli via Inc HI2 type plasmid.
TI  - Determination of antimicrobial activity and resistance to oxidation of moringa peregrina seed oil.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the oil extracted with n-hexane from the seeds of Moringa peregrina was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. The oil proved effective against all of the tested microorganisms. Standard antibiotics (netilmycin, 5-flucytocine, intraconazole and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid) were used for comparison. The resistance to oxidation of the extracted seed oil was also determined.
TI  - [Trends of bacterial resistance phenotypes in high-complexity public and private  hospitals in Colombia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Describe and compare the frequency of bacterial resistance phenotypes  of microorganisms obtained from patients in intensive care units (ICU) and other (non-ICU) high-complexity public and private hospital services in Colombia. METHODS: A retrospective observational, analytical, multicenter study was conducted. The records from January 2007 to December 2009 on bacterial isolates and bacterial resistance phenotypes of microorganisms obtained from ICU and non-ICU patients in 79 high-complexity public and private hospitals were consolidated. The information was analyzed with the WHONET((R)) 5.5 (WHO) software, following the 2009 recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, and summarized on an Excel((R)) spreadsheet. A descriptive analysis with the calculation of proportions was performed. The trends were analyzed with Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: The 2007-2009 trends for bacterial resistance phenotypes show increased percentages of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, imipenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin-resistant K. pneumoniae, ceftazidime-resistant Escherichia coli and cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacter cloacae (r = 1, P < 0.01), and reduced percentages of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli, ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (r = -1, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The trend analysis presented in this study is the baseline for establishing a national epidemiological surveillance subsystem. The trends observed reveal that bacterial resistance to antimicrobial drugs in hospitals in Colombia is a dynamic phenomenon, with evidence of the emergence of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and imipenem-resistant K. pneumoniae phenotypes in the hospitals.

TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates of ertapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime and aztreonam.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in vitro susceptibility of ertapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae (ENSE) isolates to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime and aztreonam. METHODS: Clinical isolates of ENSE tested in this study were obtained from 10 major teaching hospitals in Taiwan during the period January 2008 to October 2010. MICs of ertapenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime and aztreonam were determined by the agar dilution method and were interpreted based on 2011 MIC interpretive criteria recommended by the CLSI and EUCAST. RESULTS: A total of 412 non-duplicate ENSE isolates (with ertapenem MIC values >/= 0.5 mg/L) were tested. These comprised 72 isolates of Escherichia coli [28 (38.9%) were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates], 167 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae [74 (44.3%) were ESBL-producing isolates], 115 isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, 13 isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes, 20 isolates of Citrobacter freundii and 25 isolates of Serratia marcescens. According to 2011 CLSI (EUCAST) MIC interpretive breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae, 64% (31%) of all ENSE isolates, 45.8% (16.7%) of E. coli isolates, 53% (29.3%) of K. pneumoniae isolates and 86.1% (35.7%) of E. cloacae isolates were susceptible to cefepime. As for ESBL-producing ENSE isolates, 25% and 14.3% of E. coli isolates and 36.5% and 10.8% of K. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to cefepime based on CLSI and EUCAST criteria, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cefepime exerts in vitro antimicrobial activity against a significant portion of clinical isolates of ENSE, although there are discrepancies between results obtained using the CLSI-2011 and EUCAST-2011 guidelines.
TI  - Complications of PORT-A-CATH(R) in patients with sickle cell disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease (SCD). However, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central venous catheters (CVCs) in adult patients with moderate or severe SCD. AIMS: To review our experience with the use of the PORT-A-CATH((R)) device in sixteen patients with SCD undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. METHODS: Among a cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen SCD patients required the insertion of a PORT-A-CATH((R)) device. These patients included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 +/- 2.3; mean +/- SD]. A total of 24 PORT-A-CATH((R)) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the study period. Eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2 devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted. RESULTS: Out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. The organisms involved were Candida spp. (3), C. Parapsilosis (2), C. albicans (1), C. famata (1), C. lusitanice (1), Staphylococcus spp. (6), and S. aureus (3), as well as the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic Streptococcus (1), Diphtheroid bacilli (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Ps. Spp. (3), Escherichia coli (3), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Klebsiella spp. (1), Serratia liquefaciens (1), Serratia fanticola (1), Achromobacter spp. (2) Chromobacterium violaceum (1), Delftia acidovirans (1), Stenotrophomonas maltophile (1), Alcaligenes faecalis (1), and Enterobacter cloacae (1). Two episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. One case presented with right atrial thrombosis/SVC syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm thrombosis. Two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports in place at the time of this study. The median working life of the ports was 688.5 days (range: 39-3925). The rate of infective complications was 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly correlated with the number of ports [Pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that patients with SCD suffer infective complications associated with the PORT-A-CATH((R)), which often necessitate its removal. Although these devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.
TI  - New heterocyclic compounds from 1,2,4-triazole and 1,3,4-thiadiazole class bearing diphenylsulfone moieties. Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity evaluation.
AB  - Some new 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-4-(R)-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3(4H)-thiones 4a,b; 5a,b and 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-N-(R)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amines 6a,b; 7a,b were obtained by cyclization of new N(1)-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-N(4)-(R)-thiosemicarbazides 2a,b; 3a,b (X=H, Br). The 1,2,4-triazoles were synthesized by intramolecular cyclization of acylthiosemicarbazides, in basic media. On the other hand, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles were obtained from same acylthiosemicarbazides, in acidic media. These new intermediates from thiosemicarbazide class were afforded by the reaction of 4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoic acids hydrazides (X=H, Br) 1a,b with 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl or 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl isothiocyanate. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. All the new compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activity against some bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 13061, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 49141, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and yeasts (Candida albicans ATCC 90028 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019).
TI  - Taurolidine lock solution in the secondary prevention of central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infection in home parenteral nutrition patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infection (CBSI) is a serious complication in patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN). The aim was to analyze the impact of taurolidine-citrate lock solution (TLS) on CBSI rate in HPN patients with a high risk of catheter infection. METHODS: This retrospective study compared CBSI rates 12 months before and 12 months after implementation of TLS. In the first period, only standardized strategies were used to reduce the CBSI rate. In the second period, TLS was injected into the catheter at the end of parenteral nutrition. The CBSI rate with a confident interval was calculated as Poisson event rates, and compared by testing for homogeneity of rates. RESULTS: 15 patients were included. During the 24 months, the CBSI rate was 6.58/1000 catheter-days in the first period and 1.09/1000 catheter-days in the second period (p < 0.001). In patients with TLS once a week (n = 8), the CBSI rate decreased from 4.8/1000 catheter-days to 1.37/1000 catheter-days (p = 0.02) and in patients with TLS after each TPN (n = 7), the CBSI rate decreased from 8.61/1000 catheter-days to 0.78/1000 catheter-days (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: In HPN patients, TLS associated with standardized precautions significantly reduced the CBSI rate.
TI  - Multi-centre evaluation of a phenotypic extended spectrum beta-lactamase detection guideline in the routine setting.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the routine setting performance of a guideline for phenotypic detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Enterobacteriaceae, recommending ESBL confirmation with Etest or combination disc for isolates with a positive ESBL screen test (i.e. cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime MIC >1 mg/L or an automated system ESBL warning). Twenty laboratories submitted 443 Enterobacteriaceae with a positive ESBL screen test and their confirmation test result (74%Escherichia coli, 12%Enterobacter cloacae, 8%Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3%Proteus mirabilis, 2%Klebsiella oxytoca). Presence of ESBL genes was used as reference test. Accuracy of local phenotypic ESBL detection was 88%. The positive predictive value (PPV) of local screen tests was 70%, and differed per method (Vitek-2: 69%, Phoenix: 68%, disc diffusion: 92%), and species (95%K. pneumoniae-27%K. oxytoca). A low PPV (3%) was observed for isolates with automated system alarm but third-generation cephalosporin MICs <2 mg/L. Local ESBL confirmation had a PPV and negative predictive value (NPV) of 93% and 90%, respectively. Compared with centrally performed confirmation tests, 7% of local tests were misinterpreted. Combination disc was more specific than Etest (91% versus 61%). Confirmation tests were not reliable for P. mirabilis and K. oxytoca (PPV 33% and 38%, respectively, although NPVs were 100%). In conclusion, performance of Etests could be enhanced by education of technicians to improve their interpretation, by genotypic ESBL confirmation of P. mirabilis and K. oxytoca isolates with positive phenotypic ESBL confirmation, and by interpreting isolates with a positive ESBL alarm but an MIC <2 mg/L for cefotaxime and ceftazidime as ESBL-negative.
TI  - Ratiometric fluorescence detection of pathogenic bacteria resistant to broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  
TI  - Antimicrobial peptide gene induction, involvement of Toll and IMD pathways and defense against bacteria in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum.
AB  - Using Tribolium castaneum, we quantitatively investigated the induction of nine antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes by live gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae), gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis) and the budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Then, five representative AMP genes were selected, and the involvement of the Toll and IMD pathways in their induction by E. coli, M. luteus and S. cerevisiae was examined by utilizing RNA interference of either MyD88 or IMD. Results indicated: Robust and acute induction of three genes by the two bacterial species was mediated mainly by the IMD pathway; slow and sustained induction of one gene by the two bacteria was mediated mainly by the Toll pathway; induction of the remaining one gene by the two bacteria was mediated by both pathways; induction of the five genes by the yeast was mediated by the Toll and/or IMD pathways depending on respective genes. These results suggest that more promiscuous activation and usage of the two pathways may occur in T. castaneum than in Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, the IMD pathway was revealed to dominantly contribute to defense against two bacterial species, gram-negative E. cloacae and gram-positive B. subtilis that possesses DAP-type peptidoglycan.
TI  - Molecular characterization of NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates in Singapore hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we molecularly characterized 12 NDM-1 producing clinical Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae) isolates that were part of a collection of non-carbapenem susceptible isolates obtained during a one-year period. These isolates were obtained from four local general hospitals in Singapore. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and sequencing was used to determine the presence of beta-lactamase encoding genes (bla) including bla NDM-1 and plasmid-mediated quinolone and aminoglycoside resistance determinants. Conjugation experiments were performed to determine the transferability of bla NDM-1. Isolate relatedness was determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: The isolates were completely resistant to the second- and third-generation cephalosporins tested as well as carbapenems. Susceptibility profiling of the isolates indicated that 100% retained susceptibility to tigecycline while 11/12 (91.7%) were susceptible to colistin. The bla NDM-1 gene was encoded on plasmids that were easily transferable. None of the patients had a travel history to countries where NDM-1 has been reported. The isolates appear clonally unrelated with MLST, revealing a diversity of clonal types among the Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli isolates. CONCLUSION: The ease of NDM-1 plasmid transmissibility may help their dissemination among the Enterobacteriaceae. Although it appears that the isolates are clonally unrelated, epidemiological links cannot be fully excluded without further research.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections after liver transplantation - spectrum and risk factors.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Gram-negative bacilli infections, especially multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli infections, are the leading cause of high mortality after liver transplantation. This study sought to investigate the type of infection, infection rate, pathogenic spectrum, antibiotic-resistance profile, risk factors, and epidemiology of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infection. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted and data of 217 liver transplant patients receiving cadaveric livers between January 2007 and April 2010 were analyzed. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration test. Extended-spectrum and metallo-beta-lactamase assays were used to analyze beta-lactamase-produced isolates, and repetitive-sequence polymerase chain reaction was used to differentiate bacterium subspecies. RESULTS: Sixty-seven isolates of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 66 infected liver transplant patients. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (100%, 8/8), Klebsiella pneumoniae (61.5%, 8/13), Enterobacter cloacae (75%, 3/4) and Escherichia coli (81.3%, 13/16) were the most common extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacilli. Metallo-beta-lactamase expressing isolates were identified as S. maltophilia (100%, 8/8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (83.3%, 5/6), Acinetobacter baumannii (95%, 19/20). Significant independent risk factors for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infection were extended use of pre-transplant broad-spectrum antibiotics (OR 9.027, P=0.001) and prolonged (>==72h) endotracheal intubation (OR 3.537, P=0.033). CONCLUSIONS: To reduce the risk of acquiring MDR gram-negative bacillus infections after liver transplant, control measures are required to limit the use of prophylactic antibiotic in preventing infection during liver transplant and to shorten endotracheal intubation time.
TI  - [Five years follow-up of infections with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Actually, epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing enterobacteriaceae is increasing worldwide, especially in urinary tract infections (UTI). The objective of the study was to investigate the epidemiology of ESBL producers in a department of urology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, monocentric study, which included all patients with positive culture showing an ESBL producing enterobacteriaceae in a department of urology between 2005 and 2009 included. RESULTS: The prevalence of ESBL producers in UTI was 2/113 (1.8%) in 2005 and 3/196 (1.5%) in 2009 (P=0.87). Twenty-seven isolates were included: 66.7% of Escherichia coli, 11.1% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 11.1% of Enterobacter cloacae. ESBL producers were resistant to another antibiotic family in 24 cases (88.8%). The mean age in this study was 70.4 years, 70% of patients had another antibiotherapy in the past 6 months, 87% an hospitalization within 90% had surgery. Among the patients, 56.5% had a material. The infection was community-acquired in three cases only. Thirty-five percent of patients had no symptoms, 26% presented with severe sepsis. CONCLUSION: This report was a five-year retrospective study of BLSE-positive bacteria showing the nosocomial infection with ESBL producers and their multiresistance to usual antibiotics without any increase of their prevalence.
TI  - Enhanced antibacterial activities of leonuri herba extracts containing silver nanoparticles.
AB  - We report an efficient and powerful green process to enhance the antibacterial activities of the Leonuri herba extract. Plant sources, especially leaves and herbs, are precious for the generation of gold and silver nanoparticles. Various kinds of polyphenols and hydroxyl groups are capable of processing a reduction reaction to generate metals from its corresponding salts. We have prepared gold and silver nanoparticles with 70% ethanol and water extracts. No other toxic chemicals were utilized and the extracts played dual roles as reducing and stabilizing agents. For the generation of nanoparticles, both oven incubation and autoclaving methods were applied and the reaction conditions were optimized. Surface plasmon resonance band indicated that the formation of nanoparticles was successful. Images of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed mostly spherical nanoparticles ranging from 9.9 to 13.0 nm in size. A water extract containing silver nanoparticles exhibited remarkable (approximately 127-fold) enhancement in antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae when compared with the water extract alone. In addition, antibacterial activity towards Gram-negative bacteria was greater than that against Gram-positive bacteria. The process reported here has the potential to be a new approach to improve the antibacterial activities of plant extracts.
TI  - Effects of clinical breakpoint changes in CLSI guidelines 2010/2011 and EUCAST guidelines 2011 on antibiotic susceptibility test reporting of Gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of clinical breakpoint changes in CLSI 2010 and 2011 guidelines and EUCAST 2011 guidelines on antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) reports. METHODS: In total, 3713 non-duplicate clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter baumannii were analysed. Inhibition zone diameters were determined for beta-lactams, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. CLSI 2009-11 and EUCAST 2011 clinical breakpoints were applied. RESULTS: Changes in resistance as defined per the guidelines affected individual species and drug classes differently. The cefepime resistance rate in Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae increased from 2.1% and 1.3% to 8.2% and 6.9%, respectively, applying CLSI 2009-11 versus EUCAST 2011 guidelines. Ertapenem resistance rates in E. cloacae increased from 2.6% with CLSI 2009 to 7.2% for CLSI 2010 and 2011, and to 10.1% when applying EUCAST 2011. Cefepime and meropenem resistance rates in P. aeruginosa increased from 12.2% and 20.6% to 19.8% and 27.7%, respectively, comparing CLSI 2009-11 with EUCAST 2011. Tobramycin and gentamicin resistance rates in A. baumannii increased from 15.9% and 25.4% to 34.9% and 44.4% applying CLSI 2009-11 versus EUCAST 2011. CONCLUSIONS: Higher resistance rates reported due to breakpoint changes in CLSI and EUCAST guidelines will result in increasing numbers of Gram-negative bacilli reported as multidrug resistant. AST reports classifying amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefepime or carbapenem resistance will lead clinicians to use alternative agents. Upon implementation of the EUCAST guidelines, laboratories should be aware of the implications of modified drug susceptibility testing reports on antibiotic prescription policies.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among gram-negative isolates collected from intensive care units in North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific Rim, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa between 2004 and 2009 as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial is an antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance program that collects gram-positive and gram-negative organisms globally. OBJECTIVE: This analysis reports on antimicrobial susceptibility among 23,918 gram-negative isolates collected from intensive care units globally between 2004 and 2009. METHODS: MICs and susceptibility were determined according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (US Food and Drug Administration breakpoints were applied against tigecycline). RESULTS: Gram-negative isolates were collected from 6 geographical regions: North America, 8099 isolates; Europe, 9244; Asia-Pacific Rim, 1573; Latin America, 3996; the Middle East, 635; and Africa, 371. North America reported the lowest rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli both overall (12.8% and 4.7%, respectively) and in each year of collection. High rates of ESBL production were reported among K pneumoniae from Latin America (45.5%) and Africa (54.9%) and for E coli from the Middle East (32.4%). Imipenem and tigecycline maintained >90% susceptibility against K pneumoniae, E coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens for all regions. Susceptibility to meropenem was >90% against all K oxytoca and S marcescens. Large regional variations in susceptibility among Acinetobacter baumannii were reported, with the largest variations reported for amikacin (75.2% in North America, 21.8% in the Middle East) and meropenem (60.4% in North America, 15.9% in Africa). MIC(90) values for tigecycline against A baumannii were low (1-2 mg/L) for all regions. Against P aeruginosa, susceptibility to amikacin (97.5% in North America, 67.5% in Latin America) and meropenem (79.1% in North America, 51.4% in Africa) had the largest variations. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative intensive care unit isolates was highly variable between geographic regions. The carbapenems were active in vitro against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii and P aeruginosa, and tigecycline continued to be active in vitro against members of the Enterobacteriaceae and A baumannii collected from intensive care units in North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific Rim, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.
TI  - Chromate-resistance genes in plasmids from antibiotic-resistant nosocomial enterobacterial isolates.
AB  - The presence of chromate-resistance genes in enterobacteria was evaluated in a collection of 109 antibiotic-resistant nosocomial isolates from nine major cities in Mexico. Results were compared with the presence of mercury-resistance genes. Susceptibility tests showed that 21% of the isolates were resistant to chromate (Cr(R)), whereas 36% were resistant to mercury (Hg(R)). Cr(R) levels were high in Klebsiella pneumoniae (61%), low in Enterobacter cloacae (12%) and Escherichia coli (4%), and null in Salmonella sp. isolates. Colony hybridization demonstrated that the majority of metal-resistant isolates hybridized with chrA gene (87% of Cr(R) isolates), encoding a CHR transporter homologue, and merA gene (74% of Hg(R) isolates), encoding MerA mercuric reductase, suggesting that most isolates expressed these widespread metal-resistance systems. Southern blot hybridization of Cr(R) isolates showed that plasmids of 80, 85, and 95 kb from K. pneumoniae isolates, and of 100 kb from an E. cloacae isolate, contained chrA-related sequences. These plasmids belonged to IncN or IncP incompatibility groups, and conferred Cr(R), as well as multiple antibiotic resistance, when transferred by conjugation to an E. coli standard strain. These data indicated that Cr(R) genes may be distributed among clinical enterobacteria via conjugative plasmids, probably by coselection with antibiotic-resistant genes.
TI  - Impact of solvent/detergent treatment of plasma on transfusion-relevant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment in a medical device has been developed for pathogen reduction of plasma for transfusion. Impact of S/D on bacterial growth and on the capacity of complement to kill bacteria has been investigated in this study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A pool of apheresis plasma from four donors was spiked with eight transfusion-relevant bacteria. Plasma was treated with 1% tri(n-butyl) phosphate and 1% Triton X-45 at 31 degrees C for 90 min and then extracted by oil at 31 degrees C for 70 min. Decomplemented plasma and Phosphate Buffer Saline were used as controls. Bacterial count was determined in samples taken immediately after spiking, or after S/D and oil treatment. Similar experiments were conducted using three individual recovered plasma donations. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were performed using discs soaked with plasma samples whether containing the S/D agents or not. RESULTS: The mean reduction factors of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae due to complement during S/D treatment were >8.75, 4.71, and 4.18 log in pooled plasma and >7.42, 2.24 and >6.08 log in individual plasmas, respectively. Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis were inactivated by S/D (>7.04 and 1.60 log in pooled, and >6.06 and 2.39 in individual plasmas, respectively). Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter cloacae did not multiply during S/D treatment of plasma. Growth inhibition tests revealed an inhibition of three gram-negative bacteria by complement and all gram-positive by S/D. CONCLUSION: The S/D treatment of plasma does not alter the bactericidal activity of complement, and inactivates some gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Investigation of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients].
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is widely found in the environment, may lead to serious nosocomial infections. Due to its intrinsic resistance to many antibacterial agents, treatment of P.aeruginosa infections usually present difficulty. Quinolones, especially ciprofloxacin, are crutial antibiotics for the treatment of P.aeruginosa infections. However resistance developing to quinolones may become an important problem. Resistance to quinolones is often a result of chromosomal mutations and by the effect of efflux pumps. Recently plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance have been reportedin the members of Enterobacteriaceae family. The gene responsible for this resistance is called qnr. In addition to qnr genes there is also another gene called aac(6)-Ib-cr responsible for plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance and aminoglycoside resistance. Limited studies which to screen P.aeruginosa strains for the presence of qnr gene region, revealed no positivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in P.aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. A total of 110 P.aeruginosa strains isolated from respiratory tract specimens from the patients were included in the study. Ciprofloxacin susceptibilities of the isolates were detected by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method according to CLSI guidelines. The presence of qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrS and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes were searched by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the use of specific individual primer pairs. As positive control strains, Escherichia coli J53 pMG252 (qnrA1 positive), E.coli J53 pMG252 (qnrS1 positive), E.coli J53 pMG258 (qnrB1 and aac(6')-Ib-cr positive), Klebsiella pneumoniae ref.15 (qnrB positive), Enterobacter cloacae ref.287 (qnrS positive), E.coli ref.20 (qnrA positive) and E.coli DH10 conjugated with pHS11 plasmid (qnrC positive) were used. Of 110 P.aeruginosa clinical isolates, 13 were found resistant to ciprofloxacin, while 7 were intermediate. However multiplex PCR yielded no positivity in terms of qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrS and aac(6')-Ib-cr gene regions. In conclusion, although our results indicated that none of the tested P.aeruginosa strains harboured those genes, further multicenter studies with large numbers of isolates are needed to confirm these results.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of extended spectrum beta-lactamases in Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia group bacteria, in Algeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The authors had for aim to assess the local epidemiology, antibiotic  resistance, and molecular typing of expanded spectrum betalactamase producing Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Serratia (ESBL KES). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and seven strains of the KES group were isolated in the microbiology laboratory of the Annaba Ibn Rochd hospital in 2009. The antibiotic resistance (diffusion method and MIC) was tested and ESBL detection was performed as recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). The characterization of genes for resistance to beta-lactams (CTX-M-1, TEM, and SHV) and AmpC cephalosporinase (DHA-1) was performed by polymerase chain reaction. The epidemiological relationship among identified strains was analyzed by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). Genetic transfers were performed by conjugation using sodium azide resistant Escherichia coli K(12)J(5) as recipient strain. RESULTS: The overall incidence of ESBL KES was 31.4% (65/207) distributed as follows: 17.4% of Klebsiella spp., 7.2% Enterobacter spp., and 6.8% Serratia marcescens. The beta-lactamase CTX-M 1 types were predominant (88%), followed by TEM (36.5%), and SHV (31.1%). Twenty-three strains expressed at least two bla genes. DHA-1 type cephalosporinase was found in 4 E. cloacae associated with CTX-M-1. Several epidemic clones were determined. Conjugation experiments showed that bla(CTX-M), bla(TEM), and bla(SHV) were carried by conjugative plasmids of high molecular weight (>/=125kb). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a high frequency of ESBL KES with a predominance of CTX-M-1. This high rate of ESBLs could be due to a clonal spread and the emergence of new epidemic clones.
TI  - Group IIC intron with an unusual target of integration in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - A potential role of group IIC-attC introns in integron gene cassette formation, that is, the way in which they could provide the attC sequence essential for recombination, has been proposed. Group IIC introns usually target the attC site of gene cassettes and more specifically their inverse core. Here we characterized a novel group IIC intron targeting the core site of the aadA1 gene cassette attC site (aadA1-qacEDelta1 gene cassette junction) from enterobacterial isolates. Intron mobility (retrohoming) was analyzed using a two-plasmid assay performed in Escherichia coli. Intron mobility assays confirmed the mobilization-integration of the group II intron into the core site of the aadA2, bla(VIM-2), bla(CARB-2), aac(6')-Ib, dfrXVb, arr2, cmlA4, and aadB gene cassettes but not into the attI site. This mobility was dependent on maturase activity. Reverse transcriptase PCR showed that this intron was transcriptionally active, and an intermediate circular form was detected by inverse PCR. This element was linked to the bla(VEB-1) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene in a high number of enterobacterial isolates. A phylogenetic tree showed that the identified element was located in a branch separate from group IIC-attC introns, being an IIC intron possessing the ability to integrate using the core site of the attC sites as target.
TI  - Prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance and its association with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC beta-lactamase in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance and its association with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC beta-lactamase in Enterobacteriaceae. METHODS: A total of 347 non-duplicated isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were collected between August and October 2006 from 2 hospitals. Qnr determinant screening was conducted using PCR amplification, and all positive results were confirmed by direct sequencing. Qnr-positive strains were determined on the basis of the presence of ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamase genes. RESULTS: The qnr gene was detected in 47 of 347 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Among the 47 qnr-positive strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae (N=29) was the most common, followed by Escherichia coli (N=6), Enterobacter cloacae (N=6), Citrobacter freundii (N=5), and Enterobacter aerogenes (N=1). These isolates were identified as qnrA1 (N=6), 8 qnrB subtypes (N=40), and qnrS1 (N=1). At least 1 ESBL was detected in 38 of the 47 qnr-positive strains. Qnr-positive strains also showed high positive rates of ESBL or AmpC beta-lactamase, such as TEM, SHV, CTX-M, and DHA. DHA-1 was detected in 23 of 47 qnr-positive strains, and this was co-produced with 1 qnrA1 and 22 qnrB4. Strains harboring MIR-1T and CMY were also detected among the qnr-positive strains. Antimicrobial-resistance rates of qnr-positive strains to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, and moxifloxacin were 51.1%, 46.8%, 46.8%, 74.5%, and 53.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The qnr genes were highly prevalent in Enterobacteriaceae, primarily the qnrB subtypes. They were closely associated with EBSL and AmpC beta-lactamase.
TI  - Bacterial inactivation using silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles as functional antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The ability for silver nanoparticles to function as an antibacterial agent while  being separable from the target fluids is important for bacterial inactivation in biological fluids. This report describes the analysis of the antimicrobial activities of silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles synthesized by wet chemical methods. The bacterial inactivation of several types of bacteria was analyzed, including Gram-positive bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus ) and Gram-negative bacteria ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Enterobacter cloacae , and Escherichia coli ). The results have demonstrated the viability of the silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles for achieving effective bacterial inactivation efficiency comparable to and better than that of silver nanoparticles conventionally used. The bacteria inactivation efficiency of our silver-coated MnZn ferrite (MZF@Ag) nanoparticles was also determined for blood platelets samples, demonstrating the potential of utilization in inactivating bacterial growth in platelets prior to transfusion to ensure blood product safety, which also has important implications for enabling the capability of effective separation, delivery, and targeting of the antibacterial agents.
TI  - Urinary tract infections in the early posttransplant period after liver transplantation: etiologic agents and their susceptibility.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We performed an analysis of etiologic agents for urinary tract infections in the early posttransplant period after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in adult recipients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study covered the first 4 weeks after OLT of 190 patients from September 2001 to the end of 2007. Immunosuppression consisted of steroids and tacrolimus. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was piperacillin/tazobactam, fluconazole, and SBD. Urine samples were cultured to identify microorganisms in accord with standard microbiological procedures and to test susceptibility using Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: Urine specimens (n=539) examined from 185 recipients (97.4%) showed 210 microbial strains. The most common were Gram-negative (n=131; 62.4%) with predominance of Escherichia coli (28.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (19.1%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (11.4%). Extended-spectrum beta- lactamases (ESBL(+)) strains were isolated in 38.5% of cases. Gram-positive bacteria comprised 28.6% (n=60): The most common strains were enterococci (85% including HLAR 80.4% and VRE 17.6%] and staphylococci 11.8% [MRSA/MRCNS; 100%]. There were 19 (9%) fungal strains. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the identification in urine samples of multi-drug-resistant bacterial and fungal strains in patients after OLT such as ESBL(+) 38.5%; HLAR 80.4%; VRE 17.6%; and MRSA/MRCNS 100% requires better infection control.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of meropenem and biapenem in bile and dosing considerations for biliary tract infections based on site-specific pharmacodynamic target attainment.
AB  - The present study investigated the pharmacokinetics of meropenem and biapenem in  bile and estimated their pharmacodynamic target attainment at the site. Meropenem (0.5 g) or biapenem (0.3 g) was administered to surgery patients (n = 8 for each drug). Venous blood samples and hepatobiliary tract bile samples were obtained at the end of infusion (0.5 h) and for up to 5 h thereafter. Drug concentrations in plasma and bile were analyzed pharmacokinetically and used for a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the probability of attaining the pharmacodynamic target (40% of the time above the MIC). Both drugs penetrated similarly into bile, with mean bile/plasma ratios of 0.24 to 0.25 (maximum drug concentration) and 0.30 to 0.38 (area under the drug concentration-time curve). The usual regimens of meropenem (0.5 g every 8 h [q8h]) and biapenem (0.3 g q8h) (0.5-h infusions) achieved similar target attainment probabilities in bile (>/= 90%) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae isolates. However, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, meropenem at 1 g q8h and biapenem at 0.6 g q8h were required for values of 80.7% and 71.9%, respectively. The biliary pharmacodynamic-based breakpoint (the highest MIC at which the target attainment probability in bile was >/= 90%) was 1 mg/liter for 0.5 g q8h and 2 mg/liter for 1 g q8h for meropenem and 0.5 mg/liter for 0.3 g q8h and 1 mg/liter for 0.6 g q8h for biapenem. These results help to define the clinical pharmacokinetics of the two carbapenems in bile while also helping to rationalize and optimize the dosing regimens for biliary tract infections based on site-specific pharmacodynamic target attainment.
TI  - Biocatalytic production of (2S,3S)-2,3-butanediol from diacetyl using whole cells of engineered Escherichia coli.
AB  - (2S,3S)-2,3-Butanediol ((2S,3S)-2,3-BD) is a crucial chiral compound that acts as an excellent building block in asymmetric synthesis of highly valuable chiral compounds. However, the low concentration and optical purity of (2S,3S)-2,3-BD produced in previous studies limited its applications. In the present work, the gene encoding 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase from an Enterobacter cloacae ssp. dissolvens strain SDM was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Whole cells of the recombinant E. coli was used to produce (2S,3S)-2,3-BD from diacetyl. Under optimal conditions, high-optical-purity (2S,3S)-2,3-BD (purity >99%) was obtained with concentrations of 16.1 g l(-1) and 26.8 g l(-1) in batch and fed-batch conversions, respectively. Thus, the process might be a promising alternative for the production of (2S,3S)-2,3-BD.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Seseli globiferum essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil from aerial parts of Seseli globiferum Vis. obtained by hydrodistillation with Clevenger-type apparatus was analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty-eight compounds were identified, representing 99.4% of the total oil. The main components of the oil were sabinene (38.0%), alpha-pinene (21.2%) and beta-phellandrene (13.5%). The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oil were determined using the broth microdilution method against seven bacterial species: Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 13311), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Enterobacter cloacae (clinical isolates), Bacillus cereus (clinical isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Micrococcus flavus (ATCC 10240) and three fungal species: Aspergillus niger (ATCC 6275), Aspergillus versicolor (ATCC 11730), Trichoderma viride (IAM 5061) and Penicillium funiculosum (ATCC 36839). The essential oil showed activity against bacteria P. aeruginosa, followed by M flavus, L. monocytigenes and E. coli, and all investigated fungal species.
TI  - Bile culture and susceptibility testing of malignant biliary obstruction via PTBD.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the information obtained by bile culture and susceptibility testing for malignant biliary obstruction by a retrospective one-center study. METHODS: A total of 694 patients with malignant biliary obstruction received percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage during the period July 2003 to September 2010, and subsequently, bile specimens were collected during the procedure. Among the 694 patients, 485 were men and 209 were women, ranging in age from 38 to 78 years (mean age 62 years). RESULTS: A total of 42.9% patients had a positive bile culture (298 of 694). Further, 57 species of microorganisms and 342 strains were identified; gram-positive bacteria accounted for 50.9% (174 of 342) and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 41.5% (142 of 342) of these strains. No anaerobes were obtained by culture during this study. The most common microorganisms were Enterococcus faecalis (41 of 342, 11.9%), Escherichia coli (34 of 342, 9.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (28 of 342, 8.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (19 of 342, 5.5%), Enterococcus (18 of 342, 5.3%), and Enterobacter cloacae (16 of 342, 4.7%). The percentage of beta-lactamase-producing gram-positive bacteria was 27.6% (48 of 174), and the percentage of gram-negative bacteria was 19.7% (28 of 142). The percentage of enzyme-producing Escherichia coli was 61.7% (21 of 34). CONCLUSION: The bile cultures in malignant biliary obstruction are different from those in the Tokyo Guidelines and other benign biliary obstruction researches, which indicates that a different antibacterial therapy should be applied. Thus, knowledge of the antimicrobial susceptibility data could aid in the better use of antibiotics for the empirical therapy of biliary infection combined with malignant biliary obstruction.
TI  - Effectiveness of antibiotic-lock therapy for long-term catheter-related bacteremia due to Gram-negative bacilli: a prospective observational study.
AB  - A prospective observational study evaluated the effectiveness of combining antibiotic-lock therapy and systemic antibiotics for Gram-negative bacilli long-term catheter-related bacteremia. In 46 uncomplicated episodes, the most frequently isolated microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15), Enterobacter cloacae (12), Escherichia coli (10), and Klebsiella spp. (8). Cure was achieved in 95% of cases.
TI  - Preparation and antibacterial evaluation of decarboxylated fluoroquinolones.
AB  - Decarboxylated ciprofloxacin (3) has been reported in the literature to have antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and especially potent activity against Escherichia coli. Herein, we report our syntheses of 3 and five additional decarboxylated fluoroquinolones (FQs). We have re-evaluated the antibacterial activity of these FQs. In contrast to previously reported data, none of these decarboxylated fluoroquinolones showed significant antibacterial activity in our assays using both the broth dilution and agar methods. Our study confirmed that the presence of a carboxylic acid group at the 3-position of the fluoroquinolone scaffold is essential for antibacterial activity.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2009 and March 2010].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2009 to March 2010 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 671 strains including 16 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 174 (79.1%) of 220 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and eleven strains were isolated from primary infections, and 244 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Streptococcus constellatus and Finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by B. ovatus, B. wadsworthia and B. thetaiotaomicron, in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Heracleum thomsonii (Clarke) from the cold desert of the western Himalayas.
AB  - Volatile oil composition of hydro-distilled (HD) and supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO(2)) essential oil of freshly collected aerial parts of Heracleum thomsonii (Umbeliferae) from the western Himalayas was studied by GC-FID and GC-MS. Results revealed qualitative and quantitative dissimilarity in the composition of hydro-distilled and SC-CO(2) extracted oils. Nineteen constituents, which accounted for 89.32% of total constituents in HD oil, represented by limonene (4.31%), (Z)-beta-ocimene (3.69%), terpinolene (22.24%), neryl acetate (36.19%), nerol (9.51%) and p-cymene-8-ol (2.61%) were identified. In SC-CO(2) extracted oil, 24 constituents representing 89.95% of total constituents were identified. Terpinolene (5.08%), germacrene D (2.17%), neryl acetate (51.62%), nerol (9.78%), geranyl acetate (2.06%), alpha-bisabolol (2.48%) and 1-nonadecanol (4.96%) were the dominating constituents. In vitro antimicrobial activity of hydro-distilled oil was conducted against microrobial strains including two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and five Gram-negative (Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebseilla pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria as well as seven fungi (Candida albicans, Issatchenkia orientalis, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus sydowii and Trichophyton rubrum) using broth microdilution method. The results of bioassay showed that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity against fungi C. albicans (MIC 625 microg ml(-1)), A. parasiticus (MIC 312.5 microg ml(-1)), A. sydowii (MIC 312.5 microg ml(-1)), T. rubrum (MIC 625 microg ml(-1)), Gram-positive bacteria B. subtilis (MIC 625 microg ml(-1)) and Gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa (MIC 312.5 microg ml(-1)).
TI  - Dissemination of the rmtB gene carried on IncF and IncN plasmids among Enterobacteriaceae in a pig farm and its environment.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and characterization of 16S rRNA methylase-producing bacteria in a pig farm and its environment in East China. METHODS: Enterobacteriaceae isolates and metagenomic DNA from 102 pig faecal samples from a pig farm and 97 soil samples taken in or around the farm were screened for the presence of 16S rRNA methylase genes. The clonal relationships of 16S rRNA methylase-positive isolates, plasmid content and other associated resistance genes were also characterized. RESULTS: Fifty-six rmtB-positive Enterobacteriaceae isolates, including 54 Escherichia coli, 1 Morganella morganii and 1 Proteus mirabilis, were recovered from 55 pig faecal samples. Nineteen rmtB-positive bacteria, including 13 E. coli, 2 M. morganii, 2 Leclercia adecarboxylata, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes and 1 Enterobacter cloacae, were recovered from 16 soil samples. Among the 75 rmtB-positive isolates, 31 and 25 also carried the qepA and bla(CTX-M) genes, respectively. The qepA gene co-localized with rmtB on the F2:A-:B1 plasmids and the bla(CTX-M-65) gene co-localized with rmtB on the F33:A-:B- plasmids. The rmtB gene was also found to be associated with the IncN plasmids. Clonal transmission of rmtB-positive E. coli isolates was observed between different pig groups and soil samples. CONCLUSIONS: Both horizontal gene transfer and clonal spread could be responsible for the dissemination of the rmtB gene in the pig farm and its environment. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of rmtB-positive bacteria from farmland soils and indicates that these antibiotic-resistant bacteria and/or resistance genes could be acquired by humans through the food chain.
TI  - Genotypic characterization and in vitro activities of tigecycline and polymyxin B for members of the Enterobacteriaceae with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems.
AB  - Carbapenem resistance in members of the Enterobacteriaceae is increasing. To evaluate the effects of tigecycline and polymyxin B against carbapenem-non-susceptible pathogens, 89 representative clinical carbapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates were recovered from seven hospitals from four cities in China during 2006-2009: 30 Serratia marcescens, 35 Klebsiella pneumoniae, seven Enterobacter cloacae, six Enterobacter aerogenes, five Escherichia coli, four Citrobacter freundii and two Klebsiella oxytoca isolates. Twenty-eight S. marcescens isolates were indistinguishable. The 35 K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to 12 clonal strains. Among the 89 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 82 produced KPC-2, seven produced IMP (three produced KPC-2 simultaneously), three did not produce any carbapenemases and nine were deficient in porins. Polymyxin B was much more active than tigecycline against carbapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, polymyxin B and tigecycline were 8 and 32 microg ml(-1), 8 and 32 microg ml(-1), 16 and 128 microg ml(-1), 0.5 and 16 microg ml(-1), and 4 and 16 microg ml(-1), respectively. Rates of susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem and polymyxin B were 30.0%, 27.5%, 2.5% and 89.2% by CLSI criteria. The rate of susceptibility to tigecycline was 40% and 17.5% by Food and Drug Administration (MIC </=2 microg ml(-1)) and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MIC </=1 microg ml(-1)) criteria, respectively. KPC-2- or IMP-producing E. coli transconjugants exhibited reduced susceptibility to carbapenems but were susceptible to polymyxin B and tigecycline with an MIC range of 0.5-2 microg ml(-1), 0.25-2 microg ml(-1), 0.5-4 microg ml(-1), 0.5 microg ml(-1) and 0.5-1 microg ml(-1). In conclusion, carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is mainly due to production of KPC-2, and polymyxin B is active for the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates in Mexico.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes in a collection of 226 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates and characterize the qnr-positive isolates. The rate of qnr-positive isolates was 21.6% (49/226), 49.5% for aac(6')-Ib-cr (112/226), and 1.7% for qepA1 (4/226). Those isolates carried qnr genes corresponding to types qnrB (71.4%), qnrS1 (24.4%), and qnrA1 (18.3%). The distribution among bacterial species was as follows: 55.8% (19/34) to Enterobacter cloacae, 50% (28/56) to Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1.4% (2/136) to Escherichia coli. The characterization of qnr-positive isolates indicated the ESBL SHV-types as the most prevalent (81.6%), including the ESBLs SHV-12, SHV-5, and SHV-2a, followed by CTX-M-15 (44.9%) and TLA-1 (8.1%). In addition, for qnr-positive isolates, the prevalence of aac(6')-Ib-cr was 55.1%, but qepA was not identified. Alterations at codons Ser-83 and Asp-87 in GyrA and at codons Ser-80 in ParC were observed in 69% and 80% of the qnr-positive isolates, respectively. The analysis of the transconjugants revealed a cotransmission of bla(CTX-M-15) with qepA1 or aac(6')-Ib-cr and/or qnrA1 and bla(SHV-type) with qnrB5 and qnrB6 genes. To conclude, these findings indicate a high prevalence of qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr among ESBL-producing isolates from Mexican hospitals and point to the wide spread of qnr-like determinants associated to ESBLs SHV- and CTX-M-type in Mexican clinical isolates.
TI  - Rectal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli in community settings in Madagascar.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum ss-lactamase-producing Enterobacteria (ESBL-PE) emerged at the end of the 1980s, causing nosocomial outbreaks and/or hyperendemic situations in hospitals and long-term care facilities. In recent years, community-acquired infections due to ESBL-PE have spread worldwide, especially across developing countries including Madagascar. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal carriage of ESBL-PE in the community of Antananarivo. METHODS: Non-hospitalized patients were recruited in three health centers in different socio economic settings. Fresh stool collected were immediately plated on Drigalski agar containing 3 mg/liter of ceftriaxone. Gram-negative bacilli species were identified and ESBL production was tested by a double disk diffusion (cefotaxime and ceftazidime +/- clavulanate) assay. Characterization of ESBLs were perfomed by PCR and direct sequencing. Molecular epidemiology was analysed by Rep-PCR and ERIC-PCR. RESULTS: 484 patients were screened (sex ratio = 1.03, median age 28 years). 53 ESBL-PE were isolated from 49 patients (carrier rate 10.1%). The isolates included Escherichia coli (31), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14), Enterobacter cloacae (3), Citrobacter freundii (3), Kluyvera spp. (1) and Pantoae sp. (1). In multivariate analysis, only the socioeconomic status of the head of household was independently associated with ESBL-PE carriage, poverty being the predominant risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of carriage of ESBL in the community of Antananarivo is one of the highest reported worldwide. This alarming spread of resistance genes should be stopped urgently by improving hygiene and streamlining the distribution and consumption of antibiotics.
TI  - EmmdR, a new member of the MATE family of multidrug transporters, extrudes quinolones from Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - We cloned a gene, ECL_03329, from the chromosome of Enterobacter cloacae ATCC13047, using a drug-hypersensitive Escherichia coli KAM32 cell as the host. We show here that this gene, designated as emmdR, is responsible for multidrug resistance in E. cloacae. E. coli KAM32 host cells containing the cloned emmdR gene (KAM32/pEMMDR28) showed decreased susceptibilities to benzalkonium chloride, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ethidium bromide, acriflavine, rhodamine6G, and trimethoprim. emmdR-deficient E. cloacae cells (EcDeltaemmdR) showed increased susceptibilities to several of the antimicrobial agents tested. EmmdR has twelve predicted transmembrane segments and some shared identity with members of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family of transporters. Study of the antimicrobial agent efflux activities revealed that EmmdR is an H+-drug antiporter but not a Na+ driven efflux pump. These results indicate that EmmdR is responsible for multidrug resistance and pumps out quinolones from E. cloacae.
TI  - Molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the Philippines.
AB  - beta-Lactamases, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and AmpC beta-lactamases, are major resistance mechanisms of Enterobacteriaceae. Emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants in ESBL-producing isolates poses a global threat. The molecular characterisitcs of ESBL and PMQR determinants in the Philippines are not well characterized. In this study, we investigated ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the Philippines, and analyzed the association between ESBL and PMQR genes. A total of 91 amoxicilin non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae were collected at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine of the Philippines from 2006 to 2008. AmpC- or ESBL-producing isolates were screened by detecting a zone diameter for cefoxitin </= 14 mm or cefpodoxime </= 20 mm, respectively. Possible ESBL-producing strains were assessed by the ESBL confirmation test of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. PCR and sequencing were performed to detect the ESBL and PMQR genes. The number of ESBL-producers and AmpC-producers confirmed phenotypically was 17 (18.7%) and 61 (67.0%), respectively. Of 17 phenotypic ESBL-producers, 14 isolates had ESBL genes, including 6 of Escherichia coli, 3 of Enterobacter cloacae, 2 of Enterobacter aerogenes, 2 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 of Klebsiella ozaenae. Among these isolates, there were 13, 4, and 12 with bla(CTX-M), bla(SHV), and bla(TEM), respectively. Of the bla(CTX-M)-positive isolates, bla(CTX-M-15) shows the highest prevalence, followed by bla(CTX-M-3) and bla(CTX-M-14). Of 14 ESBL-producers identified by PCR, 4, 6, and 7 isolates were positive for qnrB, qnrS, and aac(6')-Ib-cr, respectively. The frequency of aac(6')-Ib-cr positivity was significantly higher among CTX-M-15-producing isolates. Thus, we identified bla(CTX-M), aac(6')-Ib-cr, and qnr in ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae from the Philippines, and revealed a significant association between bla(CTX-M-15) and aac(6')-Ib-cr. Local epidemiological data are important for implementing appropriate antimicrobial therapy and effective infection control measures. Continuous monitoring of antimicrobial resistance genes in the Philippines will be required.
TI  - Development of a simple method for biotoxicity measurement using ultramicroelectrode array under non-deaerated condition.
AB  - In this paper, a mediated method by using ferricyanide under non-deaerated condition for biotoxicity measurement was proposed. Ultramicroelectrode array (UMEA) was employed for effectively amplify the electrochemical signal from the total limiting currents to distinguish a little change in toxicity. Five species of microorganisms including two bacilli (Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae), two pseudomonas (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseucomonas putida) and one fungus (Trichosporon cutaneum) were employed. 3,5-dichlorophenol (DCP) was taken as the reference toxicant. The IC50 values we obtained were similar with the values obtained using in the deaerated method. E. coli was used as model test microorganism. The final concentration of ferricyanide is 45 mM, E. coli OD600 8 and 1 h incubation were taken in optimum conditions in this study. Four heavy metal ions (Cr(6+), Hg(2+), Cd(2+) and Bi(3+)) were examined under the optimum conditions. Comparison with the results reported previously has confirmed that this method provided a simple and rapid alternative to toxicity screening of chemicals, especially advantageous for in situ monitoring of water system.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory amino acid derivatives from the ascidian Herdmania momus.
AB  - Four new amino acid derivatives, herdmanines A-D (1-4), were isolated from the marine ascidian Herdmania momus. Herdmanines A-C contain the unusual D-form of arginine. Compounds 3 and 4 had a moderate suppressive effect on the production of NO, with IC(5)(0) values of 96 and 9 muM, respectively. These compounds were found to inhibit the mRNA expression of iNOS. The inhibitory activities on the production and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were evaluated.
TI  - Laboratory evaluation of the CHROMagar KPC medium for identification of carbapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - CHROMagar KPC was evaluated with 53 carbapenem-nonsusceptible strains. KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae grew efficiently and yielded metallic blue colonies (100% sensitivity). Poor or no growth or atypical colony color were evident with KPC-producing Escherichia coli (71.4% sensitivity) and ertapenem-resistant KPC-nonproducing K. pneumoniae (72.7% sensitivity). CHROMagar KPC appears applicable for processing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae surveillance specimens, but its performance might possibly be suboptimal in the presence of KPC-negative ertapenem-resistant strains or for detection of KPC-producing E. coli.
TI  - Metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates at a Taiwanese hospital: lack of distinctive phenotypes for screening.
AB  - We investigated the prevalence of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) among 1,827 Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected in 2006 and evaluated the VITEK 2 microbiology system, modified Hodge test, and 2 combined disk tests as the screening tools for MBLs by using these isolates and 77 previously characterized IMP-8 producers. The IMP-8 MBL was identified in 18 isolates of 2006, and the IMP-8-positive isolates represented 0.2%, 1.1%, and 5.0% of all Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively. Only one-third of all MBL producers could be recognized by either VITEK 2 or the Hodge test. MBL production could be identified in 38 (40%) of the 95 IMP-8-producing isolates by the combined disk test using meropenem disks supplemented by phenylboronic acid and EDTA, and only 2 (2.1%) isolates gave positive results in the combined disk test using meropenem disks supplemented with dipicolinic acid. Of all IMP-8 producers, 37.9%, 50.5%, and 32.6% were nonsusceptible to tigecycline, fluoroquinolones, and both, respectively. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the lack of distinct phenotypes that could be easily identified among the IMP-8-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates at a Taiwanese hospital. Continuous surveillance and monitoring are needed because the widespread of tigecycline- and fluoroquinolone-coresistant MBL producers may become a serious therapeutic problem.
TI  - Colonization of the gut with Gram-negative bacilli, its association with neonatal sepsis and its clinical relevance in a developing country.
AB  - This study examined the pattern of colonization of the neonatal gut by aerobic Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and evaluated the association between gut colonization and sepsis in the developing world. This deserves attention because of the high incidence of sepsis and the differences in hygienic environments in developing countries compared with the developed world. The study was carried out on neonates in a tertiary-care government hospital. Serial gut samples were analysed (gastric aspirates and stool samples) for GNB. Blood samples of cases showing clinical signs of sepsis were also analysed for septic screening and culture positivity. Antibiograms, serotyping and PFGE were carried out to evaluate the relatedness of the gut and blood isolates. A diverse array of GNB was isolated from the gut of the neonates, Klebsiella pneumoniae being most common, followed by Escherichia coli. The rate of isolation of GNB was consistently higher in stool samples compared with gastric aspirate samples. Colonization was influenced by a stay in the neonatal intensive care unit and by the prolonged use of a feeding tube. GNB were the cause of sepsis in the majority of cases, with K. pneumoniae being the most frequently isolated GNB from the blood. Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Burkholderia cepacia were the other GNB recovered from the blood of the neonates. Neonates with GNB in the gut had a higher incidence of clinical sepsis than those without. In 50 % of cases, the genotypes of the organisms found in the blood were indistinguishable from their gut counterpart. These results show that the neonatal gut is colonized with a diverse array of GNB, and an association between gut colonization and neonatal sepsis was observed.
TI  - Antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. Intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. However, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. The benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. This study was performed to evaluate the interaction between Lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. RESULTS: Strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in McConkey Agar and identified using PCR with species-specific primers, and the BBL Enterotube II system for Enterobacteriaceae. Gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. The average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) CFU/g of faeces (p = 0.015). The following strains were identified: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterococcus faecalis. Then, 27 Lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii DSM 20074 and L. plantarum MB 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that two out of 27 strains of Lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. Our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which Lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance of Gram negative bacilli isolated from tertiary-care hospitals in Colombia].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial resistance has been identified as one of the major public health problems worldwide. To facilitate its control, bacterial resistance levels must be monitored permanently by effective surveillance systems. OBJECTIVE: To describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns of Gram negative bacilli in Colombian hospitals over a 3-year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive study used the bacterial susceptibility profiles provided by 14 tertiary-care hospitals belonging to the Colombian Nosocomial Resistance Study Group. The hospitals were located in 7 major cities in Colombia, and provided records over the period January 2006 to December 2008. Using WHONET 5.4, the antimicrobial resistance patterns were described for the Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) and non-fermenters (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii). Comparisons were made in the bacterial responses to selected antibiotics in samples from general wards and from adult intensive care units. RESULTS: The antimicrobial resistance frequencies of several Enterobacteriaceae species showed a decreasing trend. In contrast, P. aeruginosa was demonstrated to be a multidrug-resistance organism with increasing resistance frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: These data emphasize the importance of surveillance programs in detecting presence of multidrug-resistant organisms. This information will aid the implementation of protocols aimed to strengthen the infection control strategies and antibiotic stewardship in each hospital.
TI  - Mucosal surveillance cultures in predicting Gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  - This study aimed to examine the spectrum and time course of gut and nasopharyngeal colonization with Gram-negative micro-organisms, and to define the value of surveillance cultures in predicting late-onset sepsis in neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units. Nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected on admission and twice weekly thereafter in 278 neonates admitted within the first 72 h of life with risk factors of early-onset sepsis. Sterile body fluid cultures were obtained on admission and subsequently as clinically indicated. Approximately half of the rectal (693/1250, 55%) and nasopharyngeal (558/1153, 48%) samples but only 6% (32/555) of the sterile fluid samples in 26 patients were culture positive for Gram-negative organisms. In total, 2108 invasive and mucosal culture pairs were analysed. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of a mucosal sample to predict late-onset sepsis were 27%, 66%, 4% and 94%, respectively. Patients with pre-existing colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae (P = 0.011), Klebsiella oxytoca (P = 0.002), Escherichia coli (P = 0.003), Stenotrophomonas spp. (P = 0.003) and Pseudomonas spp. (P </= 0.001) were more likely to develop late-onset sepsis. No such association was found for Acinetobacter baumannii, Serratia spp. or Enterobacter cloacae. In conclusion, routine mucosal cultures are inefficient for the prediction of Gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care units. However, targeted screening for specific organisms in an outbreak (e.g. Klebsiella spp., E. coli, Stenotrophomonas spp. and Pseudomonas spp.) may offer an opportunity to improve infection control measures and enable timely initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Multiresistance, beta-lactamase-encoding genes and bacterial diversity in hospital wastewater in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the bacterial diversity, antimicrobial resistance patterns and types of beta-lactamase genes in Gram-negative bacteria isolated from a hospital sewage treatment plant. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between July and December 2008, we collected samples from influent, clarifier tank effluent and chlorine contact tank effluent from a sewage treatment plant service of a hospital located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Of the 221 isolates identified, 40% were characterized as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. Nonpathogenic micro-organisms and some pathogenic genera were quantified. The most common ESBL-producing isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli. The bla(TEM), bla(SHV) and bla(CTX-M) genes were detected in 82, 48 and 67% of bacterial isolates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that hospital wastewater treatment plant is not suitable systems for the removal of all antibiotic-resistant micro-organisms present in hospital wastewaters. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides evidence that bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics and their resistance genes that are usually present in the hospital can reach the environment, even after the use of hospital wastewater treatment plants.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  - We studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. Species studied included 3 common species of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. MICs and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria for urinary tract isolates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria for Enterobacteriaceae. Tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by CLSI or EUCAST. Escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. A. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of MIC breakpoint. New tentative zone diameter criteria for K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, S. aureus, and E. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by CLSI and EUCAST.
TI  - [Comparative studies on the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria between children with community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This research was to explore the difference between children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: 241 CAP and 116 HAP with positive sputum culture who were hospitalized from January to December in 2008 in Children's Hospital Affiliated to Suzhou University were selected in this study. The bacteria were identified by traditionally manual method and antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed by K-B method. The chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used for statistical test. RESULTS: In 241 CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza accounted for (42.2%, 106/251) and (12.4%, 31/251) infection, respectively; however in 116 HAP, Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters accounted for (88.2%, 127/144). In addition, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus weren't isolated, however, its detection rate was 66.7% in HAP. The drug resistance was 1.5 times higher in HAP than that in CAP for several types of antibiotics, such as ceftazidime (37.5% (6/16) vs 75.6% (31/41)), cefepime (37.5% (6/16) vs 78.0% (32/41)), aztreonam (50.0% (8/16) vs 90.2% (37/41)), cefoperazone/sulbactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 51.2% (21/41)) and piperacillin/tazobactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 56.0% (23/41)). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from HAP had higher drug resistance than that isolated from CAP against some antibiotics, for example, gentamicin (0 vs 63.6% (7/11)), SMZ + TMP (20.0% (1/5) vs 63.6% (7/11)) and cefoperazone/sulbactam (0 vs 54.5% (6/11)). We also found Enterobacter cloacae isolated from HAP showed high drug resistance than that isolated from CAP against imipenem (0 vs 46.7% (7/15)), aztreonam (9.1% (1/11) vs 60.0% (9/15)) and cefoperazone (18.2% (2/11) vs 80.0% (12/15)) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from HAP had higher resistance than that from CAP against gentamicin (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)), amikacin (0 vs 38.9% (7/18)), ceftazidime (0 vs 55.6% (10/18)), cefepime (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)) and cefoperazone (33.3% (2/6) vs 94.4% (17/18)). The detection rates of ESBLs for Escherichia coli were 84.6% (11/13) and 93.3% (14/15) in CAP and HAP, respectively (chi(2) = 0.553, P > 0.05); while for Klebsiella pneumoniae, they were 81.3% (13/16) and 95.1% (39/41), respectively (chi(2) = 2.767, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: CAP was mainly comprised of Streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza; while HAP was mainly comprised of Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters. The drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli was higher in HAP than that in CAP.
TI  - Evaluation of handwashing behaviors and analysis of hand flora of intensive care  unit nurses.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the handwashing behaviors of intensive care nurses based on personal statements, and to identify the microorganisms represented in the hand flora preshift and postshift. METHODS: This prospective study was performed with 60 intensive care nurses between January and December 2008, at a training and research hospital at a university in Turkey. Samples were taken from the hands of the nurses for bacteriological culture, using the bag-broth method, at the beginning and end of the shift. The samples were cultured aerobically and the colonies that grew were counted and identified. The nurses completed a self-report questionnaire, and their answers were evaluated. RESULTS: The frequency of handwashing by participants during each shift was 32.8+/-13.9. Overall, 65% of the nurses preferred alcohol-based antiseptic solutions for handwashing, 95% used paper towels to dry their hands, and 98.3-100% of the nurses washed their hands after performing care procedures. The Escherichia coli and coagulase negative Staphylococcus species were found to be at significantly higher levels in the postshift hand culture samples when compared to the preshift hand culture sample values. Enterobacter cloacae was the only species found in the postshift hand culture samples of the nurses. CONCLUSIONS: The number of colonies of the microorganisms in the hand flora of the nurses increased postshift. The handwashing behavior of intensive care nurses must be improved as they nurse critical patients.
TI  - Comparative activity of tigecycline and tetracycline on Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria revealed by a multicentre study in four North European countries.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study involves a multicentre surveillance of tigecycline and tetracycline activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria from primary care centres (PCCs), general hospital wards (GHWs) and intensive care units (ICUs) in Denmark (n = 9), Finland (n = 10), Norway (n = 7) and Sweden (n = 19). METHODS: The hospitals were each asked to test 30 consecutive Gram-positive and 30 Gram-negative clinical isolates. Supportive information accompanying each isolate included the study centre, ward level (PCC, GHW, or ICU), patient identification and source of the isolate. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for tetracycline and tigecycline were determined with the Etest. RESULTS: The isolates collected comprised 1610 Gram-negative and 1767 Gram-positive clinical isolates. The study showed low rates of non-susceptibility (intermediate (I) and resistant (R)) to tigecycline: <1% in Escherichia coli, though other Enterobacteriaceae showed higher rates (Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%) and Serratia spp. (23%)). The overall non-susceptibility rate for tigecycline in Enterobacteriaceae with species-related breakpoints for tigecycline was 6% (4% excluding Serratia spp.). The activity of tigecycline against Haemophilus influenzae and Acinetobacter spp. was high with a MIC(50) of 0.25 mg/l and MIC(90) of 1 mg/l. The prevalence of non-susceptibility to tigecycline among Gram-positive bacteria was <1%. The corresponding figure for tetracycline was 14%. The activity of tigecycline against Streptococcus pneumoniae was high with MIC(50) and MIC(90) of 0.125 mg/l. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline showed good overall in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates, including both tetracycline-susceptible and resistant isolates. Most non-susceptibility to tigecycline among Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli was I (6%), rather than R (<1%). This indicates a problem setting interpretive species-related tigecycline breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli.
TI  - [Validity of using imipenem as a representative carbapenems and levofloxacin as a representative fluoroquinolones in antibiotics susceptibility test for enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - In antimicrobial susceptibility test for enterobacteriaceae, the efficacies of carpapenems are predicted by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of imipenem, and that of fluoroquinolones are predicted by the MIC of levofloxacin. To assess its judgement, we compared the MICs of imipenem, meropenem, panipenem, and doripenem for carbapenems, and ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tosufloxacin and pazufloxacin for fluoroquinolones of clinically isolated enterobacteria, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacterfreundii, those resistant to the third generation cephalosporin. MIC distributions in low concentration range are estranged in some strains, conspicuously S. marcescens, E. cloacae and C. freundii: meropenem and doripenem displayed low MIC value than imipenem and panipenem. Since the estrangements are appeared MIC value of less than 8 microg/ml, the interpretive results (susceptible, intermediate, resistant) are not affected. In fluoroquinolones, all 4 agents showed almost identical MIC distributions, thus the MIC of levofloxacin is accepted to use the reference for other fluoroquinolones. The existence of the strains harboring carbapenem-resistant gene displaying low MIC value of carbapenems was reported. For the sensitive detection of the candidate of carbapenem-resistant strains, cut-off value of each carbapenem should be reconsidered, and also other phonotype analysis should be applied. Genomic analysis also would be required to detect the carbapenem-resistant gene.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics of free ertapenem in critically ill septic patients: intermittent versus continuous infusion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper was to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters of continuous (CI) and intermittent infusion (ITI) of ertapenem into critically ill patients with severe abdominal infections. METHODS: Twenty septic patients hospitalized in a university hospital intensive care unit were enrolled in the study. Half of the patients received ertapenem as an ITI 1 g bolus once daily, and the other half of the patients received the same dose via CI over 24 h following a 1-g loading dose. Blood was drawn 1, 12 and 24 h after terminating ITI or on days 2, 3 and 5 after starting CI for each patient. After centrifugation, the drawn blood was frozen at -80 degrees C until being examined by high-performance liquid-chromatography analysis. RESULTS: Median serum-free ertapenem concentrations were as follows: fCmax = 98.9 mg/L and fCmin = 2.5 mg/L for ITI, and fCss=15.9 mg/L for CI. The ITI and CI median total clearance and volumes of distribution were 2.2 L/h vs. 2.5 L/h and 15.4 L vs. 21.0 L, respectively. The ertapenem MIC ranges were as follows: Escherichia coli (0.006 to 0.5 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (0.023 to 0.5 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.023 to 0.5 mg/L), Staphylococcus aureus (0.38 to 3 mg/L), Streptococcus viridians (0.38 to 3 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (0.38 to 3 mg/L). ITI and CI provided steady-state serum-free ertapenem concentrations constantly above the MIC for all bacteria. CONCLUSION: Ertapenem exhibited satisfactory PK/PD parameters and achieved serum-free concentrations 100% of the time, above even the high MIC of extracellular pathogens normally encountered during severe abdominal infections. CI administration resulted in equally effective PK/PD parameters as ITI in normal weight, good renal-function patients.
TI  - SugE, a new member of the SMR family of transporters, contributes to antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - We cloned a gene, sugE, from the chromosome of Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047. Analysis of the susceptibilities of the sugE-containing strain (Escherichia coli KAM32/pSUGE28) and sugE-deficient E. cloacae (EcDeltasugE) showed that SugE confers resistance to cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, cetylpyridinium chloride, tetraphenylphosphonium, benzalkonium chloride, ethidium bromide, and sodium dodecyl sulfate. We also investigated expression of sugE. We confirm here that SugE from E. cloacae is an SMR family transporter as determined by observing its energy-dependent drug efflux activity.
TI  - bla(KPC) RNA expression correlates with two transcriptional start sites but not always with gene copy number in four genera of Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing organisms are therapeutically and diagnostically challenging. It is possible that bla(KPC) gene expression plays a role in the variability observed in clinical susceptibility testing. bla(KPC) transformants together with 10 clinical isolates representing four genera were evaluated for bla(KPC) copy number and gene expression and correlated with beta-lactam MIC data. The data suggest that mechanisms other than gene copy number and expression of bla(KPC) contribute to variability in susceptibility when testing KPC-producing isolates.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae causing nosocomial  infections in Mexico. A retrospective and multicenter study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) production is still the most frequent mechanism of resistance to cephalosporins in gram-negative bacteria. The aim of the study was to identify the types of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates causing nosocomial infections in Mexico. METHODS: ESBL production was performed using a disk diffusion method. The MIC for several antibiotics was performed by agar dilution on Mueller-Hinton. PFGE typing was carried out on all enterobacteria assayed. The beta-lactamase pattern was obtained by IEF and bioassay. Genes of beta-lactamases were amplified by PCR with specific primers and products were sequenced and analyzed using informatics programs. Plasmid isolation and conjugation experiments were carried out using standard methodologies. RESULTS: There were 134 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae included from a retrospective and multicenter study that included eight Mexican hospitals from 1999 to 2005. The most prevalent species were K. pneumoniae (56%), Enterobacter cloacae (29%), and Escherichia coli (15%). Molecular analysis identified the underlying endemic and polyclonal spread of enterobacterials in each hospital. The most frequent ESBLs identified were SHV-type (84%), TLA-1 (11%), and CTX-M-15 (5%). Successful matings were detected in 68.4% (71/104) isolates. CONCLUSIONS: ESBL-producer K. pneumoniae remains the most frequent bacterial species obtained in nosocomial infections. The SHV-type and TLA-1 ESBLs were disseminated in most hospitals analyzed and CTX-M-15 was emerging in one of the studied hospitals. This work highlights the proper use of antibiotics to avoid the selection of these types of multiresistant bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing on burn wound isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the antimicrobial effectiveness of a silver alginate dressing  on opportunistic pathogens, namely meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Chryseobacterium indologenes, Proteus vulgaris and Acinetobacter baumannii. METHOD: In total, 40 microorganisms were isolated from patients attending three burn centres in the US and evaluated for their susceptibility to a silver alginate wound dressing, employing a corrected zone of inhibition assay, conducted on Mueller Hinton agar (MHA). RESULTS: The sizes of the corrected zones of inhibition varied between and within genera. For example, all Acinetobacter baumannii strains were found to be sensitive to ionic silver at pH 7, with a mean of 2.8mm, compared with 3.5mm at pH 5.5. The silver alginate dressing also demonstrated activity on all strains of Enterobacter and Escherichia coli, with susceptibility to the silver alginate dressing enhanced at pH 5.5. For Enterococcus spp. the average corrected zone of inhibition at pH 7 was 3.6mm, versus 4.9mm at pH 5.5. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing. The average corrected zone of inhibition was 6.9mm at pH 7, compared with 8mm at pH 5.5. For MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus, it ranged from 4.5mm to 7.5mm at pH 7. When the pH was decreased to 5.5, the corrected zone of inhibition increased. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the activity of a silver alginate dressing on a wide range of burn isolates, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolated from three different burn centres in the US. It also highlights the possible importance of pH and its potential effects on antimicrobial performance and microbial susceptibility. However, more extensive testing is required to substantiate this. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: SLP is employed by Advanced Medical Solutions Ltd.
TI  - A promising target for treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.
AB  
TI  - The inhibitory effect of Zingiber corallinum Hance essential oil on drug-resistant bacteria and evaluation of its acute toxicity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The excessive and irregular use of antibiotics could result in the generation and diffusion of drug-resistant bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of Zingiber corallinum Hance essential oil (ZCHO) on drug-resistant bacteria, especially on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. MATERIAL/METHODS: Susceptibility testing was used to evaluate the effect of ZCHO on growth inhibition of drug-resistant bacteria by paper disk method. Mice orally administered with ZCHO were used to observe acute toxicity and to determine median lethal dose (LD(5)(0)) of ZCHO. Broth dilution method was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of ZCHO on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. RESULTS: ZCHO exhibited an obvious inhibitory effect not only on gram-negative drug-resistant bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumannii, but also on gram-positive drug-resistant bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The ZCHO containing 79% terpinen-4-ol revealed better bacteriostatic effect than ZCHO with 34% terpinen-4-ol. The LD(5)(0) of ZCHO was 1790.427 mg/kg. The MIC and MBC of ZCHO on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii were 1457.81 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: ZCHO has obvious bacteriostasis and bactericidal effects, especially against drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Therefore, ZCHO is a promising natural bioactive component with antibacterial effect and satisfactory safety due to its low toxicity.
TI  - Comparative ceftaroline activity tested against pathogens associated with community-acquired pneumonia: results from an international surveillance study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To document the spectrum of activity of ceftaroline, the active form  of the prodrug, ceftaroline fosamil, a new cephalosporin with anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcal activity, against a surveillance collection of clinical isolates obtained from the USA and Europe during 2008-09. METHODS: A selected group of species associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP; 6496 of 17 326 monitored strains) were tested for susceptibility in a central laboratory using CLSI broth microdilution methods. Organisms were sampled from 55 medical centres, 27 in the USA and 28 (12 countries) in Europe. Ceftaroline and comparator agents were tested and interpretations of MIC endpoints made by applying current CLSI (2010) and EUCAST (2010) breakpoint criteria. RESULTS: Against 1340 Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline inhibited all isolates at </=0.5 mg/L (MIC(50/90), </=0.008/0.12 mg/L) and was 8-fold more active than ceftriaxone (MIC(90), 1 mg/L; only 79.2% coverage at EUCAST breakpoint). Haemophilus influenzae (n = 584; MIC(50/90), </=0.008/0.015 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 377; MIC(50/90), 0.03-0.06/0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 590; MIC(50/90), 0.5/1 mg/L) were very susceptible to ceftaroline, regardless of beta-lactamase production or multidrug resistance (MDR) patterns. The potency of ceftaroline against three species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) was similar to that of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam. Only modest differences in rates of ceftaroline susceptibility (breakpoint </=2 mg/L) were noted with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative Enterobacteriaceae strains between the USA and Europe (97.9% versus 97.0% for E. coli). Ceftaroline, like ceftriaxone, was not active against ceftazidime-resistant E. coli (10.2%-26.2% susceptible at </=2 mg/L) or K. pneumoniae (5.3%-11.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The ceftaroline surveillance for 2008-09 (USA and Europe) documented low MIC(50/90) values for S. aureus isolates at 0.5/1 and 0.25/1 mg/L, respectively. More importantly, ceftaroline MIC(90) results for S. pneumoniae (0.12 mg/L), H. influenzae (0.015 mg/L) and M. catarrhalis (0.12 mg/L) were very low, all MICs being </=0.5 mg/L. Ceftaroline exhibited promising high potency and wide coverage against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens known to cause CAP, especially isolates of MDR pneumococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - Comparative analysis of the bacterial flora of vegetables collected directly from farms and from supermarkets in Germany.
AB  - A total of 1,001 vegetables were collected from 13 farms and 11 supermarkets in Bavaria, Germany; 722 samples were positive for coliforms (mostly Enterobacter cloacae; n = 176). Escherichia coli were detected in 34, Pseudomonas spp. in 439, Salmonella spp. in 1, Enterococcus spp. in 682, and Listeria spp. in 11 samples. Prevalence of all investigated genera tended to be lower in samples collected at the supermarket. However, prevalence of Pseudomonas fluorescens was higher in supermarket samples. Cereals/bulbous vegetables were less contaminated than root vegetables/salads. Fruit vegetables seem to be often subsequently contaminated in the retail market. Compared to foods of animal origin, prevalence of pathogenic bacteria is low. Particularly, in 1,001 investigated vegetables, only four L. monocytogenes and one Salmonella enterica have been found. Almost all of the detected microorganisms are reported to be opportunistic pathogens, if only in rare cases. Therefore, fresh produce should be washed or peeled before it is eaten raw.
TI  - Bile bacterial flora and its in vitro resistance pattern in patients with acute cholangitis resulting from choledocholithiasis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cholangitis and biliary sepsis are severe infectious diseases, which are often observed in patients with choledocholithiasis. The antimicrobial therapy is effective if started as soon as the diagnosis is made. Therefore, the profile of bile pathogens and its susceptibility to a number of antibiotics were evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bile cultures and antibiograms from 92 patients hospitalized between January 2006 and December 2008 in a tertiary referral center for the treatment of biliary and pancreatic diseases (Central Teaching Hospital, Medical University of Silesia) were reviewed. Specimens were obtained from patients with acute cholangitis and confirmed choledocholithiasis during endoscopic (i.e. ERCP) and surgical (i.e. percutaneus transhepatic biliary drainage) procedures. The bile specimens were examined for pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungi. RESULTS: Sixty-five of 92 analyzed cultures were positive. A total of 69 pathogens were isolated: 47 (68.1%) gram-negative bacteria, 18 (26.1%) gram-positive bacteria, 2 (2.9%) anaerobes and 2 (2.9%) Candida. The predominant gram-negative pathogens were Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumani complex, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The most effective antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria were imipenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam and cefepime (susceptibility 97.9%, 89.4%, 85.1% and 85.1%, respectively). The expenditure on antibiotics monotherapies and combined therapies was also analyzed. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that gram-negative bacteria were the predominant bile pathogens found in patients with acute cholangitis. Piperacillin/tazobactam or ceftazidime may be the alternative to ciprofloxacin therapeutic option. The addition of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid to ciprofloxacin could also be considered. However, imipenem should remain a back-up antibiotic in the treatment of acute cholangitis.
TI  - Characterization of a thiamin diphosphate-dependent phenylpyruvate decarboxylase  from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - The product of the ARO10 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was initially identified as a thiamine diphosphate-dependent phenylpyruvate decarboxylase with a broad substrate specificity. It was suggested that the enzyme could be responsible for the catabolism of aromatic and branched-chain amino acids, as well as methionine. In the present study, we report the overexpression of the ARO10 gene product in Escherichia coli and the first detailed in vitro characterization of this enzyme. The enzyme is shown to be an efficient aromatic 2-keto acid decarboxylase, consistent with it playing a major in vivo role in phenylalanine, tryptophan and possibly also tyrosine catabolism. However, its substrate spectrum suggests that it is unlikely to play any significant role in the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids or of methionine. A homology model was used to identify residues likely to be involved in substrate specificity. Site-directed mutagenesis on those residues confirmed previous studies indicating that mutation of single residues is unlikely to produce the immediate conversion of an aromatic into an aliphatic 2-keto acid decarboxylase. In addition, the enzyme was compared with the phenylpyruvate decarboxylase from Azospirillum brasilense and the indolepyruvate decarboxylase from Enterobacter cloacae. We show that the properties of the two phenylpyruvate decarboxylases are similar in some respects yet quite different in others, and that the properties of both are distinct from those of the indolepyruvate decarboxylase. Finally, we demonstrate that it is unlikely that replacement of a glutamic acid by leucine leads to discrimination between phenylpyruvate and indolepyruvate, although, in this case, it did lead to unexpected allosteric activation.
TI  - Cell-based biosensor for measurement of phenol and nitrophenols toxicity.
AB  - A cost-effective whole cell biosensor based on electrochemical technique to detect toxicities of phenol and nitrophenols has been developed. This method relied on the inhibition effect for respiratory chain activity of microorganism by toxicant, which was measured by chronoamperometry using mediator (ferricyanide). The current signals produced by suspended microorganisms and reoxidation of ferrocyanide were transformed to inhibiting efficiency directly, and 50% inhibiting concentration (IC(50)) was chosen as the quantitative standard of toxicity. The test microorganisms used here consist of three bacilli (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Alcaligenes faecalis), two pseudomonas (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseucomonas putida) and one fungus (Trichosporon cutaneum). 3,5-Dichlorophenol (DCP) was taken as the reference toxicant. The results showed that the microorganisms which belong to the same bacterial family had similar trends of inhibitions on respiratory activity and similar IC50 values. By comparing the IC(50) values, P. fluorescens was the most sensitive one to DCP toxicity, its IC(50) was estimated to be 4.2mg/L. pH 7.0 and together with the standard glucose-glutamic acid (GGA) as an exogenous material were taken for optimum conditions in this study. Here, P. fluorescens as model test microorganism was employed to assess toxicities of phenol and nitrophenols under the optimum conditions. IC(50) values of 291.4 mg/L for phenol, 64.1mg/L for 2-NP, 71.4 mg/L for 3-NP and 14.0mg/L for 4-NP were determined at 60 min, respectively. Comparison with the results of published data has confirmed that this cell biosensor is a sensitive and rapid alternative to toxicity screening of chemicals.
TI  - The activity of antimicrobial peptide S-thanatin is independent on multidrug-resistant spectrum of bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the activity of S-thanatin (an analog of antimicrobial peptide derived from thanatin) against different bacterial pathogens frequently which can cause therapeutic problems was tested. The result showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of S-thanatin against all isolates of the Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Klebsiella oxytoca were in the range of 4-16mug/ml, no matter which antibiotic the bacterial was resistant or susceptible, while almost all MICs to Gram-positive bacterial were >128mug/ml except Enterococcus faecium. S-thanatin was more effective toward Gram-negative strains, especially for Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The MICs of S-thanatin were no significantly different in the same species regardless of antibiotic sensitive or -resistant isolates to single or multiple antibiotic (P>0.05). Likewise, no notable difference could be observed between E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, K. ornithinolytica which were sensitive to S-thanatin (P>0.05). It was implied that the antimicrobial activity of S-thanatin was independent on multi-drug resistance spectrum of bacteria.
TI  - Changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. We evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at a tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. The numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third period, 1999-2005. RESULTS: During the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. A significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant S pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Additionally, a significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for E coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and A baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). However, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005 was found for Groups A and B streptococci, non-A, B, D streptococci, and S pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in Taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. Continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.
TI  - Correlation between antibiotic consumption and resistance of Gram-negative bacteria causing healthcare-associated infections at a university hospital in Taiwan from 2000 to 2009.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the correlation between antibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria causing healthcare-associated infections at a university hospital in Taiwan from 2000 to 2009. METHODS: Disc susceptibility data of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli causing healthcare-associated infections were evaluated. Data on annual patient-days and annual consumption (defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days) of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fl uoroquinolones were analysed. RESULTS: The trend of total consumption of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones significantly increased between 2000 and 2003 and remained stable between 2004 and 2009. The decreasing use of gentamicin and amikacin in recent years was associated with increasing susceptibility of E. coli, E. cloacae, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa to gentamicin, as well as increasing susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to amikacin. The use of piperacillin/tazobactam was positively correlated with the prevalence of piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant E. coli and S. maltophilia. In contrast, the use of cefotaxime and piperacillin/tazobactam was negatively correlated with the prevalence of cefotaxime-resistant E. coli and piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant S. maltophilia, respectively. The consumption of fluoroquinolones was positively correlated with the rates of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli, piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant P. aeruginosa and ceftazidime-resistant S. maltophilia. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between antibiotic prescription and the rates of resistance for Gram-negative bacteria is complicated; every type of antimicrobial agent or even individual agent can have distinct associations with different pathogens.
TI  - What remains against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae? Evaluation of chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, colistin, fosfomycin, minocycline, nitrofurantoin, temocillin and tigecycline.
AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae present an increasing and diverse problem, including strains of multiple species with metallo-beta-lactamases (IMP, NDM or VIM) and non-metallo (KPC and OXA-48) enzymes as well as those combining an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or AmpC enzyme with porin loss. Most strains, except those with OXA-48 alone, are broadly resistant to beta-lactams and have multiple aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes; those with NDM-1 carbapenemase typically also have 16S rRNA methylases, conferring complete aminoglycoside resistance. In this study, the activity of chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, colistin, fosfomycin, minocycline, nitrofurantoin, temocillin and tigecycline was evaluated against 81 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates from the UK. Testing was performed by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) agar dilution method. Chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin inhibited <25% of the isolates at the breakpoint, whereas colistin was active against 75/81 isolates (92.6%), the exceptions being four Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae isolates along with members of inherently resistant genera. Fosfomycin was active against 49/81 isolates (60.5%), including 7/7 Escherichia coli, 16/20 Enterobacter and Citrobacter spp., but only 25/52 Klebsiella spp. Tigecycline was active against 38/81 isolates (46.9%) and was intermediate against another 27 (33.3%), with resistance scattered amongst K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp. The activity of colistin, fosfomycin and tigecycline was unrelated to the isolates' carbapenem resistance mechanisms. Temocillin was fully active [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) </=8 mg/L] against only 4/81 isolates (4.9%), but inhibited a further 22 isolates (27.2%) at the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) urinary breakpoint (32 mg/L), predominantly comprising those isolates with combinations of impermeability and an ESBL or AmpC enzyme, along with 6/11 isolates producing KPC carbapenemases. Studies with transconjugants and transformants confirmed the small effect of KPC enzymes against temocillin, whereas OXA-48 and NDM-1 conferred clear resistance.
TI  - A novel gene cassette, aacA43, in a plasmid-borne class 1 integron.
AB  - A novel gene cassette, aacA43, was identified in the aadB-aacA43-oxa10-smr2 cassette array in a class 1 integron. Like related aminoglycoside-(6')-acetyltransferases, AacA43 confers clinically relevant resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, and some less-used aminoglycosides but not to gentamicin. Although transferable on an IncL/M plasmid, aacA43 was identified in only two different Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (14 isolates), one Escherichia coli strain (2 isolates), and one Enterobacter cloacae strain in a survey of patients in a Sydney intensive care unit in 2004-2005.
TI  - Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter, and Proteus
AB  - The Gram-negative bacilli of the genera Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter,and Proteus(Table 26- 1) are members of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals and may be isolated from a variety of environmental sources. With the exception of Proteus, they are sometimes collectively referred to as the coliform bacilli because of shared properties, particularly the ability of most species to ferment the sugar lactose. Many of these microorganisms used to be dismissed as harmless commensals. Today, they are known to be responsible for major health problems worldwide. A limited number of species, including E coli, K pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, S marcescens,and P mirabilis, are responsible for most infections produced by this group of organisms. The increasing incidence of the coliforms, Proteus, and other Gram-negative organisms in diseases reflects in part a better understanding of their pathogenic potential but more importantly the changing ecology of bacterial disease. The widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics has created drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli that readily acquire multiple resistance through transmission of drug resistance plasmids (R factors). Also, development of new surgical procedures, health support technology, and therapeutic regimens has provided new portals of entry and compromised many host defenses.
TI  - The relevance of aortic endograft prosthetic infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular prosthetic graft infection is a severe complication after open aortic aneurysm repair. Reports of infected endografts are scarce. General treatment consensus with infected graft material is that it should be removed completely. The objective of this study was to describe the incidence of endograft infection after endovascular repair of abdominal (EVAR) and thoracic aortic aneurysm (TEVAR) and to report treatment options and their outcome. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed of patients endovascularly operated for abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm in two large hospitals (one tertiary referral center and one large community hospital) between March 1996 and June 2009. Diagnosis of infected endograft was made based on clinical findings, blood tests and cultures, imaging studies (computed tomography, fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography), and intraoperative findings at reoperation. RESULTS: Eleven patients with an infected endograft were identified in 1431 endovascular procedures. One other patient was referred from another hospital. Patients were aged 68 +/- 9 years, and all but one were male. The median time from initial TEVAR/EVAR to the diagnosis of infection was 115 days (range, 7-3748 days), with 42% of patients presenting within 3 months after TEVAR/EVAR. Seven patients were diagnosed with endograft infection after elective TEVAR/EVAR and five after emergency TEVAR/EVAR. The incidence was significantly higher in patients that were treated in an emergency setting (0.56% vs 2.79%; P = .002), while there was no significant difference between TEVAR and EVAR procedures (1.37% vs 0.77%). All patients were initially treated with antibiotic therapy, which was complemented with surgical intervention in six patients. In four patients, the infected graft material was completely explanted. Isolated microorganisms included Staphylococcus species (n = 4), Streptococcus species (n = 4), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), Escherichia coli (n = 1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), and Listeria monocytogenes (n = 1). Median time of follow-up was 201 days (range, 6-2023 days). During the study period, three out of 12 patients died, of which two were treated conservatively (P = ns). At their last follow-up visit, seven of nine patients still used antimicrobial therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of endograft infection is below 1%, with a mortality rate of 25%. Although consensus is that infected graft material should always be removed, this study shows no significant difference in mortality between the conservatively- and the surgically-managed group, possibly related to the small sample size. There may be a role for conservative treatment in selected cases of patients with an infected endograft.
TI  - Identification of a novel fosfomycin resistance gene (fosA2) in Enterobacter cloacae from the Salmon River, Canada.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the occurrence of fosfomycin-resistant (fos(R) ) bacteria in aquatic environments. METHODS AND RESULTS: A fos(R) strain of Enterobacter cloacae was isolated from a water sample collected at a site (50 degrees 41'33.44''N, 119 degrees 19'49.50''W) near the mouth of the Salmon River at Salmon Arm, in south-central British Columbia, Canada. The strain was identified by PCR screening for plasmid-borne, fosA-family amplicons, followed by selective plating. Sequencing of the resistance gene cloned using PCR primers to conserved flanking DNA revealed a new allele (95% amino acid identity to fosA), and I-Ceu I PFGE showed that it was chromosomally located. In Escherichia coli, the cloned DNA conferred a greater resistance to fosfomycin than its fosA counterpart. CONCLUSIONS: Gene fosA2 conferred fosfomycin resistance in an environmental isolate of Ent. cloacae. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The repurposing of older antibiotics should be considered in the light of existing reservoirs of resistance genes in the environment.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections in the Asia-Pacific region according to currently established susceptibility interpretive criteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) was  intended to reveal the evolving profiles of antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative pathogens causing intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) from Asia-Pacific region in 2009. METHODS: A total of 3577 aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli associated with IAIs were collected from 32 centers in 12 countries. The in vitro susceptibilities of these isolates to 12 antimicrobial agents were determined using the broth microdilution method. Susceptibility results for selected species of Enterobacteriaceae were also compared using different MIC interpretive criteria recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute in 2009 (M100-S19), in January 2010 (M100-S20), in June 2010 (M100-S20-U) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing in 2010 (EUCAST-2010). RESULTS: Enterobacteriaceae comprised 89.5% of the isolates of which Escherichia coli was the most common species (56.7%). Enterobacteriaceae showed poor susceptibility to ampicillin-sulbactam in China (25.3%) and India (19%), and to fluoroquinolones in India (23.4%) and China (37.7%). The rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli (36.8%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (26.3%) remained high. The resistance of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae to carbapenems also increased, especially to ertapenem (9.9%). Using M100-S20 criteria, 19% of ESBL-producing E. coli and 9% of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae were susceptible to ceftazidime; 5% and 10% were susceptible to cefepime, respectively. Using M100-S20-U guidelines, the susceptibility rates of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (88%) and Enterobacter cloacae (69%) to ertapenem were substantially decreased from those determined using M100-S20. CONCLUSIONS: These up-to-date epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance surveillance data are crucial to select appropriate treatment of IAIs.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens from blood cultures from Canadian hospitals: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - This study assessed the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens associated with bloodstream infections in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. Tertiary-care medical centers representing 8 of 10 Canadian provinces submitted bloodstream infection pathogens from patients attending hospital clinics, emergency rooms, medical/surgical wards, and intensive care units. Over 8,000 blood culture pathogens were collected. The 10 most common pathogens (representing 80.9% of all isolates) were Escherichia coli (1856 [22.6%]), Staphylococcus aureus (1457 [17.7%] including 1101 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 356 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), coagulase-negative staphylococci (907 [11.0%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (600 [7.3%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (470 [5.7%]), Enterococcus faecalis (360 [4.4%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (333 [4.0%]), viridans group streptococci (321 [3.9%]), Enterobacter cloacae (193 [2.3%]), and Streptococcus pyogenes (159 [1.9%]). The most active agents against Gram-negative bacilli were carbapenems (e.g., meropenem and ertapenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam, while for Gram-positive cocci, they were vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin.
TI  - Microbiology and antibiotic susceptibility of organisms in bile cultures from patients with and without cholangitis at an Asian academic medical center.
AB  - PURPOSE: To review the epidemiology of microbial isolates from bile cultures taken from patients with and without cholangitis admitted to an Asian academic medical center in order to compare antimicrobial sensitivities and to make recommendations for empiric antimicrobial therapy of patients with cholangitis in the Philippines. METHODS: Routine aerobic bile culture results and corresponding clinical abstracts of surgical patients admitted to an academic medical center over a three-year period were analyzed. RESULTS: The series consisted of 125 patients, 77 with cholangitis (62%) and 48 (38%) without, which was determined according to the Tokyo Guidelines. Patients with cholangitis were significantly more likely to have positive bile cultures (p = 0.012). Gram-negative bacilli were the most common isolates in both patients with (94%) and patients without (95%) cholangitis. For both groups, Escherichia coli (36%) had greatest sensitivity to amikacin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, imipenem-cilastatin meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam; Klebsiella pneumoniae (16%) had greatest sensitivity to amikacin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, imipenem-cilastatin meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5%) was most sensitive to cefepime, gentamicin, imipenem-cilastatin meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacilli (or Enterobacteriaceae) (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae) were the most common aerobic microbial isolates in bile cultures from patients with cholangitis in the Philippines. Their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns suggest that imipenem-cilastatin (sensitivity 100%), meropenem (100%), amikacin (90-100%), cefepime (75%-100%), ceftriaxone (75%-100%), gentamicin (67%-100%), and piperacillin-tazobactam (50%-100%) would be the most effective antimicrobials for both groups. However, the authors echo the caution from the Surgical Infection Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America against using aminoglycosides as empiric drugs when safer and equally effective regimens are available.
TI  - Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli in acute gastroenteritis in infants in North-West  Italy.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli may cause diarrhoea in infancy, but it is not routinely detected and regarded as a major causative agent. The aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of enteropathogenic E. coli infection and to investigate its epidemiology and pathogenesis from faecal specimens in infants hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. Between March 2008 and June 2009, faecal samples were collected and examined to recognize diarrhoeal aetiology, especially for E. coli, by cultural identification and multiplex-PCR. E. coli were isolated in 75 of 160 collected samples (46,88%); 10 samples of which (6,3%) had been positively recognised for pathogenic genes. Data showed that the presence of diarrheagenic E. coli infection was 6.3%, but it becomes 5% considering E. coli as a unique agent responsible for diarrhoea. The datum is not statistically meaningful because of the small sample (p>0,05). Bacterial pathogens were also isolated in 60 samples (37,5% of the total collected samples): 15 Salmonella spp., 8 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Klebsiella oxytoca, 11 Citrobacter freundii, 5 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 Serratia spp., 7 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Shigella spp., 2 Campylobacter spp. Rotavirus was the predominant pathogenic single etiologic agent identified. It was found in 35 samples (21.88% of the overall collected samples), while Adenovirus, serotypes 40 or 41, was isolated in 2 samples (1.3%). Rotavirus infection was found predominantly in winter with respect to autumn. Data provide an interesting epidemiologic survey of enteropathogenic E. coli, which is not usually detected, although it may have potential clinical implications. ABBREVIATIONS: CDEC, detaching E. coli; DAEC, diffusely adherent E. coli; EAggEC, enteroaggregative E. coli; EHEC, enterohaemorrhagic E. coli; EIEC, enteroinvasive E. coli; EPEC, enteropathogenic E. coli; ETEC, enterotoxigenic E. coli.
TI  - Molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria  isolated from bovine mastitis in Egypt.
AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic basis of multidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine mastitis cases in Egypt. Multidrug resistance phenotypes were found in 34 of 112 (30.4%) Gram-negative bacterial isolates, which harbored at least one antimicrobial resistance gene. The most prevalent multidrug-resistant (MDR) species were Enterobacter cloacae (8 isolates, 7.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 6.3%), Klebsiella oxytoca (7 isolates, 6.3%), Escherichia coli (5 isolates, 4.5%), and Citrobacter freundii (3 isolates, 2.7%). The most commonly observed resistance phenotypes were against ampicillin (97.0%), streptomycin (94.1%), tetracycline (91.2%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (88.2%), nalidixic acid (85.3%), and chloramphenicol (76.5%). Class 1 integrons were detected in 28 (25.0%) isolates. The gene cassettes within class 1 integrons included those encoding resistance to trimethoprim (dfrA1, dfrA5, dfrA7, dfrA12, dfrA15, dfrA17, and dfrA25), aminoglycosides (aadA1, aadA2, aadA5, aadA7, aadA12, aadA22, and aac(3)-Id), chloramphenicol (cmlA), erythromycin (ereA2), and rifampicin (arr-3). Class 2 integrons were identified in 6 isolates (5.4%) with three different profiles. Furthermore, the beta-lactamase encoding genes, bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), and bla(OXA), the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, qnr and aac(6)-Ib-cr, and the florfenicol resistance gene, floR, were also identified. To the best of our knowledge, the results identified class 2 integrons, qnr and aac(6)-Ib-cr from cases of mastitis for the first time. This is the first report of molecular characterization for antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine mastitis in Africa.
TI  - Influence of referral bias on the clinical characteristics of patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infection.
AB  - Referral bias can influence the results of studies performed at tertiary-care centres. In this study, we evaluated demographic and microbiological factors that influenced referral of patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infection (BSI). We identified 2919 and 846 unique patients with Gram-negative BSI in a referral cohort of patients treated at Mayo Clinic Hospitals and a population-based cohort of Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2007, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with referral. Elderly patients aged >/=80 years with Gram-negative BSI were less likely to be referred than younger patients [odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.30-0.62] as were females (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.53-0.74). After adjusting for age and gender, bloodstream isolates of Escherichia coli (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.43-0.58) and Proteus mirabilis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30-0.82) were underrepresented in the referral cohort; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.70-3.06), Enterobacter cloacae (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.53-3.66), Serratia marcescens (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.33-4.52) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (OR 17.94, 95% CI 3.98-314.43) were overrepresented in the referral cohort. We demonstrated that demographic and microbiological characteristics of patients with Gram-negative BSI had an influence on referral patterns. These factors should be considered when interpreting results of investigations performed at tertiary-care centres.
TI  - Is selective digestive decontamination useful in controlling aerobic gram-negative bacilli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases?
AB  - AIMS: To identify outbreak episodes of either carriage or infection due to extended spectrum beta-lactamases producing aerobic Gram-negative bacilli (AGNB-ESBL); to establish whether AGNB-ESBL, sensitive to tobramycin, become resistant over time; and to evaluate the impact of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) on abnormal carriage of AGNB-ESBL. DESIGN AND SETTING: All children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) over a 12-month period had biweekly surveillance cultures of throat and rectum and diagnostic cultures when clinically indicated. All AGNB were tested for ESBL, and the positive isolates were sent for molecular typing. The PICU uses SDD (parenteral cefotaxime and enteral polymyxin E/tobramycin) to control abnormal carriage. Patients who had at least one AGNB-ESBL were included in the study. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,101 children were admitted to the PICU. There were 39 patients (3.5%) with a total of 236 cultures positive for AGNB-ESBL. Twenty-eight patients (2.5%) were carriers, and 11 (1%) had proven infections. Organisms isolated from the first culture were 14 patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 with Enterobacter cloacae, 7 with Citrobacter freundii, 5 with Klebsiella oxytoca, and 5 with Escherichia coli. In the first sample, 59% of isolates showed tobramycin resistance. Molecular typing confirmed that there were five different strains of K. pneumoniae and that similar strains were not isolated in the same period. CONCLUSIONS: SDD is an effective measure to control AGNB-ESBL and to avoid outbreak episodes of either carriage or infection. When tobramycin resistance is found, replacing it with another aminoglycoside based on antibiogram may be more effective in achieving AGNB clearance.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in expanded spectrum beta lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae in Morocco.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although independently acquired, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance appears to be linked with extended-spectrum or AmpC-type beta-lactamases. Since no data are available in African countries, the prevalence of qnr genes at the University Hospital Ibn Rochd, Casablanca, Morocco, was investigated. METHODOLOGY: Between October 2006 and March 2007, the following 39 randomly selected non-duplicate Enterobacteriaceae producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), representing 20% of ESBL strains with respect to species and ward origin, were collected: Escherichia coli (n = 16); Klebsiella spp (n = 14); Enterobacter cloacae (n = 8); Proteus mirabilis (n = 1). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to CLSI guidelines. ESBL detection was performed by the double disc diffusion test. A multiplex PCR was conducted to detect qnrA, qnrB and qnrS genes that were confirmed by sequencing of the PCR product. RESULTS: The estimated overall prevalence of qnr reached 36% (n = 14; qnrA, 10.25%; qnrB, 23.07%; qnrS, 2.56%). Genes were identified in E. coli, Klebsiella and Enterobacter with a respective prevalence of 18.7%, 50% and 62.5%. The qnr genes were detected in nine wards and qnrA1, qnrB1-B2-B4 and qnrS1 variants were identified. Three genes were identified among nalidixic acid susceptible strains (n = 6); three of those were also susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Among nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin resistant strains, all strains had qnrB. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the high prevalence of qnr genes among ESBL strains in the Ibn Rochd CHU, Casablanca. Moreover, qnr were present in quinolone-susceptible strains which could lead to in vivo selection of ciprofloxacin-resistant strains.
TI  - Activity of tigecycline alone and in combination with colistin and meropenem against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains by time-kill assay.
AB  - Antibiotic combinations including tigecycline have not been studied against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing pathogens. Tigecycline alone and combined with colistin and meropenem was tested against eight genetically unrelated KPC-producing clinical strains of Enterobacteriaceae (four K. pneumoniae, two Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter cloacae and one Serratia marcescens) by time-kill assay. Tigecycline displayed a concentration-independent bacteriostatic activity in seven strains and bactericidal activity in one strain. Colistin showed bactericidal activity at 4x the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in three strains and was bacteriostatic for the remaining strains and concentrations. Meropenem was bactericidal in three strains and bacteriostatic in five strains. The tigecycline+meropenem combination was not bactericidal against the four K. pneumoniae strains and was non-synergistic against all eight strains. Tigecycline+colistin was bactericidal against all strains at most time intervals and concentrations and was also synergistic at 1x and 2x MIC against most strains up to 4-8h and at 4x MIC up to 24 h against all strains. These findings suggest that, at most drug concentrations, tigecycline, colistin and meropenem as single agents do not exhibit efficient bactericidal activity against most of the KPC-producing strains. Tigecycline alone might be a therapeutic option for infections caused by KPC-producers when bacteriostatic activity is adequate or combined with colistin when bactericidal activity is necessary. Additional in vivo tests are warranted to assess better the killing kinetics of tigecycline combinations against KPC-producers.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic profiling of antimicrobials against Gram-negative respiratory isolates from Canadian hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: With diminishing antimicrobial potency, the choice of effective empirical therapy has become more challenging. Thus, the pharmacodynamic evaluation of potential therapies is essential to identify optimal agents, doses and administration strategies. METHODS: Monte Carlo simulation was conducted for standard and/or prolonged infusion regimens of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, doripenem, ertapenem, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were obtained for Escherichia coli (n=64 respiratory isolates), Enterobacter cloacae (n=53), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=75) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=273) throughout Canada. The cumulative fraction of response (CFR) was calculated using bactericidal targets for each regimen against each species. A CFR >/=90% was defined as optimal. RESULTS: All cefepime, doripenem, ertapenem and meropenem regimens achieved optimal exposures against Enterobacteriaceae, whereas target attainment was organism and dose dependent for the other agents. Prolonged infusion doripenem and meropenem 1 g and 2 g every 8 h, along with standard infusion doripenem and meropenem 2 g every 8 h, were the only regimens to attain optimal exposures against P aeruginosa. Ciprofloxacin had the lowest CFR against P aeruginosa, followed by cefepime. Among the P aeruginosa isolates collected in the intensive care unit (ICU) compared with the wards, differences of 0.5% to 10% were noted in favour of non-ICU isolates for all agents; however, marked differences (10% to 15%) in CFR were observed for ciprofloxacin in favour of ICU isolates. CONCLUSION: Standard dosing of cefepime, doripenem, ertapenem and meropenem has a high likelihood of obtaining optimal pharmacodynamic indexes against these Enterobacteriaceae. For P aeruginosa, aggressive treatment with high-dose and/or prolonged infusion regimens are likely required to address the elevated resistance rates of respiratory isolates from Canada.
TI  - Early dissemination of NDM-1- and OXA-181-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Indian  hospitals: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 2006-2007.
AB  - Among 39 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (2.7% overall; Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains) isolated in 2006 and 2007 in India, 15 strains carried bla(NDM-1) and 10 harbored a gene encoding a variant of the carbapenemase OXA-48, named bla(OXA-181). One E. cloacae strain harbored bla(VIM-6), and one K. pneumoniae strain carrying bla(OXA-181) also possessed bla(VIM-5). Multiple pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns and clonal dissemination within and among sites were observed. Isolates producing NDM-1 were disseminated in Indian health care facilities as early as 2006.
TI  - Bactericidal oncocin derivatives with superior serum stabilities.
AB  - The proline-rich antimicrobial peptide oncocin is remarkably active in vitro against a number of important Gram-negative bacteria of concern to humans owing to their increasing resistance to antibiotics, i.e. Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) and non-fermenting species (Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Degradation of oncocin in mouse serum was investigated in this study. Several approaches to stabilise the main cleavage sites (C-terminal to Arg-15 and N-terminal to Arg-19) by substituting either or both arginine (Arg) residues with non-proteinogenic amino acids, i.e. alpha-amino-3-guanidino-propionic acid, homoarginine, nitro-arginine, N-methyl-arginine, beta-homoarginine, D-arginine (D-Arg) or ornithine (Orn), were tested. These modifications were found to increase the half-life of oncocin in full mouse serum. For oncocin with two Orn residues in positions 15 and 19, the half-life in full serum increased from 25 min to 3 h. An increase of >8 h was observed for oncocin with two D-Arg residues at these same positions. The antibacterial activities of these modified sequences were slightly better than the original oncocin sequence. Moreover, the three most stable analogues were found to be bactericidal against E. coli and were not toxic to HeLa cells or haemolytic to human erythrocytes.
TI  - Serendipitous discovery of alpha-hydroxyalkyl esters as beta-lactamase substrates.
AB  - O-(1-Carboxy-1-alkyloxycarbonyl) hydroxamates were found to spontaneously decarboxylate in aqueous neutral buffer to form O-(2-hydroxyalkylcarbonyl) hydroxamates. While the former molecules do not react rapidly with serine beta-lactamases, the latter are quite good substrates of representative class A and C, but not D, enzymes, and particularly of a class C enzyme. The enzymes catalyze hydrolysis of these compounds to a mixture of the alpha-hydroxy acid and hydroxamate. Analogous compounds containing aryloxy leaving groups rather that hydroxamates are also substrates. Structure-activity experiments showed that the alpha-hydroxyl group was required for any substantial substrate activity. Although both d- and l-alpha-hydroxy acid derivatives were substrates, the former were preferred. The response of the class C activity to pH and to alternative nucleophiles (methanol and d-phenylalanine) suggested that the same active site functional groups participated in catalysis as for classical substrates. Molecular modeling was employed to explore how the alpha-hydroxy group might interact with the class C beta-lactamase active site. Incorporation of the alpha-hydroxyalkyl moiety into novel inhibitors will be of considerable interest.
TI  - Long-term characteristics of healthcare-associated infections in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Healthcare-associated infections in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are associated with a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Knowledge regarding pathogens, primary sources of infection and antibiotic resistance in the NICU is essential for developing management strategies. This study aimed to analyze the long-term characteristics of healthcare-associated infections in a tertiary referral center in southern Taiwan. METHODS: Infants < 30 days old, with positive blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine or tissue fluid cultures during hospitalization in the NICU of National Cheng Kung University Hospital from July 1989 to June 2008 were included in the study. RESULTS: In total, 1,417 organisms and episodes were identified during the study period. Gram-positive organisms, Gram-negative organisms and fungi constituted 923 (65.1%), 358 (25.3%) and 136 (9.6%) of the pathogens, respectively. Of the Gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci (51.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (34.8%) and Enterococcus spp. (6.1%) were the major pathogens; and 27% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were oxacillin-resistant. For the Gram-negative organisms, Klebsiella pneumoniae (22%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.8%), Escherichia coli (16.7%) and Enterobacter cloacae (16.7%) were dominant. Also, Candida albicans accounted for 50% of fungal infections. The most common source of infection was bloodstream infection (59.0%), and 5.6% of these were catheter-related. Skin and soft tissue infections were also frequent (26.3%). CONCLUSION: Bloodstream and skin/soft tissue infections caused by commensal species play an important role in healthcare-associated infections in the NICU. New measures should be developed in response to the changing patterns in the NICU.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections in China: the 2002-2009 Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART).
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution and susceptibility of aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) in China. From 2002 to 2009, minimum inhibitory concentrations of 14 antibiotics for 3420 aerobic and facultative GNB from up to eight hospitals in six cities were determined by the broth microdilution method. Enterobacteriaceae comprised 82.9% (2834/3420) of the total isolates, with Escherichia coli (49.2%) being the most commonly isolated species followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.0%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.8%) and Citrobacter freundii (2.3%). Amongst the antimicrobial agents tested, the three carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem) were the most active agents against Enterobacteriaceae, with susceptibility rates of 96.1-99.6% (2002-2009), 98.2-100% (2002-2009) and 99.6-100% (2002-2004), respectively, followed by amikacin (86.8-95.1%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (84.5-94.3%). Susceptibility rates of all tested third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae declined by nearly 30%, with susceptibility rates of 40.2%, 39.1%, 56.3% and 51.8% in 2009 for ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefepime, respectively. The occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases increased rapidly, especially for E. coli (from 20.8% in 2002 to 64.9% in 2009). Susceptibility of E. coli to ciprofloxacin decreased from 57.6% in 2002 to 24.2% in 2009. The least active agent against Enterobacteriaceae was ampicillin/sulbactam (SAM) (25.3-44.3%). In conclusion, Enterobacteriaceae were the major pathogens causing IAIs, and carbapenems retained the highest susceptibility rates over the 8-year study period. Third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and SAM may not be ideal choices for empirical therapy of IAIs in China.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of the essential oils of commonly consumed medicinal herbs  using an in vitro model.
AB  - The chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from 10 commonly consumed herbs: Citrus aurantium, C. limon, Lavandula angustifolia, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha piperita, M. spicata, Ocimum basilicum, Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris and Salvia officinalis have been determined. The antibacterial activity of these oils and their main components; i.e. camphor, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, limonene, menthol, a-pinene, b-pinene, and thymol were assayed against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Micrococcus flavus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, S. epidermidis, S. typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus. The highest and broadest activity was shown by O. vulgare oil. Carvacrol had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested components.
TI  - Cellulosic ethanol production by Zymomonas mobilis harboring an endoglucanase gene from Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Enterobactercloacae was isolated from the gut of the wood feeding termite, Heterotermes indicola, and a 2.25-kb fragment conferring cellulase activity was cloned in Escherichia coli. The cloned fragment contained a 1083-bp ORF which could encode a protein belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 8. The cellulase gene was introduced into Zymomonas mobilis strain Microbial Type Culture Collection centre (MTCC) on a plasmid and 0.134 filter paper activity unit (FPU)/ml units of cellulase activity was observed with the recombinant bacterium. Using carboxymethyl cellulose and 4% NaOH pretreated bagasse as substrates, the recombinant strain produced 5.5% and 4% (V/V) ethanol respectively, which was threefold higher than the amount obtained with the original E.cloacae isolate. The recombinant Z. mobilis strain could be improved further by simultaneous expression of cellulase cocktails before utilizing it for industrial level ethanol production.
TI  - Vejovine, a new antibiotic from the scorpion venom of Vaejovis mexicanus.
AB  - Multidrug resistant bacterial infections are one of the most important health problems in recent years. Resistance to conventional antibiotics limits the therapeutic options causing increase rate in morbid-mortality in hospitals. Therefore, new antibacterial agents with new bacterial targets have been searched and found in many different sources, including scorpion venom and scorpion hemolymph. Here, we report a new anti-microbial peptide named Vejovine. This peptide was isolated from the venom of the Mexican scorpion Vaejovis mexicanus by two steps of reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). It is composed of 47 amino acid residues with no cysteine residues in its sequence, with a molecular weight of 4873 Da. The chemical synthesis of Vejovine was performed by the solid phase method of Merrifield, using fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-amino acids. Both the native and synthetic peptides were shown to have essentially the same activity. Vejovine inhibits growth of clinical isolates of Gram-negative multidrug resistant (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumanii) causing nosocomial infections with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.4 muM up to 50 muM. This peptide has also hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes with a HC(50) value of 100 muM. A cDNA library of the venomous gland of this scorpion provided material for cloning the gene encoding Vejovine. This peptide is a new type of antibiotic, showing less than 50% similarity to other known scorpion peptides. Vejovine is a candidate to be used as a leading compound for future development of an effective peptide against multidrug resistant bacteria.
TI  - Comment on: role of changes in the L3 loop of the active site in the evolution of enzymatic activity of VIM-type metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  
TI  - Mutation of a degS homologue in Enterobacter cloacae decreases colonization and biological control of damping-off on cucumber.
AB  - We have been using mutagenesis to determine how biocontrol bacteria such as Enterobacter cloacae 501R3 deal with complex nutritional environments found in association with plants. E. cloacae C10, a mutant of 501R3 with a transposon insertion in degS, was diminished in growth on synthetic cucumber root exudate (SRE), colonization of cucumber seed and roots, and control of damping-off of cucumber caused by Pythium ultimum. DegS, a periplasmic serine protease in the closely related bacterium Escherichia coli K12, is required for the RpoE-mediated stress response. C10 containing wild-type degS from 501R3 or from E. coli K12 on pBeloBAC11 was significantly increased in growth on SRE, colonization of cucumber roots, and control of P. ultimum relative to C10 containing pBeloBAC11 alone. C10 and 501R3 were similar in sensitivity to acidic conditions, plant-derived phenolic compounds, oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide, dessication, and high osmoticum; stress conditions potentially associated with plants. This study demonstrates a role for degS in the spermosphere and rhizosphere during colonization and disease control by Enterobacter cloacae. This study implicates, for the first time, the involvement of DegS and, by extension, the RpoE-mediated stress response, in reducing stress on E. cloacae resulting from the complex nutritional environments in the spermosphere and rhizosphere.
TI  - Molecular characterization and antimicrobial susceptibility of extended-spectrum  {beta}-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates at a tertiary-care centre in Monterrey, Mexico.
AB  - Our objective was to analyse phenotypic and genetic data of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens that cause infections in our hospital. Over a 3 year period, 342 randomly selected clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates were tested for ESBL production and evaluated for the presence of the beta-lactamase genes bla(SHV), bla(TEM,) bla(CTX-M) and bla(TLA-1). The antibiotic susceptibilities of these isolates were also determined, and the clonality of the isolates was assessed by PFGE. Based on our analyses, 33/92 (35.9 %) K. pneumoniae, 31/87 (35.6 %) Enterobacter cloacae, 24/80 (30 %) E. coli and 17/83 (20.5 %) S. marcescens were identified as ESBL producers. The presence of TEM, SHV or CTX ESBL types was detected in 99/105 (94 %) of the isolates. TLA-1 was not detected in any of the 105 isolates. The dominant ESBL types were bla(SHV-5) (n=33), bla(SHV12) (n=31) and bla(CTX-M-15) (n=30). The predominant ESBL identified in E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae isolates was CTX-M-15, whereas in K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens the predominant types were SHV-12 and SHV-5, respectively. PFGE genotyping revealed two main genetic patterns in the K. pneumoniae isolates, types SHV-12 and TEM-1+SHV-5. An outbreak caused by Enterobacter cloacae SHV-5+CTX-M-15 was detected. In contrast, most ESBL-producing isolates of E. coli and S. marcescens did not have similar PFGE banding patterns and thus were not genetically similar. Enterobacteriaceae are a concern in our hospital, especially K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. Our results confirm that the CTX-M-15 ESBL type has spread rapidly in the hospital, and thus requires careful monitoring.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents --special references to bacteria isolated between April 2008 and March 2009].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2008 to March 2009 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 712 strains including 18 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 173 (80.5%) of 215 patients with surgical infections. Three hundred and sixty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 346 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from postoperative infections, P aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Streptococcus constellatus and Gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and Bilophila wadsworthia, and from postoperative infections, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by B. thetaiotaomicron, B. wadsworthia and B. ovatus, in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and Enterococcus spp., nor multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Evaluation of the DiversiLab system for detection of hospital outbreaks of infections by different bacterial species.
AB  - Many bacterial typing methods are specific for one species only, time-consuming,  or poorly reproducible. DiversiLab (DL; bioMerieux) potentially overcomes these limitations. In this study, we evaluated the DL system for the identification of hospital outbreaks of a number bacterial species. Appropriately typed clinical isolates were tested with DL. DL typing agreed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for Acinetobacter (n = 26) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 13) isolates. With two exceptions, DL typing of Klebsiella isolates (n = 23) also correlated with PFGE, and in addition, PFGE-nontypeable (PFGE-NT) isolates could be typed. Enterobacter (n = 28) results also correlated with PFGE results; also, PFGE-NT isolates could be clustered. In a larger study (n = 270), a cluster of 30 isolates was observed that could be subdivided by PFGE. The results for Escherichia coli (n = 38) correlated less well with an experimental multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) scheme. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 52) showed only a limited number of amplification products for most isolates. When multiple Pseudomonas isolates were assigned to a single type in DL, all except one showed multiple multilocus sequence types. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus generally also showed a limited number of amplification products. Isolates that belonged to different outbreaks by other typing methods, including PFGE, spa typing, and MLVA, were grouped together in a number of cases. For Enterococcus faecium, the limited variability of the amplification products obtained made interpretation difficult and correlation with MLVA and esp gene typing was poor. All of the results are reflected in Simpson's index of diversity and adjusted Rand's and Wallace's coefficients. DL is a useful tool to help identify hospital outbreaks of Acinetobacter spp., S. maltophilia, the Enterobacter cloacae complex, Klebsiella spp., and, to a somewhat lesser extent, E. coli. In our study, DL was inadequate for P. aeruginosa, E. faecium, and MRSA. However, it should be noted that for the identification of outbreaks, epidemiological data should be combined with typing results.
TI  - [Gut translocation septicemia in infant].
AB  - Intestinal microbiotype necessary for life is a source of complications in childhood. Bacterial translocation is responsible of endogenous septicaemia and invasive complications. We report five cases of severe invasive infections associated with diarrhoea, digestive bleeding or sepsis. Biological parameters for inflammation are highly positive, and blood cultures reveal bacterial identification: salmonella enteridis, enterobacter cloacae, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli or clostridium difficile. We describe the predisposing factors and susceptibility status to develop translocation: invasive diarrhoea, asplenia, gasto-intestinal disease... All invasive infections in children require etiological approach with the possibility of an endogenous septicaemia (bacterial translocation). This approach minimises the nosocomial features undercurrent in these invasive infections, and leads also to other alternative preventive measures: antibiotic association, maintaining an enteral nutrition, pre or probiotic use, specific digestive decontamination.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of ram semen, antibiotic sensitivities, and effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees C.
AB  - This study was designed to determine the degree and type of bacterial contamination of ejaculated semen samples in fertile rams and its consequences on sperm quality during storage. In experiment 1, 68 ejaculates from 36 rams were divided into two aliquots, one of which was used for bacterial culture, while the other one was diluted, stored at 15 degrees C and assessed for plasma membrane integrity and motility at 0, 24 and 48h after dilution. From the 68 ejaculates, 66 were positive for aerobic bacteria, including 20 species of bacteria from 14 genera. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Staphylococcus aureus species. These 5 bacteria were present in 97% of all contaminated samples. All contaminant bacteria were found to be sensitive to gentamicin and to ceftiofur, with variable percentages of resistance to the other antibiotics evaluated. In samples with total enterobacteria count lower than 100 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml, higher proportions of motile and progressive sperm and higher velocities of spermatozoa were observed at different times during storage. In experiment 2, pure cultures of the most frequently isolated bacteria were individually added to fresh semen samples of low contamination and tested for their effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees C. Semen with E. coli showed a drastic reduction in motility, velocity and viability during storage. This reduction was also significant, but less drastic, in semen with E. cloacae and P. mirabilis, whereas it was partial and less pronounced in the other groups (S. epidermidis and S. aureus). In conclusion, the contamination of ram semen with enterobacterial species reduced sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees C, and the antibiotics gentamicin and ceftiofur showed the higher antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Faecal carriage of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli during a non-outbreak situation in a French university hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacilli and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates in stool specimens obtained from patients hospitalized for acute diarrhoea in a French university hospital. METHODS: Bacteria in stool specimens were screened for ESBL production on Drigalski agar supplemented with ceftazidime, ESBL CHROMagar((R)) and CTX CHROMagar((R)) media and confirmed by the double-disc synergy test. Genetic detection was performed by PCR and sequencing with bacterial DNA extracted from isolates. RESULTS: The presence of MDR bacteria was markedly high (96 of 303 patients, 31.7%). The majority of MDR bacteria were Enterobacter cloacae (44, 38%) and Escherichia coli (32, 28%). Moreover, the prevalence of ESBL and CTX-M producers among all included patients was 15.8% and 5.9%, respectively. The clone E. coli O25b : H4-ST131 was detected in 63% of CTX-M strains. Surprisingly, 16 carbapenemases (5.3% of patients) were isolated. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed the wide dissemination of MDR bacteria, including carbapenemase producers, in a French hospital during a non-outbreak situation. Public health efforts to combat emergence and dissemination of MDR organisms need to be developed.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Canadian hospitals: results of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008).
AB  - A total of 5,282 bacterial isolates obtained between 1 January and 31 December 31 2008, inclusive, from patients in 10 hospitals across Canada as part of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008) underwent susceptibility testing. The 10 most common organisms, representing 78.8% of all clinical specimens, were as follows: Escherichia coli (21.4%), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; 13.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.4%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; 5.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (4.1%), Enterococcus spp. (3.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (2.2%). MRSA comprised 27.0% (272/1,007) of all S. aureus isolates (genotypically, 68.8% of MRSA were health care associated [HA-MRSA] and 27.6% were community associated [CA-MRSA]). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of E. coli isolates. The CTX-M type was the predominant ESBL, with CTX-M-15 the most prevalent genotype. MRSA demonstrated no resistance to ceftobiprole, daptomycin, linezolid, telavancin, tigecycline, or vancomycin (0.4% intermediate intermediate resistance). E. coli demonstrated no resistance to ertapenem, meropenem, or tigecycline. Resistance rates with P. aeruginosa were as follows: colistin (polymyxin E), 0.8%; amikacin, 3.5%; cefepime, 7.2%; gentamicin, 12.3%; fluoroquinolones, 19.0 to 24.1%; meropenem, 5.6%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 8.0%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (5.9%) but uncommonly in E. coli (1.2%) and K. pneumoniae (0.9%). In conclusion, E. coli, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Enterococcus spp. are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian hospitals. The prevalence of MRSA was 27.0% (of which genotypically 27.6% were CA-MRSA), while ESBL-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of isolates. An MDR phenotype was common in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Sensitization of microcin J25-resistant strains by a membrane-permeabilizing peptide.
AB  - Microcin J25 (MccJ25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by Escherichia coli. MccJ25 inhibits RNA polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. MccJ25 uptake into E. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor FhuA and the inner membrane proteins TonB, ExbB, ExbD, and SbmA. This peptide is active on some E. coli, Salmonella, and Shigella species strains, while other Gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, are completely resistant. In the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (KFF)(3)K made some resistant strains sensitive to MccJ25, among them S. Typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. The results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (KFF)(3)K allows MccJ25 penetration in an FhuA and SbmA-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic Salmonella strains.
TI  - The clinical and prognostic importance of positive blood cultures in adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adults. Bloodstream infections should be reassessed periodically because of increased antibiotic resistance, more patients receiving immunomodulatory therapy, improved antiretroviral therapy, and acquisition of infection in health care settings other than hospitals. METHODS: We conducted retrospective assessment by infectious disease physicians of hospitalized adults with positive blood cultures at 3 academic medical centers. RESULTS: Two thousand two hundred seventy positive blood culture episodes occurred in 1706 patients. Of 2669 isolates, 51% represented true infection, 41% contamination, and 8% unknown clinical significance. Although coagulase-negative staphylococci were most common, only 10% were clinically significant. Among 1225 true bloodstream infections, the most frequent isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens. Intravenous catheters were the most common primary source of bloodstream infection (23% of episodes). Most (81%) bloodstream infections were acquired in the hospital or other health care settings. Crude and attributable in-hospital case-fatality ratios were 20% and 12%, respectively, lower than in previous studies. Increasing age, hypotension, absence of fever, hospital acquisition, extreme white blood cell count values, and the presence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, malignancy, or renal disease were significantly associated with an increased risk of in-hospital attributable death in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of bloodstream infections due to intravenous catheters is continuing to increase. Most episodes were acquired in the hospital or other health care setting. In-hospital case-fatality ratios have decreased compared with previous studies. Several previously identified factors associated with an increased mortality remain statistically significant.
TI  - In vitro ciprofloxacin resistance profiles among gram-negative bacteria isolated  from clinical specimens in a teaching hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the trends of ciprofloxacin resistance pattern in commonly isolated gram-negative bacteria over time in a Saudi Arabian teaching hospital. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out for ciprofloxacin resistance patterns of 10089 isolates of gram-negative bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens submitted to microbiology laboratories at King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU), Alkhobar, Saudi Arabia during the period January 2002 to August 2005. RESULTS: Increase in ciprofloxacin resistance rates in these isolates during the years 2002 and 2005 were as follows: Escherichia coli, 23.85 to 33.1%; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 15.93 to 27.55%; Enterobacter cloacae, 12.32 to 18.05%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 4.16 to 25.64%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 17.05 to 39.53%, Pseudomonas spp., 20.58 to 58.77%; H. influenzae, 00.00% to 11.11% and H. aegyptius, 00.00% to 1.73%. CONCLUSION: There was a gradual increase in resistance from year 2002 to 2005 in most of the gram negative isolates i.e. E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, P. aeruginosa and Pseudomonas spp showing that ciprofloxacin is no more a drug of choice for gram negative infections by these microbes.
TI  - [Analysis of drug resistance and risk factors of Enterobacteriaceae in burn units].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the risk factors of infection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing strains and drug resistance of Enterobacteriaceae that infected burn patients. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on clinical information of 92 patients with Enterobacteriaceae infection in our burn unit from January 2001 to December 2008. The distribution and drug resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, and the detection rate, drug resistance of ESBL-producing strains, and its risk factors of nosocomial infection were analyzed. Data were processed with Chi-square test. RESULTS: One hundred and nine strains of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated, with 38 (34.9%) strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 25 (22.9%) strains of Escherichia coli, 22 (20.2%) strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 13 (11.9%) strains of Proteus mirabilis, and 11 (10.1%) other strains of Enterobacteriaceae. Enterobacteriaceae were moderately or highly resistant to antibiotics except imipenem, resistance rate of which was less than 8.0%. ESBL-producing strains accounted for 44.0% in Escherichia coli, and 77.3% in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Drug-resistance rate of ESBL-producing strains to antibiotics was obviously higher than that of non ESBL-producing strains. Length of hospital stay longer than 20 days, and use of the third-generation cephalosporin longer than 5 days, quinolone antibiotics longer than 7 days, and topical antibiotics longer than 5 days were the risk factors of nosocomial infection caused by ESBL-producing strains, comparing with non ESBL-producing strains, the difference was statistically significant (with chi2 value respectively 5.491, 4.441, 15.186, 4.938, P values all below 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Enterobacteriaceae strains in burn unit of our hospital are highly drug resistant, with high lactamase-producing rates, calling for intense monitor to control the risk factors that predispose the infection of ESBL-producing strains in order to lower the infection rate.
TI  - Prospective study of urinary tract infection surveillance after kidney transplantation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) remains one of the main complications after kidney transplantation and it has serious consequences. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with kidney transplantation were evaluated for UTI at 3-145 days (mean 40.0 days) after surgery.. Forty-two received a graft from a live donor and 10 from a deceased donor. There were 22 female and 30 male patients, aged 11-47 years. Microscopic examinations, leukocyte esterase stick, and urinary culture were performed every third day and weekly after hospitalization. A positive culture was consider when patients presented bacterial counts up to 105 counts. RESULTS: UTI developed in 19/52 (37%) patients at 3-75 days (mean 19.5 days after transplantation. Recurrent infection was observed in 7/52 (13.4%) patients at days 17-65. UTI was more frequent in patients who received deceased grafts compared with live grafts (7/10, 70% vs. 12/42, 28%; p < 0.007). Female patients were more susceptible than male (11/22, 50% vs. 8/22, 36.35%; p < 0.042). Five-year survival rate was 94.5% (49/52 patients). Kidney Graft exit update is 47/52 (90.2%), and there were no significant differences between graft rejection and UTI (p = 0.2518). Isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (31.5%), Candida albicans (21.0%) and Enterococcus spp. (10.5%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae and Micrococcus spp. Secondary infections were produced by (7/19, 36.8%). Enterococcus spp. (57%), E. coli (28%) and Micrococcus spp. (14.2%). Antibiotic resistance was 22% for ciprofloxacin and 33% for ampicillin. Therapeutic alternatives were aztreonam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, netilmicin and fosfomycin. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance of UTI for the first 3 months is a good option for improving quality of life of kidney transplantation patients and the exit of graft function especially for female patients and those receiving deceased grafts. Antibiograms provided a good therapeutic alternative to patients who presented with UTIs after receiving a kidney allograft.
TI  - Seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd in southern Brazil.
AB  - The seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd grown in southern Brazil was analyzed by GC-MS, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. The yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. The results obtained from principal components analysis (PCA) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. The samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. Samples collected during winter contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). In autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). Samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. The observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. The essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, and Enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), indicated that S. aureus, B. subtilis, and Candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest MIC values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/mL, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/mL, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico: special focus on Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Our aim was to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance of Acinetobacter  baumannii and other pathogens at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico over a 3-year period. Clinical isolates of A. baumannii (n = 550), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 250), some Enterobacteriaceae species (n = 500) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 250) collected over a 3-year period were included. Susceptibility tests were performed by the broth microdilution method. 74% of A. baumannii, 40% of Escherichia coli, 34% of P. aeruginosa, 22% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9% of Enterobacter cloacae, and 7% of Serratia sp. were multidrug resistant. 59% of A. baumannii clinical isolates were meropenem-resistant. A. baumannii isolates from the lower respiratory tract were the most susceptible, followed by urine clinical isolates. Species from Enterobacteriaceae showed susceptibility rates higher than 90% to meropenem and tigecycline and Serratia sp. showed the highest susceptibility to the drugs evaluated. For P. aeruginosa, the most potent drug was levofloxacin, followed by meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. With regard to S. aureus, 96% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, followed by tigecycline and minocycline (91% of strains susceptible). The high multidrug resistance observed underscores the need for surveillance of bacterial drug resistance.
TI  - Production of biogenic amines "in vitro" in relation to the growth phase by Enterobacteriaceae species isolated from traditional sausages.
AB  - Histidine, lysine, ornithine and tyrosine decarboxylase activities were tested in 79 strains of Enterobacteriaceae (41 of Hafnia alvei, 17 of Serratia liquefaciens, 5 of Enterobacter cloacae, 4 of Citrobacter braakii, 2 of Proteus vulgaris, 2 of Proteus mirabilis, 2 of Providencia stuartii, 2 of Klebsiella terrigena, 1 of Rahnella aquatilis, 1 of Salmonella arizonae, 1 of Citrobacter youngae and 1 of Escherichia coli) isolated from Botillo, a Spanish traditional sausage. In general, the strains were positive for all four activities, with the exception of two strains of H. alvei and the E. coli strain, which did not display histidine decarboxylase activity. The strains of P. mirabilis and P. stuartii did not exhibit any of the four activities tested. Accumulation of putrescine and cadaverine was studied throughout growth of the 75 strains that displayed ornithine and lysine decarboxylase activities. Biogenic amines were produced particularly in the exponential phase, with maximum accumulation occurring after between 12 to 72 h, depending on the biogenic amine and microbial species considered. Maximum accumulation of putrescine varied greatly between species and within the same species, and ranged from 18 mg/l in the R. aquatilis strain to 7325 mg/l in a H. alvei strain. Maximum accumulation of cadaverine varied less than that of putrescine, and ranged from 30 mg/l in the R. aquatilis strain to 1935 mg/l in a S. liquefaciens strain.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - Common origin of plasmid encoded alpha-hemolysin genes in Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alpha (alpha)-hemolysin is a pore forming cytolysin and serves as a virulence factor in intestinal and extraintestinal pathogenic strains of E. coli. It was suggested that the genes encoding alpha-hemolysin (hlyCABD) which can be found on the chromosome and plasmid, were acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Plasmid-encoded alpha-hly is associated with certain enterotoxigenic (ETEC), shigatoxigenic (STEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) strains. In uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), the alpha-hly genes are located on chromosomal pathogenicity islands. Previous work suggested that plasmid and chromosomally encoded alpha-hly may have evolved independently. This was explored in our study. RESULTS: We have investigated 11 alpha-hly plasmids from animal and human ETEC, STEC and EPEC strains. The size of alpha-hly plasmids ranges from 48-157 kb and eight plasmids are conjugative. The regulatory gene (hlyR) located upstream of the hlyCABD gene operon and an IS911 element located downstream of hlyD are conserved. Chromosomally-encoded alpha-hly operons lack the hlyR and IS911 elements. The DNA sequence of hlyC and hlyA divided the plasmid- and chromosomally-encoded alpha-hemolysins into two clusters. The plasmid-encoded alpha-hly genes could be further divided into three groups based on the insertion of IS1 and IS2 in the regulatory region upstream of the alpha-hly operon. Transcription of the hlyA gene was higher than the housekeeping icdA gene in all strains (rq 4.8 to 143.2). Nucleotide sequence analysis of a chromosomally located alpha-hly determinant in Enterobacter cloacae strain indicates that it originates from an E. coli alpha-hly plasmid. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that plasmids encoding alpha-hly in E. coli descended from a common ancestor independent of the plasmid size and the origin of the strains. Conjugative plasmids could contribute to the spread of the alpha-hly determinant to Enterobacter cloacae. The presence of IS-elements flanking the plasmid-encoded alpha-hly indicate that they might be mobile genetic elements.
TI  - Successful treatment of a chronic facial abscess using a prolonged release antibiotic copolymer in a golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia).
AB  - A 3-yr-old, female captive golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia) developed an abscess initially within the oral cavity that progressed to the cheek. Treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, enrofloxacin, and sulfamethoxizole/trimethoprim resulted in temporary resolution of the abscess. Cultures from the abscess included Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, hemolytic Staphylococcus, and Serratia marcescens. Histopathology was consistent with chronic cellulitis. Ceftazidime mixed with a thermoreversable polymer gel was surgically placed in the wound to provide long-term local antibiotic therapy. This provided complete resolution of infection without the need for additional surgical procedures.
TI  - Detection of Enterobacteriaceae isolates carrying metallo-beta-lactamase - United States, 2010.
AB  - During January-June 2010, three Enterobacteriaceae isolates carrying a newly described resistance mechanism, the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1), were identified from three U.S. states at the CDC antimicrobial susceptibility laboratory. This is the first report of NDM-1 in the United States, and the first report of metallo-beta-lactamase carriage among Enterobacteriaceae in the United States. These isolates, which include an Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae, carry blaNDM-1, which confers resistance to all beta-lactam agents except aztreonam (a monobactam antimicrobial); all three isolates were aztreonam resistant, presumably by a different mechanism. In the United Kingdom, where these organisms are increasingly common, carriage of Enterobacteriaceae containing blaNDM-1 has been closely linked to receipt of medical care in India and Pakistan. All three U.S. isolates were from patients who received recent medical care in India.

TI  - Flavonoid glucuronides and a chromone from the aquatic macrophyte Stratiotes aloides.
AB  - The first phytochemical analysis of the aquatic macrophyte Stratiotes aloides afforded two new flavonoid glucuronides, luteolin 7-O-beta-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (1) and chrysoeriol 7-O-beta-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2), as well as the new 2-(2-hydroxypentyl)-5-carboxy-7-methoxychromone (5) and chrysoeriol 7-O-beta-(6-O-malonyl)glucopyranoside (3), which has been assigned via NMR data for the first time. Additionally, free amino acids such as tryptophan, arginine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine along with choline, cis-aconitic acid, the phenolic glycoside alpha-arbutine, the chlorophyll derivative phaeophorbide a, and the flavonoid glycoside luteolin 7-O-beta-(6-O-malonyl)glucopyranoside (4) were isolated. Despite the low quantities obtained in some cases (between 50-300 microg), the structures of all compounds were unambiguously elucidated by extensive NMR and MS experiments. With a delay of 2 days compound 1 (10 and 50 microM test concentration) strongly inhibited the growth of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas only a moderate growth inhibition of human Patu 8902 carcinoma cells could be observed. Compounds 1 and 2 showed no activities against the bacteria Escherichia coli BW25113, Pseudomonas pudida KT2440, and Enterobacter cloacae subsp. dissolvens.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profiling of four antimicrobials against gram-negative bacteria collected from Shenyang, China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To examine common antimicrobial regimens used in eradicating certain  nosocomial gram-negative pathogens and determine which ones are likely to be the most suitable as empirical choices in Shenyang, China. METHODS: A 5000-subject Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to determine the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for meropenem, imipenem, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected in 2006 and 2007 from Shenyang. RESULTS: Meropenem and imipenem had the highest CFRs against the Enterobacteriaceae (97%-100%), followed by cefepime. No antibiotic simulated regimen achieved optimal CFR against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Piperacillin/tazobactam dosed at 4.5 g q8h achieved the lowest CFR against all bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the carbapenems provide the greatest likelihood of clinical success for the Enterobacteriaceae, and combination therapy might be needed when choosing empirical therapy, especially when A. baumannii or P. aeruginosa are suspected.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of meropenem against main bacterial species isolated from patient blood in 2008].
AB  - We examined the antimicrobial activities of meropenem and other antibiotics against main bacteria isolated from patient blood in Keio university hospital between January and November in 2008. A total of 187 isolates, including 43 Escherichia coli, 23 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Enterobacter cloacae, 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 24 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 50 Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested. Meropenem showed the potent and stable antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria especially compared with our previous testing data. These results suggested that meropenem was first-line antibiotic for serious infections, although over 12 years passed after meropenem was approved in Japan.
TI  - The association between antibiotic use and resistance: the role of secondary antibiotics.
AB  - Using susceptibility rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae over time as markers, we assessed the significance of the change of susceptibility rates to imipenem, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin over time and the relationship to antibiotic use for the period 2000-2006. Antibiotic use-susceptibility relationships were assessed using longitudinal regression analysis. The variables "time" and define daily doses (DDD)/1,000 patient days for the specific drug related to the susceptibility rates of that particular model's dependent variable were considered as the main effects, with significance determined at the 0.05 level. Decreases in susceptibility of the target organisms were common over the period of observation. Decreasing susceptibility trends over time were not statistically associated with the primary drug (e.g., organism susceptibility rate to imipenem with imipenem usage). However, secondary drug use was associated with susceptibility rates (e.g., susceptibility of E. cloacae to cefepime with piperacillin/tazobactam usage). These results suggest that antibiotic use-resistance relationships are influenced by the use of secondary antibiotics. Thus, a resistance problem may not be adequately addressed by simply altering the utilization of the primary antibiotic.
TI  - Detection of a common plasmid carrying blaKPC-2 in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from distinct cities in China.
AB  - Four isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and one isolate of Enterobacter cloacae exhibiting resistance to most beta-lactam antibiotics, including oxyimino-cephalosporins and carbapenems, were obtained from different patients among four hospitals in China. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated that all the K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to two clone patterns. Multilocus sequence typing showed that the four isolates of K. pneumoniae belonged to two sequence types: ST 23 and ST 351. Conjugation studies with Escherichia coli (EC600) resulted in the transfer of reduced carbapenem susceptibility compared with that of the original isolates. Plasmid restriction analysis and hybridization experiment showed that the five isolates of Enterobacteriaceae carried a common 50 kb bla(KPC-2)-encoding plasmid.
TI  - [Clinical assessment of novel ChromID ESBL agar plates for detection of ESBL producers in the family Enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - Extended-Spectrum beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producers in the family Enterobacteriaceae are recognized worldwide as nosocomial pathogens, however it is difficult to screen them in the routine laboratory processing. ChromID ESBL agar newly developed for screening ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was released in Japan in April, 2007. We evaluated the clinical assessment of ChromID ESBL agar in routine microbiology laboratory. The 47 strains investigated were clinical isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae with the MICs of cefpodoxime greater than 2 mug/ml. The 27 ESBL-producers examined were comprising of 19 Escherichia coli, 3 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Citrobacter freundii, 3 Enterobacter cloacae, and 1 S. marcescens (ESBL group) and 20 ESBL non-producers consiating of 5 K. oxytoca, 1 Proteus mirabilis, 1 P. vlugaris, 2 Serratia marcescens, 8 C. freundii, 2 Enterobacter cloacae, and 1 E. aerogenes (non-ESBL group). Characterization of beta-lactamase genes was carried out by use of polymerase chain reaction. As the results, the sensitivity and the specificity of ChromID ESBL agar plates after incubation for 18 hours was 100% and 20%, respectively. It should be noted that the values of specificity was extremely low compared with those of the sensitivity. These findings clearly suggested that in cases of utilizing ChromID ESBL agar plates, it should be important to consider its characteristic properties, as even the ESBL-non-producers could grow on these media only when they were resistant to CPDX.
TI  - Microbiological profile and antimicrobial susceptibility in surgical site infections following hollow viscus injury.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess the microbiological profile, antimicrobial susceptibility, and adequacy of the empiric antibiotic therapy in surgical site infections (SSI) following traumatic hollow viscus injury (HVI). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients admitted with an HVI from March 2003 to July 2009. SSI was defined as a wound infection or intra-abdominal collection confirmed by positive cultures and requiring percutaneous or surgical drainage. RESULTS: A total of 91 of 667 (13.6%) patients with an HVI developed an SSI confirmed by positive culture. Mean age was 33.0 +/- 14.1 years, mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 17.7 +/- 9.6, 91.2% were male, and 80.2% had sustained penetrating injuries. The SSI consisted of 65 intra-abdominal collections and 26 wound infections requiring intervention. The most commonly isolated species in the presence of a colonic injury was Escherichia coli (64.7%), Enterococcus spp. (41.2%), and Bacteroides (29.4%), and in the absence of a colonic perforation, Enterococcus spp. and Enterobacter cloacae (both 38.9%). Susceptibility rates of E. coli and E. cloacae, respectively, were 38% and 8% for ampicillin/sulbactam, 82% and 4% for cefazolin, 96% and 92% for cefoxitin, with both 92% to piperacillin/tazobactam, and 100% to ertapenem. The initial empirical antibiotic therapy adequately targeted the pathogens in 51.6% of patients who developed an SSI. CONCLUSION: The distribution of the microorganisms isolated from SSIs differed significantly according to whether or not a colonic injury was present. Empiric antibiotic treatment was inadequate in upwards of 50% of patients who developed an SSI. Further investigation is warranted to determine the optimal empiric antibiotic regimen for reducing the rate of postoperative SSI.
TI  - A novel polymyxin derivative that lacks the fatty acid tail and carries only three positive charges has strong synergism with agents excluded by the intact outer membrane.
AB  - Polymyxins are cationic lipopeptides (five cationic charges) and the last resort  for the treatment of serious Gram-negative infections caused by multiresistant strains. NAB741 has a cyclic peptide portion identical to that of polymyxin B but carries in the linear peptide portion a threonyl-D-serinyl residue (no cationic charges) instead of the diaminobutyryl-threonyl-diaminobutyryl residue (two cationic charges). At the N terminus of the peptide, NAB741 carries an acetyl group instead of a mixture of methyl octanoyl and methyl heptanoyl residues. NAB741 sensitized Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Acinetobacter baumannii to antibiotics against which the intact outer membrane is an effective permeability barrier. When tested by using Etest strips on plates containing increasing concentrations of NAB741, the fractional inhibition concentration index (FICI) of the combination of NAB741 with rifampin ranged from <or=0.111 to 0.158 and that with clarithromycin from <or=0.094 to 0.292. When tested by the checkerboard method, the corresponding FICI values against E. coli ATCC 25922 were <or=0.141 to <or=0.155 with rifampin and 0.094 with clarithromycin. In addition, at 4 microg/ml, NAB741 decreased the MICs of azithromycin, mupirocin, fusidic acid, and vancomycin for E. coli strains and E. cloacae by factors ranging from 8 to 200. A sister peptide, NAB752, carrying a threonyl-aminobutyryl residue as the linear peptide portion, was inactive. Furthermore, NAB741 sensitized E. coli to the bactericidal activity of fresh guinea pig serum. The renal clearance of NAB741 was approximately 400-fold, 16-fold, and 8-fold higher than those measured for colistin, NAB7061, and NAB739, respectively.
TI  - Tipsitis: incidence and outcome-a single centre experience.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infection of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) called 'Tipsitis' has been reported but appears unusual. We report here our experience of patients who were diagnosed to have Tipsitis at our centre. METHODS: Retrospective single centre study. Patients identified from a dedicated data base. Patients with TIPSS with otherwise unexplained sustained bacteraemia were included. RESULTS: Over 14 years of age, of 785 patients with TIPSS, eight (1%) had Tipsitis. Indication for TIPSS: variceal bleed, seven; refractory ascites, one. Child-Pugh score: 8.3 (1.4). Seven patients had overlapping stents in situ. Duration to Tipsitis: 21.6 (7.1) months. At diagnosis, TIPSS was occluded in four and patent in three. Tipsitis developed within 2 weeks of shunt interventions in two patients and was owing to development of bilio-venous fistula in one. The organisms identified were: Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcusfaecium and Staphylococcus aureus. Median duration of antibiotic therapy: 3 (0.3-3) months. Symptoms initially resolved in all but one. Symptoms recurred in three and this was related to premature cessation of antibiotics in two. Five patients died at a median 1.3 (0.3 to 33) months after Tipsitis with Tipsitis contributing to death in three. CONCLUSION: Tipsitis is a rare but serious problem. It should be suspected in patients with TIPSS and unexplained sustained bacteraemia. Shunt interventions, where TIPSS is inserted for variceal bleed, and use of overlapping shunts at TIPSS insertion may be risk factors for its development. Prolonged antibiotics are usually required but Tipsitis may recur despite apparently successful treatment.
TI  - [In vitro activities of Odorrana grahami antimicrobial peptides from skin against 5 pathogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of 4 Odorrana grahami antimicrobial peptides from skin against 5 pathogenic bacteria, include 2 wild strains and 7 resistant strains. METHODS: Broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility test was used for bacteria that growed aerobically. RESULTS: The 4 Odorrana grahami antimicrobial peptides were basically in vitro efficient agents for inhibition against to methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRSCN, 85460), wild Staphylococcus aureus (24157), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP, 84688 and 91452), class I beta-lactamase Enterobacter cloacae (AmpC, 85439 and 93543), wild Escherichia coli (84492), extended-spectrum beta-lactamases Escherichia coli (ESBL, 84492), inhabitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamase Escherichia coli (IRT, 85580). CONCLUSION: The 4 Odorrana grahami antimicrobial peptides from skin have broad spectrum antimicrobial activity; especially have in vitro activity to resistant strains. So it is hopeful to be developed as the antimicrobial agent as well as the disinfectant and the antiseptic.
TI  - The fungal product terreic acid is a covalent inhibitor of the bacterial cell wall biosynthetic enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase (MurA) .
AB  - Terreic acid is a metabolite with antibiotic properties produced by the fungus Aspergillus terreus. We found that terreic acid is a covalent inhibitor of the bacterial cell wall biosynthetic enzyme MurA from Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli in vitro. The crystal structure of the MurA dead-end complex with terreic acid revealed that the quinine ring is covalently attached to the thiol group of Cys115, the molecular target of the antibiotic fosfomycin. Kinetic characterization established that the inactivation requires the presence of substrate UNAG (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine), proceeding with an inactivation rate constant k(inact) of 130 M(-1) s(-1). Although the mechanisms of inactivation are similar, fosfomycin is approximately 50 times more potent than terreic acid, and the structural consequences of covalent modification by these two inhibitors are fundamentally different. The MurA-fosfomycin complex exists in the closed enzyme conformation, with the Cys115-fosfomycin adduct buried in the active site. In contrast, the dead-end complex with terreic acid is open, is free of UNAG, and has the Cys115-terreic acid adduct solvent-exposed. It appears that terreic acid reacts with Cys115 in the closed, binary state of the enzyme, but that the resulting Cys115-terreic acid adduct imposes steric clashes in the active site. As a consequence, the loop containing Cys115 rearranges, the enzyme opens, and UNAG is released. The differential kinetic and structural characteristics of MurA inactivation by terreic acid and fosfomycin reflect the importance of noncovalent binding potential, even for covalent inhibitors, in ensuring inactivation efficiency and specificity.
TI  - [Analysis and clinical implication of upper urinary tract stone's bacterial spectrum].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the pathogenic bacterial's distribution and the drug resistance in the upper urinary tract stones, and to provide the information for choosing suitable antibiotics. METHODS: Stone samples were taken for culture and for drug sensitivity test in 146 patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy between April 2007 and October 2008, and the results were analyzed. RESULTS: Pathogens presented in 72 (49.3%) patients. There were 70 (86.4%) Gram-negative bacteria strains. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae were the predominant bacteria, accounted for 30.9%(25 strains), 23.5% (19 strains) and 12.3% (10 strains), respectively. There were 10 (12.3%) Gram-positive bacteria strains, the predominant bacteria was Staphylococcus epidermidis (6 strains), accounting for 7.4%. And there was 1 fungi strain (1.2%). Resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam (88.7%), ceftriaxone (81.3%) and ciprofloxacin (67.5%) was most commonly found in pathogen, and the rate of resistance to amikacin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were 8.6%, 10.0%, 10.0%, respectively. Erythromycylamine, teicoplanin, SMZ-TMP, nitrofurantoin were sensitive to Gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial's distribution of upper urinary tract stones are multiple, and the majority pathogen is Gram-negative bacteria. A big variant resistance is found among different bacterium. The suitable antibiotics should be chosen according to the different bacterium in the patients who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Alpinia galanga (L) Willd crude extracts.
AB  - Methanol, acetone and diethyl ether extracts of Alpinia galanga have been evaluated against pathogens viz. Bacillus subtilis MTCC 2391, Enterobacter aerogene, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli MTCC 1563, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 6642, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus epidermis using Agar well diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of all the extracts were determined using the macrodilution method. Methanol extracts have shown excellent activity towards all the pathogens with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.04-1.28 mg/ml and 0.08-2.56 mg/ml, respectively. The GC-MS analysis of methanol extracts have yielded compounds like 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (59.9%), benzyl alcohol (57.6%), 1,8 cineole (15.65%), methylcinnamate (9.4%), 3-phenyl-2-butanone (8.5%) and 1,2 benzenedicarboxylic acid (8.9%), which could be responsible for its broad spectrum activity. So, A. galanga can be quite resourceful for the development of new generation drugs.
TI  - Metallo-beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae from routine samples in an Italian tertiary-care hospital and long-term care facilities during 2008.
AB  - The emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae is a serious public health concern. Producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (LTCF) residents around Bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. All routine Enterobacteriaceae isolates from a Bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for MBLs, with case details reviewed for the source patients. In total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 Escherichia coli, six Klebsiella pneumoniae, four Klebsiella oxytoca, four Citrobacter freundii, two Enterobacter cloacae and two Morganella morganii, as well as single Citrobacter amalonaticus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Providencia stuartii and Proteus mirabilis isolates. All were PCR-positive for bla(VIM) and 25 were PCR-positive for qnrS; 19 non-K. pneumoniae had bla(SHV) and one had bla(CTX-M-group1); 13 were from 12 LTCF residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. All these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or LTCF stay; only seven had infections due to the MBL producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. Five patients had more than one MBL-producing organism. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related E. coli, whereas pairs of K. pneumoniae and C. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity. Transformants prepared from two isolates were shown to be PCR-positive for bla(VIM), qnrS and bla(SHV); their plasmids gave similar restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and bla(VIM-1), qnrS1 and bla(SHV-12) were detected by sequencing.
TI  - Extended Spectrum Beta-lactamase Detection in Gram-negative Bacilli of Nosocomial Origin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to third generation cephalosporins by acquisition and expression of extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) enzymes among gram-negative bacilli is on a rise. The presence of ESBL producing organisms significantly affects the course and outcome of an infection and poses a challenge to infection management worldwide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the period from June 2007 to 2008, we collected 1489 samples from patients suspected of nosocomial infection. The isolates were identified based on colony morphology and biochemical reaction. Gram negative bacilli resistant to third generation cephalosporins were tested for ESBL by double disc synergy test (DDST- a screening test)and then phenotypic confirmatory test. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by modified Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. RESULTS: From the sample of 238 gram-negative bacilli, we isolated Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii and Enterobacter cloacae. Following both methods, 34% isolates were ESBL-positive. The ESBL producing isolates were significantly resistant (p < 0.01) to ampicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin as compared to non-ESBL producers. Multidrug resistance was significantly (p < 0.01) higher (69.14%) in ESBL positive isolates than non-ESBL isolates (21.66%). CONCLUSION: High prevalence of ESBL in our hospital cannot be ignored. ESBL producers can be detected by DDST and phenotypic confirmatory test with equal efficacy. The sensitivity of screening test improved with the use of more than one antibiotic and addition of one or two antibiotics would not increase cost and labor. We recommend DDST using multiple antibiotics in all microbiology units as a routine screening test.
TI  - Novel depsides as potential anti-inflammatory agents with potent inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli-induced interleukin-8 production.
AB  - Sixteen novel depsides were synthesized for the first time. Their chemical structures were clearly determined by (1)H NMR, ESI mass spectra, and elemental analyses. All the compounds were assayed for antibacterial activities against three Gram-positive bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, and Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790) and three Gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 13525, and Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047) by the MTT method. Compound 2-(2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl)phenyl 5-bromonicotinate (5) exhibited significant antibacterial activities against E. coli ATCC 35218 with an MIC of 0.78 microg/mL, which was superior to the positive control kanamycin B. In addition, compound 5 showed potent inhibitory activity against E. coli-induced interleukin-8 production.
TI  - Design, synthesis, and pharmacological investigation of iodined salicylimines, new prototypes of antimicrobial drug candidates.
AB  - A series of 3,5-diiodo-salicylalidene Schiff bases (compounds 1-35) has been synthesized and tested for antimicrobial activity. The compounds were assayed for antibacterial activities by the MTT method. Some of the compounds inhibit the growth of a broad range of bacteria including the species of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae. Among them, compounds 2-[(4-chloro-phenylimino)methyl]-4,6-diiodo-phenol 11 and 2,4-diiodo-6-[(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethylimino)methyl]phenol 19 showed the most potent antibacterial activity with MIC of 3.1, 12.9, 3.3, 6.5, 12.9, 3.3 and 3.2, 12.8, 3.2, 12.8, 12.8, 3.2 muM against B. subtilis, S. aureus, S. faecalis, P. aeruginosa, E. Coli, and E. cloacae, respectively.
TI  - Comparison of the efficacy of Rose Bengal and erythrosin in photodynamic therapy  against Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the photosensitizers Rose Bengal and erythrosin combined with a light-emitting diode (LED) on Enterobacteriaceae. Twelve Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from the oral cavities of patients undergoing prolonged antibiotic therapy, including three Escherichia coli, three Enterobacter cloacae, three Klebsiella oxytoca and three Klebsiella pneumoniae, were studied. An Enterobacteriaceae suspension (10(6) cells/ml) was prepared from each clinical strain isolated from the human oral cavity and subjected to the following treatments: LED and Rose Bengal, LED and erythrosin, LED and physiological solution, and physiological solution only as control. A blue LED unit (460 nm), and Rose Bengal and erythrosin at a concentration of 50 micromol/l were used. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 h, the number of colony-forming units (CFU) was calculated and subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Enterobacterial strains were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with Rose Bengal. There was a reduction of approximately 7.14 log10 for Enterobacter cloacae, 7.73 log10 for Escherichia coli, 6.76 log10 for Klebsiella pneumoniae and 7.21 log10 for Klebsiella oxytoca. However, photodynamic therapy using erythrosin did not reduce the numbers of CFUs per milliliter compared to the control group. The use of the LED alone had no toxic effect on the strain tested. The Enterobacteriaceae strains studied were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with Rose Bengal.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance patterns in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria causing septicemia in newborns in Leon, Nicaragua: correlation with environmental samples.
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify the bacteria causing neonatal septicemia in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Leon, Nicaragua and its relation with bacteria isolated from the environment at the NICU. Our data showed that 74% (34/46) of the bacteria related to newborns with septicemia were Gram-negative and highly resistant to beta-lactams (>85%) and aminoglycosides (80%), leading to treatment failure in 10 neonates with fatal outcome. Although, the prevalence of Gram-positive bacteria (26%) was lower than Gram-negative bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis was related to the death of three newborns. No clonal similarity was found among Enterobacter cloacae , Escherichia coli and Serratia liquefaciens isolated from the neonates with septicemia and the NICU environment. However, in order to improve the outcome for neonates with septicemia, infection control practices and appropriate empirical therapy should be considered to reduce the high prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria isolated from neonates with septicemia (80%) and from the NICU environment (34%).
TI  - Mechanisms of carbapenem resistance among a collection of Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates in a Texas city.
AB  - Fourteen Enterobacteriaceae isolates with ertapenem MIC >2 mg/mL were analyzed to identify mechanisms of resistance. All isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase or AmpC beta-lactamase with variable, but decreased, expression of outer membrane proteins. One Enterobacter cloacae produced derepressed AmpC beta-lactamase, 1 Escherichia coli expressed plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase, and 1 E. cloacae produced a carbapenemase.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (DFI). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in DFI, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with 95% of MICs < or =2 microg/mL for the entire collection. The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for DFI, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. As reported previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the Proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other Gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with DFIs.
TI  - Efflux pumps are involved in the defense of Gram-negative bacteria against the natural products isobavachalcone and diospyrone.
AB  - The activities of two naturally occurring compounds, isobavachalcone and diospyrone, against documented strains and multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacterial isolates were evaluated. The results indicated that the two compounds exhibited intrinsic antibacterial activity against several Gram-negative bacteria, and their activities were significantly improved in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor (MIC values decreased to below 10 microg/ml). In addition, the activities of isobavachalcone and diospyrone against various strains exhibiting deletions of the major efflux pump components (AcrAB, TolC) were significantly increased. The overall results indicate that isobavachalcone and diospyrone could be candidates for the development of new drugs against MDR strains and that their use in combination with efflux pump inhibitors reinforces their activity.
TI  - Influencing factors in the occurrence of injured coliforms in the drinking water  distribution system in the city of La Plata, Argentina.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the influencing factors in the occurrence of coliforms in the drinking water in La Plata (Argentina) from June 1999 to June 2001. A total of 180 samples were collected from Rio de La Plata (102 samples) and Puelche Aquifer (78 samples); 45 samples were collected for each of the four seasons. The membrane filter procedure was used for isolating bacteria, and each sample was tested for chlorine and pH. The highest percentage of samples positive for coliforms in the two tested media was obtained in summer while the highest percentage of negative samples was obtained in winter. No Escherichia coli was isolated. The percentage of injured coliforms fluctuated between 70 and 100%. The most frequently isolated bacteria was Enterobacter cloacae in summer, Enterobacter agglomerans in autumn and Klebsiella oxytoca in winter and spring. Significant correlations were observed between coliforms and the distance from the initial treatment point, and with the level of free chlorine. We conclude that drinking water contamination in La Plata occurs in the distribution system due to increased temperatures and reduced disinfectant levels, which result in bacterial regrowth.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for hospital acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 819 baseline pathogens isolated from 383 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trial investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 27 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in HAP, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains (90% of MICs </=2 microg/mL for the entire collection). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus complex, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Enterobacter cloacae. As reported previously, a few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro, expanded, broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with with hospital acquired pneumonia infections.
TI  - [Microbiologic study on the pathogens isolated from wound culture among orthopaedic patients after Wenchuan earthquake].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the bacterial characteristic of orthopedic open wounds injured in Wenchuan earthquake and their drug-resistant pattern for reasonable application of antibiotics. METHODS: A total of 340 secretion specimens isolated from 148 cases of orthopedic open wounds of earthquake victims were analyzed. Among the patients, 71 patients were male and 77 patients were female, ranging in age from 2 to 82 years, with an average of 40.4 years. Thirty-seven patients were detained under the ground ranged from 5 min to 102 h. The 340 specimens of exudation in the wound were collected for bacterial culture and drug sensitivity tests. RESULTS: The infection rate of 148 cases was 66.2 percent. Two hundred and fifty-seven pathogens were isolated from 340 secretion specimen, including gram-negative bacteria accounted for 77.8%, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 20.6%. The most frequent pathogens isolated from secretion culture in Wenchuan earthquake survivors were Escherichia coli (16.3%), Acinetobacter baumannii (16.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5%) and Enterobacter cloacae (8.6%). CONCLUSION: The drug sensitivity test of exudation as well as exact application of antibiotics should be highly payed attention to by doctors in order to reduce the occurrence of bacterial resistance.
TI  - Microbiological study of pathogenic bacteria isolated from paediatric wound infections following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.
AB  - On 12 May 2008, the Wenchuan earthquake struck in Sichuan, China. Within 1 month  after the earthquake, 98 injured children were admitted to the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. According to clinical manifestations, 50 children were diagnosed with wound infections. Wound secretions were cultured for bacteria. Pathogen distribution and drug resistance were analyzed. A total of 99 pathogens were isolated; 16 (16%) were Gram-positive bacteria and 81 (82%) were Gram-negative bacteria. The distribution of pathogens isolated within 1 month after the earthquake was different to the distribution of pathogens in 546 general hospitalized cases in the y before the earthquake. The pathogens most frequently isolated 1 month after the earthquake were Acinetobacter baumannii (27%), Enterobacter cloacae (18%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%). The pathogens most frequently isolated in the y prior to the earthquake were Escherichia coli (27%), Staphylococcus aureus (23%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (9%). The rate of isolated drug-resistant bacteria was higher in the earthquake cases than in the general hospitalized cases. In the cases injured in the earthquake, the rates of isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. cloacae, E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were higher than in the cases from before the earthquake. Multidrug-resistant and pandrug-resistant A. baumannii were isolated at a higher rate in cases after the earthquake than in those before the earthquake. These changes in the spectrum of pathogens and in the drug resistance of the pathogens isolated following an earthquake will provide the basis for emergency treatment after earthquakes.
TI  - [Investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  - Sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. Previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. A total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. The antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for 10 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 Escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 Proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 Proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 Enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 Enterobacter aerogenes strains. The MIC values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 32 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, 32 microg/ml for E. coli ATCC 25922 and > 128 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Sertralin has showed antibacterial activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that MIC values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Resistance development profiling of piperacillin in combination with the novel {beta}-lactamase inhibitor BLI-489.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate development of resistance to the piperacillin/BLI-489 combination. METHODS: BLI-489 was used at a constant concentration of 4 mg/L. Spontaneous mutation frequency was measured on piperacillin/BLI-489-containing agar plates. Five beta-lactamase-producing strains were exposed to a serial dilution of piperacillin/BLI-489, and the highest concentration allowing growth was used to inoculate subsequent serial passage for 10 days. Mutation stability was monitored in drug-free medium for 10 days. RESULTS: Escherichia coli (OXA-3, OXA-7, ACT-1, SHV-1 or none), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (CTX-M-5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (SHV-1 and SHV-5) and Enterobacter cloacae (AmpC) had a spontaneous mutation frequency of < or =1.0 x 10(-9). Two AmpC-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains had a mutation frequency of 6.52 x 10(-6) and 1.0 x 10(-7); a beta-lactamase-negative P. aeruginosa strain had a mutation frequency of 2.68 x 10(-8). The mutant prevention concentration (MPC) was < or =32 mg/L. During serial passages, the MIC increased 64- and 128-fold for S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (CTX-M-5) and E. cloacae (AmpC), respectively, to > or =512 mg/L. The MIC reverted to < or =64 mg/L after serial passages in drug-free medium. The MICs increased only 4-fold for K. pneumoniae (SHV-1 and SHV-5), E. coli (OXA-3) and E. coli (SHV-1). CONCLUSIONS: Piperacillin/BLI-489 demonstrated a low probability of spontaneous resistance development in vitro for all of the strains tested with the exception of P. aeruginosa. The MPC value for all strains was < or =32 mg/L. Resistance developed during serial passage for two of the five strains tested; however, this resistance phenotype was unstable as MIC values reverted to < or =64 mg/L after propagation in drug-free medium.
TI  - Dispersal of carbapenemase blaVIM-1 gene associated with different Tn402 variants, mercury transposons, and conjugative plasmids in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The emergence of bla(VIM-1) within four different genetic platforms from distinct Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in an area with a low prevalence of metallo-beta-lactamase producers is reported. Forty-three VIM-1-producing isolates (including 19 Enterobacter cloacae, 2 Escherichia coli, and 2 P. aeruginosa isolates, 18 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate, and 2 Klebsiella oxytoca isolate) recovered from 2005 to 2007 and corresponding to 15 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types were studied. The Enterobacteriaceae isolates corresponded to a hospital outbreak, and the P. aeruginosa isolates were sporadically recovered. The genetic context of the integrons carrying bla(VIM-1) (arbitrarily designated types A, B, C, and D) was characterized by PCR mapping based on known Tn402 and mercury transposons and further sequencing. Among Enterobacteriaceae isolates, bla(VIM-1) was part of integrons located either in an In2-Tn402 element linked to Tn21 (type A; In110-bla(VIM-1)-aacA4-aadA1) or in a Tn402 transposon lacking the whole tni module [type B; In113-bla(VIM-1)-aacA4-dhfrII (also called dfrB1)-aadA1-catB2] and the transposon was associated with an IncHI2 or IncI1 plasmid, respectively. Among P. aeruginosa isolates, bla(VIM-1) was part of a new gene cassette array located in a defective Tn402 transposon carrying either tniBDelta3 and tniA (type C; bla(VIM-1)-aadA1) or tniC and DeltatniQ (type D; bla(VIM-1)-aadB), and both Tn402 variants were associated with conjugative plasmids of 30 kb. The dissemination of bla(VIM-1) was associated with different genetic structures and bacterial hosts, depicting a complex emergence and evolutionary network scenario in our facility, Ramon y Cajal University Hospital, Madrid, Spain. Knowledge of the complex epidemiology of bla(VIM-1) is necessary to control this emerging threat.
TI  - [Septic pylephlebitis associated with Enterobacter cloacae septicemia].
AB  - Septic pylephlebitis or purulent thrombosis of the portal venous system generally results from a progressive extension of suppurated thrombophlebitis, secondary to an intrabdominal infection. Germs most often found are Escherichia coli and Streptococcus, isolation of Enterobacter cloacae is unusual. We report a particular observation of septic pylephlebitis associated with E. cloacae bacteremia, without biliary, digestive or pancreatic lesion on the CT-scan. The antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the isolated germ and the negative epidemiologic investigation pled in favour of community acquired infection. The infection resolved with antibiotics and anticoagulation, followed by total repermeation of the portal system.
TI  - [Evolution of Enterobacteriaceae resistance to antibiotics in Reunion Island: emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases].
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The antibiotic resistance of enterobacteriacae knows a worldwide worrying evolution with an increase of the extended spectrum betalactamases (ESBL) that spread into the community. Few publications describe this problem in the Indian Ocean area. The aim of this study is first to identify in Felix Guyon Hospital (Reunion Island) the emergent antibiotics resistance for enterobacteriaceae between 1997/1998 and 2006/2007 periods, at second, to update the prophylactic and therapeutic measures for handling the risk linked to multiresistant enterobacteriaceae in our hospital and third, to assess the risk in Reunion Island and especially at the community level. METHODS: The antibiotic susceptibility of 7814 enterobacteriaceae strains collected among patients, during 1997/1998 and 2006/2007 periods, were analysed as well as the consumption of the third generation cephalosporins, imipenem and fluoroquinolones. RESULTS: Within a span of time of 10 years, an important increase (+57 %) of the resistance prevalence of enterobacteriaceae is observed. The resistance by the ESBL production mechanism is predominant especially for Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli. An important use of broad spectrum antibiotics is correlated with this resistance evolution. CONCLUSION: The emergence of ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae in our hospital is impairing both therapeutic and health care. It requires a much better control of antibiotics prescriptions and therefore, an important multidisciplinary implication. A proof molecular analysis would allow to evaluate the risk more precisely, especially at the community level.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents--special reference to bacteria isolated between April 2007 and March 2008].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2007 to March 2008 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 707 strains including 24 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 181 (79.0%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. Three hundred and ninety-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 288 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Parvimonas micra was the highest from primary infections, followed by Streptococcus constellatus and Gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, Anaerococcus prevotii was most predominantly isolated. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of both Bacteroides fragilis and Bilophila wadsworthia were the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Campylobacter gracilis, and from postoperative infections, B. thetaiotaomicron was most predominately isolated, followed by B. fragilis, Bacteroides caccae and B. wadsworthia in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa. There were nine strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococci which show higher MIC against teicoplanin more than 4 gg/mL, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-MRSA antibiotics. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. METHODOLOGY: The antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 29751, E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. RESULTS: The crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). The most active plant extracts were from Dortenia picta and Bridelia micrantha (MIC: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from B. micrantha, Mallotus oppositifolius, Garcinia lucida, Garcinia. kola, Campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and C. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-positive cocci (MIC: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). CONCLUSION: Of the 17 plant extracts studied, seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. The stem bark of B. micrantha and the leaves of D. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative bacilli. This study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.
TI  - [Evolution of third-generation cephalosporin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae from 2000 to 2008 in a Perpignan hospital].
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the evolution of Enterobacteriaceae resistance to third generation cephalosporin (3CG) from 2000 to 2008 at Perpignan hospital. Were observed: the percentage of strains isolated from short stay wards, intensive care unit and medium and long-term care facility. The percentage of strains isolated from: urine, suppuration, tracheal aspiration, and blood have been evaluated. The proportion of Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains among the Enterobacteriaceae strains intermediate (I) or resistant (R) to 3GC was also evaluated.The number of Enterobacteriaceae intermediated (I) or resistant (R) to 3GC increased (402 %).The distribution of species I or R to 3GC has changed, decrease of Klebsielle pneumoniae and Enterobacter aeorogenes species, Escherichia.coli and Enterobacter cloacae became dominant in 2008. We noted the change of isolated species distribution, urines represent the main source of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae (MRE), 72 % of strains. The profile of patients colonised or infected by MRE has changed. Patients mainly infected with hospital acquirred MRE changed to MRE colonised patients carrying the strain into the hospital. The association of fluorinated quinolone resistance and Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase Enterobacteriaceae represented 51 % in 2000, became stable at 73 % from 2002. The association of fluorinated quinolone resistance and high-level Enterobacteriaceae cephalosporinase has increased from 21 % in 2000 to be stable at 50 % since 2006. The mesures to contain the spread of MRE strains remained inefficient because of outpatients circulation, multiresistant E. coli being community species.
TI  - Bacterial sepsis after prostate biopsy--a new perspective.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of sepsis following transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy at our center. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a group of 24 men who presented with urosepsis after undergoing TRUS biopsy at our center. RESULTS: Of the 24 men, 22 were given prophylactic ciprofloxacin. The median time to presentation of sepsis was 1 day after biopsy. The median length of hospitalization was 4 days. Escherichia coli was the most frequent cause of urosepsis (67%). Variable resistance patterns were observed. Enterobacter cloacae and Streptococcus viridans were isolated in 2 cases. No bacteria were isolated in 6 cases. Two patients who received extensive antibiotic prophylaxis still developed urosepsis. Treatment of patients infected with multiresistant anaerobic strains using metronidazole among others, proved successful. High sensitivities toward cefazolin, gentamicin, and tobramycin were observed. The number of cases reported was likely an underestimation, because some patients may have reported to other hospitals and were not captured by this study. In addition, some patients may not have developed infection and urosepsis despite harboring ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic ciprofloxacin is still a useful option for the prevention of urosepsis after TRUS biopsy, as the incidence is relatively low. For the patient who develops urosepsis after TRUS biopsy, ciprofloxacin resistance needs to be suspected and the treatment regime should be tailored to the resistance profiles of the local region, the patient's medical history, and the culture and sensitivity reports.
TI  - Kinetic and theoretical study of the chalcones as inhibitors of beta-lactamase enzyme.
AB  - Staphyloccoccus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and more bacteria have shown resistance to antibiotics in Colombia, therefore, resistance to antibiotics is a problem that is on increase in Colombia. The resistance mechanism to penicillin antibiotics in these bacteria is the expression of beta-Lactamase enzyme. In order to use the penicillin antibiotics which are still effective against them, we had evaluated 10 chalcones as inhibitors of this enzyme. The most active chalcone showed K(m') = 406.7 microM higher than clavulanic acid that showed K(m') = 211.9 microM at 37 degrees C during 10 h, and using amoxycillin as substrate. The chalcones were better competitive inhibitors because of they allowed the hydrolysis of smaller quantity of amoxycillin than the clavulanic acid, the most active chalcone showed K(cat)/K(M) = 1.398 (minM)(-1) and the clavulanic acid showed K(cat)/K(M) = 2.674 (minM)(-1). The molecular modelling of the Enzyme-chalcones complexes showed that the chalcones with electron-donating groups on ortho, meta position of A ring favour the interaction with the residues Threonine-319, Lysine-67, Serine-64 and Tyrosine-150 of the active site of the enzyme, because of the number and strong of Hydrogen bonds of the chalcones in the active site of the enzyme increase, and therefore the affinity of the chalcones increases too. The electron-donating groups in the chalcones contribute to their inductive effect improving the interaction with the active site of the enzyme because of rising of electrostatic attraction between them.
TI  - Performance of VITEK-2 Compact and overnight MicroScan panels for direct identification and susceptibility testing of Gram-negative bacilli from positive FAN BacT/ALERT blood culture bottles.
AB  - We describe the reliability of the VITEK-2 Compact and overnight MicroScan panels for direct identification and susceptibility testing from the BacT/ALERT blood culture system when using FAN (FA and FN) bottles. A simple procedure, in two centrifugation steps, was designed to remove the charcoal particles present in FA and FN bottles. A total of 113 positive blood cultures showing Gram-negative rods were investigated. Enterobacteriaceae were isolated in 104 cases, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in nine. The MicroScan system correctly identified 106 (93.8%) of the 113 isolates. The seven identificaction errors included P. aeruginosa (three), Enterobacter cloacae (one), Escherichia coli (one), Klebsiella oxytoca (one), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (one). The VITEK-2 system correctly identified 109 (96.5%) of the 113 samples obtained directly from the blood culture bottles. The four unidentified isolates were Enterobacter cloacae (two), Escherichia coli (one), and P. aeruginosa (one). MicroScan yielded 4/779 (0.5%) very major errors and 28/2825 (0.9%) minor errors. VITEK-2 yielded 2/550 (0.36%) very major errors, 1/1718 (0.05%) major error, and 32/2373 (1.3%) minor errors. Both systems provided excellent identification (correlation of >90%) and susceptibility (correlation of >98%) results. The average times required to obtain identification and susceptibility results using the direct test applied to the VITEK-2 Compact system were 4.57 +/- 1.37 h and 6.52 +/- 1.64 h, respectively. The VITEK-2 compact system provided results on the same day that the blood culture was found to be positive.
TI  - Nosocomial transmission of highly resistant microorganisms on a spinal cord rehabilitation ward.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanism of nosocomial transmission of highly resistant microorganisms (HRMOs). DESIGN: A prospective observational study. SETTING: A spinal cord ward of a rehabilitation center. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to the spinal cord rehabilitation ward. OUTCOME MEASURES: HRMOs present in urine and feces. HRMOs, Enterobacteriaceae: (1) that produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), (2) that were resistant to carbapenems, (3) that fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species), or other Enterobacteriaceae species that were resistant to 2 of 3 of the following types of antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, cotrimoxazole). METHODS: Bacterial growth, identification and sensitivity were tested in urine cultures of 46 patients and faeces cultures of 15 patients. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, reason and date of admission, room number, method of catheterization (suprapubic, clean intermittent catheterization or indwelling Foley catheter) and antibiotic use. RESULTS: Nine different HRMOs (7 E. coli, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, and 1 Citrobacter koseri) were isolated in urine samples from 15 patients. E. coli resistant to gentamicin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, and ciprofloxacin were isolated from 8 patients during the study (cluster 1). One strain of multiresistant E coli found before the start of the study was not found during the study period (cluster 2). E coli strains producing an ESBL and resistant to tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, and ciprofloxacin were isolated from urine samples of 3 patients (cluster 3). Ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli were present in feces of 3 patients (2 in cluster 1). Catheterization was found to be significantly more prevalent in patients with HRMOs. Most of the patients in cluster 1 were treated with antibiotics before the first isolation of the strain. CONCLUSIONS: HRMOs from urine samples were strongly correlated with the use of catheterization. A close correlation was found between prior use of antibiotics and colonization of the urinary tract on the level of the individual patient, which has been rarely described in the literature.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a public hospital in Brazil.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in enterobacteria are recognized worldwide as a great hospital problem. In this study, 127 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated in one year from inpatients and outpatients at a public teaching hospital at Sao Paulo, Brazil, were submitted to analysis by PCR with specific primers for bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M genes. From the 127 isolates, 96 (75.6%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 (9.3%) Escherichia coli, 8 (6.2%) Morganella morganii, 3 (2.3%) Proteus mirabilis, 2 (1.6%) Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 (1.6%) Providencia rettgeri, 2 (1.6%) Providencia stuartti, 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter aerogenes and 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter cloacae were identified as ESBL producers. Bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M were detected in 63%, 17.3% and 33.9% strains, respectively. Pulsed field gel eletrophoresis genotyping of K. pneumoniae revealed four main molecular patterns and 29 unrelated profiles. PCR results showed a high variety of ESBL groups among strains, in nine different species. The results suggest the spread of resistance genes among genetically different strains of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in some hospital wards, and also that some strongly related strains were identified in different hospital wards, suggesting clonal spread in the institutional environment.
TI  - Isolation of faecal coliform bacteria from the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis).
AB  - AIMS: To determine whether American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) are an unrecognized poikilothermic source of faecal coliform and/or potential pathogenic bacteria in South Carolina's coastal waters. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacteria from the cloaca of American alligators, as well as bacteria from surface water samples from their aquatic habitat, were isolated and identified. The predominant enteric bacteria identified from alligator samples using biochemical tests included Aeromonas hydrophila, Citrobacter braakii, Edwardsiella tarda, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Plesiomonas shigelloides and putative Salmonella, and these were similar to bacteria isolated from the surface waters in which the alligators inhabited. Based on most-probable-number enumeration estimates from captive alligator faeces, faecal coliform bacteria numbered 8.0x10(9) g(-1) (wet weight) of alligator faecal material, a much higher concentration than many other documented endothermic animal sources. CONCLUSIONS: A prevalence of enteric bacteria, both faecal coliforms and potential pathogens, was observed in American alligators. The high faecal coliform bacterial density of alligator faeces may suggest that alligators are a potential source of bacterial contamination in South Carolina coastal waters. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These findings help to increase our understanding of faecal coliform and potential pathogenic bacteria from poikilothermic reptilian sources, as there is the potential for these sources to raise bacterial water quality levels above regulatory thresholds.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - [Epidemiology of enterobacteriaceae causing bloodstream infections in neonatal intensive care unit patients].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: An increasing number of neonates require intensive care, and this population has a high risk of developing infections. The Enterobacteriaceae most commonly related to healthcare-associated infection in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp and Enterobacter cloacae. METHODS: From January 2001 to December 2005, 84 bloodstream infections caused by E. cloacae, E. coli and Klebsiella spp. were studied in 80 neonates hospitalized in the NICU and intermediate care unit. Clinical histories were reviewed to extract the most important demographic data. Identification and susceptibility patterns were carried out with GN VITEK 2 and AST_N057 VITEK 2 (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Molecular typing was performed by macrorestriction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: Twenty-one community bloodstream infections and 63 healthcare-associated infections were diagnosed. In community bloodstream infections there were no significant differences according to birth weight or gestational age of the neonates. In healthcare-associated infection, however, there was a high percentage of neonates whose birth weight was between 1.001 and 1.500 grams and gestational age < or =36 weeks (P<0.001). On PFGE analysis, the majority of E. coli strains belonged to different clones. Among Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. cloacae isolates, some strains showed a high percentage of similarity, highlighting detection of an E. cloacae outbreak. CONCLUSION: The study has provided better knowledge of bloodstream infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae in the NICU of our hospital from both the epidemiological and clonal standpoints.
TI  - [Influence of bifidobacteria on antilysozyme activity of microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms].
AB  - AIM: To assess influence of bifidobacteria's exometabolites on expression of antilysozyme activity of microflora and its ability to biofilm formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six strains of bifidobacteria belonging to B. longum, B. bifidum, and B. adolescentis as well as 42 strains of opportunistic microorganisms belonging to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Rhodotorula rubra isolated by conventional methods during assessment of intestinal microbiocenosis in humans. In order to study the influence of bifidoflora's exometabolites on associative flora, obtained filtrates were mixed with nutrient broth in 1:10 ratio with subsequent introduction of pure culture of opportunistic microorganism. Nutritional broth was used instead of filtrates of bifidobacteria for obtaining the control samples. Formation of biofilms was determined on the ability of strains of microorganisms to adhere on the surface of 96-well polystyrene plate, whereas the antilysozyme activity was studied by photometric method. RESULTS: Performed studies revealed multidirectional but mostly inhibiting effect of bifidobacteria's metabolites on antilysozyme activity of opportunistic microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms. Changes of these characteristics was observed both in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as in yeast fungi and depended from species of bifidobacteria and associative opportunistic microflora. CONCLUSION: Obtained data open perspective for search of control on infectious process on the basis of modification of persistence characteristics of associative pathogens and their ability to form biofilms in host's biotope.
TI  - [Formation of biofilms by fecal strains of enterobacteria and yeast fungi from Candida genus].
AB  - AIM: To assess the ability of bacteria and Candida genus' yeast fungi from human  fecal microflora to form biofilms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one strains of enterobacteria and 45 strains of yeast fungi from Candida genus isolated from feces of patients during test on intestinal dysbiosis were used. In order to study the ability of microorganisms to form biofilms, level of binding of crystal violet by the formers in sterile 96-well polystyrene plates was studied. RESULTS: Ability to form biofilms was noted in 87.1% of enterobacteria strains. This characteristic was observed in lactose-positive and lactose-negative Escherichia coli and bacteria belonging to Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia, Morganella, Providencia genuses. The highest mean value of the characteristic was noted in strains belonging to Enterobacter cloacae species (6.52+/-2.01). Overwhelming majority of fungal strains belonging to Candida genus formed static biofilms in wells of polystyrene plates. Mean value of the characteristic in group of Candida spp. (not albicans) was significantly higher compared with strains from C. albicans species (2.75+/-0.53 vs. 1.38+/-0.11, p<0.05). The highest value of the mentioned characteristic (6.75+/-1.65) was observed in yeast fungi belonging to C. krusei species. CONCLUSION: Obtained data widen our knowledge about armamentarium of biological characteristics of opportunistic microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) promoting their prolonged persistence in intestinal biotope.
TI  - Phenotypic characterization of human pathogenic bacteria in fish from the coastal waters of South West Cameroon: public health implications.
AB  - Increasing economic and recreational opportunities, attractive scenery and a perception of a better quality of life are luring people to the coast. Unfortunately, these activities together with the commensurate increase in population in the area inevitably result in pollution of coastal waters with excessive microorganisms and other pollutants. Microbial pollutants not only contaminate the coastal water but also aquatic food sources, thus posing a health risk to consumers. Fish is a major source of protein in Cameroon, especially in the coastal areas. In this study, we investigated the microbiological quality of fish from the Limbe and Tiko beaches in South West Cameroon from May to October 2007. We isolated human pathogenic bacteria from three anatomic sites (skin, gills, intestine) of 50 fish (150 specimens) and investigated their susceptibility patterns to a battery of antibiotics. Data were analyzed statistically using chi2 with significance set at p < .05. Eleven bacterial species were identified, including Escherichia coli type 1 (20.8%), Citrobacter fruendii (16.4%), Proteus vulgaris (13%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.1%), Klebsiella ozaenae (7.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (7.2%), Klebsiella oxytoca (5.8%), Serratia marcescens (4.8%), Serratia odorifera (4.8%), Hafnia alvei (4.4%) and Proteus penneri (2.9%). More contaminated fish were found at Limbe beach than at Tiko beach (61.4% versus 38.6%, respectively (p < .05)). When ranking contamination with respect to anatomic site, skin was the most contaminated (40.6%) specimen and gills the least (28.5%). Ciprofloxacillin, ofloxacillin, and cotrimoxazole were the most effective antibiotics against all isolates, exhibiting 100% sensitivity. Almost half of the isolates (45.7%) were resistant to ampicillin. The results of our study demonstrate that fish from the coastal waters of South West Cameroon are a source of human pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria; hence this finding has public health implications.
TI  - Differentiation of whole bacterial cells based on high-throughput microarray chip printing and infrared microspectroscopic readout.
AB  - Using robotic automation, a microarray printing protocol for whole bacterial cells was developed for subsequent label-free and nondestructive infrared microspectroscopic detection. Using this contact microspotting system, 24 microorganisms were printed on zinc selenide slides; these were 6 species of Listeria, 10 species of Vibrio, 2 strains of Photobacterium damselae, Yersinia enterocolitica 289, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14529, Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 19075 (serotype 104 B), Shigella sonnei 20143, Klebsiella pneumoniae KP73, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii 200, and Escherichia coli. Microarrays consisting of separate spots of bacterial deposits gave consistent and reproducible infrared spectra, which were differentiated by unsupervised pattern recognition algorithms. Two multivariate analysis algorithms, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, successfully separated most, but not all, the bacteria investigated down to the species level.

TI  - Molecular identification of coliform bacteria from colicky breastfed infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence of intestinal coliform bacteria in colicky vs healthy infants. STUDY DESIGN: We isolated coliform strains from faeces and performed quantitative bacterial cultures in 41 colicky and 39 healthy breastfed infants, identified using PCR with species-specific primers, strain-specific Automated Ribotyping and the API-50E kit for Enterobacteriaceae to identify the most frequent strains. RESULTS: Coliform strains were more abundant in colicky infants (median 6.04 log(10) CFU/g faeces, range 2.00-8.76) vs controls (median 4.47 log(10) CFU/g faeces, range 1.00-8.08) (p = 0.026). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes and Enterococcus faecalis were the predominant species in colicky and healthy infants. The counts of each bacterial species differed between the two groups, and the difference was significant (p = 0.002) for E. coli: median 6.30 log(10) CFU/g faeces (range 3.00-8.74) in colicky infants, and median 4.70 log(10) CFU/g faeces (range 2.00-5.85) in controls. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the colonization patterns of gas-forming coliforms in colicky infants and healthy controls identified by molecular methods. Coliform bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli, were found to be more abundant in colicky infants. Our data could help to shed light on the cause of infantile colic.
TI  - [A clinical study of bile cultures and antibiotic susceptibility test in the patients with operation on biliary tract].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the bacteriology and their susceptibility to antibiotics in patients with biliary tract diseases and provide information for antibiotic choices. METHODS: The bile specimens were cultured and pathogens' susceptibility to antibiotics was obtained intraoperatively from 195 patients undergoing operations on biliary tract and 24 healthy liver donors from June 2007 to March 2008. RESULTS: Among 195 bile specimens collected from the patients intraoperatively, 44 ones were found bacterial growth by culture (22.6%), in which 11 ones were mixed infections (25.0%). Fifty-five bacterial strains belonging to 16 species were identified from these bile specimens. They included 34 Gram negative strains (61.8%), 19 Gram positive strains (34.6%) and 2 fungal strains (3.6%). The commonest pathogens were Escherichia coli (27.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (12.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.7%) and Enterococcus faecium (10.9%). Among 24 bile specimens collected from the healthy liver donors, one was found Escherichia coli growth by culture (4.2%). The results of susceptibility test showed that the resistant rates of Gram negative strains to Meropenem was 2.8%, followed by Imipenem (5.6%), Sulperazone (22.8%) and Amikacin (28.7%). In this study Gram negative strains were highly resistant to Penicillins, Quinolones, some third generation Cephalosporins and so on (>50.0%). None of Gram positive strains were resistant to Vancomycin and Teicoplanin. They were highly resistant to Penicillins, Quinolones, Clindamycin and so on (>40.0%). CONCLUSIONS: (1) Gram negative strains remain the commonest pathogens in biliary tract infection in Renji Hospital and the commonest pathogen is Escherichia coli. The infection of enterococcus is going up. The mixed infection cases happen mostly in acute biliary infection. (2) To treat biliary infection the broad-spectrum antibiotics which are effective to Escherichia coli are optimal choices. Ceftazidime or Ciprofloxacin may be used in mild biliary infection. Sulperazone or Amikacin may be used in severe biliary infection. Imipenem and Vancomycins may be used as second choice to treat the infection which other drugs are ineffective to.
TI  - [Distribution of pathogenic bacteria in patients of injuries combined with infection after May 12 Wenchuan Earthquake and drug resistance thereof].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution of pathogenic bacteria in the patients of injuries combined with infection after May 12 Wenchuan Earthquake and the drug resistance thereof. METHODS: Bacterial culture and identification were conducted on 139 clinical specimens from 108 patients with open injuries combined with infection. Drug-sensitive test was carried out by Kirby-Bauer method on the isolated strains. RESULTS: Ninety-six stains were isolated, 79.86% of them were from the infected wound secretion and 58.33% were from three department of orthopedics. The bacteria with high isolation rates included Acinetobacter spp. (20 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (20 strains), Escherichia coli (17 strains), and Staphylococcus spp. (13 strains). The isolated Gram negative bacteria showed lower resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam. CONCLUSION: The Gram negative bacteria isolated from the wounds caused by earthquake show lower resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam. No Staphylococcus spp. is found resistant to glycopeptides.
TI  - Characterization of CTX-M ESBLs in Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates from Cairo, Egypt.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A high rate of resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins among Enterobacteriaceae isolates from Egypt has been previously reported. This study aims to characterize the resistance mechanism (s) to extended spectrum cephalosporins among resistant clinical isolates at a medical institute in Cairo, Egypt. METHODS: Nonconsecutive Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), Enterobacter cloacae (ENT) and Escherichia coli (EC) isolates were obtained from the clinical laboratory at the medical institute. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by CLSI disk diffusion and ESBL confirmatory tests. MICs were determined using broth microdilution. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was used to determine the pI values, inhibitor profiles, and cefotaxime (CTX) hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases. PCR and sequencing were performed using blaCTX-M and ISEcp1-specific primers, with DNA obtained from the clinical isolates. Conjugation experiments were done to determine the mobility of blaCTX-M. RESULTS: All five clinical isolates were resistant to CTX, and were positive for ESBL screening. IEF revealed multiple beta-lactamases produced by each isolate, including a beta-lactamase with a pI of 8.0 in Kp and ENT and a beta-lactamase with a pI of 9.0 in EC. Both beta-lactamases were inhibited by clavulanic acid and hydrolyzed CTX. PCR and sequence analysis identified blaCTX-M-14 in Kp and ENT and a blaCTX-M-15 in EC. Both blaCTX-M-14 and blaCTX-M-15 were preceded by ISEcp1 elements as revealed by partial sequence analysis of the upstream region of the blaCTX-M genes. blaCTX-M-15 was transferable but not blaCTX-M-14. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of CTX-M-14 in Kp and ENT isolates from Egypt, the Middle East and North Africa.
TI  - Design and quality control of a pharmaceutical formulation containing natural products with antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant properties.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to determine the antibacterial and antifungal  activity as well as mutagenicity of Sechium edule fluid extract and to obtain a pharmaceutical formulation with them. The extract exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. isolated from clinical samples from two hospitals of Tucuman, Argentina. Non-toxicity and mutagenicity on both Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA 100 strains until 100 microg/plate were observed. A hydrogel with carbopol acrylic acid polymer containing S. edule fluid extract as antibacterial, antimycotic and antioxidant agent was obtained. Microbiological, physical and functional stability of pharmaceutical formulation conserved at room temperature for 1 year were determined. Addition of antioxidant preservatives to store the pharmaceutical formulation was not necessary. The semisolid system showed antimicrobial activity against all gram positive and gram negative bacteria and fungi assayed. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 20 to 800 microg/mL. Its activity was compared with a pharmaceutical formulation containing commercial antibiotic and antifungal. A pseudoplastic behavior and positive thixotropy were observed. Our current finding shows an antimicrobial activity of hydrogel containing S. edule extract on a large range of gram negative and gram positive multi-resistant bacteria and fungi. This topical formulation may be used as antimycotic and as antibacterial in cutaneous infections.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antibacterial activities of the essential oils from aerial parts and corollas of Origanum acutidens (Hand.-Mazz.) Ietswaart, an endemic species to Turkey.
AB  - Essential oils extracted by hydrodistillation from the aerial parts and corollas  of Origanum acutidens (Hand.-Mazz.) Ietswaart, an endemic Turkish flora species, were analyzed by GC-MS. The amounts of essential oil obtained from the aerial parts and the corollas were 0.73% and 0.93%, respectively. Twenty-five components in both the aerial parts oil and the corolla oil, representing 95.11% and 93.88%, respectively, were identified. The aerial parts and corolla oils were characterized by the predominance of two components: p-cymene (9.43% and 17.51%) and carvacrol (67.51% and 52.33%), respectively. The essential oils were also evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against ten bacteria by the disc diffusion assay. Our findings showed the following order in the sensitivity to the essential oils, as indicated by the corresponding inhibition zones: Proteus vulgaris > Salmonella typhimurium > Enterobacter cloacae > Klebsiella pneumonia > Escherichia coli > Serratia marcescens > Pseudomonas aeruginosa for the aerial parts essential oil, and Salmonella typhimurium > Proteus vulgaris > Enterobacter cloacae > Escherichia coli > Klebsiella pneumoniae > Serratia marcescens > Pseudomonas aeruginosa for the corolla essential oil. The studied essential oils thus exhibited a broad-spectrum of activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, whereas the tested Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to the essential oil samples.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of selected plant species from "the Argentine Puna" against sensitive and multi-resistant bacteria.
AB  - AIM: The plant species reported here are traditionally used in the "Puna" or "Altiplano" of Argentina for ailments related to bacterial infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate their antimicrobial properties against a panel of sensitive and multi-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of tinctures and aqueous extracts (Baccharis boliviensis, Chiliotrichiopsis keidelii, Chuquiraga atacamensis, Fabiana bryoides, Fabiana densa, Fabiana punensis, Frankenia triandra, Parastrephia lucida, Parastrephia lepidophylla, Parastrephia phyliciformis, Tetraglochin cristatum) was determined using the agar macrodilution and broth microdilution methods recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS). The antibiotic resistant clinical strains were isolated from nosocomial infection in human lesions of skin and soft parts. RESULTS: The ethanolic extracts of 11 plant species inhibited the growth of one or more of the following strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ethanol extracts (tinctures) of aerial parts of Baccharis, Fabiana and Parastrephia showed the highest levels of antibacterial activity on methicillin, oxacillin and gentamicin resistant Staphylococcus with MIC values from 20 to 150 microg/ml. Baccharis boliviensis and Fabiana bryoides were more active than the other plant species on Enterococcus faecalis with different phenotype. The most interesting activity on multi-resistant gram-negative strains was obtained from Chuquiraga atacamensis. Parastrephia species showed activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The ethanolic extracts exhibited stronger activity and broader spectrum of action than aqueous extracts. The extracts were bactericidal in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of antibacterial activity in Puna plant extracts against multi-resistant bacteria give support to their traditional use for treating conditions associated with microorganisms in humans and animals and consequently seems promising for the treatment of multi-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Detection of plasmid-mediated IMP-1 metallo-beta-lactamase and quinolone resistance determinants in an ertapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae isolate.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of carbapenem resistance and the occurrence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr in a clinical isolate of Enterobacter cloacae. METHODS: An ertapenem-resistant E. cloacae ZY106, which was isolated from liquor puris of a female gastric cancer patient in a Chinese hospital, was investigated. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by agar dilution method. Conjugation experiments, isoelectric focusing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and DNA sequence analyses of plasmid-mediated carbapenemases and quinolone resistance determinants were preformed to confirm the genotype. Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) were examined by urea-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Urea-SDS-PAGE). RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem for ZY106 were 2, 4, and 16 microg/ml, respectively. Conjugation studies with Escherichia coli resulted in the transfer of significantly reduced carbapenem susceptibility. ZY106 produced IMP-1 metallo-beta-lactamase and CTX-M-3 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and E. coli transconjugant produced IMP-1. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant qnrS1 was detected in ZY106. Transfer of the qnrS1-encoding-plasmid into E. coli by conjugation resulted in intermediate resistance to ciprofloxacin in E. coli transconjugant. Urea-SDS-PAGE analysis of OMPs showed that ZY106 lacked an OMP of approximately 38 kDa. CONCLUSION: It is the first IMP-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae in China and the first report of a clinical isolate that harbors both blaIMP and qnrS genes as well. The blaIMP-1, blaCTX-M-3, and qnrS1 are encoded at three different plasmids. IMP-1 combined with the loss of an OMP possibly resulted in ertapenem resistance and reduced imipenem and meropenem susceptibility in E. cloacae.
TI  - Prevalence of qnr determinants among extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates in southern Stockholm, Sweden.
AB  - Three hundred and nineteen extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were screened for qnr genes. Twelve isolates were positive for qnr, including one qnrA1, two qnrB1, three qnrB2, one qnrB4, one qnrB6 and four qnrS1. No qnr-positive strains were identified among the isolates recovered before 2006. The first qnr-positive Escherichia coli was detected from a patient in 2006. qnr genes remained rare in E. coli (6/288; 2.1%), but appeared to be more prevalent in Klebsiella pneumoniae (4/25; 16%) and Enterobacter cloacae (2/3; 66.7%). All qnr-positive isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid while presenting varied susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones. Isolates harbouring qnrB4 or qnrB6 were highly resistant to all the fluoroquinolones tested. Their high-level resistance is associated with multiple chromosomal substitutions in gyrA and parC. Alterations at codons Ser-83 and Asp-87 in GyrA and at codons Ser-80 and Glu-84 in ParC were observed in these isolates.
TI  - Can we rely on one laboratory test in detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae? An evaluation of the Vitek 2 system and comparison with four other detection methods in Kuwait.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clinical hospitals need to correctly identify extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria in infected patients to correctly treat the patient and avoid spreading antibiotic resistance. Kuwaiti hospitals use one laboratory test for detecting ESBL bacteria. This study evaluated whether that was sufficient to detect ESBL bacteria, and compared the Vitek system with other detection systems. METHODS: (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, K oxytoca and Enterobacter cloacae) were collected from five different Kuwaiti main hospitals, all of which were flagged as ESBL-positive by the Vitek 2 system. The isolates were retested by the Vitek 2 system, and were also tested by double disc diffusion (DDD), the disc approximation test, the E-test and the MicroScan system for the detection of ESBLs. RESULTS: Retesting with the Vitek system revealed 100% compatibility with the results of the source hospitals. The MicroScan system, DDD, disc approximation test and E-test could detect ESBL in 199, 192, 178 and 205 isolates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Technically, the MicroScan and Vitek 2 systems were the least demanding method to detect ESBL as it is an integral part of the routine susceptibility test card. E-test strips were reliable but the most expensive of all techniques used. The DDD test and disc approximation, while relatively inexpensive, were technically subjective. The Vitek system may be very suitable in clinical laboratories, but would be better if accompanied with another test for detection of ESBL bacteria.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine mastitis between 2003 and 2008 in Korea.
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess trends in the prevalence and distribution of gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine mastitis and their antimicrobial susceptibilities during a 6-yr period between 2003 and 2008 in Korea. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter lwoffi/junii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens were the most commonly observed pathogens during this period. Generally, gram-negative bacteria showed low susceptibilities to most of the antimicrobials tested in this study, except amikacin and gentamicin. Although these 2 aminoglycosides were broadly active against gram-negative bacteria, less than half of those bacteria showed susceptibilities to streptomycin. The beta-lactams, except piperacillin, had the lowest activity among antimicrobials tested in this study. Susceptibilities to chloramphenicol and trimethoprim were fairy high in all genera of gram-negative bacteria, except Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp., whereas relatively high resistance to tetracycline was observed uniformly among gram-negative bacteria. There was no significant change in the prevalence of bacterial and the proportion of antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacteria isolates during a 6-yr period.
TI  - [Aberrant gallstones--extraordinary complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy].
AB  - About 0.2 % of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystetomy will suffer from complications caused by lost gallstones. Diagnostic and therapeutic measures are correlated to the symptoms. At different locations, abscesses can arise, which can be treated by direct access through the -abdominal wall, laparotomy or laparoscopy. Two cases are presented with the especially grave sequels of subphrenic abscess, infiltration of the thoracic wall, and pleural empyema, which -respectively needed several successive operations -after ten years. In laparoscopic cholecystectomy, all detected stones should be removed. In the case of a failure, conversion to laparotomy is not essential. The loss of stones has to be formally -documented, the patient and family doctor are to be informed.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline alone and in combination against clinical isolates of resistant gram-negative pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Ceftaroline is a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin that exhibits bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and -negative pathogens. However, the activity of ceftaroline cannot be solely relied upon for eradication of multidrug-resistant gram-negative isolates, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which represent a current clinical concern. As drug combinations might be beneficial by potential synergy, we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline combined with meropenem, aztreonam, cefepime, tazobactam, amikacin, levofloxacin, and tigecycline. Susceptibility testing was performed for 20 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates, 10 ESBL-producing Escherichia coli isolates, 10 ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, and 10 AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter cloacae isolates. Time-kill experiments were performed for 10 isolates using antimicrobials at one-fourth the MIC. Ceftaroline exhibited a MIC range of 0.125 to 1,024 microg/ml and was reduced 2- to 512-fold by combination with tazobactam (4 microg/ml) for ESBL-producing strains. In time-kill experiments, ceftaroline plus amikacin was synergistic against 90% of the isolates (and indifferent for one P. aeruginosa isolate). Ceftaroline plus tazobactam was indifferent for E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa strains but synergistic against 100% of E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates. Combinations of ceftaroline plus meropenem or aztreonam were also synergistic for all E. coli and E. cloacae isolates, respectively, but indifferent against 90% of the other isolates. Finally, combinations of ceftaroline plus either tigecycline, levofloxacin, or cefepime were indifferent for 100% of the isolates. No antagonism was observed with any combination. Ceftaroline plus amikacin appeared as the most likely synergistic combination. This represents a promising therapeutic option, and further studies are warranted to elucidate the clinical value of ceftaroline combinations against resistant gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Multidrug efflux systems in Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae obtained from wholesome broiler carcasses.
AB  - Members of the Enterobacteriaceae family are present in the intestines of man and animals as commensals or are important disease causing agents. Bacteria bearing multidrug efflux systems (MDR) are able to survive adverse ecological niches. Multiresistant Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae isolates from wholesome broiler carcasses were investigated for the presence of MDR. Lowering of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration for antimicrobials in the presence of a proton-motive force (PMF) uncoupler was tested as a potential display of the MDR phenotype. PCR amplification of the genes encoding AcrA and AcrB, components of a MDR system was performed. Diversity of each species was ascertained by Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) of DNA digested with endonuclease XbaI. For all the isolates, except E. coli 1 and E. cloacae 9, lowering of MIC or of the growth rate in the presence of antimicrobials was observed, indicating a PMF dependent resistance mechanism. Expected products of DNA amplification with acrAB derived primers was obtained with all E. coli strains and with two of the five E. cloacae strains. Dendrogram generated shows diverse pulsetypes, confirming the genetic diversity among the strains. An important issue and related public health is the fact that different models and mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance are present in a small number of non-pathogenic strains and isolated from the same origin. These may be sources of resistance genes to others microorganisms, among them, pathogenic strains.
TI  - Novel CTX-M {beta}-lactamase genotype distribution and spread into multiple species of Enterobacteriaceae in Changsha, Southern China.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to undertake a survey of the occurrence of  CTX-M and SHV extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genotypes in Enterobacteriaceae from Hunan Province, China. METHODS: Clinical isolates (425) from three major hospitals in Changsha, Hunan Province, were collected between October 2004 and July 2005, and their antimicrobial susceptibilities of the genotype of bla(CTX-M) and bla(SHV) were determined. Random amplified polymorphic DNA was used to characterize the clonality of all of the isolates. RESULTS: The overall rate of ESBL-positive isolates was 33.4% (142/425). The dominant ESBLs were CTX-M types, and were found in 109/142 (76.8%) isolates comprising seven different genera/species, namely Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris and Providencia stuartii. The most common bla(CTX-M) genotypes were bla(CTX-M-14) (47.7%), bla(CTX-M-3) (29.4%) and bla(CTX-M-15) (17.4%). A novel gene derived from bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-82) (Ala-40-->Pro), was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The dominant ESBL genotype in Hunan Province was bla(CTX-M). The high prevalence (17.4%) of bla(CTX-M-15) has not previously been reported from China. Our results identify that an epidemic of bla(CTX-M) in Changsha, Hunan Province, has evolved with the appearance and spread of bla(CTX-M-15) against the dominant genotypes bla(CTX-M-14) and bla(CTX-M-3.) The worldwide dominance of bla(CTX-M-15) could be poised to spread to China, displacing the current prevailing genotypes.
TI  - Identification of novel antibacterial peptides by chemoinformatics and machine learning.
AB  - The rise of antibiotic resistant pathogens is one of the most pressing global health issues. Discovery of new classes of antibiotics has not kept pace; new agents often suffer from cross-resistance to existing agents of similar structure. Short, cationic peptides with antimicrobial activity are essential to the host defenses of many organisms and represent a promising new class of antimicrobials. This paper reports the successful in silico screening for potent antibiotic peptides using a combination of QSAR and machine learning techniques. On the basis of initial high-throughput measurements of activity of over 1400 random peptides, artificial neural network models were built using QSAR descriptors and subsequently used to screen an in silico library of approximately 100,000 peptides. In vitro validation of the modeling showed 94% accuracy in identifying highly active peptides. The best peptides identified through screening were found to have activities comparable or superior to those of four conventional antibiotics and superior to the peptide most advanced in clinical development against a broad array of multiresistant human pathogens.
TI  - Doripenem activity tested against a global collection of Enterobacteriaceae, including isolates resistant to other extended-spectrum agents.
AB  - The emergence and rapid dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates among Enterobacteriaceae coupled with increasing prevalence of stably derepressed and plasmid-borne AmpC producers have rendered broad-spectrum cephalosporins and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations less effective. This scenario has required the use of carbapenems for treatment of infections caused by such organisms. In this study, the in vitro activities of doripenem and comparator agents against Enterobacteriaceae, including ESBL- and AmpC-producing strains, were evaluated. A total of 36 614 isolates collected from more than 60 medical centers (2000-2007) were included and tested for susceptibility using reference methods and interpretive criteria, except for doripenem (product package insert). Overall, doripenem inhibited 98.7% of all Enterobacteriaceae tested at <or=0.5 microg/mL. ESBL rates were higher among Klebsiella pneumoniae (from 7.7% to 44.0%, varied by geographic region), followed by Escherichia coli (3.6-14.0%) and Proteus mirabilis (0.8-34.8%). Derepressed AmpC production-mediated resistance rates were highest among Enterobacter cloacae (26.6-38.7%) compared with other species and generally higher for strains isolated in the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions. Doripenem inhibited 94.3% and 93.7% of the ESBL phenotype and derepressed AmpC isolates, respectively, and these resistances had little adverse influence on doripenem MIC(50) values (nil to 2-fold increases). The observed increase in AmpC- and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae necessitates a greater confidence on carbapenem empiric therapy. Doripenem could represent a valuable choice for broad-spectrum coverage of contemporary Enterobacteriaceae isolates with widespread resistance mechanisms.
TI  - Isothiocyanate profile and selective antibacterial activity of root, stem, and leaf extracts derived from Raphanus sativus L.
AB  - Acetone and hexane extracts derived from the root, stem, and leaf of Raphanus sativus were investigated for their antibacterial activity against foodborne and resistant pathogens, such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Total and individual isothiocyanate (ITC) components and their relationship with the antibacterial activity of R. sativus were also evaluated. Both acetone and hexane fractions of root, stem, and leaf exhibited selective antibacterial activity against the organisms tested. Antibacterial activity was strongest in the acetone fraction of root with larger zone of inhibition and lower minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained were comparable to that seen with standard antibiotics. Of the different parts of R. sativus studied, root tended to be more active than the stem and leaf extracts in inhibiting the bacterial growth. Gas chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of variable amounts of five different ITCs such as allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC), benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), phenethyl isothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate (MTBITC) in different parts of the plant. The low linear correlation between the total ITC content and antibacterial activity implied that bacterial growth inhibitory ability of R. sativus was not dependent on the total ITC content. However, the antibacterial activity of R. sativus was well correlated with AITC, PITC, and BITC for all organisms except for Enteroc. faecalis, whose inhibitory effect was more related to MTBITC.
TI  - Extended septic thrombophlebitis in a patient with duplicated inferior vena cava: case report and review of literature.
AB  - Duplication is one of the congenital abnormalities of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and is reported to be associated with deep venous thrombosis (DVT). We report a case who was admitted for carbamazepine-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis. The patient had persistent fever caused by septic thrombophlebitis extending from the left femoral vein to the duplicated left IVC. The fever and thrombosis resolved under combined treatment with antibiotics and anticoagulants, without further complication of symptomatic pulmonary embolism. This is the first case in patient with IVC duplication complicated by DVT induced by septic thrombophlebitis, which was not seen in the nine cases of IVC duplication reported previously.
TI  - Changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study period. METHODS: Microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by Escherichia coli (13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (10.9%), Enterococcus sp. (9.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), Acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), Proteus mirabilis (2%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). Susceptibility of S. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. Not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. Increases in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). Results for methicillin-resistant CNS (MRCNS) show an even greater increase. P. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. S. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. Acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. Imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and P. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. CONCLUSION: In-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. Our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.
TI  - Generation of antibacterial oligosaccharides derived from chitin using heterologous endochitinase synthesized in Escherichia coli.
AB  - AIMS: To synthesize two heterologous endochitinases in Escherichia coli and demonstrate their potential for applied use in generating antibacterial chitin-derived oligosaccharides (OGS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Heterologous endochitinase genes, chiA Nima and chiA74, were expressed in E. coli. Endochitinases were secreted by the E. coli export machinery and by approximately 20 h maximal chitinolytic activity was observed. The highest chitinolytic activity was observed with ChiA Nima, which produced antibacterial OGS with activities against Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and S. xylosus. CONCLUSIONS: It was shown that the export machinery of E. coli is well suited for the secretion of bioactive ChiA74 and ChiA Nima endochitinases, and that the latter can generate antibacterial OGS. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our study suggests that it is feasible to synthesize endochitinases ChiA Nima and ChiA74 codified by E. coli and mass-produce these enzymes in culture supernatants. As signal peptides in native ChiA Nima and ChiA74 were recognized by the protein export molecular apparatus in E. coli, these short peptides could be included as signal sequences for transport in E. coli of other proteins with applied value. This is the first report suggesting that ChiA Nima can be used to produce OGS to control food-borne pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - AmpC beta-lactamases.
AB  - SUMMARY: AmpC beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded  on the chromosomes of many of the Enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. In many bacteria, AmpC enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. Overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy. Transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for AmpC enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla(AmpC) gene, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Resistance due to plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. AmpC enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. Techniques to identify AmpC beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates this resistance mechanism. Carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to AmpC-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance efflux (efflux pump activation).
TI  - [Temporal and bacteriological comparison of neonatal urinary infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To find out the epidemiological and management changes of urinary tract infection over the last years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Descriptive retrospective review of patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) admitted to our neonatal unit over an 11 year period. A temporal, microorganism group and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) group comparison. RESULTS: We studied 106 cases (5 cases/1,000 alive newborns). The most commonly isolated microorganisms were Escherichia coli (81.1%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.6%) and Enterobacter cloacae (4.7%). Gentamicin had an overall sensitivity of 93.2%, followed by cefotaxime 91.3% and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 89.5%. We did not found temporal differences in microorganisms or sensitivities. We found differences in C reactive protein, nitrate and leucocyte values in E. coli versus non-E. coli UTIs, as well as patterns of antibiotic sensitivity with more resistances by non-E. coli microorganisms. No differences were found in patients with normal and pathological VCUG. We found ultrasound and VCGU disturbances in 35.2% and 21.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: UTI is a common problem in our area. The most frequently isolated microorganism is E. coli. Non-E. coli UTIs have more resistances to usual therapies, although these did not show any increase in disease in the imaging tests. We found no increase in resistances throughout the study.
TI  - [Susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae rods to selected tetracyclines].
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluated the susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae rods to tigecycline, tetracycline and doxycycline. We analysed 121 strains belonged to species as follows: Escherichia coli (40 strains), Proteus mirabilis (22), Enterobacter cloacae (19), Klebsiellapneumoniae (18), Morganella morgannii (13), Serratia marcescens (4), Klebsiella oxytoca (3) i Proteus vulgaris (2). All strains of E. coli, K. oxytoca, S. marcescens and P. vulgaris were susceptible to tigecycline. Twenty five of analysed strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Among of ESBL-positive strains 22 (88.0%) were susceptible to tigecycline and 13 (52.0%) to tetracycline and doxycycline.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - Biologically active and C-amidated hinnavinII-38-Asn produced from a Trx fusion construct in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The cabbage butterfly (Artogeia rapae) antimicrobial peptide hinnavinII as a member of cecropin family is synthesized as 37 residues in size with an amidated lysine at C-terminus and shows the humoral immune response to a bacterial invasion. In this work, a synthetic gene for hinnavinII-38-Asn (HIN) with an additional amino acid asparagine residue containing amide group at C-terminus was cloned into pET-32a(+) vector to allow expression of HIN as a Trx fusion protein in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS. The resulting expression level of the fusion protein Trx-HIN could reach 15-20% of the total cell proteins and more than 70% of the target proteins were in soluble form. The fusion protein could be purified successfully by HiTrap Chelating HP column and a high yield of 15 mg purified fusion protein was obtained from 80 ml E. coli culture. Recombinant HIN was readily obtained by enterokinase cleavage of the fusion protein followed by FPLC chromatography, and 3.18 mg pure active recombinant HIN was obtained from 80 ml culture. The molecular mass of recombinant HIN determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer is 4252.084 Da which matches the theoretical mass (4252.0 Da) of HIN. Comparing the antimicrobial activities of the recombinant hinnavinII with C-amidated terminus to that without an amidated C-terminus, we found that the amide of asparagine at C-terminus of hinnavinII improved its potency on certain microorganism such as E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus megaterium, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Pathogen prevalence and influence of composted dairy manure application on antimicrobial resistance profiles of commensal soil bacteria.
AB  - Composting manure, if done properly, should kill pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157:H7, providing for an environmentally safe product. Over a 3-year period, samples of composted dairy manure, representing 11 composting operations (two to six samples per producer; 100 total samples), were screened for Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 and were all culture negative. Nonpathogenic bacteria were cultured from these compost samples that could theoretically facilitate the spread of antimicrobial resistance from the dairy to compost application sites. Therefore, we collected soil samples (three samples per plot; 10 plots/treatment; 90 total samples) from rangeland that received either composted dairy manure (CP), commercial fertilizer (F), or no treatment (control, CON). Two collections were made appoximately 2 and 7 months following treatment application. Soil samples were cultured for Pseudomonas and Enterobacter and confirmed isolates subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Three species of Enterobacter (cloacae, 27 isolates; aeroginosa, two isolates; sakazakii, one isolate) and two species of Pseudomonas (aeruginosa, 11 isolates; putida, seven isolates) were identified. Five Enterobacter isolates were resistant to ampicillin and one isolate was resistant to spectinomycin. All Pseudomonas isolates were resistant to ampicillin, ceftiofur, florfenicol, sulphachloropyridazine, sulphadimethoxine, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and most isolates were resistant to chlortetracycline and spectinomycin. Pseudomonas isolates were resistant to an average of 8.6, 7.9, and 8 antibiotics for CON, CP, and F treatments, respectively. No treatment differences were observed in antimicrobial resistance patterns in any of the soil isolates examined. Results reported herein support the use of composted dairy manure as an environmentally friendly soil amendment.
TI  - [Bacterial etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children: combined detection with culture and polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. The objective of this study was to explore application of the combined detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. METHODS: Totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. The age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. Deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by Streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, Hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. The aspirate samples were also amplified for DNA of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Tem-PCR) and detected with Luminex xMAP technology platform. RESULTS: The total positive rate by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. The total positive rate by combined detection of culture and Tem-PCR assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. CONCLUSION: The Tem-PCR assay may increase the detection rate of Hemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The Combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. The Tem-PCR needs further improvement for diagnosis of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of tigecycline against 14 gram-positive organisms.
AB  - The in vitro postantibiotic effects (PAEs), postantibiotic sub-MIC effects (PA-SMEs), and sub-MIC effects of tigecycline were determined for 14 gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The pneumococcal, staphylococcal, and enterococcal PAEs were 1.9 to 5.1, 2.9 to 5.7, and 3.9 to 6.1 h, respectively, and those for Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Acinetobacter baumannii were 1.1 to 5.0, 1.9 to 2.1, 1.7 to 1.8, 1.0 to 1.7, and 0.7 to 3 h, respectively. The PA-SMEs (four times the MIC) ranged from 6.7 to >11 h for gram-positive organisms and from 2.3 to >11.3 h for gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants over a 9-year period.
AB  - Recently, several plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes conferring low levels of quinolone resistance have been discovered. To evaluate the temporal change in the prevalence of PMQR genes over a decade in a tertiary hospital in the Republic of Korea, we selected every fifth isolate of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and every third isolate of Enterobacter cloacae between 1998 and 2001 and between 2005 and 2006 from a collection of blood isolates. Six PMQR genes [qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrS, aac(6')-Ib-cr, and qepA] were screened by multiplex PCR and then confirmed by direct sequencing, and the aac(6')-Ib-positive PCR products were digested with BtsCI to identify the aac(6')-Ib-cr variant. Of 461 isolates, 37 (8%) had one of the six PMQR genes; 13 (5%) of 261 E. coli strains, 13 (10%) of 135 K. pneumoniae strains, and 11 (17%) of 65 E. cloacae strains. qnrB was the most common PMQR gene and was found as early as 1998, whereas qnrS, aac(6')-Ib-cr, and qepA emerged after 2000. None of the isolates carried qnrA or qnrC. Ciprofloxacin resistance increased over time (P < 0.001), and the overall prevalence of PMQR genes tended to increase (P = 0.20). PMQR-positive isolates had significantly higher ciprofloxacin resistance and multidrug resistance rates (P = 0.005 and P < 0.001, respectively). The increasing frequency of ciprofloxacin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae was associated with an increasing prevalence of PMQR genes, and this change involved an increase in the diversity of the PMQR genes and also an increase in the prevalence of the mutations in gyrA, parC, or both in PMQR-positive strains but not PMQR-negative strains.
TI  - Summer Peaks in the Incidences of Gram-Negative Bacterial Infection Among Hospitalized Patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recognition of seasonal trends in hospital infections may improve diagnosis, use of empirical therapy, and infection prevention interventions. There are very few data available regarding the seasonal variability of these infections. We quantified the seasonal variation in the incidences of hospital infection caused by common bacterial pathogens and estimated the association between temperature changes and infection rates. METHODS: A cohort of all adult patients admitted to the University of Maryland Medical Center during the period from 1998 through 2005 was analyzed. Time-series analyses were used to estimate the association of the number of infections per month caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci with season and temperature, while controlling for long-term trends. RESULTS: There were 218,594 admissions to the index hospital, and analysis of 26,624 unique clinical cultures that grew the organisms of interest identified increases in the mean monthly rates of infection caused by P. aeruginosa (28% of isolates recovered; P ! .01), E. cloacae (46%; P ! .01), E. coli (12%; P ! .01), and A. baumannii (21%; Pp.06). For each 10 degrees F increase, we observed a 17% increase in the monthly rates of infection caused by P. aeruginosa (Pp.01) and A. baumanii (Pp.05). CONCLUSION: Significantly higher rates of gram-negative infection were observed during the summer months, compared with other seasons. For some pathogens, higher temperatures were associated with higher infection rates, independent of seasonality. These findings have important implications for infection prevention, such as enhanced surveillance during the warmer months, and for choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy among hospitalized adults. Future, quasi-experimental investigations of gram-negative infection prevention initiatives should control for seasonal variation.
TI  - Nosocomial spread of armA-mediated high-level aminoglycoside resistance in Enterobacteriaceae isolates producing CTX-M-3 beta-lactamase in a cancer hospital in Bulgaria.
AB  - 1,310 Enterobacteriaceae, 242 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 97 Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates collected at a cancer hospital in Bulgaria were screened for the presence of 16S rRNA methylases. The armA methylase gene was identified in 20 (1.5%) Enterobacteriaceae (7 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 Escherichia coli, 3 Serratia marcescens, 3 Citrobacter freundii , 3 Enterobacter cloacae and 1 Klebsiella oxytoca). ArmA-mediated aminoglycoside resistance was transferable by conjugation and carried by closely related IncL/M plasmids which also carried ant3"9, dfrXII, sul1, bla(TEM-1), and bla(CTX-M-3) genes encoding resistance to streptomycin-spectinomycin, trimethoprim, sulfonamides, and ss-lactams, respectively. Most of the isolates were genetically different according to PFGE but shared similar restriction patterns of the armA -encoding plasmids. Our findings highlight the strong association of armA and bla(CTX-M-3) extended-spectrum ss-lactamase genes across various species in the family Enterobacteriaceae . The spread of multiresistant isolates expressing 16S rRNA methylases and ESBLs is a worrisome development requiring continuous monitoring.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated 16S rRNA methylases in aminoglycoside-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates in Shanghai, China.
AB  - High-level resistance to aminoglycosides produced by 16S rRNA methylases in Enterobacteriaceae isolates was investigated. The prevalences of armA in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae were 0.6%, 3.0%, and 10%, respectively. rmtB was more prevalent than armA. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns indicated that armA and rmtB have spread horizontally and clonally.
TI  - Transfer of antibiotic multiresistant plasmid RP4 from escherichia coli to activated sludge bacteria.
AB  - In situ transfer of a self-transmissible, antibiotic-multiresistant plasmid RP4 from a laboratory Escherichia coli strain C600 to indigenous activated sludge bacteria was investigated using filter mating. The transfer frequency of RP4 from the donor E. coli to the bacteria that was sampled from two wastewater treatment plants was 5.1x10(-2) to 7.5x10(-1) and 4.6x10(-3) to 1.3x10(-2)/potential recipient. The isolated transconjugants showed resistance to Ap, Km, and Tc and the presence of a plasmid with a similar size to RP4. The traG gene on RP4 was also detected from all transconjugants. Reverse-transfer experiments from the transconjugants to E. coli HB101 indicated that RP4 maintained self-transmissibility in the transconjugants. The transconjugant strains were dominant bacteria in activated sludge including Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. putida, and Ochrobactrum anthropi and minor populations of enteric bacterial strains including Citrobacter freundii, E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, E. asburiae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae. The transconjugant strains K. pneumoniae ssp. pneumonia, E. cloacae, and E. asburiae had several naturally occurring plasmids. These results suggest that in situ transfer of plasmids and the exchange of antibiotic-resistant genes can occur between released and indigenous bacteria in activated sludge.
TI  - [Recent evolution and characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteria in the CHU of Nice (2005-2007)].
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: ESBL producing enterobacteria (E-ESBL+) are always a public health concern, mainly due to increase of CTX-M beta-lactamase. So, 542 new strains were isolated in the CHU de Nice during the 2005-2007 period. The aim of this work was to characterize the ESBL and to type isolates suspected to be implicated in outbreaks. METHODS: Every first E-ESBL+ was studied, the antibiotype was defined by the agar diffusion technique. Type of ESBL was determined by PCR, followed by sequencing for CTX-M and SHV enzymes. Typing was performed when several strains of one species had same antibiotype and beta-lactamase. RESULTS: CTX-M type ESBL are predominant (45% of all E-ESBL+), mainly in Escherichia coli (34.5%). The TEM24 ESBL was the second predominant type (34.5%), mainly in Enterobacter aerogenes (18.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.4%). SHV5/12 ESBL was found mainly in Enterobacter cloacae (7.5%). Several epidemic situations were identified, with CTX-M15 in Escherichia coli (2005/2006: 27 patients), SHV5/12 in Enterobacter cloacae (2006: 10 patients) and TEM in Proteus mirabilis (2007: nine patients). Enterobacter aerogenes is still endemic (101 patients) while an epidemic clone of TEM24 producing K. pneumoniae persists especially in an intensive care unit (26 patients during the three years). CONCLUSION: Caracterization of E-ESBL+ is essential to better understand their mode of dissemination, monitor the emergence of new enzymes and adapt the efforts against BMR cross transmission.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2006 and March 2007].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2006 to March 2007 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 474 strains including 23 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (75.2%) of 226 patients with surgical infections. Two hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 224 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp. was higher from postoperative infections, while Enterococcus spp. was higher from primary infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides fragilis and from postoperative infections, B. fragilis was most predominately isolated, followed by Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and B. wadsworthia in this order. In this series, we noticed no methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, nor multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. There were three strains of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-MRSA antibiotics. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia.
TI  - Growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  - Free-living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. Here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. All bacteria assayed induced a dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) mL(-1); except for M. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. In addition, Acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. Single-dose experiments indicated a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of M. luteus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. Long-term Acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including S. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the bacterium given, being much higher with E. coli, M. luteus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Role of menaquinone biosynthesis genes in selenate reduction by Enterobacter cloacae SLD1a-1 and Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - In this study, we investigated the role of menaquinone biosynthesis genes in selenate reduction by Enterobacter cloacae SLD1a-1 and Escherichia coli K12. A mini-Tn5 transposon mutant of E. cloacae SLD1a-1, designated as 4E6, was isolated that had lost the ability to reduce Se(VI) to Se(0). Genetic analysis of mutant strain 4E6 showed that the transposon was inserted within a menD gene among a menFDHBCE gene cluster that encodes for proteins required for menaquinone biosynthesis. A group of E. coli K12 strains with single mutations in the menF, menD, menC and menE genes were tested for loss of selenate reduction activity. The results showed that E. coli K12 carrying a deletion of either the menD, menC or menE gene was unable to reduce selenate. Complementation using wild-type sequences of the E. cloacae SLD1a-1 menFDHBCE sequence successfully restored the selenate reduction activity in mutant strain 4E6, and E. coli K12 menD and menE mutants. Selenate reduction activity in 4E6 was also restored by chemical complementation using the menaquinone precursor compound 1,4-dihydroxy-2-nathphoic acid. The results of this work suggest that menaquinones are an important source of electrons for the selenate reductase, and are required for selenate reduction activity in E. cloacae SLD1a-1 and E. coli K12.
TI  - High prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from nine teaching hospitals in China.
AB  - Quinolone resistance is an emerging problem in China. To investigate the prevalence of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr, a total of 265 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae with ciprofloxacin MICs of > or =0.25 microg/ml were screened at nine teaching hospitals in China. The qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, and aac(6')-Ib genes were detected by PCR. The aac(6')-Ib-cr gene was further identified by digestion with BtsCI and/or direct sequencing. The qnr gene was present in significantly smaller numbers of isolates with cefotaxime MICs of <2 microg/ml than isolates with higher MICs (> or =2.0 microg/ml) (20.6% and 42.1%, respectively; P < 0.05). aac(6')-Ib-cr was present in 17.0% of the isolates tested, and 7.9% of the isolates carried both the qnr and the aac(6')-Ib-cr genes. Among the isolates with cefotaxime MICs of > or =2.0 microg/ml, qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr were present in 65.7% and 8.6% of E. cloacae isolates, respectively; 65.5% and 21.8% of K. pneumoniae isolates, respectively; 63.3% and 26.7% of C. freundii isolates, respectively; and 6.5% and 16.9% of E. coli isolates, respectively. The 20 transconjugants showed 16- to 128-fold increases in ciprofloxacin MICs, 14 showed 16- to 2,000-fold increases in cefotaxime MICs, and 5 showed 8- to 32-fold increases in cefoxitin MICs relative to those of the recipient due to the cotransmission of bla(CTX-M-14), bla(CTX-M-3), bla(DHA-1), bla(SHV-2), and bla(SHV-12) with the qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes. Southern hybridization analysis showed that these genes were located on large plasmids of different sizes (53 to 193 kb). These findings indicate the high prevalence of qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the widespread dissemination of multidrug resistance in China.
TI  - Type II hydride transferases from different microorganisms yield nitrite and diarylamines from polynitroaromatic compounds.
AB  - Homogenous preparations of XenB of Pseudomonas putida, pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase of Enterobacter cloacae, and N-ethylmaleimide reductase of Escherichia coli, all type II hydride transferases of the Old Yellow Enzyme family of flavoproteins, are shown to reduce the polynitroaromatic compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). The reduction of this compound yields hydroxylaminodinitrotoluenes and Meisenheimer dihydride complexes, which, upon condensation, yield stoichiometric amounts of nitrite and diarylamines, implying that type II hydride transferases are responsible for TNT denitration, a process with important environmental implications for TNT remediation.
TI  - Aromatic amino acid-dependent expression of indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase is regulated by TyrR in Enterobacter cloacae UW5.
AB  - The plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Enterobacter cloacae UW5 synthesizes the plant growth hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) via the indole-3-pyruvate pathway utilizing the enzyme indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase that is encoded by ipdC. In this bacterium, ipdC expression and IAA production occur in stationary phase and are induced by an exogenous source of tryptophan, conditions that are present in the rhizosphere. The aim of this study was to identify the regulatory protein that controls the expression of ipdC. We identified a sequence in the promoter region of ipdC that is highly similar to the recognition sequence for the Escherichia coli regulatory protein TyrR that regulates genes involved in aromatic amino acid transport and metabolism. Using a tyrR insertional mutant, we demonstrate that TyrR is required for IAA production and for induction of ipdC transcription. TyrR directly induces ipdC expression, as was determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, by ipdC promoter-driven reporter gene activity, and by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Expression increases in response to tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine. This suggests that, in addition to its function in plant growth promotion, indolepyruvate decarboxylase may be important for aromatic amino acid uptake and/or metabolism.
TI  - Susceptibility of common aerobic pathogens to tigecycline: results of a surveillance study in Germany.
AB  - Tigecycline is a novel antimicrobial agent for parenteral use encompassing a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens, including multi-resistant organisms. Here, we report the results of the first nationwide surveillance trial that was conducted in order to evaluate the susceptibility of bacterial isolates to tigecycline in a European country prior to its clinical use. A total of 2,610 Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms recovered from hospitalized patients were tested. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the microdilution method. All enterococci, staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; MRSA), and streptococci tested were tigecycline-susceptible, except one isolate of Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, 100% of the Escherichia coli isolates (including extended spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL]-producers) were tigecycline-susceptible, while about 10% of the Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were resistant. Based on the results of this surveillance study, tigecycline may represent a suitable option most notably for the empiric treatment of bacterial mixed infections, including in clinical situations in which multi-resistant organisms are suspected.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among Enterobacteriaceae in intensive care units in Taiwan.
AB  - To determine the antimicrobial resistance profiles among clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae in Taiwanese intensive care units (ICUs), a national surveillance of antibiotic resistance among important Enterobacteriaceae was conducted from September 2005 through November 2005 at the ICUs of ten major teaching hospitals in Taiwan. A total of 574 Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from various clinical samples of our ICU patients were submitted for in vitro test. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these isolates to 18 antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method. The prevalences of Enterobacteriaceae isolates with phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production were 26% in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 16% in Serratia marcescens, 14% in Escherichia coli, and 13% in Proteus mirabilis, in which a significantly rising prevalence of ESBL production among K. pneumoniae was noted (p = 0.002) when compared with a previous Taiwanese survey in 2000. Heterogeneous resistance to various fluoroquinolones was found among our Enterobacteriaceae isolates, except for Enterobacter cloacae. Emergence of ertapenem-resistant isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, and S. marcescens was noted. Gradually increasing rates of drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were noted in Taiwanese ICUs. Periodic surveillance of the evolutionary trend of antimicrobial resistance among ICU isolates is crucial for starting appropriately empirical antimicrobial therapy in the future.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic assessment of doripenem in peritoneal fluid against Gram-negative organisms: use of population pharmacokinetic modeling and Monte Carlo simulation.
AB  - This study aimed to assess the peritoneal pharmacodynamics of intravenous doripenem using population pharmacokinetic modeling and Monte Carlo simulation. Drug concentrations in peritoneal fluid (PF) and serum from 11 laparotomy patients and MIC distributions against clinical isolates in Japan for 4 Gram-negative organisms were used. The probabilities of attaining the pharmacodynamic target (40% T > MIC) were greater in PF than in serum. To achieve a > or =90% probability of target attainment in PF, 0.25 g tid and 0.5 g tid (0.5-h infusions) had to be sufficient against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter cloacae; however, 1 g tid (0.5-h infusion) was required against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Prolonged (4-h) infusion regimens resulted in increase of the target attainment probabilities in PF for P. aeruginosa. These results should help to achieve a better understanding of the peritoneal pharmacodynamics of doripenem while also helping to rationalize and optimize the dosing regimen for intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Molecular characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases produced by clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae from a Teaching Hospital in China.
AB  - Of 59 clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae from a teaching hospital in Sichuan, China, 18 isolates were shown to be resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins and aztreonam. Enterobacterial repetitive consensus PCR revealed that these isolates comprised 7 distinct genotypes. The presence of plasmids in the 18 clinical isolates was revealed by conjugational transfer of plasmids from E. cloacae to Escherichia coli with the further isolation of the plasmids in the transconjugants. Subsequent nucleotide sequencing and beta-lactamase isoelectric focusing indicated that the plasmids encoded blaSHV, blaCTX-M and/or blaTEM genes, including genes for CTX-M-22 (13 strains), TEM-1 (12 strains), TEM-29 (1 strain), TEM-141 (1 strain), TEM-157 (1 strain), SHV-5 (1 strain), SHV-12 (1 strain), and SHV-70 (1 strain). The widespread presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in E. cloacae isolated from the southwest of China was likely due to the dissemination of resistance plasmids with the predominant genotype of blaCTX-M-22.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Genetic and structural insights into the dissemination potential of the extremely broad-spectrum class A beta-lactamase KPC-2 identified in an Escherichia coli strain and an Enterobacter cloacae strain isolated from the same patient in France.
AB  - Two clinical strains of Escherichia coli (2138) and Enterobacter cloacae (7506) isolated from the same patient in France and showing resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and low susceptibility to imipenem were investigated. Both strains harbored the plasmid-contained bla(TEM-1) and bla(KPC-2) genes. bla(KLUC-2), encoding a mutant of the chromosomal beta-lactamase of Kluyvera cryocrescens, was also identified at a plasmid location in E. cloacae 7506, suggesting the ISEcp1-assisted escape of bla(KLUC) from the chromosome. Determination of the KPC-2 structure at 1.6 A revealed that the binding site was occupied by the C-terminal (C-ter) residues coming from a symmetric KPC-2 monomer, with the ultimate C-ter Glu interacting with Ser130, Lys234, Thr235, and Thr237 in the active site. This mode of binding can be paralleled to the inhibition of the TEM-1 beta-lactamase by the inhibitory protein BLIP. Determination of the 1.23-A structure of a KPC-2 mutant in which the five C-ter residues were deleted revealed that the catalytic site was filled by a citrate molecule. Structure analysis and docking simulations with cefotaxime and imipenem provided further insights into the molecular basis of the extremely broad spectrum of KPC-2, which behaves as a cefotaximase with significant activity against carbapenems. In particular, residues 104, 105, 132, and 167 draw a binding cavity capable of accommodating both the aminothiazole moiety of cefotaxime and the 6 alpha-hydroxyethyl group of imipenem, with the binding of the former drug being also favored by a significant degree of freedom at the level of the loop at positions 96 to 105 and by an enlargement of the binding site at the end of strand beta 3.
TI  - Peritoneal pharmacokinetics of cefepime in laparotomy patients with inflammatory  bowel disease, and dosage considerations for surgical intra-abdominal infections based on pharmacodynamic assessment.
AB  - This study aimed to examine the peritoneal pharmacokinetics of cefepime and to assess its pharmacodynamic exposure in peritoneal fluid (PF). Cefepime (1 g) was administered to eight patients with inflammatory bowel disease before abdominal surgery. Venous blood and PF samples were obtained at the end of the 0.5-h infusion and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h thereafter. Drug concentrations in plasma and PF were determined, analyzed pharmacokinetically, and used for a Monte Carlo simulation with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data. Cefepime penetrated well into PF, with a maximum drug concentration in a PF/plasma ratio of 0.59 +/- 0.15 (mean +/- SD, n = 8), and an area under the concentration-time curve ratio of 0.90 +/- 0.10. The probabilities of attaining the bacteriostatic and bactericidal targets (40% and 70% of the time above the MIC, respectively) in PF were > or =85% against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Enterobacter cloacae with 0.5 g every 12 h, 1 g every 12 h, 1 g every 8 h, and 2 g every 12 h. However, 1 g every 8 h or 2 g every 12 h was required for bacteriostatic and bactericidal probabilities > or =85% against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These conventional regimens did not achieve a high probability against Bacteroides species. These results should help to give us a better understanding of the peritoneal pharmacokinetics of cefepime while also helping to choose the appropriate dosage to prevent surgical intra-abdominal infections on the basis of the pharmacodynamic assessment.
TI  - The culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  - AIM: Traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. AIM: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. METHODS: A cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. After surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. Identification of bacteria as well as computation of mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. Wilcoxon's paired and Chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. Positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (P<0.001). The microorganisms identified were Escherichia coli (14 cases) and Enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (P<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (P<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. CONCLUSION: The neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. This difference might be attributed to the presence of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the region.
TI  - Influence of extended-spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance.
AB  - PURPOSE: The influence of extended- spectrum beta-lactams on gram-negative bacterial resistance was studied. METHODS: Hospital pharmacists were asked to provide data on antimicrobial use and bacterial susceptibilities. Defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam were assessed for significant associations with gram-negative susceptibility. To account for midyear changes in usage patterns and the lag between changes in usage and resistance, susceptibility over two-year periods was evaluated. RESULTS: Susceptibility data of more than 300,000 gram-negative isolates, representing 10 species of interest, were provided by 82 U.S. hospitals. Two-year periods (n = 45) were evaluable for 25 hospitals, containing 159 hospital-years of data and 204,513 clinical isolates. Use of cefepime increased, while use of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam decreased. Excluding Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteria were most susceptible to cefepime, followed by piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime. Significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to the antibiotics themselves were observed with ceftazidime (Enterobacter aerogenes) and ceftriaxone (Escherichia coli). Extended-spectrum beta-lactams associated with significantly decreased susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to other beta-lactams included cefepime (E. aerogenes and E. coli susceptibility to ceftazidime), ceftazidime (Enterobacter cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), ceftriaxone (E. cloacae susceptibility to cefepime), piperacillin-tazobactam (E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa susceptibility to cefepime). There were insufficient susceptibility data to allow for impact analysis for piperacillin-tazobactam. CONCLUSION: Use of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with variably changing susceptibilities of several key gram-negative bacteria, either to themselves or to each other. Despite the increased use of cefepime, gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cefepime remained high.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and structure-activity relationship analysis of novel depsides as potential antibacterials.
AB  - Twenty-six depsides were synthesized to screen for their antibacterial activity.  All of them were reported for the first time. Their chemical structures were clearly determined by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, ESI mass spectra and elemental analyses, coupled with one selected single-crystal structure. All the compounds were assayed for antibacterial activities against three gram-positive bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790) and three gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 13525 and Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047) by MTT method. Compound 2-(2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl)phenyl 3-nitrobenzoate (C10) and 2-(2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)phenyl 3-nitrobenzoate (C23) showed powerful antibacterial activities against B. subtilis with MIC of 0.78 microg/mL while compound 2-(2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl)phenyl 2-(3,4-diethoxyphenyl)acetate (C8) and 2-(2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)phenyl 2-(3,4-diethoxyphenyl)acetate (C21) exhibited significant antibacterial activities against E. coli with MIC of 1.562 microg/mL, which were superior to the positive controls penicillin G and kanamycin B, respectively. On the basis of the biological results, structure-activity relationships were discussed.
TI  - Monitoring and identification of bacteria associated with safety concerns in the  manufacture of Sao Jorge, a Portuguese traditional cheese from raw cow's milk.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the hygienic quality of raw milk used in the  manufacture of Sao Jorge, a Protected Denomination of Origin Portuguese semihard cheese, as well as to ascertain the sanitary conditions prevailing during its processing. Viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae and Micrococcaceae were accordingly obtained, pertaining to 21 independent batches (including samples of raw milk, curd, and cheeses after 1, 3, and 4 months of ripening), from 7 dairy farms. Standard plate counts (log CFU per milliliter or per gram) ranged from 6.1 to 8.6 in raw milk, whereas they ranged from 7.0 to 8.0 in 4-month-old cheeses. Viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae ranged between 5.9 and 7.0 in raw milk and between 0.0 and 1.3 in 4-month-old cheeses. Species identified within this family encompassed Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sakazakii, and Escherichia coli; Klebsiella ornithinolytica, Klebsiella terrigena, and Serratia odorifera were detected only in raw milk. No Salmonella whatsoever could be detected in any of the samples. Viable counts of Micrococcaceae ranged between 4.7 and 5.9 and between 1.3 and 3.3 in raw milk and 4-month-old cheeses, respectively. Species identified within this family encompassed Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus (which was found mainly in ripened cheeses), and Staphylococcus aureus (which was not detected in 4-month-old cheeses). Accompanying physicochemical analyses included determination of moisture, salt, and pH. Statistical analyses revealed a negative correlation between salt content and viable numbers of Enterobacteriaceae in cheese, whereas in the case of Micrococcaceae, a more negative correlation was found between viable numbers and moisture content than between viable numbers and pH. The results of our study indicate, in general, poor milk handling conditions in all farms, given that the indicators total mesophile and Enterobacteriaceae counts were high, between 100- and 1,000-fold those enforced by international standards pertaining to the matrices in question. However, by the time of regular consumption (i.e., after 4 months of ripening), Sao Jorge cheeses exhibit low levels of contamination by Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus, as well as absence of Salmonella.
TI  - [Influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  - The influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, WalkAway-40 (Dade MicroScan, West Sacramento, CA, USA), VITEK 2 Compact (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo). In the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. For the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. Enterobacter cloacae plus Klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in K. ornithinolytica or E. aerogenes with 93% to 97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. Whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and non-producing Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (VR) and vancomycin-susceptible (VS) Enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. However, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, RAISUS required 70% of MRSA, VITEK 2 Compact was 8%, and the WalkAway-40 was 1%. Also, when the cell suspension of VS E. faecalis spiked with Proteus mirabilis was tested, the WalkAway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both VITEK 2 Compact and RAISUS reported as the test inoculum being VR E. faecalis. With these results, it can be concluded that: First, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. Secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from reporting very major error interpretation.
TI  - A plasmid-borne Shewanella algae Gene, qnrA3, and its possible transfer in vivo between Kluyvera ascorbata and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - The plasmid-borne quinolone resistance gene qnrA1 is prevalent in multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. A chromosomally encoded homologue in Shewanella algae, qnrA3, has been described. We isolated two qnrA3-positive strains, one of Klebsiella pneumoniae (He96) and one of Kluyvera ascorbata (Kas96), from the feces of an immunocompromised outpatient. The qnrA3 allele was identical to that of S. algae except for 5 nucleotides and differed from qnrA1 by 29 nucleotides affecting three amino acids. The analysis of the qnrA3 genetic environment showed that qnrA3 was inserted downstream from an ISCR1 element at a recombination crossover site described for other resistance genes, including qnrA1, and immediately upstream from IS26, a situation not described before. IS26 preceded an incomplete class 1 integron which contained, among other genes, aac(6')-Ib-cr, another transferable quinolone resistance gene, and the beta-lactamase gene bla(OXA-1/30). The 10-kb fragment encompassing qnrA3 was compared to previously described qnrA1-containing plasmids and multidrug-resistant plasmids; it shares identical sequences with pC15a, pHSH2, pQR1, pQKp311H, and pSAL-1 but with rearrangements, deletions, and mutations. Conjugal transfer of qnrA3 was highly efficient (10(-2)) from K. pneumoniae He96 or K. ascorbata Kas96 to Escherichia coli J53 but less so (10(-5)) from either donor to a clinical strain of Enterobacter cloacae. This first description of a plasmid-borne copy and of the in vitro transfer of qnrA3 is taken to illustrate its likely in vivo transfer from S. algae to the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Dissemination of the CTX-M-25 family beta-lactamases among Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae and identification of the novel enzyme CTX-M-41 in Proteus mirabilis in Israel.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The CTX-M-25 family of beta-lactamases is a closely related family of enzymes found rarely in the world. We aimed to describe the occurrence and to understand the dissemination of this extended-spectrum beta-lactamase family among Enterobacteriaceae strains in our hospital. METHODS: Fifty-four CTX-M-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains collected from 2000 to 2005 were screened for bla(CTX-M-25) genes by PCR and sequencing. Genetic relatedness was analysed by PFGE. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by VITEK-2. Plasmids encoding bla(CTX-M-25)-type genes were isolated, transformed and analysed by Southern blot using a bla(CTX-M-25) probe. Chromosomal location of bla(CTX-M-25)-type was studied by I-CeuI restriction analysis. The bla(CTX-M-25) genetic environment was characterized by PCR mapping and partial sequencing. RESULTS: Ten out of 54 CTX-M-producing isolates (18.5%) carried bla(CTX-M-25) genes, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and Proteus mirabilis (n = 2). Isolates were genetically unrelated. Four beta-lactamases were found: CTX-M-25, CTX-M-26, CTX-M-39 and CTX-M-41, a new member of the family (accession no. DQ023162) that differed from CTX-M-25 in three amino acids, Ala80Val, Val106Ile and Ile126Ser. bla(CTX-M-25)-type genes were plasmid-mediated in all genera but P. mirabilis, organized in a class I integron and located downstream of an ISEcp1 element. The genes were encoded on different plasmids with varying degree of similarities. Several antibiotic-resistant determinants conferring resistance to trimethoprim and aminoglycosides existed on the same integron. CONCLUSIONS: bla(CTX-M-25) exists in Israel in different enteric species. Spread of these enzymes within and between species is due to transfer of plasmids with common regions and by dissemination of determinants encoding these genes. CTX-M-41, a novel member of this family, was identified in the chromosome of P. mirabilis.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated in Korean hospitals.
AB  - Prevalence and characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Korean hospitals were assessed. A total of 1484 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates were collected from 8 tertiary-care hospitals in various regions of Korea over a 3-month period (June to August) in 2005. Among 546 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 123 isolates (22.4%) showed ESBL-producing activity, and 47 (10.2%) of 460 isolates of Escherichia coli were ESBL producers. Of the Enterobacter cloacae isolates, 16.2% (17/105) evidenced ESBL-producing activity. The most prevalent ESBLs were SHV-12 and CTX-M-14 in K. pneumoniae and E. coli, respectively. In E. cloacae, SHV-12 was also the most prevalent. Prevalence of ESBL production differed among the specimens. Although the K. pneumoniae isolates from urine and aspirates evidenced high ESBL production rates (35.4% and 57.1%, respectively), those from sputum, blood, and pus showed relatively low ESBL production rates (17.0%, 14.8%, and 5.3%, respectively). However, E. coli isolates obtained from sputum showed significantly higher ESBL production rates (37.5%) than were seen in samples obtained from other sources, but those obtained from urine showed lower ESBL production rates (8.3%). These significant differences in ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates among the isolated specimens should be examined further, with an eye toward the implications of this research in clinical settings.
TI  - Structure of the plasmid-mediated class C beta-lactamase ACT-1.
AB  - The crystallographic structure of ACT-1, which is the first plasmid-mediated AmpC-type beta-lactamase to have been completely analyzed in terms of nucleotide sequence and which has a high degree of sequence similarity to the chromosomal AmpC enzymes of Enterobacter cloacae and the plasmid-encoded MIR-1, has been solved at 2.4 A resolution. The overall structure of ACT-1 is similar to those of other class C beta-lactamases, such as the AmpC enzymes from E. cloacae P99 and Escherichia coli.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2006].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 876 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1764 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 198 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2006 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MEPM was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. MEPM was also active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of the MEPM-resistant strains were resistant to imipenem (IPM). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (41.8%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (33.3%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 4.3% (6 strains) in Escherichia coli, 1.1% (1 strain) in Citrobacter freundii, 21.7% (5 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 3.1% (4 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3.3% (3 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.8% (1 strain) in Serratia marcescens, and 4.9% (2 strains) in Providencia spp. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 3.1% (10 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, there were no species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. Therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 11 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - Risk factors for Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia after liver transplantation.
AB  - Enterobacteriaceae are now the predominant pathogens isolated in bloodstream infections complicating orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent OLT in a University hospital between 01/01/1997 and 31/03/2003 to investigate the risk factors of Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia (EB) after OLT. EB was defined as the isolation of an Enterobacteriaceae species from at least one blood culture within 3 months following OLT. Pre-, per- and postoperative variables were collected from the medical records and analyzed in relation to EB. Forty (12.5%) of the 320 patients developed EB. The origin of EB was abdominal in 32% of the patients, urinary in 18%, pulmonary in 10%, and primary in the remaining 40% of the patients. Two-thirds of EB occurred within 1 month following OLT. The main pathogens were Escherichia coli (42%), Enterobacter cloacae (17%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). Susceptibility rates varied from 82.5% for ciprofloxacin to 95% for amikacin. Fourteen patients (35%) with EB died. Variables significantly associated with EB after multivariate analysis were a MELD score >20 (OR: 2.79 [1.24-6.30], P=0.013), transplantation for posthepatitic B (OR: 4.47 [1.67-11.98], P=0.03) or posthepatitic C (OR: 3.79 [1.59-9.01], P=0.03) cirrhosis, a positive bile culture (OR: 3.47 [1.19-10.13], P=0.023) and return to surgery (including retransplantation) (OR: 2.72 [1.32-5.58], P=0.006). EB is a frequent and severe complication following OLT. Patients grafted for a posthepatitic cirrhosis, with a severe pretransplantation status, with a positive bile culture and those undergoing reoperation have a high risk of developing EB.
TI  - Medical-grade honey kills antibiotic-resistant bacteria in vitro and eradicates skin colonization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance among microbes urgently necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial agents. Since ancient times, honey has been used successfully for treatment of infected wounds, because of its antibacterial activity. However, large variations in the in vitro antibacterial activity of various honeys have been reported and hamper its acceptance in modern medicine. METHODS: We assessed the in vitro bactericidal activity of Revamil (Bfactory), a medical-grade honey produced under controlled conditions, and assessed its efficacy for reduction of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers in a within-subject-controlled trial. RESULTS: With Bacillus subtilis as a test strain, we demonstrated that the variation in bactericidal activity of 11 batches of medical-grade honey was <2-fold. Antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella oxytoca were killed within 24 h by 10%-40% (vol/vol) honey. After 2 days of application of honey, the extent of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers was reduced 100-fold (P < .001), and the numbers of positive skin cultures were reduced by 76% (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Revamil is a promising topical antimicrobial agent for prevention or treatment of infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging features of spinal epidural empyema in five dogs.
AB  - Spinal epidural empyema is defined an accumulation of purulent material in the epidural space of the vertebral canal. Spinal epidural empyema should be considered as a differential diagnosis in dogs with pyrexia, spinal pain, and rapidly progressing myelopathy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the imaging test of choice in humans. Here, we describe the MR imaging features of five dogs with confirmed spinal epidural empyema. The epidural lesions appeared as high or mixed signal masses in T2-weighted (T2W) images. Increased signal within the spinal cord gray matter at the site of the lesion was detected in T2W images in all dogs. Two patterns of enhancement were detected on postcontrast T1-weighted (T1W) images. Mild to moderate peripheral enhancement was seen in three dogs and a diffuse pattern of enhancement was seen in one. Discospondylitis was identified in three dogs on T1W postcontrast images. Decompressive spinal surgery was performed in all dogs. Bacteria isolated from the abnormal epidural tissue were Enterobacter cloacae, coagulase-positive Staphylococci, Pasteurella multocida, and Escherichia coli. In one dog bacteria were not isolated. These MR imaging features, along with appropriate clinical signs, can allow prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment planning.
TI  - Bacteria flora and heavy metals in cultivated oysters Crassostrea iredalei of Setiu Wetland, East Coast Peninsular Malaysia.
AB  - Slipper oyster Crassostrea iredalei is a species of good demand for its sweet flavor and white coloured flesh. The filter feeding nature predisposes oysters to accumulation of pathogenic and heavy metals in waters impacted by sewage pollutions and may thus render the oysters unfit for human consumption. A study was undertaken to investigate the presence of bacteria flora and heavy metal concentrations in cultivated oysters Crassostrea iredalei at Setiu Wetland, Terengganu, the only source of cultivated oysters in East Coast of Malaysia. A total of 200 slipper oyster samples were analyzed. The bacteria were isolated using non selective agar such as TSA agar and selective agars before they were then identified using conventional methods in combination with BBL Crystal identification kit. Heavy metals such as zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) concentrations were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results showed that the oysters harbor predominantly Shewanella putrifaciens followed by Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio cholerae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Chromobacterium violaceum. They also contain high concentration of Zn (785.68 +/- 285.88 microg/g) with the lowest heavy metal was Pb (0.17 +/- 0.15 microg/g), whilst the concentrations of other heavy metals were Cu (38.9 +/- 13.2 microg/g) and Cd (1.60 +/- 0.28 microg/g). The study is very useful to evaluate the type of bacteria and heavy metal present in oyster meat for human consumption.
TI  - Empiric antibiotic therapy for seawater injuries: a four-seasonal analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous seawater studies found Vibrio species associated with morbidity, suggesting that seawater-contaminated wounds should be treated early. The purpose of this study was to identify common seawater pathogens and antibiotic sensitivities to provide empiric antibiotic therapy until patient-specific culture results are available. METHODS: Seasonal samples were collected from 25 Galveston beach locations and cultured. Colonies were identified and sensitivities were performed using MicroScan Positive and Negative Breakpoint Combo Panels. RESULTS: In the fall (28.3 degrees C), of 15 species isolated, the three most common isolates were Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Gram-negative isolates were sensitive to levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and cefepime. Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to penicillin and ampicillin. In the winter (11.1 degrees C), of 14 species isolated, the three most common isolates were Enterobacter agglomerans, E. faecium, and E. coli. Gram-negative isolates were sensitive to levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and cefepime. Most Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to vancomycin, levofloxacin, penicillin, and ampicillin. In the spring (26.6 degrees C), of 14 species isolated, the three most common isolates were E. coli, Bacillus species, and E. faecium. Gram-negative isolates were sensitive to levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and cefepime. Most Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. In the summer (29.7 degrees C), of 17 bacterial species isolated, the three most common isolates were Bacillus species, Enterobacter cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Gram-negative isolates were sensitive to cefepime, lomefloxacin, and levofloxacin. Gram-positive isolates were sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and chloramphenicol. CONCLUSIONS: Cultured pathogens were sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, or levofloxacin. The authors recommend a combination of penicillin or ampicillin with levofloxacin for empiric antibiotic coverage for seawater-contaminated injuries.
TI  - The effects of bee (Apis mellifera) venom phospholipase A2 on Trypanosoma brucei  brucei and enterobacteria.
AB  - The potential role of phospholipases in trypanosomiasis was investigated using bee venom phospholipase A2 (bvPLA2) as a model. The effects of bvPLA2 on the survival of Trypanosoma brucei brucei, 2h and 12h cultures of Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii were studied. About 1 mg ml(-1) bvPLA2 was trypanocidal after 30 min. Some growth occurred at lower concentrations up to 2h after treatment but viability decreased up to 8h. Even very low concentrations of bvPLA2 (10(-12) mg ml(-1)) had some trypanocidal activity. Bee venom PLA2 was bactericidal to 2h bacterial cultures but bacteriostatic to 12h ones. Minimum bactericidal concentrations were 10(-5)-10(-6) mg ml(-1). The results showed that bvPLA2 had significant trypanocidal and antibacterial effects on Gram-negative bacteria. The relationship to events occurring during infection is discussed. Phospholipases may play a role in increased endotoxin levels in trypanosomiasis.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in intensive care units in Canada: results of the Canadian National Intensive Care Unit (CAN-ICU) study, 2005-2006.
AB  - Between 1 September 2005 and 30 June 2006, 19 medical centers collected 4,180 isolates recovered from clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada. The 4,180 isolates were collected from 2,292 respiratory specimens (54.8%), 738 blood specimens (17.7%), 581 wound/tissue specimens (13.9%), and 569 urinary specimens (13.6%). The 10 most common organisms isolated from 79.5% of all clinical specimens were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (16.4%), Escherichia coli (12.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Enterococcus spp. (6.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.8%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (4.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (3.9%). MRSA made up 22.3% (197/884) of all S. aureus isolates (90.9% of MRSA were health care-associated MRSA, and 9.1% were community-associated MRSA), while vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) made up 6.7% (11/255) of all enterococcal isolates (88.2% of VRE had the vanA genotype). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae occurred in 3.5% (19/536) and 1.8% (4/224) of isolates, respectively. All 19 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were PCR positive for CTX-M, with bla CTX-M-15 occurring in 74% (14/19) of isolates. For MRSA, no resistance against daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin was observed, while the resistance rates to other agents were as follows: clarithromycin, 89.9%; clindamycin, 76.1%; fluoroquinolones, 90.1 to 91.8%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 11.7%. For E. coli, no resistance to amikacin, meropenem, and tigecycline was observed, while resistance rates to other agents were as follows: cefazolin, 20.1%; cefepime, 0.7%; ceftriaxone, 3.7%; gentamicin, 3.0%; fluoroquinolones, 21.1%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.9%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 24.8%. Resistance rates for P. aeruginosa were as follows: amikacin, 2.6%; cefepime, 10.2%; gentamicin, 15.2%; fluoroquinolones, 23.8 to 25.5%; meropenem, 13.6%; and piperacillin-tazobactam, 9.3%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype (resistance to three or more of the following drugs: cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, amikacin or gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin) occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (12.6%) but uncommonly in E. coli (0.2%), E. cloacae (0.6%), or K. pneumoniae (0%). In conclusion, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), E. coli, P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, Enterococcus spp., S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian ICUs. A MDR phenotype is common for P. aeruginosa isolates in Canadian ICUs.
TI  - Screening, cloning, expression, and purification of an acidic arylmalonate decarboxylase from Enterobacter cloacae KU1313.
AB  - We have already isolated, purified, and characterized arylmalonate decarboxylases (AMDase; EC. 4.1.1.76) from Alcaligenes bronchisepticus KU1201 and Achromobacter sp. KU1311. These are unique enzymes that give optically pure alpha-arylpropionates from the corresponding alpha-aryl-alpha-methylmalonates. Recently, we have further screened novel AMDase producers from soil samples under acidic conditions and succeeded in isolating Enterobacter cloacae KU1313. The gene encoding the enzyme was cloned by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The AMDase gene consists of 720 nucleotides, which specifies a 240-amino-acid protein. The recombinant enzyme was purified and shown that the pH-activity profiles were quite different from those of known AMDases.
TI  - In vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, an anti-MRSA cephalosporin, against recent gram-positive and gram-negative isolates of European origin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), for use as a contemporary baseline to help detect any changes in its activity profile throughout the course of clinical development and use. METHODS: MICs were determined by broth microdilution testing for ceftobiprole and comparators against 6680 isolates [1201 S. aureus, 460 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 526 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1213 Escherichia coli, 854 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 443 Proteus mirabilis, 406 Enterobacter cloacae, 387 Citrobacter spp., 291 Serratia marcescens, 621 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 278 Acinetobacter spp.] from 31 sites in 12 countries. RESULTS: Ceftobiprole activity against MRSA (MIC90 2 mg/L) was 4-fold less than the activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) and a similar trend was observed for methicillin-resistant CoNS (MIC90 2 mg/L) and methicillin-susceptible CoNS (MIC90 0.25 mg/L). Activity against S. pneumoniae (MIC90s: penicillin-susceptible, 0.015 mg/L; -intermediate, 0.25 mg/L; -resistant, 0.5 mg/L) was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. Ceftobiprole activity against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 0.12 mg/L; non-susceptible, >32 mg/L), P. aeruginosa (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 8 mg/L, non-susceptible, >32 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90: >32 mg/L for imipenem-susceptible and non-susceptible) was comparable to that of cefepime. As with cefepime, ceftobiprole activity was decreased among cephalosporin-resistant isolates of gram-negative bacilli [extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or non-ESBL mediated]. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftobiprole demonstrated potent in vitro activity against MRSA and showed activity against key gram-negative bacilli comparable to that of cefepime. Given this broad spectrum of activity, ceftobiprole appears well suited for development and use in the treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - Chemical markers for the evaluation of raw material hygienic quality in egg products.
AB  - The aim of this research was to study uracil and lactic and acetic acids as chemical markers for hygienic quality evaluation of raw material in liquid pasteurized egg products. Uracil, absent in sound whole eggs, was formed in raw and pasteurized egg products as a consequence of high microbial contamination (>10(6) cfu/g) after a sufficient lag time, remaining stable at 4 degrees C but disappearing after 7 days of storage at 25 degrees C. Both lactic and acetic acids, starting from initial values of 1-7 mg/kg dry matter, presented trends similar to that of uracil; however, acetic acid never decreased during the storage of raw egg products. With few exceptions, all three metabolites were produced by Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, Aeromonas hydrophyla, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus avium, and Enterococcus faecalis, separately inoculated in whole egg samples. Uracil seems to be the most sensible marker, with a suggested limit corresponding to the detectable level.
TI  - Substrate selectivity of the melibiose permease (MelY) from Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - We have examined the substrate selectivity of the melibiose permease (MelY) from  Enterobacter cloacae in comparison with that of the lactose permease (LacY) from Escherichia coli. Both proteins catalyze active transport of lactose or melibiose with comparable affinity and capacity. However, MelY does not transport the analogue methyl-1-thio-beta,d-galactopyranoside (TMG), which is a very efficient substrate in LacY. We show that MelY binds TMG and conserves Cys148 (helix V) as a TMG binding residue but fails to transport this ligand. Based on homology modeling, organization of the putative MelY sugar binding site is the same as that in LacY and residues irreplaceable for the symport mechanism are conserved. Moreover, only 15% of the residues where a single-Cys mutant is inactivated by site-directed alkylation differ in MelY. Using site-directed mutagenesis at these positions and engineered cross-homolog chimeras, we show that Val367, at the periplasmic end of transmembrane helix XI, contributes in defining the substrate selectivity profile. Replacement of Val367 with the MelY residue (Ala) leads to impairment of TMG uptake. Exchanging domains N6 and C6 between LacY and MelY also leads to impairment of TMG uptake. TMG uptake activity is restored by the re-introduction of a Val367 in the background of chimera N6(LacY)-C6(MelY). Much less prominent effects are found with the same mutants and chimeras for the transport of lactose or melibiose.
TI  - [Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among nosocomial gram-negative pathogens from 15 teaching hospitals in China in 2005].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance among the nosocomial gram-negative pathogens from 15 teaching hospitals located in different areas in China in 2005. METHODS: A total of 1927 non-repetitive nosocomial gram-negative pathogens were collected from 15 teaching hospitals in different areas in China and sent to the central lab for reidentification and susceptibility testing. The levels of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 18 antimicrobial agents were determined by agar dilution method. WHONET 5.4 software was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteous mirabilis isolates that did not produce extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs) showed high sensitivity to beta-lactams. The antibiotics with a susceptibility rates over 80% against the strains of Entorobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogene, Citrobacter spp, Serratia spp, and Proteous vulgaris producing AmpC enzyme included meropenem, imipenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam, and these 3 drugs showed a susceptibility rate of more than 80% against the ESBL-producing strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Other antimicrobial agents showing a relatively high activity against Enterobacter spp, Citrobacter spp, Serratia spp and Proteous vulgaris included cefepime (67.3% - 100%), amikacin (67.3% - 95.2%), ceftazidime (52.9% - 100%) and cefoperazone-sulbactam (51.9% - 100%). The susceptibility rate of fluoroquinolones was 34.8% - 36.1% against non-ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and was 13.4% - 17.1% against ESBL-producing isolates. The most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was polymyxin B (95.6%). The agents with the activity rates of 70% - 80% included meropenem, imipenem, amikacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam. The antibiotic with a high susceptible rate against Acinetobacter baumannii was polymyxin B (98.3%), followed by imipenem (80.8%), meropenem (76.2%), and minocycline (67.4%). The susceptible rates of other agents were all below 60%. The agents with relatively high activity against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia included minocycline (85%), levofloxacin (82.5%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (77.5%). The agents with a relatively high activity against Burkholderia cepacia included minocycline (77.2%) and meropenem (61.4%). CONCLUSION: Carbapenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin and cefepime remained relatively high activity against nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae, Non-fermenting pathogens have lower susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents than before.
TI  - Microbiological surveillance and parenteral antibiotic use in a critical care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate parenteral antibiotic utilization and bacterial resistance patterns in a critical care unit (CrCU). DESIGN: Descriptive, prospective audit of infection site, culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test results, parenteral antibiotic usage and duration, total antibiotic acquisition costs, and length of stay. SETTING: A 17-bed medical-surgical CrCU in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Metropolitan Toronto. PATIENTS: Two hundred and fifty-eight patients admitted to the CrCU between May 1995 and April 1996 who received antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were cefazolin (47%, 1098 g), gentamicin (33%,141 g) and ceftriaxone (20%, 255 g). The most common indications for antimicrobial therapy included surgical prophylaxis (34%) and pneumonia (35%). The following organisms were isolated from patients treated with antibiotics: Staphylococcus aureus (26%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%), enterococci (12%), Haemophilus influenzae (11%), Escherichia coli (11%), Enterobacter cloacae (8%) and other Gram-negative bacilli (19%). Only 9% of Gram-negative bacilli were resistant to aminoglycosides, 3% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and no extended-spectrum beta-lactamases or imipenem-resistance were detected. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci and only two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic use during the audit appeared appropriate for the specific clinical indications. Low levels of bacterial resistance were detected during the audit.
TI  - Distribution of conjugative-plasmid-mediated 16S rRNA methylase genes among amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected in 1995 to 1998 and 2001 to 2006 at a university hospital in South Korea and identification of conjugative plasmids mediating dissemination of 16S rRNA methylase.
AB  - The distribution of conjugative-plasmid-mediated 16S rRNA methylase genes among amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae collected between 1995 and 1998 and between 2001 and 2006 at a university hospital in South Korea was examined, and conjugative plasmids carrying the 16S rRNA methylase genes were characterized by PCR-based replicon typing and by determination of their antimicrobial resistance pattern. Among the 7,127 isolates, 463 isolates showed a high level of resistance to amikacin, and 218 of the 463 isolates transferred amikacin resistance by conjugation. Among the 218 isolates, armA was detected in 153 isolates (88 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 28 Escherichia coli, 19 Enterobacter cloacae, and 6 Serratia marcescens isolates and 12 isolates of other organisms), and rmtB was detected in 51 isolates (32 K. pneumoniae isolates, 18 E. coli isolates, and 1 Citrobacter freundii isolate). The first appearance of armA was in 1997. The armA gene was carried by conjugative plasmids of replicon groups IncL/M, IncFIIAs, IncF, IncA/C, IncHI2, and Inc(unidentified) in 38, 20, 7, 9, 4, and 75 strains, respectively. The rmtB gene was carried by conjugative plasmids of groups IncA/C, IncF, and IncI1-Igamma in 43 strains, 7 strains, and 1 strain, respectively. Transconjugants that received the IncL/M plasmid carrying armA or the IncA/C plasmid carrying rmtB showed an additional resistance to cefotaxime. Transconjugants that received the IncFIIA plasmid or Inc(unidentified) plasmid carrying the armA gene showed an additional resistance to cefoxitin and a high MIC(50) (0.25 mg/liter) of ciprofloxacin. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the dissemination of 16S rRNA methylase genes among the Enterobacteriaceae is mediated by conjugative plasmids of various incompatibility groups that confer resistance to multiple drugs, including aminoglycosides, extended-spectrum beta-lactams, and/or quinolones.
TI  - In vitro activity of isepamicin and other aminoglycosides against clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial bloodstream infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Isepamicin is a newly introduced aminoglycoside in Taiwan. Since in vitro data for isepamicin against nosocomial Gram-negative bloodstream infection from Taiwan are limited, we compared the activity of isepamicin, amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin against nosocomial Gram-negative blood isolates. METHODS: A total of 247 non-duplicate nosocomial blood isolates of Gram-negative bacteria collected between January 2003 and December 2003 in a major teaching hospital in Taiwan were tested for their in vitro susceptibilities to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and isepamicin using the agar dilution method. The isolates included Escherichia coli (31 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (31), Enterobacter cloacae (30), Serratia marcescens (31), Morganella morganii (21), Citrobacter freundii (10), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31), Acinetobacter baumannii (31), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31). RESULTS: Overall, isepamicin had high antibacterial activity against the tested Gram-negative bacteria. For the 154 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, isepamicin had the lowest minimum concentration inhibiting 90% of isolates (MIC90) among the tested drugs, while its resistance rate (3.9%) was equal to that of amikacin (3.9%) and lower than those of tobramycin (18.2%) and gentamicin (21.4%). For the 93 of non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli isolates, isepamicin had the lowest MIC90, and a resistance rate (23.7%) lower than those of amikacin (27.9%), tobramycin (38.7%) and gentamicin (40.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro activity of isepamicin against Gram-negative bacteria isolates was equal or similar to amikacin and superior to other tested aminoglycosides. In view of its potential for less nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity than other aminoglycosides, isepamicin is a drug of choice for the empirical treatment of nosocomial infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Characterization of qnr gene for plasmid-mediated quionlone resistance].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the distribution of qnr gene and broad spectrum p-lactamase (ESBLs) gene in gram-negative bacteria which were isolated from our hospital patients. METHODS: qnr gene in nonrepetitive 129 isolates of Escherichia coli, 10 isolates of Enterobacter cloacac and 29 isolates of K. pneunoniae were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For qnr gene positive strains, int I, SHV-1, TEM-1, CTX-M, OXA-I , OXA-II , OXA-III, DHA and EBC genes were examined. Plasmid conjugatable test was applied to examine whether qnr gene was located in conjugate plasmid and ERIC-PCR was carried out for DNA homologous analysis. ESBLs detection (according to phenotypic confirmatory test based on National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards criteria) and susceptibility test to 16 antibiotics were also performed. RESULTS: qnr gene was found in 6 clinical isolates including 5 strain of E. coli and one strain of E. cloacac, but qnr gene was undetectable in K. pneunoniae isolates. The 6 clinical isolates were suspectible to imipenem but resistance to some other drugs while only 2 isolates of E. coli were susceptible to quinolone. Among the 6 qnr gene-positive strains, all of them belonged to I type integron-positive isolates, 4 isolates of them were TEM-1 producing strains,with only one isolate was OXA-III gene producing strain, and 2 isolates of them were EBC producing strains. Most of them were with 2 ESBLs gene if not more. qnr gene was on transferable plasmids which could be disseminated by clone. CONCLUSION: In Wuhan city, the prevalence of qnr was confirmed. qnr gene were found with some ESBLs gene in the same strains, and qnr gene in suspect strains. The transmission of qnr gene producing strains could be mediated by transferable plasmids or clone, forcing us to make intensive investigation and take effective control measures.
TI  - Chemical kinetic and molecular genetic study of selenium oxyanion reduction by Enterobacter cloacae SLD1a-1.
AB  - Microbial processes play an important role in the redox transformations of toxic  selenium oxyanions. In this study, we employed chemical kinetic and molecular genetic techniques to investigate the mechanisms of Se(IV) and Se-(VI) reduction by the facultative anaerobe Enterobacter cloacae SLD1a-1. The rates of microbial selenium oxyanion reduction were measured as a function of initial selenium oxyanion concentration (0-1.0 mM) and temperature (10-40 degrees C), and mutagenesis studies were performed to identify the genes involved in the selenium oxyanion reduction pathway. The results indicate that Se(IV) reduction is significantly more rapid than the reduction of Se(VI). The kinetics of the reduction reactions were successfully quantified using the Michaelis-Menten kinetic equation. Both the rates of Se(VI) and Se(IV) reduction displayed strong temperature-dependence with E(a) values of 121 and 71.2 kJ/ mol, respectively. X-ray absorption near-edge spectra collected for the precipitates formed by Se(VI) and Se(IV) reduction confirmed the formation of Se(0). A miniTn5 transposon mutant of E. cloacae SLD1a-1 was isolated that had lost the ability to reduce Se(VI) but was not affected in Se(IV) reduction activity. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the transposon was inserted within a tatC gene, which encodes for a central protein in the twin arginine translocation system. Complementation by the wild-type tatC sequence restored the ability of mutant strains to reduce Se(VI). The results suggest that Se(VI) reduction activity is dependent on enzyme export across the cytoplasmic membrane and that reduction of Se(VI) and Se(IV) are catalyzed by different enzymatic systems.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary community acquired meningitis is not a rare entity in last two decades.
AB  - The aim of this short note is to assess gram-negative bacillary community acquired meningitis (CBM) and nosocomial meningitis (NM) within 17 years nationwide survey. All cases of gram-negative bacillary CBM within 1990-2007 were assessed in national database of 372 patients with bacterial meningitis: 69 of gram-negative cases were nosocomial and 24 of gram-negative meningitis cases were CBM. Those 24 cases were compared with all CBM (201 cases) for risk factors and outcome. Among nosocomial gram-negative pathogens, A. baumannii in 23 cases, Ps. aeruginosa in 15 cases and Enterobacteriaceae in 31 cases were isolated. Among CBM, in 13 cases Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli 6, Klebsiella pneumoniae 3, Proteus mirabilis 2, Enterobacter cloacae 2), in 5 cases Ps. aeruginosa and in 6 cases Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The only significant risk factor for CBM due to gram-negative bacilli was neonatal age (12.5% vs. 3.5%, p=0.04) as underlying disease. However, mortality among gram-negative bacillary meningitis was significantly higher (12.4% vs. 37.5%, p=0.001) in comparison to other meningitis.
TI  - Saturation mutagenesis of Asn152 reveals a substrate selectivity switch in P99 cephalosporinase.
AB  - In class C beta-lactamases, the strictly conserved Asn152 forms part of an extended active-site hydrogen-bonding network. To probe its role in catalysis, all 19 mutants of Enterobacter cloacae P99 cephalosporinase Asn152 were simultaneously constructed and screened in Escherichia coli for their in vivo activity. The screen identified the previously uncharacterized mutants Asn152Ser, Asn152Thr, and Asn152Gly, which possess significant activity and altered substrate selectivity. In vitro measurement of Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants revealed that the Asn152Ser mutation causes a selectivity switch for penicillin G versus cefoxitin. Asn152Thr showed a 63-fold increase in k (cat) for oxacillin, a slow substrate for wild-type cephalosporinase. The results contribute to a growing body of data showing that mutation of highly conserved residues in the active site can result in substrate selectivity changes. The library screening method presented here would be applicable to substrate selectivity determination in other readily screenable enzymes.
TI  - Prevalence of qnr genes among extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacterial isolates in Barcelona, Spain.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the presence of qnr genes among enterobacterial isolates  carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Barcelona, Spain. METHODS: Screening for the qnrA, qnrB and qnrS genes was carried out by PCR amplification with specific primers in 305 non-duplicate, clinically relevant ESBL-producing enterobacterial isolates obtained from February 2003 to August 2004. ESBLs from all qnr-positive isolates were characterized by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. Plasmid analysis was performed by S1 digestion and hybridization with specific probes for the qnr and bla genes. Plasmids containing qnr genes were transferred by conjugation or transformation. The genetic environment of qnrA1 in selected isolates was characterized by cloning experiments. RESULTS: Fifteen isolates, each from a different individual, carried qnr. Among them, 14 had qnrA1 (6 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 Enterobacter cloacae and 2 Escherichia coli isolates) and 1 had qnrS1 (K. pneumoniae). None of the isolates carried qnrB. Among the qnrA1-carrying isolates, 10 possessed both bla(CTX-M-9) and bla(SHV-12), 2 had both bla(CTX-M-9) and bla(SHV-92) and 2 had bla(CTX-M-9) alone. The isolate with qnrS1 possessed bla(SHV-12). The qnrA1 and ESBL genes were located together on plasmids ranging in size from 40 to 320 kb. qnrS1 and bla(SHV-12) were not located on the same plasmid. Transfer of quinolone resistance was successfully achieved from all but three isolates. The cloned region surrounding qnrA in two K. pneumoniae isolates revealed a novel genetic organization. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of qnr among enterobacterial clinical isolates carrying ESBLs between 2003 and 2004 in Barcelona was 4.9%. qnrA1 was the most prevalent, whereas only one qnrS and no qnrB were detected.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activities of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against aerobic and anaerobic intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - We studied the serum bactericidal activity (SBA) of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against common pathogens associated with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Ten healthy volunteers received a single dose of moxifloxacin (400 mg) and levofloxacin (750 mg) and serum samples were collected at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24h after the dose of each drug. Bactericidal titers in serum over time were determined for aerobic gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Klebseilla pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae) and anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Prevotella bivia, and Finegoldia magna). Both fluoroquinolones provided rapid (2h) attainment and prolonged (24h) SBA (titers > or = 1:8) against each of the aerobic bacilli studied. SBA was observed for at least 12h against B. fragilis strains with MICs < or = 2 microg/ml to moxifloxacin and < or = 4 microg/ml to levofloxacin. Prolonged (12h) SBA (titers > or = 1:2) was also observed against isolates of B. thetaiotaomicron, P. bivia, and F. magna with moxifloxacin < or = MICs 2 microg/ml.
TI  - Composition of intestinal Enterobacteriaceae populations of healthy domestic pigs.
AB  - In this study, the Enterobacteriaceae microbiota, including their diversity as well as the distribution of haemolytic and virulence gene-harbouring Escherichia coli of 56-day-old healthy piglets, was characterized. Both the composition and the diversity of Enterobacteriaceae populations varied considerably between individual pigs and intestinal sections. E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae dominated the Enterobacteriaceae microbiota. However, mucosa-associated Enterobacteriaceae were scarce or in some cases undetectable. The majority of E. coli clones from the jejunum were also found in the colon, with up to 10 different E. coli clones in one intestinal section. Other Enterobacteriaceae species were represented by only one clone localized to one intestinal section. While several piglets did not harbour virulence gene-positive or haemolytic E. coli, such strains dominated intestinal sections of other animals. This study reveals that the diversity of intestinal Enterobacteriaceae is clearly individual. In general, Enterobacteriaceae do not appear to be a consistent fraction of the microbiota of the jejunum. High numbers of adherent bacteria do not appear to be essential for successful intestinal colonization, and E. coli clones do not necessarily colonize distinct intestinal sections based on the particular phylogenetic affiliation. Furthermore, dominance of haemolytic or virulence gene-positive E. coli does not correlate with disease. Finally, probiotic Enterococcus faecium feed supplementation does not affect the Enterobacteriaceae microbiota.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  - Previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of Proteus mirabilis. In the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, P. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. Little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which P. mirabilis encrusts catheters. In the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as Providencia stuartii and Klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with P. mirabilis, when Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii or Enterobacter cloacae were present, P. mirabilis was rarely or never found. The hypothesis that the absence of P. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. Experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of P. mirabilis with M. morganii, K. pneumoniae or E. coli had no effect on the ability of P. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. Co-infection with Ent. cloacae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly increased the time that catheters took to block (P <0.05). The growth of Ent. cloacae, M. morganii, K. pneumoniae or E. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with P. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. In the case of Ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (P < or =0.01). In all cases, however, P. mirabilis was able to generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. The results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between P. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with P. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.
TI  - [Pathogenic bacteria distribution and drug resistance analysis in burns department].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacterium  and find the proper measures of infection control. METHODS: Six hundred and eighty-two pathogenic bacteria strains were isolated and cultured from samples collected from January 2003 to December 2005. The pathogenic bacterium distribution and antibiotic resistance were analyzed. RESULTS: The detection rate of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive ones. The gram-positive bacteria accounted for 292 strains (42.8%), in which the detection rate of staphylococcus aureus is highest (16.7% of total) and the detection rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus accounted for 82.5% in staphylococcus aureus strains. Among 372 gram-negative bacteria strains (54.5%), the detection rate of bacillus aeruginosa, escherichia coli, baumannii and enterobacter cloacae were 12.5%, 11.1%, 9.1% and 8.2% respectively; extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were detected in 45 (60.8%) escherichia coli and 9 (42.9%) klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Eighteen strains of fungus were found, and it decreased in last 2 years. The detection rate of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and the antibiotic resistant strains kept increasing in the 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance of pathogenic bacterium is very serious in burns department. The irrational use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the antibiotic detection of pathogenic bacterium are all contributed to the drug resistance. It is important to enhance the asepsis, prevent hospital infection, detect the pathogenic bacteria and use antibiotics rationally in burns department.
TI  - Biochemical reference intervals and intestinal microflora of free-ranging Ricord's iguanas (Cyclura ricordii).
AB  - Caribbean iguanas, including the Ricord's iguana (Cyclura ricordii) are ranked as critically endangered on the International Union of the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. The taxon is endemic to Hispaniola, where it inhabits xeric lowlands and is found in a very limited range in two subpopulations in the southwestern area of the island. The goals of this study were to obtain and analyze plasma biochemical and intestinal microbiological data from Ricord's iguanas in the subpopulation of the Neiba Valley, on Cabritos Island National Park, Dominican Republic, and to establish biochemical reference intervals. A total of 23 blood samples from clinically healthy iguanas (16 males, 7 females) and 14 fecal samples from clinically healthy iguanas were analyzed. Adult female iguanas had higher concentrations of cholesterol, phosphorus, triglycerides, urea, uric acid, and aspartate transaminase activity compared with male iguanas, although the difference was not statistically significant. Seventeen bacterial isolates were obtained, including: Salmonella sp. (serogroup B; serogroup D negative) Escherichia coli, Brevibacterium sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterococcus durans. These data will help contribute to the management and recovery of Ricord's iguana populations.
TI  - Complex clonal and plasmid epidemiology in the first outbreak of Enterobacteriaceae infection involving VIM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase in Spain: toward endemicity?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report the emergence and spread of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs)  among enterobacterial isolates at Ramon y Cajal University Hospital (Madrid, Spain). METHODS AND RESULTS: During the period from March 2005 through September 2006, 25 patients (52% of whom were in the intensive care unit) were infected and/or colonized with single or different MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 patients; Enterobacter cloacae, 12 patients; Escherichia coli, 1 patient; and/or Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 patient). Clonal analysis (XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) revealed that all K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to the same clone, but 6 patterns were found among the E. cloacae isolates. Carbapenems were affected to different degrees (minimum inhibitory concentration, < or = 1 to > 8 microg/mL), as were aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin. The bla(VIM-1) MBL gene was present in all isolates; in addition, the bla(SHV-12) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene was detected in K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates. The bla(VIM-1) gene was detected within a 4.0-kb class 1 integron (bla(VIM-1)-aacA4-dfrII-aadA1-catB2) in K. pneumoniae and E. coli and in a 2.5-kb class 1 integron (bla(VIM-1)-aacA4-aadA1) in E. cloacae and K. oxytoca isolates. The bla(VIM-1) gene was transferable (filter-mating) in 14 of 14 K. pneumoniae isolates, 4 of 11 E. cloacae isolates, and 1 of 1 E. coli isolate. A 60-kb plasmid belonging to the IncI1 group was detected in the epidemic VIM-1-K. pneumoniae clone. Plasmids of 300- or 435-kb belonging to IncH12 group were found among E. cloacae isolates. CONCLUSIONS: K. pneumoniae-MBL monoclonal epidemics coexisted with E. cloacae-MBL multiclonal epidemics in our hospital. The spread of the bla(VIM-1) gene among Enterobacteriaceae was driven by clonal spread associated with intergeneric plasmid transfer with different class I integron platforms. Such complex epidemiology might anticipate endemicity and should be considered for the design of containment epidemiology strategies.
TI  - Preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  - The aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. One hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. On the basis of these results, 80% alcohol, Octenidine 0.1%, and Chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. The results of the questionnaire revealed that Chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and Octenidine by 7% of the dentists. Using the in vitro model, with the exception of S. aureus, Chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. In contrast, the treatment with Octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. The 80% alcohol was more efficient. No growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. On the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or Octenidine using an incubation time of 15 min with ultrasonication.
TI  - Dry stress and survival time of Enterobacter sakazakii and other Enterobacteriaceae in dehydrated powdered infant formula.
AB  - Powdered infant formula is not a sterile product, and opportunistic pathogens could multiply in the reconstituted product, resulting in neonatal infections. In this study, the generation of sublethally injured Enterobacteriaceae during desiccation and their persistence in dehydrated powdered infant formula was assessed during a 2.5-year period. The study included 27 strains of Enterobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella Enteritidis, Citrobacter koseri, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Escherichia vulneris, Pantoea spp., Klebsiella oxytoca, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The number of sublethally injured cells generated during desiccation was lower for K. oxytoca, Pantoea spp., Salmonella Enteritidis, and capsulated strains of E. sakazakii than for the other Enterobacteriaceae. The Enterobacteriaceae could be divided into three groups with respect to their long-term survival in the desiccated state. C. freundii, C. koseri, and E. cloacae were no longer recoverable after 6 months, and Salmonella Enteritidis, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli could not be recovered after 15 months. Pantoea spp., K. oxytoca, and E. vulneris persisted over 2 years, and some capsulated strains of E. sakazakii were still recoverable after 2.5 years.
TI  - [The antibacterial activity of fluoroquinolones against gram-negative bacteria isolated from Gifu Prefecture (2005)].
AB  - We investigated the susceptibility to 6 fluoroquinolones against 433 strains of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from 6 medical facilities in Gifu prefecture between January and September in 2005, determined by the agar dilution methods in according with the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. We also investigated the correlation between the degree of resistance to fluoroquinolones and the amino acid substitutions in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR). The tested clinical isolates were as follows, Salmonella spp.; 17 strains, Escherichia coli; 112 strains Citrobacter freundii; 35 strains, Enterobacter cloacae; 31 strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae; 73 strains, Proteus spp.; 18 strains, Providencia spp.; 3 strains, Morganella morganii; 14 strains, Serratia marcescens; 27 strains and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 103 strains. The number of the strains resistant to ciprofloxacin (CPFX) (MIC > or = 6.25 microg/mL) was twenty (E. coli; 14 strains, E. cloacae; I strain, Proteus spp.; 2 strains and P. aeruginosa; 3 strains). Among these strains, 12 strain (E. coli; 11 strains and E. cloacae; 1 strain) were highly resistant to CPFX (MIC > or =25 microg/mL). The E. coli strains highly resistant to CPFX had the multiple amino acid mutations in QRDR of ParC an GyrA. However in other strains, there was no strains possessing multiple mutations in both ParC and GyrA.
TI  - Competitive inhibition bacteria of bovine origin against Salmonella serovars.
AB  - Studies were conducted to isolate bacteria inhibitory to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium definitive type (DT) 104 in vitro from cattle not carrying Salmonella and to determine the inhibitory activity of the isolated bacteria through competitive growth in cattle feces artificially contaminated with Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 and S. enterica serovar Newport. Fecal samples (108) were obtained from dairy and beef cows. S. enterica serovars were isolated from 9.25% of the samples and included Salmonella Newport (4), Salmonella Bareilly (1), Salmonella Mbandaka (1), Salmonella Montevideo (1), Salmonella Meleagridis (1), and monophasic Salmonella (2). All four Salmonella Newport isolates were resistant to at least nine antibiotics. Of 1,097 bacterial isolates from cattle feces screened, 30 were inhibitory to Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 in vitro. The inhibitory isolates included 22 Escherichia coli, 6 Bacillus circulans, 1 Serratia fonticola, and 1 Enterobacter cloacae. Typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed 17 distinguishable profiles among the 22 E. coli. Competitive inhibition isolates did not significantly reduce Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 during 21 days of storage at 37 degrees C in cattle feces. B. circulans (10(5) CFU/g of inoculum) significantly reduced Salmonella Newport on days 3 and 5 and on day 21 with 10(8) CFU/g of inoculum at 37 degrees C. At 21degrees C, significant reductions of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 occurred with 10(8) CFU of gram-negative competitive inhibition bacteria per g and 10(5) CFU of B. circulans per g on day 5 only. No significant reductions were observed with Salmonella Newport at 21 degrees C. The 25 competitive inhibition bacteria identified in this study offer a first step in identifying competitive inhibition bacteria that may reduce the level of intestinal carriage and fecal shedding of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 and Salmonella Newport in cattle.
TI  - Structure--activity study of the antibacterial peptide fallaxin.
AB  - Fallaxin is a 25-mer antibacterial peptide amide, which was recently isolated from the West Indian mountain chicken frog Leptodactylus fallax. Fallaxin has been shown to inhibit the growth of several Gram-negative bacteria including Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we report a structure-activity study of fallaxin based on 65 analogs, including a complete alanine scan and a full set of N- and C-terminal truncated analogs. The fallaxin analogs were tested for hemolytic activity and antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate resistant S. aureus, (VISA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. We identified several analogs, which showed improved antibacterial activity compared to fallaxin. Our best candidate was FA12, which displayed MIC values of 3.12, 25, 25, and 50 muM against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, MSSA, and VISA, respectively. Furthermore, we correlated the antibacterial activity with various structural parameters such as charge, hydrophobicity H, mean hydrophobic moment mu(H), and alpha-helicity. We were able to group the active and inactive analogs according to mean hydrophobicity H and mean hydrophobic moment mu(H). Far-UV CD-spectroscopy experiments on fallaxin and several analogs in buffer, in TFE, and in membrane mimetic environments (small unilamellar vesicles) indicated that a coiled-coil conformation could be an important structural trait for antibacterial activity. This study provides data that support fallaxin analogs as promising lead structures in the development of new antibacterial agents.
TI  - Prevalence and expression of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant qnrA1.
AB  - Since its discovery, qnrA has been found in most common Enterobacteriaceae. Ciprofloxacin MICs conferred by different qnrA-positive plasmids could range from 0.1 microg/ml to 2 microg/ml in Escherichia coli J53. The reasons for different ciprofloxacin MICs conferred by qnrA have not been fully clarified. Five hundred forty-one consecutive gram-negative clinical strains that were resistant or intermediate to ciprofloxacin and that were isolated in Shanghai in 2005 were screened for qnrA by PCR. For qnrA-positive isolates, the transferability of quinolone resistance was determined by conjugation and mutations within the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of gyrA and parC. aac(6')-Ib-cr was detected and qnrA RNA expression was determined using real-time reverse transcription-PCR for transconjugants with different ciprofloxacin MICs. The qnrA gene was detected in 7 of the 541 clinical isolates. Quinolone resistance was transferred in four strains by conjugation. Mutations in the QRDR of gyrA and parC were detected in five qnrA-positive clinical strains with higher ciprofloxacin MICs. Of four qnrA-bearing plasmids in E. coli J53, pHS4 and pHS5 conferred ciprofloxacin MICs of 0.094 to 0.125 microg/ml; pHS3, which harbored the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene as well, conferred a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.25 microg/ml, and pHS6, which had both the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene and a high expression level of qnrA, had a ciprofloxacin MIC of 1.0 microg/ml. The prevalence of qnrA appeared to be higher in Enterobacter cloacae than in other Enterobacteriaceae. The coexistence of qnrA and aac(6')-Ib-cr in a single plasmid and increased qnrA expression can account for the different levels of ciprofloxacin resistance seen in transconjugants.
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - Postcollection synthesis of ethyl glucuronide by bacteria in urine may cause false identification of alcohol consumption.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a minor ethanol metabolite used as a specific marker to document recent alcohol consumption; confirm abstinence in treatment programs, workplaces, and schools; and provide legal proof of drinking. This study examined if bacterial pathogens in urine may enable postsampling synthesis of EtG and ethyl sulfate (EtS) from ethanol, leading to clinical false-positive results. METHODS: Urine specimens with confirmed growth of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Enterobacter cloacae were stored at room temperature in the presence of ethanol. Ethanol was either added to the samples or generated by inoculation with the fermenting yeast species Candida albicans and glucose as substrate. EtG and EtS were measured by LC-MS. RESULTS: High concentrations of EtG (24-h range 0.5-17.6 mg/L) were produced during storage in 35% of E. coli-infected urines containing ethanol. In some specimens that were initially EtG positive because of recent alcohol consumption, EtG was also sensitive to degradation by bacterial hydrolysis. In contrast, EtS was completely stable under these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of EtG in urine is not a unique indicator of recent drinking, but might originate from postcollection synthesis if specimens are infected with E. coli and contain ethanol. Given the associated risks for false identification of alcohol consumption and false-negative EtG results due to bacterial degradation, we recommend that measurement of EtG be combined with EtS, or in the future possibly replaced by EtS.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the United States between 1993 and 2004.
AB  - During the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care unit (ICU) patients in United States hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. MICs for 12 different agents were determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. The 11 organisms most frequently isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), Escherichia coli (18.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), Acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), Serratia marcescens (5.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), Proteus mirabilis (4.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and Citrobacter freundii (2.0%). Specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). Rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. Carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. E. coli and P. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. Mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with Acinetobacter spp. Rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study period for most species. Ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (Acinetobacter spp., C. freundii, E. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens) became more susceptible. The prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among ICU isolates of Acinetobacter spp., P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae.
TI  - Development of a base stacking hybridization-based microarray method for rapid identification of clinical isolates.
AB  - A base stacking hybridization-based microarray method was developed for rapid identification of clinical isolates within 2 h. The oligonucleotide probe sequences for species or genus-level identification were targeted against ribosomal RNA. Isolates were lysed and directly hybridized to the microarray-bound capture probes without conventional DNA or RNA isolation and prior polymerase chain reaction amplification. Five bacterial species encountered frequently in the clinical setting, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae, and one genus Enterococcus, could be discriminated by the microarray-based assay. Identification by this method matched biochemical identification for 150 of 152 clinical strains. This base-stacking hybridization microarray offers a simple, fast (</=2 h), and accurate identification of bacterial cultures and is a potential tool for routine clinical diagnosis.
TI  - Efficacy of a novel biofilter in hatchery sanitation: I. Removal of airborne bacteria, dust and endotoxin.
AB  - A novel biofilter containing organic, bentonite and halloysite media was applied  for elimination of microbial pollutants from the air of an industrial hatchery. The concentrations of total mesophilic bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, thermophilic actinomycetes, dust and bacterial endotoxin were determined in the air of hatchery during 2 months before installation of the biofilter, and during 6 months after installation of the biofilter, at the inlet and outlet ducts from each medium. Before installation of the biofilter, the concentrations of total mesophilic bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, thermophilic actinomycetes, dust and endotoxin in the air were within the ranges of 0.97-131.2x10(3) cfu/m3, 0.0-34.4x10(3) cfu/m3, 0.0-0.02x10(3) cfu/m3, 0.37-4.53 mg/m3, and 50.9-520,450.4 ng/m3, respectively. Enterococcus faecalis and Gram-negative bacteria (Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and other species) prevailed among bacterial species recovered from the air of the hatchery. A total of 56 species or genera of bacteria were identified in the air samples taken in the examined hatchery; of these, 11, 11 and 6 species or genera respectively were reported as having allergenic, immunotoxic and/or infectious properties The concentrations of total mesophilic bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis and endotoxin found at the inlet duct of the biofilter after its installation were significantly smaller compared to those recorded before its installation (p<0.05). The concentrations of Gram-negative bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis and dust found at the outlet ducts of biofilter after its installation were significantly smaller compared to those recorded at the inlet duct of the biofilter (p<0.01). The concentrations of total meso-philic bacteria were also smaller at the outlet ducts of the biofilter compared to that at the inlet duct; however, the difference was not significant because of the massive growth of Streptomyces species in the biofilter's media which contaminated the outcoming air. In conclusion, the applied biofilter proved to be effective in the elimination of potentially pathogenic bacteria, dust and endotoxin from the air of the hatchery. The efficacy of the biofilter could be improved by the inhibition of the Streptomyces growth in the media of the biofilter.
TI  - Expression of AmpC beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae isolated from retail ground beef, cattle farm and processing facilities.
AB  - AIMS: To better understand antibiotic resistance of Enterobacter cloacae isolates originated from food animals, the phenotypic and genotypic resistance of Ent. cloacae isolates from retail ground beef, cattle farm, processing facilities and clinical settings were investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ampC, ampD and ampR genes in the isolates were sequenced and analysed. beta-Lactamase activities and beta-lactamase profiles of the isolates were analysed by the enzymatic hydrolysis of nitrocefin and isoelectric focussing, respectively. The ampC gene of the Ent. cloacae isolate was cloned and transformed into Escherichia coli strains. The genomic DNA profiles of Ent. cloacae isolates were analysed by using pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Mutation at one residue (Val-54-->Ile) in the AmpR amino acid sequence was consistently found in Ent. cloacae isolates that were resistant to a broadspectrum of beta-lactam agents. The enzyme activity in the isolates was induced by cefoxitin. The pI (isoelectric point) of the enzymes produced by the test strains ranged from 8.4 to 8.9. Cloning of ampC gene of the Ent. cloacae isolate conferred the resistance to ampicillin, cephalothin and amoxicillin in recipient E. coli strains. One recipient of E. coli O157:H7 strain additionally acquired resistance to ceftiofur. The genomic analysis of Ent. cloacae isolates by PFGE showed that the isolates from various sources were genetically unrelated. CONCLUSIONS: The spread of diverse clones of AmpC-producing Ent. cloacae occurred in the ecosystem and retail products. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our findings suggested that AmpC-producing Ent. cloacae could be a contributor in spreading beta-lactamase genes in farm environments and food processing environments.
TI  - Convenient test using a combination of chelating agents for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases in the clinical laboratory.
AB  - Although transmissible metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) are a serious threat to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy, the CLSI currently does not recommend testing methods for the detection of MBLs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of double-disk tests (DDTs) by using disks containing a combination of the chelators 2-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) and Tris-EDTA (TE) to detect MBLs. Sixteen isolates (4 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, 6 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 Serratia marcescens isolate, 1 Aeromonas hydrophila isolate, 1 Aeromonas veronii isolate, 2 Chryseobacterium meningosepticum isolates, and 1 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolate) producing IMP-1, IMP-1-like, IMP-18, GIM-1, SPM-1, VIM-2, VIM-2-like, and chromosomal MBLs and 20 isolates (7 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 Escherichia coli isolates, 5 Enterobacter cloacae isolates, 2 S. marcescens isolates, 1 Proteus mirabilis isolate, and 2 A. baumannii isolates) producing non-MBL carbapenemases, AmpC beta-lactamases, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were tested. The DDT method was evaluated by using four types of chelator disks (TE, high-strength TE, MPA, and TE plus 20 microl of MPA [at various concentrations]) and the beta-lactams imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEM), ertapenem (ERT), and ceftazidime (CAZ). DDTs with IPM and a TE disk supplemented with 1:320 MPA detected all MBLs and yielded no false-positive results. Some, but not all, MBL producers were detected in IPM-based tests involving the single chelator TE or MPA alone or by ERT- or CAZ-based tests. IPM-based tests with MPA concentrations other than 1:320 and all MEM-based tests had suboptimal sensitivities or specificities. DDT with IPM and a TE disk supplemented with 20 microl of 1:320 MPA appears to be convenient for the detection of MBLs in the clinical laboratory.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiling of cefepime in plasma and peritoneal fluid of abdominal surgery patients.
AB  - This study was conducted to characterise the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cefepime in plasma and peritoneal fluid (PF). One gram of cefepime was administered to eight laparotomy patients and plasma and PF samples were collected at the end of 0.5 h infusion and every hour for 6 h. Drug concentrations were determined, analysed by population pharmacokinetic modelling and used for a Monte Carlo simulation with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data. The maximum concentration in PF was two-thirds of the value in plasma; however, the concentrations were higher in PF than in plasma at 0.68 h post dose. The probabilities of attaining the pharmacodynamic target (65% of the time above the MIC) were 92-99% in plasma (90% fraction unbound) and 93-100% in PF against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae with a regimen of 1 g every 12 h. However, 1 g every 8 h or 2 g every 12 h was required for values of 94-95% in plasma and 95-96% in PF against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results demonstrate that the pharmacodynamic exposures in PF were almost identical to those estimated from plasma data and provided a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic rationale for the dosing regimen for surgical intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens recovered from vegetables irrigated by wastewater in Morocco.
AB  - The authors obtained 50 vegetable samples from various regions in Morocco and examined them to determine the microbiological quality of these products. Aerobic count, coliform, enterococci, and Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated. This analysis revealed high levels of enterococci, fecal coliforms, and total coliforms. No coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was detected in any of the samples analyzed. Biochemical identification of Enterobacteriaceae showed the presence of Citrobacter freundii (28 percent), Enterobacter cloacae (27 percent), Escherichia coli (16 percent), Enterobacter sakazakii (12 percent), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17 percent), Serratia liquefaciens (11 percent), and Salmonella arizonae (0.7 percent). The results clearly demonstrate that vegetables irrigated with untreated wastewater have a high level of microbiological contamination. Consequently, these vegetables may be a threat for the Moroccan consumer and may be considered a serious risk to Moroccan public health.
TI  - Nosocomial outbreak due to extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase- producing Enterobacter cloacae in a cardiothoracic intensive care unit.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae has been associated with several outbreaks, usually involving strains that overproduce chromosomal beta-lactamase or, uncommonly, strains expressing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). Only sporadic cases of ESBL-producing E. cloacae have been identified in our hospital in recent years. We describe the epidemiology and clinical and microbiological characteristics of an outbreak caused by ESBL-producing E. cloacae in a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CT-ICU). Prospective surveillance of patients with infection or colonization by ESBL-producing E. cloacae among patients admitted to the CT-ICU was performed during the outbreak. Production of ESBL was determined by decreased susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and a positive double-disk test result. Clone relatedness was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). From July to September 2005, seven patients in the CT-ICU with ESBL-producing E. cloacae were identified (four males; median age, 73 years; range, 45 to 76 years); six patients had cardiac surgery. Four patients developed infections; three had primary bacteremia, one had ventilator-associated pneumonia, and one had tracheobronchitis. ESBL-producing E. cloacae showed resistance to quinolones and aminoglycosides. PFGE revealed two patterns. Five isolates belonged to clone A; two carried a single ESBL (pI 8.2 and a positive PCR result for the SHV type), and three carried two ESBLs (pIs 8.1 and 8.2 and positive PCR results for the SHV and CTX-M-9 types). Isolates belonging to clone B carried a single ESBL (pI 5.4 and a positive PCR result for the TEM type). Review of antibiotic consumption showed increased use of cefepime and quinolones during June and July 2005. The outbreak was stopped by the implementation of barrier measures and cephalosporin restriction. ESBL production could be increasingly common in nosocomial pathogens other than Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - [Drug-resistant bacteria isolated from pharyngeal swab cultures and urine in acutely or chronically febrile elderly nursing home inmates].
AB  - AIM: Patients in nursing homes are becoming more and more elderly and also prone  to infectious diseases. It is important to select proper antimicrobial agents in treating such patients because of the increase in drug-resistant bacteria in recent years. METHODS: Pathogenic aerobic bacteria were isolated from cultures of the pharyngeal swab obtained from patients with acute febrile episodes and those with chronic febrile conditions with a repetition of fever or continuing low-grade fever. Isolation of pathogens was also carried out in patients with a urinary tract infection that was resistant to treatment. Isolated bacteria were tested for sensitivity to commonly used antimicrobial agents. RESULTS: Pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 33% of the patients with acute febrile episodes, while they were isolated from 75% of the patients with chronic febrile conditions. The number of major pathogenic bacteria from 85 isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 13, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) 6, Streptococcus pneumoniae 8, beta-hemolytic streptococcus 5, Klebsiella pneumoniae 10, and Enterobacter cloacae 6. Only two isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-sensitive (PSSP), while the others were penicillin-resistant (PRSP) (1) or penicillin-insensitive (PISP) (5). Among these 8 isolates, 5 were resistant to levofloxacin (LVFX). Escherichia coli was isolated from the pharyngeal swab of 2 patients, one of the 2 isolates being resistant to LVFX. Escherichia coli was isolated from 5 patients with urinary tract infection and 5 of the 6 isolates were resistant to LVFX; with one of them being extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). CONCLUSION: The frequency of isolation of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens was extremely high among elderly patients in our nursing home compared to values reported from a nation-wide survey recently carried out in Japan. In particular, attention should be focused on the resistance of bacteria to fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Multiplex PCR for detection of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance qnr genes in ESBL-producing enterobacterial isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a rapid and reliable single-tube-based PCR technique for detecting simultaneously the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance qnrA, qnrB and qnrS genes. METHODS: After multiple alignments, primers were designed to detect known qnr variants (six for qnrA-, six for qnrB- and two for qnrS-like genes). They were used for screening a collection of 64 expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing enterobacterial isolates from Kuwait, collected from 2002 to 2004, as ESBL genes have been often associated with qnr genes. Sequencing was performed to identify qnr and associated ESBL genes. RESULTS: In optimized conditions, all positive controls (used separately or mixed) confirmed the specificity of the PCR primers. Out of 64 isolates, only 3 isolates were positive for a qnrB-like gene (4.7%), whereas no qnrA-like and qnrS-like gene was detected. A qnrB2 gene was detected in an Enterobacter cloacae K34 (SHV-12+) isolate, whereas qnrB1-like (termed qnrB7) and qnrB6-like (termed qnrB8) genes were identified from E. cloacae K37 (SHV-12+) and Citrobacter freundii K70 (VEB-1b+) isolates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We report here a fast and reliable technique for rapid screening of qnr-positive strains to be used for epidemiological surveys. A low prevalence of Qnr determinants among ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was identified in the study with Kuwaiti isolates.
TI  - [Biological hazards in air at municipal waste landfills].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the microbiological air quality at the selected municipal waste landfills. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted during the summer at two municipal landfills. Air samples were collected on agar plates. The evaluation was based on the concentration levels of airborne bacteria and fungi and the identification of isolated strains. RESULTS: The total number of bacteria and fungi did not exceed the level of 10(3) cfu/m3. The highest concentrations of bacteria in air were observed during unloading, disposing and compacting of municipal wastes (landfill 1 - 6,1 x 10(3) cfu/ml, landfill 2 - 5,4 x 10(2) cfu/m3). The highest concentrations of fungi in air were observed at filled up parts of the landfills (landfill 1 - 4,8 x 10(2) cfu/m3, landfill 2 - 1,2 x 10(3) cfu/m3). The qualitative analysis of the air samples indicated the presence of 21 bacterial and fungi. Among of them bacteria Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and fungi Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans are classified as harmful biological agents. CONCLUSIONS: The total number of bacteria and fungi in air samples collected at the selected municipal waste landfills did not exceed the reference values. The concentration levels of bioaerosols are diversified according to the size of the landfill, the total number of accumulated wastes and the level of area usage. It is suggested using by municipal waste workers personal protective equipment, especially for respiratory airways and skin and also keeping the rules of individual hygiene.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant QnrB4 identified in France in an Enterobacter cloacae clinical isolate coexpressing a QnrS1 determinant.
AB  
TI  - A neonatal calf with concurrent meningoencephalitis by Enterobacter cloacae and enteritis by attaching and effacing Escherichia coli (O128).
AB  - A neonatal calf developed nervous symptoms followed by diarrhea. The principal pathological changes were fibrinopurulent meningitis with necrosis of the cerebral parenchyma, and attaching and effacing lesions in the intestine. Cerebral necrosis was frequently associated with vascular changes. Enterobacter cloacae was isolated from the brain and Escherichia coli (O128) from the intestinal content. These suggest that cerebral and intestinal lesions were caused by the isolated organisms, and that most necrosis of the cerebral parenchyma might be infarctive.
TI  - [Bile duct infections as a late complication after endoscopic sphincterotomy].
AB  - Nowadays endoscopic sphincterotomy (SE) is considered to be a "gold standard" in  the treatment of residual choledocholithiasis and biliary pancreatitis. Nevertheless patients after invasive procedures concerning bile ducts with destruction of Oddi's sphincter often have increased succeptibility to chronic infections of bile ducts. AIM: Assessment of the influence of SE on bacterial colonization, development of main bile duct chronic inflammation and recurrent choledocholithiasis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included to the study 50 patients with main bile duct lithiasis, who underwent endoscopic cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Among them there were 32 women in age from 45 to 87 (mean 69.7 +/- 12.3) and 18 men in age from 39 to 84 (mean 59.8 +/- 11.56). The studied group was divided into 3 subgroups: In I (control) group were included 10 patients diagnosed with ERCP techniques because of jaundice of unknown origin. Those patients did't have ERCP or operative revision of bile ducts before, but all of them underwent cholecystectomy in the past. Each II and III group consisted of 20 patients, who underwent SE before 12-24 and 25-36 months earlier respectively. Sterile uodenoscope was inserted to the region of major duodenal papilla, and then a sterile brush was used to collect material to cytological smear (brushing) from main bile duct. In all groups 2 ml of bile were taken by a catheter to a syringe. On the basis of radiograms from ERCP findings, the width of main bile duct was assessed. In all patients blood cell count, aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, gammaglutamyltranspeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, bilirubin, C-reactive protein and procalcitonine levels were measured. RESULTS: In our study all 40 patients with previously performed endoscopic sphincterotomy (SE) had bacterial colonization in bile ducts, mostly with Gramm negative pathogens. The most virulent pathogens vere cultured from bile duct swabs from patients after two or more revisions of common bile duct, and after a longer time from sphincterotomy. Those patients had multibacterial bile duct infections (Escherichia coli + Pseudomonas aeruginosa; P. aeruginosa + Enterococcus faecalis; E. faecalis + Enterobacter cloacae + Candida albicans; P. aeruginosa + E. cloacae). E. coil and E. faecalis were most frequently cultured (20 and 16 cases respectively). It was observed that with length of time from endoscopic sphincterotomy, the width of main bile duct and also amount of cultured pathogens and their virulency grow. Elevated transaminases activity and serum procalcitonine levels were observed in studied groups. 9 patients after previous sphincterotomy had recurrent lithiasis. CONCLUSIONS: Sphincterotomy contributes to colonization of main bile duct with pathogenic bacteria. With length of time from endoscopic sphincterotomy, and amount of performed endoscopic sphincterotomies the amount of cultured pathogens, their virulency and drug resistance grow. Chronic infection of bile ducts after endoscopic sphincterotomy causes higher risk of recurrent lithiasis.
TI  - Retrospective analysis of bacteremia because of Enterobacter cloacae compared with Escherichia coli bacteremia.
AB  - A total of 52 patients of Enterobacter cloacae bacteremia from a University hospital during the period from January 2000 to June 2005 were analysed and compared with a reference group comprising 52 patients of Escherichia coli bacteremia. Overall, E. cloacae ranked the tenth in all pathogens of bacteremia accounting for 2.8% of the total patients. Although the incidence of E. cloacae bacteremia was low, the attributable mortality rate till achieved 13.5%. Most patients (86.5%) with E. cloacae bacteremia were hospital-acquired. The overwhelming majority of patients (92.3%) were men, while almost half of the patients (48.1%) were from the Department of Urological Surgery with underlying diseases such as urinal obstruction, kidney transplantation and kidney tumours. Possible risks factors associated with E. cloacae bacteremia included immunocompromised status, long-term hospitalisation and invasive procedures or surgeries. E. cloacae bacteremia significantly differed from E. coli bacteremia in a number of clinical aspects, including underlying diseases, portal of entry, infection type, risks factors, laboratory findings and appropriateness of empirical antibiotic therapy. Besides the high prevalence of resistance to cephalosporins, most E. cloacae blood isolates were also resistant to ciprofloxacin (resistance rate, 67.3%), gentamicin (73.1%) and tobramycin (73.1%). Based on the findings of the present study, E. cloacae is probably an important pathogen of bacteremia occurring in male patients with underlying urinal system illnesses.
TI  - Regional variations in multidrug resistance among Enterobacteriaceae in the USA and comparative activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - We report here on the activity of tigecycline and comparators against multidrug-resistant (resistant to >or=3 antimicrobial classes; MDR) Enterobacteriaceae from the USA collected between January 2004 and January 2006 as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST). Nationally, 131 (5.9%) Escherichia coli, 174 (10.1%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 (1.2%) Klebsiella oxytoca, 24 (4.9%) Enterobacter aerogenes, 126 (9.5%) Enterobacter cloacae and 20 (2.6%) Serratia marcescens isolates were MDR. Four isolates (two K. pneumoniae and two E. cloacae) were resistant to nine antimicrobials. Tigecycline performed well against MDR E. coli (MIC(90) 0.5 microg/mL, 0% resistant) and K. pneumoniae (MIC(90) 4 microg/mL, 9.2% resistant). A MIC(90) of 8 microg/mL was reported for tigecycline against the other MDR organisms studied here, notably lower than those of most comparators.
TI  - Emergence of RmtB methylase-producing Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae isolates from pigs in China.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the occurrence of 16S rRNA methylases conferring high-level resistance to aminoglycosides in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from two pig farms in China. METHODS: Enterobacteriaceae isolated from 151 pig rectal swab samples and 9 environmental samples were screened for the presence of the rmtA, rmtB, armA and rmtC genes by PCR and sequencing. Conjugation experiments were carried out to study the transferability of the 16S rRNA methylase genes. All isolates and their transconjugants were tested for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. The clonal relatedness of RmtB-producing Escherichia coli was assessed by PFGE with XbaI. RESULTS: Of 152 Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from pigs, 49 (32%) were positive for the rmtB gene, including 48 E. coli and a single isolate of Enterobacter cloacae. Of the nine Enterobacteriaceae isolates from environmental samples, no 16S rRNA methylase gene was identified. The 49 rmtB-positive isolates showed resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim and also carried a bla(TEM) gene. Transfer of the rmtB and bla(TEM) genes by conjugation experiments of all 49 isolates was successful, suggesting that the rmtB-containing plasmids in the E. coli and E. cloacae isolates were self-transmissible. Conjugative transfer frequencies varied from 2.2 x 10(-10) to 1.3 x 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient. The transfer of non-aminoglycoside antimicrobial resistance traits was also observed in most cases. Forty-four rmtB-positive E. coli showed 30 different PFGE types. CONCLUSIONS: The rmtB gene was detected on conjugative plasmids of porcine E. coli and E. cloacae isolates. Both horizontal gene transfer and clonal spread were responsible for the dissemination of the rmtB gene. The emergence of 16S rRNA methylases in Enterobacteriaceae isolates is described for the first time in China. This is also the first report of rmtB-positive Enterobacteriaceae among healthy food-producing animals.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial flora of nesting green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from Tortuguero National Park, Costa Rica.
AB  - Bacteriological examination of 70 nesting green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from Tortuguero National Park, Costa Rica was performed to investigate nasal and cloacal aerobic bacteria. A total of 325 bacterial isolates were obtained, including 10 Gram-negative and three Gram-positive genera. Two hundred thirty-nine were Gram-negative and 86 were Gram-positive isolates. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common microbe identified in turtle samples: 27/70 (38.5%) in cloacal, and 33/70 (47.1%) in nasal samples. The Enterobacteriaceae family, including Enterobacter agglomerans, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens, was the largest Gram-negative group of bacteria recovered and comprised 127 of 239 (53.1%) of the Gram-negative isolates. Staphylococcus species was the largest Gram-positive bacteria group, including S. aureus, S. cromogenes, S. epidermis, and S. intermedius, and made up 63 of 86 (73.2%) of the Gram-positive isolates recovered. The results of this study demonstrate that the aerobic bacterial flora of nesting green turtles at Tortuguero National Park is composed of a very wide spectrum of bacteria, including several potential pathogens.

TI  - Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  - Three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production in Enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD), the VITEK 2 System (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and the MicroScan WalkAway-96 System (Dade Behring, Inc., West Sacramento, CA), using routine testing panels. One hundred fifty putative ESBL producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. Conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the CLSI double-disk synergy test, and the Etest ESBL were also evaluated. Biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. One hundred forty-seven isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii were investigated. Of these isolates, 85 were identified as ESBL producers by the reference method. The remaining isolates were identified as non-ESBL producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal AmpC, Koxy, or SHV enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. The system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of ESBLs was the Phoenix (99%), followed by the VITEK 2 (86%) and the MicroScan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (Phoenix) to 78% (VITEK 2). The performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. The sensitivities of the conventional test methods ranged from 93 to 94%. The double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  - The most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 Italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. The most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). Overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. Three bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. Other prevalent bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, while Acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) isolates. 7% of S. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Although E. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among Enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. All the Gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)=4 microg/ml. Almost 10% of Escherichia coli, 14% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of Serratia marcescens and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. Amikacin was the most active antibiotic against P. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. Finally, Acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). The results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in Italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital setting in Italy.
TI  - Se(VI) reduction and the precipitation of Se(0) by the facultative bacterium Enterobacter cloacae SLD1a-1 are regulated by FNR.
AB  - The fate of selenium in the environment is controlled, in part, by microbial selenium oxyanion reduction and Se(0) precipitation. In this study, we identified a genetic regulator that controls selenate reductase activity in the Se-reducing bacterium Enterobacter cloacae SLD1a-1. Heterologous expression of the global anaerobic regulatory gene fnr (fumarate nitrate reduction regulator) from E. cloacae in the non-Se-reducing strain Escherichia coli S17-1 activated the ability to reduce Se(VI) and precipitate insoluble Se(0) particles. Se(VI) reduction by E. coli S17-1 containing the fnr gene occurred at rates similar to those for E. cloacae, with first-order reaction constants of k = 2.07 x 10(-2) h(-1) and k = 3.36 x 10(-2) h(-1), respectively, and produced elemental selenium particles with identical morphologies and short-range atomic orders. Mutation of the fnr gene in E. cloacae SLD1a-1 resulted in derivative strains that were deficient in selenate reductase activity and unable to precipitate elemental selenium. Complementation by the wild-type fnr sequence restored the ability of mutant strains to reduce Se(VI). Our findings suggest that Se(VI) reduction and the precipitation of Se(0) by facultative anaerobes are regulated by oxygen-sensing transcription factors and occur under suboxic conditions.
TI  - Effect of a chronic nail-biting habit on the oral carriage of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Nail biting is a common oral habit in children and young adults. However, its effect on the oral carriage of Enterobacteriaceae is unclear. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the differences in prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae in saliva samples from subjects with and without a nail-biting habit. METHODS: Saliva samples were taken from 25 subjects who were nail-biters and 34 subjects with no oral habit. The mean chronological age for all subjects was 13.5 +/- 1.9 years. The saliva samples were studied microbiologically. A Pearson chi-squared test was performed to compare the prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae in the saliva samples of the subjects with and without nail-biting habits. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found in the prevalence of Escherichia coli and total Enterobacteriaceae between both groups (P < 0.001). E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter gergoviae were found in the saliva samples of 19 of the 25 nail-biting subjects (76%), whereas E. coli, E. aerogenes and E. cloacae were detected in the saliva samples of only nine of the 34 subjects who were not nail-biters (26.5%). CONCLUSION: According to the results of the present study, the Enterobacteriaceae were more prevalent in the oral cavities of children with nail-biting habits than in children with no oral habit.
TI  - Emergence of ArmA and RmtB aminoglycoside resistance 16S rRNA methylases in Belgium.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: 16S rRNA methylase-mediated high-level resistance to aminoglycosides  has been reported recently in clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli only from a limited number of countries. This study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of this type of resistance in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from two Belgian hospitals and the characteristics of the strains. METHODS: We screened for high-level gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin resistance in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae consecutively collected between 2000 and 2005 at two laboratories by PCR for the armA, rmtA and rmtB 16S rRNA methylase genes. The beta-lactamase presence in the strains was also determined by phenotypic and genotypic methods. RESULTS: Overall armA genes were detected in 18 Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter amalonaticus whereas rmtB was detected in a single E. coli isolate. The rmtA gene was not found. All 16S rRNA methylase-bearing strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), predominantly type CTX-M-3, as well as various types of beta-lactamases. In the majority of the strains, the armA gene was carried by conjugative plasmids of the IncL/M incompatibility group whereas rmtB was borne by an IncFI plasmid. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the emergence of 16S rRNA methylases in Enterobacteriaceae in Belgium. The rapid spread of multidrug-resistant isolates producing both ESBLs and 16S rRNA methylases raises clinical concern and may become a major therapeutic threat in the future.
TI  - Accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - A prospective study is carried out to evaluate the performance of a protocol for  the accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Gram-negative bacteria. A modified double-disc test (MDDT) is incorporated in a Gram-negative template for routine susceptibility testing. The MDDT identified accurately ESBLs in all isolates subsequently confirmed as ESBL-producers by the standard Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) combined disc method. Of 1213 isolates tested, 98 (8%) were positive for ESBLs by MDDT and 95 (7.8%) were positive by the CLSI method. ESBLs were detected in 48 (7.8%) E. coli, 21 (8%) K. pneumoniae, 12 (5.8%) Proteus mirabilis, 13 (18.8%) Providencia stuartii and four (6.8%) Enterobacter cloacae isolates. Time required for ESBL detection by the MDDT method was one day. The protocol described provides a simple, rapid and low-cost method for early detection of ESBLs in Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Association of urinary tract infections and HIV infection in an internal medicine ward of Hospital of Point G-Bamako-Mali].
AB  - We gathered 14 clinical observations of urinary track infections in AIDS patients in Internal Medicine wards from August 1, 1998 to July 31, 1999. Urinary track infection and HIV were both present in 1.75% of 797 hospitalized patients. The specific prevalence was 14.43% among AIDS patients. The sex ratio (female/male) was 1.33. The mean age of patients was 37.2 years with ranges between 25 years and 59 years. Urinary symptoms were discret. Urinary tract infection was primarily evidenced by urine leucocytes > 10(4) organism/ml and a bacteriuria > 10(5) colony-forming units/ml. The main pathogenswere Escherichia coli (42.85%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.57%), Colibacilles app. (21.42%) and Enterobacter cloacae (7.14%). All isolated germs were sensible to the gentamicin, to the amikacin, to the nalidixic acid, to the cefoxitine, to the ceftazidime to the cefotaxime and the ciprofloxacin. Cephalosporin of 3rd generation, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolone can be used like treatment of first line in urinary tract infection suspicion case in Bamako. Our patients were highly immunosuppressed with the majority of them being in class IV C of CDC of Atlanta (90%) and CD4 count constantly bellow 200 cells/mm3. The main opportunistic affections were non bacilar bacterial pneumopathies (28.57%), oesophagal mycosis (71.42%), the association of cerebral toxoplasmosis and pulmonary tuberculosis (35.71%). All urinary infections were cured by mean of 5 days of treatment. Very few recidivism was found (1 case).
TI  - Enterobacteriaceae in dehydrated powdered infant formula manufactured in Indonesia and Malaysia.
AB  - To determine the occurrence of Salmonella and Shigella in infant formula from Southeast Asia, 74 packages of dehydrated powdered infant follow-on formula (recommended age, > 4 months) from five different manufacturers, four from Indonesia and one from Malaysia, were analyzed. None of the 25-g test portions yielded Salmonella or Shigella. However, further identification of colonies growing on selective media used for Salmonella and Shigella detection revealed the frequent occurrence of several other Enterobacteriaceae species. A total of 35 samples (47%) were positive for Enterobacteriaceae. Ten samples (13.5%) from two Indonesian manufacturers yielded Enterobacter sakazakii. Other Enterobacteriaceae isolated included Pantoea spp. (n = 12), Escherichia hermanii (n = 10), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 8), Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (n = 3), Citrobacter spp. (n = 2), Serratia spp. (n = 2), and Escherichia coli (n = 2). To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the contamination of dehydrated powdered infant formula from Indonesia with E. sakazakii and several other Enterobacteriaceae that could be opportunistic pathogens. Improper preparation and conservation of these products could result in a health risk for infants in Indonesia.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance in gram negative bacteria isolated from intensive care  units of Colombian hospitals, WHONET 2003, 2004 and 2005].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Surveillance systems play a key role in the detection and control of bacterial resistance. It is necessary to constantly collect information from all institutions because the mechanisms of bacterial resistance can operate in different ways between countries, cities and even in hospitals in the same area. Therefore local information is important in order to learn about bacterial behaviour and design appropriate interventions for each institution. Between January 2003 and December 2004, the Centro Internacional de Entrenamiento e Investigaciones Medicas (CIDEIM) developed a surveillance project in 10 tertiary hospitals in 6 cities of Colombia. OBJECTIVES: Describe the trends of antibiotic resistance among the isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomona aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter cloacae, five of the most prevalent nosocomial Gram negative pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The susceptibility tests were performed by automated methods in 9 hospitals and by Kirby Bauer in 1 hospital. Antibiotics with known activity against Gram negatives, according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, were selected. The laboratories performed internal and external quality controls. During the study period, the information was downloaded monthly from the databases of each microbiology laboratory and sent to CIDEIM where it was centralized in a database using the system WHONET 5.3. RESULTS: The high resistance rates reported especially for A. baumannii, evidenced the presence of multidrug resistant bacteria in both ICUs and wards at every studied institution. CONCLUSIONS: The creation of a national surveillance network to improve our capabilities to detect, follow up, and control the antibiotic resistance in Colombia is urgently needed.
TI  - Are laboratory-based antibiograms reliable to guide the selection of empirical antimicrobial treatment in patients with hospital-acquired infections?
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antibiograms are often taken into account to define a rational selection of an empirical antimicrobial therapy for treating patients with hospital-acquired infections. In this study, we performed a paired comparison between the antibiogram constructed with laboratory-based data and that formed with data subjected to prior clinical validation. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2005, the laboratory of microbiology printed in duplicate every individual susceptibility report corresponding to hospitalized patients and the copy was sent to the department of infection control. Every individual report was assessed in real time at the bedside of the patient by a multidisciplinary team for clinical significance and appropriateness of the specimen, as well as for the type, source and origin of the infection. Cumulative resistance rates were estimated in parallel at the laboratory with the whole data, and at the infection control department with data subjected to prior clinical validation. These rates were designated as 'laboratory-based' and 'clinically based', respectively. RESULTS: A total of 2305 individual susceptibility reports were assessed. Only 1429 (62.0%) were considered as clinically significant by the multidisciplinary team. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii group, Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, as well as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, were significantly more frequent in the clinically based rates (P < or = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory-based data underestimate the frequency of several major resistant organisms in patients with hospital-acquired infection. Previous clinical validation of the individual susceptibility reports seems to be a suitable strategy to get more reliable data.
TI  - [Development of Beta-lactamase resistance in enterobacteria].
AB  - Enterobacteria produce elementary chromosomal enzymes, Beta-lactamases of class A: TEM and SHV (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae). These can give rise to plasmid-coded broad-spectrum Beta-lactamases (ESBL) discovered in 1980 (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae). The first cefotaximase (CTX-M, MEN-1) was reported in Europe in 1990. This enzyme is far more active against cefotaxime than against ceftazidime and aztreonam. Chromosomal hyperpoduction of K1 Beta-lactamase differs from all other ESBLs due its sensitivity to ceftazidime (Klebsiella oxytoca). However, not all enterobacteria are resistant only because of ESBLs, but also as a result of the action of chromosomally or plasmid coded AmpC Beta-lactamase of class C (MIR-1, CMY-1, BIL-1, FOX-1, MOX-1, DHA-1, ACC-1), resistant to Beta-lactamase inhibitors and to cefoxitin (Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Morganelle spp., Serratia spp.). With the loss of outside-membrane porins (OMP) they can become resistant to carbapenem an tibiotics. The 100% resistance of enterobacteria to carbapenems that so far exists in this country is elsewhere in the world compromised by the incidence of carbapenem-hydrolysing plasmid-determined Beta-lactamase of class B (IMP-1, VIM-1) and of class A (KPC-1) in K. pneumoniae, (SME-1) in Serratia marcescens and (IMI-1, NMC-A) in E. clocae. Carbapenemases in enterobacteria are only effective in the presence of impermeability and other resistance mechanisms.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - Treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. Treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. Ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. It is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. The aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. Gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers and non-producers). Gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis. Ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). Killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. Ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the first few hours of the kinetic curves against E. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction in the first 2h), B. fragilis (4 log(10) CFU reduction in 4h), MSSA (3 log(10) CFU reduction in 4-6h), K. ozaenae (ESBL+), K. pneumoniae (ESBL+ and -), E. cloacae (ESBL-) in 1h and P. mirabilis (ESBL+) in the first 2h. The potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of E. coli-B. fragilis and E. coli-B. fragilis-E. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of S. aureus-P. mirabilis. These results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of Poland.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of Poland in years 2003-2005. Bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from California Mastitis Test (CMT) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. Some Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of API tests (Analytical Profile Index). It was found that 32.7% of samples that were CMT positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. Streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) (14.6%), Staph. aureus (8.6%), Gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and Corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. Escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among Gram-negative bacilli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), Serratia marcescens (3.1%), Pasteurella multocida (3.1%), Acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria species. Stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), Staph. hyicus (12.2%), Staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), Staph. sciuri (11.6%), Staph. chromogenes (8.8%), Staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and Staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent CNS. Streptococcus uberis (50%), Str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), Str. acidominimus (6.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among CAMP-negative streptococci. An increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, Staph. aureus, A. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by Str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.
TI  - Screening for anti-infective properties of several medicinal plants of the Mauritians flora.
AB  - Several plants of the Mauritian flora alleged to possess anti-infective properties were studied against different strains of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The grounded dried plant materials were extracted with different extractants and screened for anti-microbial activity using the disk diffusion and the micro-dilution techniques. Preliminary screening revealed that the methanol extracts were most active. Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus subtilis were the three test organisms, which were found to be susceptible to all the crude methanolic extracts of the different plants investigated (100% susceptibility), followed by Escherichia coli (57.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%). The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration recorded for the different crude methanol extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis and the mould fungus Candida albicans were 500, 1000, 125, 250, 1000 and 125 micro g/ml, respectively. Bioautography using Cladosporium cucumerinum revealed that dichloromethane (DCM) extracts had the highest activity against the phytopathogenic fungus. It was also noted that the DCM extracts of Michelia champaca and Antidesma madagascariense yielded the maximum number of growth inhibiting compounds against Cladosporium cucumerinum. Activity of the different crude extracts was also investigated against several phytopathogenic filamentous fungi, Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotium, Guignardia sp. and Fusarium oxysporum. It was found that crude hexane extracts as well as crude DCM extracts exhibited marked activity against several strains of fungi, especially Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Sclerotinia sclerotium and Guignardia sp.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Effect of tigecycline on normal oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora.
AB  - Antibacterial agents disrupt the ecological balance of the normal human microflora. Tigecycline, a member of a new class of antibiotics (glycylcyclines), has been shown to have a potent broad-spectrum activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The aim of the study was to investigate the ecological effects of tigecycline on the normal oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora of healthy subjects. Thirteen healthy white subjects (six females and seven males) between 20 and 31 years of age received 100 mg of tigecycline in the morning on day 1 as a 30-min intravenous infusion followed by a 50-mg dose of tigecycline every 12 h as a 30-minute infusion for 10 days. One subject was withdrawn on day 2 because of an adverse event (urticaria). Serum, saliva, and fecal samples were collected before, during, and after administration for microbiological cultivation and for assays of tigecycline. All new colonizing bacteria were tested for susceptibility (resistance of > or =8 mg/liter) during the investigation period. The fecal concentrations on day 8 were from 3.0 to 14.1 mg/kg, with a mean value of 6.0 mg/kg and a median value of 5.6 mg/kg. The saliva concentrations were generally low (0 to 0.12 mg/liter). A minor effect on the oropharyngeal microflora was observed. The numbers of enterococci and Escherichia coli cells in the intestinal microflora were reduced at day 8 (P < 0.05), while those of other enterobacteria and yeasts increased. There was a marked reduction of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria (P < 0.05) but no impact on bacteroides. No Clostridium difficile strains were isolated. Two Klebsiella pneumoniae strains and five Enterobacter cloacae strains resistant to tigecycline were found on day 8.
TI  - Dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in intensive care units of a medical center in Taiwan.
AB  - The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary hospital in Taiwan was assessed over a 16-month period. A total of 125 nonrepetitive ESBL-producing isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were available for investigation using molecular methods. Four predominant intensive care units (ICUs) were identified, and SHV-12 (59%), CTX-M- 3 (36%), and CTX-M-14 (14%) were the three most frequent ESBLs. SHV-12 was predominant among E. cloacae in the burn unit and K. pneumoniae in the other three chest medicine-related ICUs. CTX-M-3 was predominant among E. coli and K. pneumoniae in three other ICUs. The dissemination of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in four ICUs of a medical center in Taiwan is a consequence of the clonal dissemination of a few epidemic strains along with the horizontal transmission of resistance genes-carrying plasmids among bacterial organisms.
TI  - Potential prophylactic value of bovine colostrum in necrotizing enterocolitis in  neonates: an in vitro study on bacterial attachment, antibody levels and cytokine production.
AB  - Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an important disease of low birth-weight neonates. The immaturity of the gut mucosa may result in close contact between the host epithelium and microorganisms which are normally confined to the gut lumen. Damage of the mucosa due to endotoxin, cytokine production or other factors is believed to then occur. The aim of this study was to determine whether spray-dried bovine colostrum demonstrated potential in vitro as a prophylactic for NEC. Antiadherence was measured using a tissue culture assay and antibody levels against Enterobacteriaceae were determined by ELISA. The effect of bovine colostrum on the production of cytokines implicated in NEC was determined by a multiplex bead assay. Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae were common in both NEC positive and NEC negative infants and IgA and IgG1 antibodies to these species were present in the bovine colostrum. Pretreatment with bovine colostrum produced a significant decrease (P<0.001) in attachment of bacteria to HT-29 cells. Bovine colostrum significantly increased the production of IL-8 in HT-29 cells and IL-8, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in THP-1 cells (P<0.001). The potential of bovine colostrum to increase the production of inflammatory mediators could limit its usefulness.
TI  - Influence of culture site-specific MIC distributions on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of piperacillin/tazobactam and piperacillin: a data analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Investigators who perform pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling with Monte Carlo simulation have historically not stratified microbiological data by culture site. This lack of stratification might be problematic if susceptibility patterns differ among sites and might lead to differences in PK-PD. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the PK-PD of 2 antimicrobial regimens against 5 gram-negative bacterial species form 3 culture sites. METHODS: This data analysis was performed at the Department of Pharmacology, The University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas. Blood, pulmonary (ie, bronchial, endotracheal, lung, respiratory, sputum, and tracheal secretions), and wound distributions of MICs were extracted from the 2002 Intensive Care Unit Surveillance System database. Bacteria included Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The PK properties of piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g every 4 hours) and piperacillin (3 g every 4 hours) were obtained from studies in healthy volunteers. Monte Carlo simulation was used in 10,000 patients for each antimicrobial-bacteria-culture site combination. The cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for a free percentage time above the MIC of > or =50% was determined for each combination, and a clinically significant difference was defined a priori as > or =10%. RESULTS: Data from 2408 pulmonary, 490 blood, and 242 wound isolates were included. For piperacillin/tazobactam, the CFR varied <10% by culture site in all 5 bacterial species. Site-specific differences were noted in MIC50 for piperacillin versus E cloacae and E coli and MIC90 for piperacillin/tazobactam versus K pneumoniae and P aeruginosa. Likewise, for piperacillin, the CFR was similar among the 3 culture sites for P aeruginosa. However, the CFR for piperacillin varied by > or =10% for A baumannii (blood > wound), E cloacae (pulmonary > blood), E coli (pulmonary and blood > wound), and K pneumoniae (wound > blood). CONCLUSIONS: The PK-PD models based on PK properties found in healthy humans and site-specific MIC distributions in this study suggest that for piperacillin, culture-site differences subsequently resulted in CFR differences that exceeded a predetermined level of clinical significance. Furthermore, these data suggest that traditional reporting strategies for microbiological data (ie, MIC50 and MIC90) might fail to adequately characterize the MIC population.
TI  - FT-IR microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potentials and limitations of Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1570 FT-IR spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. A classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium at the species level. An average accuracy of about 80% was reached with Gram negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae families; Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter koseri; and Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Results were comparable with FT-IR measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with FT-IR microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. Some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Combination of FT-IR microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant qnrS in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - PCR was used to investigate the occurrence of the plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance determinants qnrA and qnrS among diarrhoeagenic enterobacterial isolates recovered from Hanoi, Vietnam, during the period March 2001 to April 2002. In total, 162 Escherichia coli isolates, 28 Shigella isolates and three Enterobacter cloacae isolates were negative for qnrA, while a single Ent. cloacae isolate harboured a 50-kb qnrS-positive conjugative plasmid. Cloning and sequencing identified a qnrS gene bracketed by open reading frames identical to those surrounding the qnrS gene of a Shigella flexneri isolate from Japan, thereby suggesting a common mechanism of acquisition.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Taiwan: epidemiology, detection, treatment and infection control.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) efficiently hydrolyze extended-spectrum beta-lactams such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. ESBLs are most often plasmid-mediated. In Taiwan, the prevalence of ESBLs in bacteria has risen, ranging from 8.5 to 29.8% in Klebsiella pneumoniae and 1.5 to 16.7% in Escherichia coli isolates. The most prevalent types of ESBLs are SHV-5, SHV-12, CTX-M-3, and CTX-M-14 in isolates of K. pneumoniae and E. coli, with differences between institutions. SHV-12 and CTX-M-3 have been reported as the most common ESBLs in isolates of Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, respectively. Molecular epidemiology studies suggest that the ESBL-encoding genes have been disseminated either by proliferation of epidemic strains or by transfer of plasmids carrying the resistance traits. The current ESBL screen guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) are issued for E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Proteus mirabilis. Owing to the lack of standard methods, it remains difficult to assure the presence of ESBL in an isolate co-harboring an AmpC beta-lactamase, particularly in cases where the latter is produced in larger amounts than the former. Empirical therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam to replace third-generation cephalosporins may help to reduce the occurrence of ESBLs in an institution with a high prevalence of ESBL producers. Carbapenems remain the drugs of choice for serious infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms. To retard the selection for carbapenem-resistant bacteria, 7-alpha-methoxy beta-lactams or fourth-generation cephalosporins can be therapeutic alternatives for mild-to-moderate infections provided that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic target can be easily achieved.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in Australia.
AB  - The aim of this study was to search for plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance determinants QnrA and QnrS in fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing enterobacterial isolates recovered in Sydney, Australia, in 2002. Twenty-three fluoroquinolone-resistant, of which 16 were also ESBL-positive, enterobacterial and nonrelated isolates were studied. PCR with primers specific for qnrA and qnrS genes and primers specific for a series of ESBL genes were used. A qnrA gene was identified in two ESBL-positive isolates, whereas no qnrS-positive strain was found. The QnrA1 determinant was identified in an Enterobacter cloacae isolate and in a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate, both of which expressed the same ESBL SHV- 12. Whereas no plasmid was identified in the E. cloacae isolate, K. pneumoniae K149 possessed two conjugative plasmids, one that harbored the qnrA and bla (SHV)-12 genes whereas the other expressed the carbapenemase gene bla (IMP-4). The qnrA gene, was located in both cases downstream of the orf513 recombinase gene and upstream of the qnrA1 gene, a structure identical to that found in sul1-type integron In36 and qnrA-positive strains from Shanghai, China. However, the gene cassettes of the sul1-type integrons were different. This study identified the first plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant in Enterobacteriaceae in Australia.

TI  - [Management of tertiary peritonitis in the patients complicated with intestinal fistula].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the etiology and management of tertiary peritonitis in  the patients with intestinal fistula. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-three cases of intestinal fistula complicated with tertiary peritonitis were reviewed. The microbiological characteristics, treatment Methods and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 114 males and 39 females with a mean age of (42+/- 19) years. The main causes of intestinal fistula included gastrointestinal surgery (40.5%), trauma (31.4%) and severe pancreatitis (14.4%), etc. The most common cultured bacteria of 157 specimens from 79 patients with tertiary peritonitis were Escherichia coli (24.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.8%), Enterobacter cloacae (10.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.3%). Debridement of the necrotic tissues, drainage of the abscess, continuous rinsing plus negative pressure drainage and antibiotics treatment were performed in 52 cases. Nineteen patients only changed from simple tube drainage to continuous rinsing plus negative pressure drainage. Twenty- eight patients changed to continuous rinsing plus negative pressure drainage and received antibiotics as well. Thirty- six patients received antibiotics and ecoimmune nutrition, while 18 patients only received ecoimmun nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal fistula complicated with tertiary peritonitis was mainly caused by residual infectious focus and inappropriate drainage. The rational treatments include reoperation for debridement of the necrotic and infectious tissues, changing drainage to continuous rinsing plus negative pressure drainage, appropriate usage of antibiotics, and ecoimmune nutrition.
TI  - Dissemination and persistence of blaCTX-M-9 are linked to class 1 integrons containing CR1 associated with defective transposon derivatives from Tn402 located in early antibiotic resistance plasmids of IncHI2, IncP1-alpha, and IncFI groups.
AB  - This study analyzes the diversity of In60, a class 1 integron bearing CR1 and containing bla(CTX-M-9), and its association with Tn402, Tn21, and classical conjugative plasmids among 45 CTX-M-9-producing clinical strains (41 Escherichia coli strains, 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 1 Salmonella enterica strain, and 1 Enterobacter cloacae strain). Forty-five patients in a Spanish tertiary care hospital were studied (1996 to 2003). The diversity of In60 and association of In60 with Tn402 or mercury resistance transposons were investigated by overlapping PCR assays and/or hybridization. Plasmid characterization included comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns and determination of incompatibility group by PCR-based replicon typing, sequencing, and hybridization. CTX-M-9 plasmids belonged to IncHI2 (n = 26), IncP-1alpha (n = 10), IncFI (n = 4), and IncI (n = 1) groups. Genetic platforms containing bla(CTX-M-9) were classified in six types in relation to the In60 backbone and in eight subtypes in relation to Tn402 derivatives. They were associated with Tn21 sequences when located in IncP-1alpha or IncHI2 plasmids. Our study identified bla(CTX-M-9) in a high diversity of CR1-bearing class 1 integrons linked to different Tn402 derivatives, often to Tn21, highlighting the role of recombination events in the evolution of antibiotic resistance plasmids. The presence of bla(CTX-M-9) on broad-host-range IncP-1alpha plasmids might contribute to its dissemination to hosts that were not members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Replicon typing of plasmids encoding resistance to newer beta-lactams.
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction-based replicon typing represents a novel method to describe the dissemination and follow the evolution of resistance plasmids. We used this approach to study 26 epidemiologically unrelated Enterobacteriaceae and demonstrate the dominance of incompatibility (Inc) A/C or Inc N-related plasmids carrying some emerging resistance determinants to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems.
TI  - Resistance in gram-negative bacteria: Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The emergence and spread of resistance in Enterobacteriaceae are complicating the treatment of serious nosocomial infections and threatening to create species resistant to all currently available agents. Approximately 20% of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections and 31% of Enterobacter spp infections in intensive care units in the United States now involve strains not susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. Such resistance in K pneumoniae to third-generation cephalosporins is typically caused by the acquisition of plasmids containing genes that encode for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and these plasmids often carry other resistance genes as well. ESBL-producing K pneumoniae and Escherichia coli are now relatively common in healthcare settings and often exhibit multidrug resistance. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae have now emerged in the community as well. Salmonella and other Enterobacteriaceae that cause gastroenteritis may also be ESBL producers, which is of relevance when children require treatment for invasive infections. Resistance of Enterobacter spp to third-generation cephalosporins is most typically caused by overproduction of AmpC beta-lactamases, and treatment with third-generation cephalosporins may select for AmpC-overproducing mutants. Some Enterobacter cloacae strains are now ESBL and AmpC producers, conferring resistance to both third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins. Quinolone resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is usually the result of chromosomal mutations leading to alterations in target enzymes or drug accumulation. More recently, however, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance has been reported in K pneumoniae and E coli, associated with acquisition of the qnr gene. The vast majority of Enterobacteriaceae, including ESBL producers, remain susceptible to carbapenems, and these agents are considered preferred empiric therapy for serious Enterobacteriaceae infections. Carbapenem resistance, although rare, appears to be increasing. Particularly troublesome is the emergence of KPC-type carbapenemases in New York City. Better antibiotic stewardship and infection control are needed to prevent further spread of ESBLs and other forms of resistance in Enterobacteriaceae throughout the world.
TI  - Production and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies specific for Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Seven monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for Escherichia coli O157:H7, one of  the major causes of haemorrhagic colitis in humans, were produced by immunising Balb/c mice with the strain E. coli O157:H7. These monoclonal antibodies do not cross-react with other bacteria such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, E. coli O14, E. coli JM109, S. enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. panama, S. saintpaul, S. derby, S. muenchen, S. bredeney, S. hadar, Yersinia enterocolitica, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneri, Listeria ivanovii, L. monocytogenes 13M, L. innocua, Enterobacter cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. amnigenus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia fergussoni or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Of the seven MAbs obtained, MAb 8B8C3 was selected to prepare a high-sensitivity sandwich ELISA method specific for O157:H7.
TI  - Purification, characterization, and gene cloning of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of Enterobacter cloacae P240.
AB  - We found the occurrence of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase in Enterobacter cloacae P240, isolated from soils under anaerobic conditions, and purified the enzyme to homogeneity. The purified enzyme was a homohexamer of identical 60 kDa subunits. The purified decarboxylase catalyzed the nonoxidative decarboxylation of 4-hydroxybenzoate without requiring any cofactors. Its Km value for 4-hydroxybenzoate was 596 microM. The enzyme also catalyzed decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, for which the Km value was 6.80 mM. In the presence of 3 M KHCO3 and 20 mM phenol, the decarboxylase catalyzed the reverse carboxylation reaction of phenol to form 4-hydroxybenzoate with a molar conversion yield of 19%. The Km value for phenol was calculated to be 14.8 mM. The gene encoding the 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase was isolated from E. cloacae P240. Nucleotide sequencing of recombinant plasmids revealed that the 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase gene codes for a 475-amino-acid protein. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme is similar to those of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of Clostridium hydroxybenzoicum (53% identity), VdcC protein (vanillate decarboxylase) of Streptomyces sp. strain D7 (72%) and 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of Escherichia coli (28%). The hypothetical proteins, showing 96-97% identities to the primary structure of E. cloacae P240 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, were found in several bacterial strains.

TI  - Resistance in gram-negative bacteria: enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The emergence and spread of resistance in Enterobacteriaceae are complicating the treatment of serious nosocomial infections and threatening to create species resistant to all currently available agents. Approximately 20% of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections and 31% of Enterobacter spp infections in intensive care units in the United States now involve strains not susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. Such resistance in K pneumoniae to third-generation cephalosporins is typically caused by the acquisition of plasmids containing genes that encode for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and these plasmids often carry other resistance genes as well. ESBL-producing K pneumoniae and Escherichia coli are now relatively common in healthcare settings and often exhibit multidrug resistance. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae have now emerged in the community as well. Salmonella and other Enterobacteriaceae that cause gastroenteritis may also be ESBL producers, which is of relevance when children require treatment for invasive infections.

TI  - Elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (PCs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. Which key steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten bacteria species were used. Blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees C for 8 hours. The buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. PCs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. At each preparation step and during PC storage, bacteria contents were measured. In additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees C for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. Titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. Compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the PCs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. With the exception of P. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the PCs. Remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor PCs. Also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for most species. When buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.
TI  - Confirmation of E. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  - Paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. Some are rich in wood fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. Others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. Still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their coliform microflora. Therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. For the first series of analyses, the medium used was Colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to isolate bacteria in pure culture on MacConkey agar. In a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase activities, were used to isolate bacteria. First, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. Also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 MPN/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. From this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on MacConkey medium and identified as Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter sp, E. sakazakii, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Pantoea sp, Raoultella terrigena, R. planticola. Second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 MPN/g (d.w) sludge, whereas E. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 MPN/g (d.w.) sludge. The presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and E. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in large quantities. Also, indigenous E. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated E. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. In this second series of isolations, API20E and Biolog identified most isolates as E. coli, but others remained unidentified. The sequences of the 16S rDNA confirmed that most isolates were likely E. coli, few Burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. This study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.

TI  - Gram-negative meningitis and infections in individuals treated with intrathecal baclofen for spasticity: a retrospective study.
AB  - The aim of this retrospective study was to describe signs, symptoms, and clinical outcomes of individuals undergoing intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy who experienced pump-related Gram-negative infections including meningitis. Participants included 12 individuals (nine males, three females) aged 10 to 32 years (mean 17y 9mo), nine of whom had quadriplegic CP. A total of 571 baclofen pump surgeries were performed with 45 total infections. Of the 45 infections, 12 were by Gram-negative organisms, two resulting in meningitis. Ten of 12 Gram-negative infections (21 site encounters) occurred within 60 days of surgery. Eleven of 12 pumps were explanted. By site encounters, Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for eight Gram-negative infections, Escherichia coli for five, Proteus for three, Enterobacter cloacae for two, and Klebsiella, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter vulnaris for one each. Two individuals with Gram-negative meningitis were admitted 72 to 96 hours after hospital discharge following pump replacement. Both patients had rapid deterioration requiring transfer to the pediatric intensive care unit, and developed coagulopathy and decrease in responsiveness. Both have improved and have elected not to replace the ITB pump. In Gram-negative infections in ITB therapy, the progression of signs and symptoms can be swift and devastating. Identification of the infectious agent in such cases is imperative; these infections can quickly become life threatening.
TI  - Characterisation and molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacter cloacae isolated from a district teaching hospital in Taiwan.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae (n = 110) isolates from a district hospital in Taiwan were screened for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). In total, 17 ESBL-producers were identified, based on the combination-disk synergy test using cefotaxime and ceftazidime +/- clavulanic acid. Investigation of ESBL genes in 33 ceftazidime-resistant isolates revealed the SHV-12 gene in the same 17 ESBL-producers. In addition, one isolate also carried the CTX-M-3 gene, and two isolates also carried the CTX-M-9 gene. No major epidemic clone of ESBL-producers was identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Routine screening for the ESBL phenotype, focusing on ceftazidime-resistant E. cloacae, should be undertaken in this area.
TI  - [Infection pathogen analysis of 2388 patients in an open hematology ward from 1993 to 2004].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of infection and pathogens in hematology  ward. METHODS: The data of incidence, pathogen, and outcome of infection of 2388 hospitalized patients in an open hematology ward of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1993 to 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The overall incidence of infection was 34.3% according to the person-times of hospitalization, 24.4% for nosocomial infection and 9.9% for community-acquired infection. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infection were Gram negative. The most common bacteria in the sputum samples included Enterobacter (27%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRSCoN, 12%), the most common bacteria in the blood samples included Escherichia coli (43%), Enterobacter cloacae (11%), and Klebsiella (11%). Whereas in the community-acquired infection the most common bacteria in the sputum samples were Haemophilus parainfluenzae (15%), MRSCoN (28%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (10%), and the most common bacteria in the blood samples were MRSCoN (28%), E. coli (28%), and Klebsiella (9.4%). Fungi were more often found in nosocomial infection, especially in the sputum samples. 12-year follow up showed that in nosocomial infection Pseudomonas aeruginosa remained the most common bacteria in the sputum samples, whereas E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae became the major bacteria in the blood samples. In community-acquired infection, the proportion of Staphylococcus aureus, that of Klebsiella in blood samples, and that of E. coli in throat swab samples increased in recent years. The incidence of fungi infection had increased in both nosocomial infection and community acquired infection. The mortality of nosocomial infection was 6.1%, higher than that of the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant (P = 0.17). There was a trend of decrease in the mortality of community-acquired infection but did not in the nosocomial infection. CONCLUSION: The patients in hematology ward are susceptible to infection, especially nosocomial infection that has a higher mortality rate in comparison with the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant. The pathogens of nosocomial infection are most likely G- bacteria, fungi and other bacteria resistant to most antibiotics. The mortality rate of nosocomial infection remains almost unchanged in the 12-year follow up.
TI  - [Clinical observation of the effects of FE combined enzymes on the infection of the granulation burn wound during late post burns stage].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of combined FE enzymes on the infection of the  granulation burn wound during late postburn stage in controlling burn wound infection caused by common antibiotic resistant bacteria. METHODS: Thirty patients in our burn ward were enrolled and were randomly divided into A [treated with combined FE enzymes (50 ml dissolved in 0-150 ml normal saline to reach the final concentration of 1-3 U/ml)] and B (treated with gentamicin) groups, with 15 patients in each group. Several layers of gauze, either soaked with combined FE enzyme in A or gentamicin in B group, were used to cover the burn wounds once to twice a day. Bacterial culture from the burn wound exudation before and after drug administration was done before the application of the agents. The bacteria in the burn wounds and their susceptibility to antibiotics were identified. The healing time of the burn wounds was recorded. Furthermore, the healing rate of the burn wound was recorded on the 3rd, 5th, 8th, 10th and 12th post skin grafting days (PSGD). RESULTS: The dominating bacteria in the burn wounds in both groups were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and MRSA. The susceptibility rate of bacteria ( MRSA, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyte, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) to combined FE enzyme was 93.8%, 100.0%, 100.0%, 100.0%, 100.0% and 95.0% respectively, which were much higher than those in B group (17.6%, 31.3%, 28.6%, 44.0%, 33.3%, 28.0% respectively, P < 0.1. The wound healing time after skin grafting in A group (10.6 +/- 1.5 days) was significantly shorter than that in B group (15.3 +/- 1.7 days, P < 0.01). The wound healing rate on 10 PSGD in A group was (85.4 +/- 2.4)%, and which was only (51.3 +/- 1.5% in B group (P < 0.01) CONCLUSION: Combined FE enzyme can effectively control burn wound infection, so that the interval between skin grafting and wound healing can be shortened and success rate of skin grafting be improved.
TI  - Application of minimal sequence quality values prevents misidentification of the  blaSHV type in single bacterial isolates carrying different SHV extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes.
AB  - Nucleotide sequencing is the standard molecular method for determination of the beta-lactamase gene present in an isolate. Using minimal sequence quality values prevents misidentification of bla(SHV) genes, as illustrated by three strains of three different species that each contained two different bla(SHV) alleles, SHV-2 and SHV-12.
TI  - First report of CTX-M-15 and CTX-M-3 beta-lactamases among clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae in Bejaia, Algeria.
AB  - We assessed the prevalence and phenotypic characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers among 365 clinical isolates of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae recovered from two hospitals in Bejaia, Algeria, between March 2004 and April 2005. Twenty-one strains were resistant to cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime. A double-disk synergy test yielded a positive result in five cases (three Escherichia coli, one Klebsiella pneumoniae and one Enterobacter cloacae). Using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing, the three E. coli isolates and the K. pneumoniae isolate were found to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase CTX-M-15 and the E. cloacae isolate produced CTX-M-3. The three CTX-M-15-producing E. coli isolates were not isolated in the same wards, although genotyping by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis revealed that they were clonally related. The bla(CTX-M-15) genes were transferred from E. coli by conjugation, whilst conjugative transfer of bla(CTX-M) genes from K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae was not detectable.
TI  - Epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli  at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand, 2003.
AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted from August to September, 2003 to determine the prevalence and risk factors in acquiring extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing gram-negative bacilli (GNB) in patients admitted to Siriraj Hospital and the outcomes of these infections. Of 346 isolates of gram-negative bacteria in 249 patients, 102 isolates from 87 patients were colonization only, but 244 isolates from 162 patients were infections. The common GNB were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter cloacae. The overall prevalence of ESBL producers was 30.1%. K. pneumoniae had a very high prevalence of ESBL producers (56.9%). The urinary tract was the most common site for ESBL- producing GNB infections. Nosocomial infections, duration from admission to infection, peripheral line, urinary catheterization, nasogastric tube insertion and previous use of beta-lactams, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones were associated with acquiring ESBL-producing GNB infections. ESBL-producing GNB were significantly more resistant to antimicrobial agents. More than 80% of ESBL-producing GNB were susceptible to carbapenems. Mortality in patients infected with ESBL-producing GNB (41.3%) was significantly higher than those infected with non- ESBL-producing GNB (19.8%).
TI  - Bacteriological urinalysis in patients after renal transplantation.
AB  - The study consisted of microbiological urinalysis performed in 269 patients after renal transplantation who remained under medical care at the Outpatient Service of the Transplantation Institute in Warsaw. The patients enrolled into the study had undergone renal transplantation 6 to 72 months before urine samples were collected. 304 urinalysis were performed. In the group of 269 patients, 42 individuals had bacteria in their urine what was confirmed in 47 urine cultures. Cases of bacteriuria were divided into 5 groups: 5 cases of symptomatic urinary tract infection (5 individuals--2% of all studied patients), 27 cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria in 22 individuals (8% of all studied patients), 5 cases of insignificant bacteriuria in 5 patients (2%), 10 cases of involuntary urine contamination in 10 cases (4%). Eventually, urinary tract infection (UTI) was established in 27 patients (5 cases of symptomatic UTI and 22 cases of asymptomatic UTI) what makes out for 10% of all studied patients. In cases where urinalysis showed significant bacteriuria, following pathogens were detected in urine cultures: Escherichia coli: 22 strains, Enterococcus faecalis--4 strains, Enterobacter cloacae--2 strains and 1 strains of Ralstonia picketii, Streptococcus uberis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Over 90% of Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, as well as to amikacin and aztreonam which are the drugs usually administered intravenously in hospitalized patients. The only drug of similar efficacy, which could be administered orally in outpatients was fosfomycin.
TI  - Purification and characterization of TrzF: biuret hydrolysis by allophanate hydrolase supports growth.
AB  - TrzF, the allophanate hydrolase from Enterobacter cloacae strain 99, was cloned,  overexpressed in the presence of a chaperone protein, and purified to homogeneity. Native TrzF had a subunit molecular weight of 65,401 and a subunit stoichiometry of alpha(2) and did not contain significant levels of metals. TrzF showed time-dependent inhibition by phenyl phosphorodiamidate and is a member of the amidase signature protein family. TrzF was highly active in the hydrolysis of allophanate but was not active with urea, despite having been previously considered a urea amidolyase. TrzF showed lower activity with malonamate, malonamide, and biuret. The allophanate hydrolase from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP, AtzF, was also shown to hydrolyze biuret slowly. Since biuret and allophanate are consecutive metabolites in cyanuric acid metabolism, the low level of biuret hydrolase activity can have physiological significance. A recombinant Escherichia coli strain containing atzD, encoding cyanuric acid hydrolase that produces biuret, and atzF grew slowly on cyanuric acid as a source of nitrogen. The amount of growth produced was consistent with the liberation of 3 mol of ammonia from cyanuric acid. In vitro, TrzF was shown to hydrolyze biuret to liberate 3 mol of ammonia. The biuret hydrolyzing activity of TrzF might also be physiologically relevant in native strains. E. cloacae strain 99 grows on cyanuric acid with a significant accumulation of biuret.
TI  - qnrB, another plasmid-mediated gene for quinolone resistance.
AB  - A novel plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance gene, qnrB, has been discovered in  a plasmid encoding the CTX-M-15 beta-lactamase from a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain isolated in South India. It has less than 40% amino acid identity with the original qnr (now qnrA) gene or with the recently described qnrS but, like them, codes for a protein belonging to the pentapeptide repeat family. Strains with qnrB demonstrated low-level resistance to all quinolones tested. The gene has been cloned in an expression vector attaching a polyhistidine tag, which facilitated purification to >or=95% homogeneity. As little as 5 pM of QnrB-His6 protected purified DNA gyrase against inhibition by 2 microg/ml (6 microM) ciprofloxacin. With a PCR assay qnrB has been detected in Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli isolates from the United States, linked to SHV-12 beta-lactamase and coding for a product differing in five amino acids from the Indian (now QnrB1) variety. The qnrB gene has been found near Orf1005 in some, but not all, plasmids and in association with open reading frames matching known chromosomal genes, suggesting that it too was acquired by plasmids from an as-yet-unknown bacterial source.
TI  - Characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Kuwait and  UK strains identified by the Vitek system, and subsequent comparison of the Vitek system with other commercial ESBL-testing systems using these strains.
AB  - Two hundred and fifty-one unique patient isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (123), Escherichia coli (114), Klebsiella oxytoca (7), Enterobacter cloacae (5) and Citrobacter freundii (2), flagged as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive by the Vitek system (GNS-526 card), were collected. These strains were isolated from a variety of clinical specimens submitted to the clinical bacteriology laboratories of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE), Edinburgh, UK (and associated GP practices), Hairmyers Hospital, Glasgow, UK, and the Amiri and Farwania Hospitals, Kuwait. Of the 101 RIE strains tested, 15 E. coli strains were found to be ESBL negative by Etest ESBL strips. On retesting the 15 E. coli strains with the Vitek GNS-532 card, 14 were found to be ESBL negative, despite being originally flagged as ESBL positive. The remaining 236 ESBL-producing strains were also subjected to the double disc-diffusion (DDD) technique for the detection of ESBLs. Of these, two were false negatives by Etest ESBL test strips (using both cefotaxime and ceftazidime strips), and 38 were false negatives by the DDD method. The Etest false-negative ESBL-producing strains of K. pneumoniae were positive by DDD. Technically, the Vitek method was the least demanding method to perform, as it was an integral part of the routine susceptibility test card. Etest strips were reliable, but were the most expensive of all the techniques used. The DDD test, while relatively inexpensive, was technically subjective, and in our hands, seven of the ESBL-positive strains that were confirmed by the other two techniques were not detected. Despite the false-positive ESBL-producing E. coli strains, the Vitek susceptibility card with its integral ESBL test offers the clinical laboratory a valuable and quick option to screen for ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. and E. coli as part of the routine laboratory methodology.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MIC90 of MEPM for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. MEPM were active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (IPM) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (87.9%). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in Serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in Proteus mirabilis. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, Peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). Therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - Clonal occurrences of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli: report from the  Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection Surveillance Program in the United States (2004).
AB  - The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection Program is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network of more than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum agents. Between 1999 and 2004, a total of 10-16 US medical centers referred up to 200 nonduplicate isolates from clinical infections to a central processing laboratory. Over this 6-year period, the antimicrobial activity of 12 broad-spectrum agents was assessed against 15990 bacterial isolates using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) reference methods. Analysis of the MIC results by year within organism species and/or organism groups revealed a continued decrease in fluoroquinolone susceptibility (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), especially among indole-positive Proteae (-22.1%), Escherichia coli (-17.0%), Enterobacter species (-10.0%), and Proteus mirabilis (-7.6%) isolates. Antibiogram analysis of strains demonstrating multidrug resistance from the same institutions were further characterized by automated ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine clonality. In 2004, a total of 165 selected multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains produced 64 different ribotypes with the largest representing 31 Escherichia coli isolates from 6 medical centers. Other clusters were also identified within single medical centers among Enterobacter cloacae (6 strains), Providencia stuartii (5 strains), and Morganella morganii (4 strains). A significant clonal outbreak encompassing 40 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from 3 centers in a single endemic region was identified in 1999 and has persisted through 2004. Continued surveillance of these broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents against MDR pathogens appears warranted to monitor the incidence and spread of resistant clones causing serious infections. Possible emergence of resistance mechanisms via clonal dissemination proves to be among the principle threats that compromise carbapenem therapy, where meropenem maintains the broadest spectrum of coverage.
TI  - Prevalences of zoonotic bacteria among seabirds in rehabilitation centers along the Pacific Coast of California and Washington, USA.
AB  - Many seabirds are rehabilitated annually by wildlife rehabilitation centers along the Pacific Coast, USA. Although various strains of zoonotic bacteria have been isolated from seabirds, risks to rehabilitators at these centers have not been well documented. From November 2001 through January 2003, we determined the prevalence of detectable enteric fauna by isolation and characterization of Gram-negative bacteria from cloacal swabs taken from 26 common murres (Uria aalge), 49 gulls (Larus spp.), and 14 other seabirds treated by rehabilitators in California and Washington (USA). At least 25 bacterial species were identified, including multiple strains of Escherichia coli, as well as Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Antibiotic resistance was found in 13 of 19 bacterial isolates tested, including E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Potential transfer of these bacteria poses a risk to wildlife rehabilitators and to seabirds in these centers, as well as to free-ranging birds.
TI  - Prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae isolated from blood culture in a tertiary care hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase among  Enterobacteriaceae isolated from blood culture in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: We carried out this study at the Armed Forces Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the period between January 2003-December 2004. We tested a total of 601 isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae from blood culture for the prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production by the standardized disc diffusion method and confirmed by the ESBL E test strips. RESULTS: Ninety-five (15.8%) of the isolates were ESBL producers. Among these, 48.4% were Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) followed by 15.8% of both Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterobacter cloacae (Ent. cloacae). Other isolates produced ESBL in low numbers. CONCLUSION: Klebsiella pneumoniae produced ESBL in significant numbers. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase gram-negative bacilli present significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to the management of infections due to these organisms. Microbiology laboratories should start reporting ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae organism due to their importance in respect to antibiotic therapy and infection control aspects.
TI  - Basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry (FACS) is a common technique in blood banking. It is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. It was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees C for various times. The following 10 species were used: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Bacterial DNA was stained with thiazole orange. After the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by FACS. RESULTS: All bacteria species used were detectable by FACS. The lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microL, that is, 10(5) per mL. In general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. In one case (K. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. When PC samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per mL of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees C, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. Exceptions were E. cloacae and P. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. At 20 to 24 degrees C, the detection times were strongly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Sterility testing of PCs by FACS is a feasible approach. The present data suggest incubating PC samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees C before testing. For slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1 to 2 days.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated high-level gentamicin resistance among enteric bacteria isolated from pet turtles in Louisiana.
AB  - The sale of small turtles is banned by the Food and Drug Administration from the  U.S. market due to concerns about their excretion of Salmonella spp. To produce a safe pet for the export market, the Louisiana pet turtle industry uses gentamicin sulfate baths (1,000 microg/ml) to eradicate Salmonella spp. from turtle eggs. In 1999, we analyzed bacterial samples recovered from turtle farms and found that strains of Salmonella enterica subsp. arizonae and other bacteria, such as Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were resistant to high concentrations of gentamicin (>2,000 microg/ml) and to other aminoglycosides. The goal of this study was to identify the gene(s) which contributes to the high-level gentamicin resistance phenotype observed in bacteria from environmental samples with turtle farming activity, particularly the salmonellae, and to estimate the incidence of such genes in these bacteria. R plasmids from gentamicin-resistant strains were transferred by conjugation and transformation to naive Escherichia coli cells. Cloning and sequencing of the gentamicin resistance determinants on these plasmids revealed the presence of the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase genes aac(3)-IIa and aac(3)-VIa; the latter was present as a gene cassette of a class 1 integron. Multiplex PCR assays showed that every gentamicin-resistant isolate carried one of these acetyltransferase genes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and restriction enzyme digestion analysis of R plasmids carrying these genes revealed different restriction profiles and sizes, indicating a dissemination of the gentamicin resistance genes through mobile molecular elements. The data presented highlight the need to develop an alternate method for the eradication of Salmonella spp. from turtle eggs.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of silver dressings: an in vitro comparison.
AB  - A range of silver-coated or -impregnated dressings are now commercially available for use but comparative data on their antimicrobial efficacies are limited. The antibacterial activities of five commercially available silver-coated/impregnated dressings were compared against nine common burn-wound pathogens, namely methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii and a multi-drug-efflux-positive Acinetobacter baumannii (BM4454), using a broth culture method. The rapidity and extent of killing of these pathogens under in vitro conditions were evaluated. All five silver-impregnated dressings investigated exerted bactericidal activity, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter species, Proteus species and E. coli. The spectrum and rapidity of action, however, ranged widely for different dressings. Acticoat and Contreet had a broad spectrum of bactericidal activities against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Contreet was characterized by a very rapid bactericidal action and achieved a reduction of > or =10,000 c.f.u. ml(-1) in the first 30 min for Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii. Other dressings demonstrated a narrower range of bactericidal activities. Understanding the characteristics of these dressings may enable them to be targeted more appropriately according to the specific requirements for use of a particular dressing, as in for prophylaxis in skin grafting or for an infected wound with MRSA.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis  (Mimosaceae).
AB  - Ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis (CG) was analysed phytochemically and evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against 17 pathogenic species isolated from patient: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus feacalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus T, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Flavonoids, saponins, tannins, polyphenols, coumarins, triterpenes and/or sterols and reducing sugars were detected in the (EA) extract of CG. The best MIC and MBC values for the microorganisms sensitive to the extract were 0.00078 and 0.00315 mg/ml respectively. The greater and remarkable antimicrobial activity of the (EA) extract of CG was recorded with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus cereus T. These results provide a rationalization for the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of infectious diseases.
TI  - Two novel bacterial biosensors for detection of nitrate availability in the rhizosphere.
AB  - The nitrate-regulated promoter of narG in Escherichia coli was fused to promoterless ice nucleation (inaZ) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter genes to yield the nitrate-responsive gene fusions in plasmids pNice and pNgfp, respectively. While the promoter of narG is normally nitrate responsive only under anaerobic conditions, the L28H-fnr gene was provided in trans to enable nitrate-dependent expression of these reporter gene fusions even under aerobic conditions in both E. coli DH5alpha and Enterobacter cloacae EcCT501R. E. cloacae and E. coli cells containing the fusion plasmid pNice exhibited more than 100-fold-higher ice nucleation activity in cultures amended with 10 mM sodium nitrate than in nitrate-free media. The GFP fluorescence of E. cloacae cells harboring pNgfp was uniform at a given concentration of nitrate and increased about 1,000-fold when nitrate increased from 0 to 1 mM. Measurable induction of ice nucleation in E. cloacae EcCT501R harboring pNice occurred at nitrate concentrations of as low as 0.1 microM, while GFP fluorescence was detected in cells harboring pNgfp at about 10 microM. In the rhizosphere of wild oat (Avena fatua), the whole-cell bioreporter E.cloacae(pNgfp) or E. cloacae(pNice) expressed significantly higher GFP fluorescence or ice nucleation activity when the plants were grown in natural soils amended with nitrate than in unamended natural soils. Significantly lower nitrate abundance was detected by the E. cloacae(pNgfp) reporter in the A. fatua rhizosphere compared to in bulk soil, indicating plant competition for nitrate. Ice- and GFP-based bacterial sensors thus are useful for estimating nitrate availability in relevant microbial niches in natural environments.
TI  - Comparison of the minimum inhibitory, mutant prevention and minimum bactericidal  concentrations of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and garenoxacin against enteric Gram-negative urinary tract infection pathogens.
AB  - Acute, uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most commonly  encountered bacterial infections and management has been made more complicated in the last decade due to the trend toward increasing antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Fluoroquinolones are suggested as alternative antimicrobials for the treatment of UTIs in communities for which TMP/SMX resistance is > or = 10%. The mutant-prevention concentration (MPC) is a novel susceptibility parameter designed to minimize the selection of first-step resistant mutants present in large, > or = 10(10) CFU/mL, heterogeneous bacterial populations and is a distinct measurement from minimum inhibitory concentration testing. We measured MPC results for 80 enteric Gram-negative and 20 Pseudomonas aeruginosa urinary isolates against ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and garenoxacin. Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and garenoxacin MPC results for Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa respectively were 0.5, 1, 1, 1 and 4 mg/L; 1, 2, 4, 2 and 16 mg/L; 1, 8, >8, 4 and > or = 32 mg/L. By comparison, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)90 results for the Enterobacteriaceae organisms ranged from < or = 0.06-4 mg/L for the three drugs and 1-4 mg/L against P. aeruginosa. Similarly, MBC90 results ranged from < or = 0.06-4 mg/L and 2-8 mg/L respectively. For ciprofloxacin against E. coli, E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae and for levofloxacin against E. coli, C. freundii and K. pneumoniae, MPC results were below susceptible breakpoints and within clinically achievable and sustainable drug concentrations for >24 hours of the dosing interval against. For garenoxacin, urine drug concentrations are expected to be in excess of MPC results for the entire length of the dosing interval for E. coli. Application of MPCs to fluoroquinolones and management of UTIs represents a situation where high levels of in vitro activity, based on low MICs, is reflected in correspondingly low MPC values for most of the organisms tested. Incorporation of MPC strategies into current fluoroquinolone dosing in UTI represents a realistic approach for preventing the further selection of resistant organisms associated with UTIs.
TI  - Relationships between antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial infections from 1991-2003 at a university hospital in Taiwan.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial use in a university hospital in Taiwan. Disk susceptibility data of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli causing nosocomial infections were evaluated. Data on annual patient-days and annual consumption (defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 patient-days) of extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, flumoxef, cefepime and cefpirome), beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (ticarcillin/clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam), carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem), aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin (oral and injectable) and oral levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) from 1991 to 2003 were analysed. Increasing trends of incidences of several of these bacteria causing all nosocomial infections or nosocomial bloodstream infections were noted from 1991 to 2003. The annual patient-days of the hospital significantly increased, from 360210 in 1991 to 672676 in 2002 (linear regression analysis, P < 0.05), but slightly decreased in 2003 (629168) owing to the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in Taiwan. The rise in cefotaxime-resistant or ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa was significantly correlated with increased consumption of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (for ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa only) in the hospital (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r > 0.72 (or < -0.72) and P-value < 0.05). Increased ciprofloxacin-resistant K. pneumoniae and meropenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. was significantly associated with the increased usage of extended-spectrum cephalosporins but not with the other four classes of antibiotics. This 13-year study in a hospital demonstrated significant changes in antimicrobial use, which may have affected antimicrobial resistance in certain Gram-negative bacteria at the hospital.
TI  - [Profiles of the utilization of 20 amino acids as the only source of nitrogen and carbon in bacteria of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Escherichia].
AB  - The profiles of the utilization of 20 protein amino acids in 118 Klebsiella pneumoniae sub- sp. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. planticola, K. mobilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marscescens, S. liquefaciens, Escherichia coli strains isolated from clinical material were studied. The utilization of amino acids was determined on minimal saline agar containing amino acid as the only source of nitrogen and carbon; the results were evaluated after 72-hour incubation at 37 degrees C. 17 profiles of amino-acid utilization were thus determined, most of them genus-specific in enterobacteria: Klebsiella (profiles No. 1--6, 9, 10), Enterobacter (No. 11--13), Serratia (No. 14--16), Escherichia (No. 17). The full coincidence of amino-acid utilization profiles in bacteria of K. mobilis (No. 1, 6) and K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae with out of such profiles in bacteria of the genera Enterobacter, Serratia, Escherichia was established, which confirmed that K. mobilis (formerly Enterobacter aerogenes) belonged to the genus Klebsiella.
TI  - A beta-lactamase with reduced immunogenicity for the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics using antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy.
AB  - Antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) delivers chemotherapeutic agents in high concentration to tumor tissue while minimizing systemic drug exposure. beta-Lactamases are particularly useful enzymes for ADEPT systems due to their unique substrate specificity that allows the activation of a variety of lactam-based prodrugs with minimal interference from mammalian enzymes. We evaluated the amino acid sequence of beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae for the presence of human T-cell epitopes using a cell-based proliferation assay using samples from 65 community donors. We observed a low background response that is consistent with a lack of preexposure to this enzyme. beta-Lactamase was found to contain four CD4+ T-cell epitopes. For two of these epitopes, we identified single amino acid changes that result in significantly reduced proliferative responses while retaining stability and activity of the enzyme. The beta-lactamase variant containing both changes induces significantly less proliferation in human and mouse cell assays, and 5-fold lower levels of IgG1 in mice were observed after repeat administration of beta-lactamase variant with adjuvant. The beta-lactamase variant should be very suitable for the construction of ADEPT fusion proteins, as it combines high activity toward lactam prodrugs, high plasma stability, a monomeric architecture, and a relatively low risk of eliciting an immune response in patients.
TI  - Survival curves for microbial species stored by freeze-drying.
AB  - The survival of a variety of species of microorganism following storage for up to 20 years has been analyzed. The organisms were freeze-dried, sealed in ampoules under vacuum (<1 Pa) and stored in the dark at 5 degrees C. The yeast that was tested, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, showed only 8% survival when recovered shortly after freeze-drying, but subsequent loss during storage was the least among all the tested microorganisms. The decrease in the logarithm of survival per year (log survival) was -0.010, which corresponds to a survival rate of 97.7% per year. The Gram-negative bacteria tested, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Enterobacter cloacae, showed 42.6, 33.5, and 50.8% survival shortly after freeze-drying, which was higher than the corresponding survival of S. cerevisiae, but the subsequent loss during storage was greater than S. cerevisiae, the log survival figures being -0.041, -0.058, and -0.073 per year. These values correspond to survival rates of 91.0, 87.5, and 84.5% each year. The Gram-positive bacteria tested, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Enteroccoccus faecium, showed 62.5 and 85.2% survival shortly after freeze-drying, which was even higher than that of the Gram-negative species, and these organisms also showed better survival during storage than Gram-negative bacteria; their log survival rates were -0.018 and -0.016 per year, which corresponded to survival rates of almost 96% per year. Comparison of these results with other published data for different drying conditions suggests that survival during storage is strongly influenced by the degree of vacuum under which the ampoules were sealed. The excellent survival after freeze-drying of each species might be attributable to the high level of desiccation and to sealing under vacuum.
TI  - Dissemination of the metallo-beta-lactamase gene blaIMP-4 among gram-negative pathogens in a clinical setting in Australia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of carbapenems is under threat because of the emergence of acquired metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) genes. We describe the first outbreak in Australia of infection and/or colonization with gram-negative pathogens carrying the MBL gene blaIMP-4. METHODS: MBL-producing organisms were identified using susceptibility data in conjunction with MBL screening methods. PCR and sequence analysis were performed to characterize the resistance gene and identify the presence of integrons. DNA profiles were determined by ribotyping. Clinical and epidemiological data were prospectively collected from January-July 2004. RESULTS: A total of 19 isolates were recovered from 16 patients: Serratia marcescens (10 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 isolates), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3 isolates), Escherichia coli (1 isolate), and Enterobacter cloacae (1 isolate). Isolates were resistant to most beta-lactams except aztreonam, and variable resistance to carbapenems was observed (MIC range, 2 to >8 mg/L). PCR and sequence analysis identified the blaIMP-4 gene and a class 1 integrase (IntI1) in all isolates. Of the 16 patients, 12 (75%) had infection; 5 had septicemia, 5 had ventilator-associated pneumonia, 1 had a urinary tract infection, and 1 had a superficial central venous line infection. Six (38%) of the 16 patients died, and 5 of those 6 (31% of the group of 16) had clinical infection with an MBL-producing organism. All except 2 patients had spatio-temporal epidemiological links in the intensive care unit. All K. pneumoniae isolates were of different ribogroups, whereas the S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa isolates were predominately of the same ribogroup. CONCLUSIONS: MBL-producing gram-negative organisms have now emerged in Australia. The resistance gene, blaIMP-4, appears highly mobile; this outbreak involved 5 different gram-negative genera from patients with close epidemiological links.
TI  - High prevalence of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant qnrA in  multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures in Liverpool, UK.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance qnrA gene in a selected collection of blood culture isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to both ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. METHODS: Over a 29 month period, a total of 47 non-repetitive isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to both ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime were identified. Isolates were screened for the presence of the qnrA gene, class I integrons and bla(ESBL) by PCR. Transferability was examined by conjugation with the sodium azide-resistant Escherichia coli J53. All qnrA-positive isolates were examined for DNA-relatedness by PFGE. RESULTS: A total of 15 of the 47 test isolates (32%) were positive for the qnrA gene, and included single isolates of E. coli and Citrobacter freundii, 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 9 Enterobacter cloacae. All 15 qnrA-positive isolates carried class 1 integrons, and 11 the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene bla(SHV-12). By PFGE two K. pneumoniae and three E. cloacae, respectively, were considered clonally but not temporally related. Plasmid transfer of quinolone resistance was only achieved with single isolates of K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae. Both plasmids carried class 1 integrons with a pSAL-1-like gene cassette arrangement intl1-aadA2-qacEDelta-sul1. CONCLUSIONS: In this selected group of ciprofloxacin- and cefotaxime-resistant bacteria, carriage of the qnrA gene was high (32%). This compares with <2.0% as demonstrated in worldwide studies of laboratory collections of ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria. The majority of qnrA-positive isolates in our study originated from high-dependency care units within our hospital, but were shown not to be clonal by PFGE. This is the first report of qnrA-positive Enterobacteriaceae in the United Kingdom.
TI  - Surveillance of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from clinical samples and faecal carriers in Barcelona, Spain.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to characterize and compare the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms isolated from clinical samples and faecal carriers in 2001 and 2002. METHODS: A total of 5251 Enterobacteriaceae isolated from clinical samples and 1321 stool samples were evaluated for the presence of ESBLs. The stool samples were spread onto plates of MacConkey agar containing 2 mg/L cefotaxime for selection of ESBL-producing strains. These strains were defined as those showing synergism between amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and third-generation cephalosporins. The beta-lactamases involved were characterized by isoelectric focusing, PCR assays and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The prevalence of ESBL-producing strains among clinical Enterobacteriaceae was 1.7%. Of these, 87.6% produced CTX-M, 25.8% produced SHV and 2.2% were TEM-type-producing strains. All clinical ESBL-producing strains were Escherichia coli, with the exception of four Klebsiella pneumoniae and one Citrobacter freundii. The prevalence of faecal carriage of ESBL-producing organisms was 3.3%. Of these, 75% produced CTX-M-type enzymes followed by 22.7% SHV-producing strains. All faecal ESBL-producing strains were E. coli except for one Enterobacter cloacae and one Proteus mirabilis. This latter strain produced the PER-1 enzyme reported for the first time in Spain. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ESBL-producing strains in stool samples was higher than that observed in clinical samples from the same period. The different types of ESBLs found were similar in both contexts. The most prevalent ESBLs were the CTX-M-related enzymes, with nine different types, followed by SHV-12.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA).
AB  - The goal of the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained in various geographic regions in the USA and Canada. Forty-one medical centres (30 from the USA and 11 from Canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. Isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. Susceptibility testing was determined using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution method. Resistance breakpoints used were those published by the NCCLS, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/mL), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/mL), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/mL). Of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the USA and 24.9% (496) were collected from Canada. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (57.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), Enterococcus spp. (6.6%), Proteus mirabilis (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), Citrobacter spp. (2.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), Klebsiella spp. (1.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). Among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to SMX/TMP, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. For the 1142 E. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, SMX/TMP 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. For all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 E. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in US compared with Canadian medical centres. This study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in US versus Canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the South American bullfrog Leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  - Norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the South American bullfrog, Leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. The primary structure of a previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Thr-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asn-Val-Val-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys-V al-Met-Glu-Lys-Leu.NH2. The second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the Caribbean mountain chicken frog L. fallax. Pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B) but potencies were relatively low (MIC values in the range 25-200 microM). The peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LD50>400 microM).
TI  - Glucose-1-phosphatase (AgpE) from Enterobacter cloacae displays enhanced phytase  activity.
AB  - Using a screening procedure developed for detection of phytate hydrolysing enzymes, the gene agpE encoding glucose-1-phosphatase was cloned from an Enterobacter cloacae VKPM B2254 plasmid library. Sequence analysis revealed 78% identity on nucleotide and 79% identity on peptide level to Escherichia coli glucose-1-phosphatase characterising the respective gene product as a representative of acid histidine phosphatases harbouring the RH(G/N)RXRP motif. The purified recombinant protein displayed maximum specific activity of 196 U mg(-1) protein against glucose-1-phosphate but was also active against other sugar phosphates and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. High-performance ion chromatography of hydrolysis products revealed that AgpE can act as a 3-phytase but is only able to cleave off the third phosphate group from the myo-inositol sugar ring. Based on sequence comparison and catalytic behaviour against phytate, we propose to classify bacterial acid histidine phosphatases/phytases in the three following subclasses: (1) AppA-related phytases, (2) PhyK-related phytases and (3) Agp-related phytases. A distinguished activity of 32 U mg(-1) of protein towards myo-inositol-hexa-phosphate, which is two times higher than that of E. coli Agp, suggests that possibly functional differences in terms of phytase activity between Agp- and AppA-like acid histidine phosphatases are fluent.
TI  - [Pathogenic characters of infected bacteria after liver transplantation].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the main pathogens of infection after the liver transplantation and their antibiotic resistant patterns. METHODS: The main pathogens of infection after the liver transplantation were retrospectively analyzed. Using 3-dimensional tests, ESBLs (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase), and AmpC were detected among the Gram negative bacilli. beta-Lactamase and Van gene in Enterococcus were determined by the standard agar dilution susceptibility tests and Nitrocefin respectively. RESULTS: The main infected strains were Enterococcus faecalis (15.0%), Enterobacter cloacae (13.9%), fungus (13.3%), and Escherichia coli (10.7%) after the liver transplantation. Among them, 32.4% of Enterobacter cloacae and 36.8% of Escherichia coli produced ESBLs; 33.8% of Enterobacter cloacae and 10.5% of Escherichia coli. produced AmpC beta-lactamases. The detectable rate of VanA gene in Enterococcusfaecalis and Enterococcus faecium was 7.5% and 11.1%; VanB was 3.8% and 7.4%; VanC was 1.3% and 0, respectively. CONCLUSION: The infection mainly occurs in the intestinal tract after the liver transplantation. The production of ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases is the main mechanism of antibiotic resistance. The increased detectable rate of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus should be paid attention to.
TI  - Genetic and enzymatic properties of metallo-beta-lactamase VIM-5 from a clinical  isolate of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - A VIM-5-producing Enterobacter cloacae isolate (EDV/1) was identified in a collection of clinical strains stored before 2002. The gene, bla(VIM-5), was located on a 2,712-bp BamHI-HindIII fragment of a 23-kbp (approximately) nonconjugative plasmid (pEDV5) in a class 1 integron as a single gene cassette.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - Characterization of Enterobacteria using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
AB  - A method is proposed for the rapid classification of Gram-negative Enterobacteria using on-slide solubilization and trypsin digestion of proteins, followed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Peptides were identified from tryptic digests using microsequencing by tandem mass spectrometry and database searches. Proteins from the outer membrane family (OMP) were consistently identified in the Enterobacteria Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Erwinia herbicola, and Salmonella typhimurium. Database searches indicate that these OMP peptides observed are unique to the Enterobacteria order.
TI  - Molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  - The complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. However, studies on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. To clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rDNA sequences from the DNA isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16S rDNA libraries were constructed with the amplicons of PCR conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. Nine independent libraries were produced by the application of three sets of primers (set A, set B, and set C) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. Approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. The library clone with set A universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. Thus, set A primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. On the first day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, and Streptococcus mitis were present. The largest taxonomic group was L. lactis. On the third day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, S. mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius were present. On the sixth day of the life of the infant, Citrobacter, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli were present. The largest taxonomic group was E. coli. These results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after the third day.
TI  - Development of a multiplex PCR and SHV melting-curve mutation detection system for detection of some SHV and CTX-M beta-lactamases of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae in Taiwan.
AB  - Infection by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae has been increasing in Taiwan. Accurate identification of the ESBL genes is necessary for surveillance and for epidemiological studies of the mode of transmission in the hospital setting. We describe herein the development of a novel system, which consists of a multiplex PCR to identify bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M-3)-like, and bla(CTX-M-14)-like genes and a modified SHV melting-curve mutation detection method to rapidly distinguish six prevalent bla(SHV) genes (bla(SHV-1), bla(SHV-2), bla(SHV-2a), bla(SHV-5), bla(SHV-11), and bla(SHV-12)) in Taiwan. Sixty-five clinical isolates, which had been characterized by nucleotide sequencing of the bla(SHV) and bla(CTX-M) genes, were identified by the system. The system was then used to genotype the ESBLs from 199 clinical isolates, including 40 Enterobacter cloacae, 68 Escherichia coli, and 91 Klebsiella pneumoniae, collected between August 2002 and March 2003. SHV-12 (80 isolates) was the most prevalent type of ESBL identified, followed in order of frequency by CTX-M-3 (65 isolates) and CTX-M-14 (36 isolates). Seventeen (9%) of the 199 clinical isolates harbored both SHV- and CTX-M-type ESBLs. In contrast to Enterobacter cloacae, the majority of which produced SHV-type ESBLs, E. coli and K. pneumoniae were more likely to possess CTX-M-type ESBLs. Three rare CTX-M types were identified through sequencing of the bla(CTX-M-3)-like (CTX-M-15) and bla(CTX-M-14)-like (CTX-M-9 and CTX-M-13) genes. The system appears to provide an efficient differentiation of ESBLs among E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae in Taiwan. Moreover, the design of the system can be easily adapted for similar purposes in areas where different ESBLs are prevalent.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Zuccagnia punctata Cav. ethanolic extracts.
AB  - The present study was conducted to investigate antibacterial activity of Zuccagnia punctata ethanolic extract against 47 strains of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and to identify bioactive compounds. Inhibition of bacterial growth was investigated using agar diffusion, agar macrodilution, broth microdilution and bioautographic methods. Zuccagnia punctata extract was active against all assayed bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 25 to 200 microg/mL. Minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were identical or two-fold higher than the corresponding MIC values. Contact bioautography, indicated that Zuccagnia punctata extracts possess one major antibacterial component against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and at least three components against. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Activity-guided fractionation of 1he ethanol extract on a silica gel column yielded a compound (2',4'-dihydroxychalcone), which exhibited strong antibacterial activity with MIC values between 0.10 and 1.00 microg/mL for Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. These values are lower than imipenem (0.25-16 microg/mL). Zuccagnia punctata might provide promising therapeutic agents against infections with multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - Fluorescein-labeled beta-lactamase mutant for high-throughput screening of bacterial beta-lactamases against beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The increasing emergence of new bacterial beta-lactamases that can efficiently hydrolyze beta-lactam antibiotics to clinically inactive carboxylic acids has created an intractable problem in the treatment of bacterial infections, and it is highly desirable to develop a useful tool that can rapidly screen bacteria for beta-lactamases against a variety of antibiotic candidates in a high-throughput manner. This paper describes the use of a fluorescein-labeled beta-lactamase mutant (E166Cf) as a convenient fluorescent tool to screen beta-lactamases, including the Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase I (PenPC), B. cereus beta-lactamase II, Bacillus licheniformis PenP, Escherichia coli TEM-1, and Enterobacter cloacae P99 against various beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin G, penicillin V, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, moxalactam, cephaloridine), using a 96-well microplate reader. The E166Cf mutant was constructed by replacing Glu166 on the flexible Omega-loop, which is close to the enzyme's active site, with a cysteine residue on a class A beta-lactamase (B. cereus PenPC) and subsequently labeling the mutant with thiol-reactive fluorescein-5-maleimide. Such modifications significantly impaired the hydrolytic activity of the E166Cf mutant compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. The fluorescence intensity of the E166Cf mutant increases in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics. For antibiotics that are resistant to hydrolysis by the E166Cf mutant (cefuroxime, cefoxitin, moxalactam), the fluorescence signal slowly increases until it reaches a plateau. For antibiotics that can be slowly hydrolyzed by the E166Cf mutant (penicillin G, penicillin V, ampicillin), the fluorescence signal rapidly increases to the plateau and then declines after a prolonged incubation. The E166Cf mutant retains its characteristic pattern of fluorescence signals in the presence of both bacterial beta-lactamases and beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics. In contrast, in the presence of both bacterial beta-lactamases and beta-lactamase-sensitive antibiotics, the fluorescence signals of the E166Cf mutant were decreased. The fluorescence signals from the E166Cf mutant allow an unambiguous differentiation of beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics from beta-lactamase-sensitive ones in the screening of bacterial beta-lactamases against a panel of antibiotic candidates. This simple method may provide an alternative tool in choosing potent beta-lactam antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections.
TI  - Allophanate hydrolase, not urease, functions in bacterial cyanuric acid metabolism.
AB  - Growth substrates containing an s-triazine ring are typically metabolized by bacteria to liberate 3 mol of ammonia via the intermediate cyanuric acid. Over a 25-year period, a number of original research papers and reviews have stated that cyanuric acid is metabolized in two steps to the 2-nitrogen intermediate urea. In the present study, allophanate, not urea, was shown to be the 2-nitrogen intermediate in cyanuric acid metabolism in all the bacteria examined. Six different experimental results supported this conclusion: (i) synthetic allophanate was shown to readily decarboxylate to form urea under acidic extraction and chromatography conditions used in previous studies; (ii) alkaline extraction methods were used to stabilize and detect allophanate in bacteria actively metabolizing cyanuric acid; (iii) the kinetic course of allophanate formation and disappearance was consistent with its being an intermediate in cyanuric acid metabolism, and no urea was observed in those experiments; (iv) protein extracts from cells grown on cyanuric acid contained allophanate hydrolase activity; (v) genes encoding the enzymes AtzE and AtzF, which produce and hydrolyze allophanate, respectively, were found in several cyanuric acid-metabolizing bacteria; and (vi) TrzF, an AtzF homolog found in Enterobacter cloacae strain 99, was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and shown to have allophanate hydrolase activity. In addition, we have observed that there are a large number of genes homologous to atzF and trzF distributed in phylogenetically distinct bacteria. In total, the data indicate that s-triazine metabolism in a broad class of bacteria proceeds through allophanate via allophanate hydrolase, rather than through urea using urease.
TI  - Enteric fever-like illness caused by infection with citrobacter amalonaticus.
AB  - 'Enteric fever' is a potentially fatal, severe systemic disease, which is encountered worldwide. Traditionally, enteric fever refers to a bacteremic illness caused by members of certain Salmonella serotypes, notably: Salmonella typhi, a Gram-negative bacterium, and to a lesser extent, Salmonella paratyphi A, B and C. In addition, other non-salmonella organisms may produce a syndrome clinically indistinguishable from "enteric fever". Brucella sp., Campylobacter sp., Edwardsiella tarda, Enterobacter Cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia alcalifaciens, Pseudomonas sp., Serratia marcescens, Francisella sp. and Yersinia pp have been identified in enteric fever This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first case of Citrobacter to be reported presenting as enteric fever in a normal host in Thailand.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-023 (RO4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - CS-023 (RO4908463, formerly R-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the C-2 position. Its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. CS-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CS-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against P. aeruginosa and MRSA, with MICs at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. CS-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris. CS-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. The in vivo efficacy of CS-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of PRSP (serotypes 6 and 19). Against the systemic infections with PRSP, MRSA, and P. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of CS-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against P. aeruginosa infections only). These results suggest that CS-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including MRSA and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Influence of cytokine preparations on the in vitro resistance of bacteria to antibiotics].
AB  - Recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha and gamma-interferon were found in vitro  to increase the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics both alone and in combination; alpha2-interferon decreased this sensitivity.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae at Middlemore Hospital.
AB  - AIMS: To review patients colonised or infected with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLPE) at Middlemore Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand. METHODS: All patients who had an ESBLPE isolated at the Middlemore Hospital Microbiology Laboratory from January 2001 to June 2004 were included in this review. RESULTS: ESBLPE were isolated from 132 patients during the review period. There were 12 patients colonised or infected with an ESBLPE in 2001, 34 in 2002, 43 in 2003, and 43 in the first 6 months of 2004. The isolates were Escherichia coli (n=56), Enterobacter spp. (n=55), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=21). ESBLPE were isolated from a wide range of specimens including peripheral blood in 18 patients. Thirty-three (25%) patients had an ESBLPE isolated within 48 hours of admission; seven of these patients were neither long-term care facility (LTCF) residents nor had hospital admissions in the previous 6 months. Thirty-one patients (23%) resided in a LTCF before their admission; four patients from the same LTCF had indistinguishable isolates. All isolates tested were susceptible to meropenem and imipenem. All but one isolate tested was susceptible to ertapenem, and all but two were susceptible to amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: Colonisation and infection due to ESBLPE are increasing at Middlemore Hospital and in the Auckland community. We expect this trend to continue. There is evidence to suggest transmission of ESBLPE both in the Auckland community and LTCFs. Antibiotics useful for treatment of patients with proven ESBLPE infection at Middlemore Hospital include amikacin or a carbapenem. Careful infection control practices and antibiotic prescribing will be necessary to reduce the rate of increase of ESBLPE colonisation and infection at Middlemore Hospital and in the Auckland community.
TI  - Selectivity and specificity of a chromogenic medium for detecting Vibrio parahaemolyticust.
AB  - The thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar (TCBS) used in the most-probable-number method for detecting Vibrio parahaemolyticus cannot differentiate growth of V. parahaemolyticus from Vibrio vulnificus or Vibrio mimicus. This study examined the selectivity and specificity of Bio-Chrome Vibrio medium (BCVM), a chromogenic medium that detects V. parahaemolyticus on the basis of the formation of distinct purple colonies on the medium. A panel consisting of 221 strains of bacteria, including 179 Vibrio spp. and 42 non-Vibrio spp., were examined for their ability to grow and produce colored colonies on BCVM. Growth of Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Aeromonas was inhibited by both BCVM and TCBS. All 148 strains of V. parahaemolyticus grew on BCVM, and 145 of them produced purple colonies. The remaining 31 Vibrio spp., except one strain of Vibrio fluvialis, were either unable to grow or produced blue-green or white colonies on BCVM. Bio-Chrome Vibrio medium was capable of differentiating V. parahaemolyticus from other species, including V. vulnificus and V. mimicus. Further studies are needed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of BCVM for detecting V. parahaemolyticus in foods.
TI  - Countrywide spread of community- and hospital-acquired extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (CTX-M-15)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Lebanon.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out to assess the extent of carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae at both hospital and community levels in Lebanon. A total of 1,442 fecal samples were collected from hospital-based patients and 58 from health care workers of six Lebanese tertiary care general hospitals located in different areas of Lebanon between January and March 2003. A total of 382 fecal samples were also collected from healthy subjects between April and June 2003. The samples analysis led to the identification of 118 strains as ESBL producers based on the synergistic effects between clavulanate and selected beta-lactams (ceftazidime and cefotaxime). These strains were isolated from 72 subjects: 61 patients, 2 health care workers, and 9 healthy subjects. One representative strain per subject was selected, and a total of 72 nonduplicate ESBL producers, including a high majority of Escherichia coli (n = 56), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 9), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 6), and Citrobacter freundii (n = 1), were characterized. The molecular analysis revealed that the majority of the strains (83%) express CTX-M-15 ESBL (pI 8.6). SHV-5a ESBL (pI 8.2) was produced by 18% of the strains. DNA macrorestriction analysis of ESBL-producing E. coli presented 38 different genotypes, revealing the absence of clonal link among these strains. In addition to the fact that the present study highlights the emergence and the countrywide dissemination of CTX-M-15-producing E. coli in Lebanon, it represents the first report of an SHV-5a-producing C. freundii.
TI  - Extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Yaounde, Cameroon.
AB  - Organisms producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) have been reported  in many countries, but there is no information on the prevalence of ESBL-producing members of the family Enterobacteriaceae in Cameroon. A total of 259 Enterobacteriaceae strains were isolated between 1995 and 1998 from patients at the Yaounde Central Hospital in Cameroon. Enterobacterial isolates resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporin and monobactam were screened for ESBL production by the double-disk (DD) synergy test. Thirty-one (12%) of these Enterobacteriaceae strains were shown to be positive by the DD synergy test, suggesting the presence of ESBLs. Resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and monobactams of 12 (38.7%) of the 31 strains-i.e., 6 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 Escherichia coli, 1 Citrobacter freundii, and 1 Enterobacter cloacae strain-was transferred to E. coli HK-225 by conjugation. Resistance to gentamicin, gentamicin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was cotransferred into 6, 2, and 1 of these transconjugants, respectively. All 12 transconjugants were resistant to amoxicillin, piperacillin, all of the cephalosporins, and aztreonam but remained susceptible to cefoxitin and imipenem. Crude extracts of beta-lactamase-producing transconjugants were able to reduce the diameters of inhibition zones around disks containing penicillins, narrow- to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins or monobactams when tested against a fully susceptible E. coli strain but had no effect on such zones around cefoxitin, imipenem, and amoxicillin-clavulanate disks. The beta-lactamases produced by the 12 tranconjugants turned out to be SHV-12 by DNA sequencing. Therefore, the ESBL SHV-12 is described for the first time in Cameroon.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2003 and March 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2003 to March 2004 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 455 strains including 14 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 191(75.2%) of 254 patients with surgical infections. Two hundred and thirty-nine strains were isolated from primary infections, and 216 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria and aerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant MRSA. Carbapenm-resistant P. aeruginosa was seen in less than 10 per cents. Last year we noticed that there were cefazolin-resistant E. coli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase, but there was no highly cefazolin-resistant E. coli in this year. In the next series, increase of both anaerobic bacteria and Enterococcus spp. should be carefully followed up.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin under various conditions against standard strains, beta-lactam resistant strains, and multidrug efflux system mutants].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible benefit of fosfomycin (FOM) as prophylactic antibiotic in terms of antimicrobial activity and the potential of inducibility of beta-lactamase, compared with cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, and piperacillin that are commonly used as perioperative agents. The in vitro activity of FOM against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria using Mueller-Hinton agar or nutrient agar supplemented with glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) as tested medium increased within a range from 2 to 256 times the activity in the medium without G6P. However, the susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria to FOM remained largely unchanged with or without G6P. There was no aerobic- or anaerobic-bacteria which changed susceptibility against beta-lactam antibiotics under various tested medium conditions. FOM demonstrated strong bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a dose dependent manner, and decreased viable cell counts of Staphylococcus aureus. In the case of P. aeruginosa, transmission electron micrographs study revealed that numerous lysed cells were present 2 hours after treatment with FOM at four times the MIC. First and second generation cephalosporins induced AmpC-type beta-lactamase in a dose dependent manner among beta-lactamase inducible strains of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. On the other hand, inducible activity of FOM on beta-lactamase production was less than 1/25 to 1/65 compared with those of cephalosporins. In addition, FOM maintained strong antimicrobial activity for over then 20 years after marketing, because of the excellent stability against various types of beta-lactamase produced by plasmid-carrying bacteria and clinical isolates. FOM was not extruded by four types of efflux systems, such as MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, MexXY/ OprM and MexEF-OprN, however beta-lactam antibiotics were substrates of MexAB-OprM and MexCD-OprJ. In conclusion, FOM provides adequate coverage for both aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria causing postoperative infections. Further, FOM would not select/concentrate beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the clinical fields and would not be a substrate for multidrug efflux system of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Accelerating bacterial identification by infrared spectroscopy by employing microarray deposition of microorganisms.
AB  - A microarray method for the deposition of bacteria onto an agar slide was developed to accelerate the formation of microcolonies. Representative microarrays each consisting of 40 micro-spots of five replicates of eight foodborne bacteria (Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli) were printed on a Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar slide using a contact micro-spotting robotic system. Within 3 h, sufficient bacterial cells were obtained to allow accurate identification of the microorganism by infrared spectroscopy. This approach allows a "complete-in-a-single-day" analysis of a large array of samples.
TI  - In-house validation of the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the FDA for the purpose of quality control (QC) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates: the BacT/ALERT blood culture system (bioMerieux) and the Pall eBDS (Pall Corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived PLTs. After the decision of the AABB to institute universal QC testing of PLT concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the performance of our current blood culture system, the BACTEC 9240, was carried out for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with PLT contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis PLT unit per organism. Four mL of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL was inoculated into blood culture bottles (Standard 10 Aerobic/F, Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Systems) and incubated in a BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. Positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to insure the identity of bacterial growth. RESULTS: With the exception of Streptococcus mitis, the BACTEC system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 CFUs per mL for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The limit of detection for the S. mitis test strain was 61 CFUs per mL. Detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. Ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis PLT products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of the BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis PLTs in less than 24 hours.
TI  - Gram-negative bacilli associated with catheter-associated and non-catheter-associated bloodstream infections and hand carriage by healthcare workers in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bloodstream infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in infants in neonatal intensive care units. This study describes the species of Gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections in two neonatal intensive care units, compares characteristics of catheter-related and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections, and compares species and antibiotic resistance patterns of these organisms with those isolated from the hands of nurses working in the same neonatal intensive care units. DESIGN: Interventional study. SETTING: Two high-risk neonatal intensive care units. PATIENTS: Neonates hospitalized for >or =24 hrs. INTERVENTIONS: Prospective surveillance for bloodstream infections was performed in two neonatal intensive care units from March 2001 to January 2003. Hand cultures were obtained quarterly from participating nurses immediately after they performed hand hygiene. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 298 episodes of bloodstream infections among 2,935 admissions (5.75 episodes per 1,000 patient-days); 77 of 298 (26%) episodes were caused by Gram-negative bacilli. Among these, 47 (61.0%) were catheter-related bloodstream infections (2.61 episodes per 1,000 catheter-days). Eleven and 24 Gram-negative bacilli species were isolated from neonates and nurses, respectively. The most common Gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections were Klebsiella pneumoniae (38.7%), Escherichia coli (21.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (11.2%), and Serratia marcescens (11.2%). In contrast, Acinetobacter lwoffi (18.1%), K. pneumoniae (11.7%), E. cloacae (10.6%), K. oxytoca (10.6%), and Pseudomonas spp. (7.4%) were most commonly isolated from hands of nurses. E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and E. aerogenes were significantly more likely to cause bloodstream infections than to be isolated from nurses' hands (all p < .001). Although 39% of bloodstream infections were non-catheter-related, there were no significant differences in types of organisms or antimicrobial resistance patterns between catheter-related bloodstream infections and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections (all p > or = .35). Resistance patterns were similar between Gram-negative bacilli isolates from neonates and nurses' hands except for a significantly higher proportion of resistance to cefotaxime and gentamicin among neonatal isolates of K. pneumoniae (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacilli species isolated from neonatal bloodstream infections and nurses' hands varied significantly. Clean hands of providers are an unlikely source of endemic Gram-negative bacilli, suggesting that prevention strategies should focus more on control of endogenous neonatal flora or environmental sources.
TI  - Worldwide disseminated armA aminoglycoside resistance methylase gene is borne by  composite transposon Tn1548.
AB  - The armA (aminoglycoside resistance methylase) gene, which confers resistance to  4,6-disubstituted deoxystreptamines and fortimicin, was initially found in Klebsiella pneumoniae BM4536 on IncL/M plasmid pIP1204 of ca. 90 kb which also encodes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase CTX-M-3. Thirty-four enterobacteria from various countries that were likely to produce a CTX-M enzyme since they were more resistant to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime were studied. The armA gene was detected in 12 clinical isolates of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and Shigella flexneri, in which it was always associated with bla(CTX-M-3) on an IncL/M plasmid. Conjugation, analysis of DNA sequences, PCR mapping, and plasmid conduction experiments indicated that the armA gene was part of composite transposon Tn1548 together with genes ant3"9, sul1, and dfrXII, which are responsible for resistance to streptomycin-spectinomycin, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim, respectively. The 16.6-kb genetic element was flanked by two copies of IS6 and migrated by replicative transposition. This observation accounts for the presence of armA on self-transferable plasmids of various incompatibility groups and its worldwide dissemination. It thus appears that posttranscriptional modification of 16S rRNA confers high-level resistance to all the clinically available aminoglycosides except streptomycin in gram-negative human and animal pathogens.
TI  - Spread of novel expanded-spectrum beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae in a university hospital in the Paris area, France.
AB  - In 2002, 28 non-duplicate enterobacterial isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were collected from infected patients at the Bicetre Hospital in Paris, France. Escherichia coli was the predominant ESBL-positive enterobacterial species, comprising ten (36%) of the isolates. CTX-M enzymes (CTX-M-3, CTX-M-10, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15) were produced by 11 (39%) of the isolates (six E. coli, two Enterobacter cloacae, one Enterobacter aerogenes, one Proteus mirabilis and one Citrobacter freundii). Other ESBLs, such as VEB-1 and PER-1, were also detected, but less frequently.
TI  - Temporal changes in bacterial resistance in German intensive care units, 2001-2003: data from the SARI (surveillance of antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in intensive care units) project.
AB  - Conservative testing revealed a stable antibiotic resistance situation for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae in 32 German intensive care units (ICUs) actively participating in the SARI (surveillance of antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in ICUs) project over a three-year period (2001--2003). No significant changes were shown for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (P=0.501; the MRSA rate increased in 18 ICUs and decreased in 14 ICUs). The only exception was an increase in ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli.
TI  - The rising influx of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli into a tertiary care hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR) among gram-negative bacilli is rapidly increasing. Quantification of the prevalence and the common antimicrobial coresistance patterns of MDR gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) isolates recovered from patients at hospital admission, as well as identification of patients with a high risk of harboring MDR-GNB, would have important implications for patient care. METHODS: Over a 6-year period, patients who harbored MDR-GNB (i.e., patients who had MDR-GNB isolates recovered from clinical cultures within the first 48 h after hospital admission) were identified. "MDR-GNB isolates" were defined as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella species isolates with resistance to at least 3 antimicrobial groups. A case-control study was performed to determine the independent risk factors for harboring MDR-GNB at hospital admission. RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2003, the prevalence of MDR-GNB isolates recovered from patients at hospital admission increased significantly for all isolate species (P < .001), with the exception of P. aeruginosa (P = .09). Of 464 MDR-GNB isolates, 12%, 35%, and 53% of isolates were coresistant to 5, 4, and 3 antimicrobial groups, respectively. Multivariable analysis identified age > or = 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-7.4; P < .04), prior exposure to antibiotics for > or = 14 days (OR, 8.7; 95% CI, 2.5 -30; P < .001), and prior residence in a long-term care facility (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.3-9.4; P < .01) as independent risk factors for harboring MDR-GNB at hospital admission. CONCLUSION: A substantial number of patients harbor MDR-GNB at hospital admission. Identification of common coresistance patterns among MDR-GNB isolates may assist in the selection of empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients with a high risk of harboring MDR-GNB.
TI  - Cryptic plasmid pRK2 from Escherichia coli W: sequence analysis and segregational stability.
AB  - Cryptic plasmid pRK2 of the strain Escherichia coli W (ATCC 9637), an ancestor of production strains for penicillin G acylase, was sequenced and characterized. Based on the data on replication region and origin (ori sequence AAC, 924-926nt), the plasmid was classified as ColE1-like plasmid. DNA sequence analysis revealed five orfs hypothetical products of which shared a significant sequence similarity with putative proteins encoded by DNA of plasmid pColE1. orf1 codes for protein Rom involved in the control of plasmid replication, orfs 2-5 code for putative mobilization proteins (Mob A-D) that show a high level of similarity with the ones encoded by DNA of plasmids pColE1 and pLG13 (E. coli), pECL18 and pEC01 (Enterobacter cloacae), pSFD10 (Salmonella choleraesuis), and pScol7 (Shigella sonnei). Recombinant plasmids pRS11 (4.91kbp), pRS12 (4.91kbp), pRS2 (2.996kbp), and pRS3 (2.623kbp) that bear the Spectinomycin resistance determinant (Spc(R)) were prepared on the basis of nucleotide sequence of pRK2. These constructs are stably maintained in the population of E. coli cells grown in the absence of the selection pressure for 63 generations. The copy number of Spc(R) constructs in E. coli host grown in antibiotic-free LB medium ranges from 25 to 40 molecules per chromosomal equivalent.
TI  - Bacteremia in patients with hematological malignancies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An appropriate regimen in the empirical therapy of neutropenic fever  episodes must be individualized at each institution. Hospitals have different patterns of microbial isolates and antibiotic resistance that must be taken into account. The aim of this study was to investigate isolates of bacteremia and their antibiotic susceptibility in patients with hematological malignancies. METHODS: All positive blood cultures at a medical center in Taiwan between 1999 and 2002 from patients with hematological malignancies were evaluated. Eleven kinds of antibiotics were tested for antimicrobial activities. The risk factors for mortality were evaluated. RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-one episodes of bacteremia in 266 patients with hematological malignancies were recorded. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were still predominant and accounted for 78.2% of isolates, followed by gram-positive cocci for 20.8% of isolates, and anaerobes for 1% of isolates. Escherichia coli was the most common isolated organism accounting for 27.5% of GNB isolates. Other isolates included Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%), and Enterobacter cloacae (10.1%). The most isolated microorganisms were susceptible to cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime or imipenem. Age, GNB microorganism and inadequate empirical antibiotics were risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime or imipenem is an ideal empirical therapy.
TI  - Analysis of etiology and drug resistance of biliary infections.
AB  - The bile was collected from fro patients with biliary infections, with the bacterium isolated to study the sensitivity of each kind of the bacterium to several antibiotics in common use. Except G- bacterium, we also found some kinds of G+ bacterium in infection bile. G- bacterium were not sensitive to Clindamycin, G+ bacterium were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin. Escherichia coli, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to Ampicillin. G+ bacterium were not sensitive to Azactam. Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter cloacae were not sensitive to Ceftazidime. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not sensitive to Ceftriaxone Sodium. We didn't found any bacterium resistance Imipenem. The possibility of the existence of G+ bacterium as well as drug resistance should be considered n patients with biliary infections. The value of susceptibility test should be respected to avoid drug abuse of antibiotics.
TI  - Variety of TEM-, SHV-, and CTX-M-type beta-lactamases present in recent clinical  isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae from Taiwan.
AB  - A total of 171 hospitals' isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of > or =2 microg/ml for ceftazidime or cefotaxime were evaluated for the production of beta-lactamases. PCR amplification with specific primers for the bla (SHV), bla (TEM), and bla (CTX) genes revealed that a total of 53, 81, and 43 of these genes were amplified, respectively. Sequencing results confirmed that TEM-1, CTX-M-3 and -14, SHV-1, -5, -11, -12, and -33, OXY-1a, and LEN-1 were presented among these isolates. No specific large cluster of isolates carried the same beta-lactamases, indicating the wide diversity of the collected strains. Plasmid spread between E. coli and K. pneumoniae was identified in few isolates. Combinations of TEM, SHV, and CTX beta-lactamase genes, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes, were observed in all three species.
TI  - In vitro activity of levofloxacin against recent Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - The objective of our study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of levofloxacin  in comparison with other antibiotics (coamoxiclav, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, meropenem, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin and netilmicin) against about 500 Gram-negative nosocomial microorganisms, isolated during 2003. The bactericidal activities (minimal bactericidal activity and killing curve) of levofloxacin and the other antibiotics were also evaluated. The results confirm the excellent in vitro activity of levofloxacin against multiresistant nosocomial Gram-negative pathogens, including the 73 extended spectrum beta-lactamase producer strains (90% of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited at 0.5 mg/l). Of particular interest is its susceptibility and bactericidal activity against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains. In conclusion, due to the favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the molecule, associated with its safety, levofloxacin may represent a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of severe Gram-negative nosocomial infections.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in children--etiologic agents and susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common clinical problem in pediatric hospitals. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of UTIs during two different time periods (from February 1999 to March 2000, and from April 2000 to September 2001) in pediatric patients treated in ambulatory or hospitalized in new children hospital. The frequency of occurrence of ESBL--producing Gram-negative rods increased during second period study. The isolated ESBL--producing strains were resistant also to aminoglicosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol Gram-negative rods were predominant microorganisms. Isolated organisms from urine samples included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus penneri, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundi, Serratia spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, Enterococcus spp. Streptococcus spp, and Candida spp. Enterococcus spp. were isolated from urine samples in 20% of cases. Only 9.4% of isolated Enterococcus spp. were high-level aminoglicoside resistant (HLAR) strains. No vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were isolated. Among coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) methicillin resistant strains (MRCNS) were isolated in 43.3%.
TI  - Interactions of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes plants cultivated in a gnotobiotic system.
AB  - The growth and persistence of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes on a diverse range of plant types over extended cultivation periods was studied. When introduced on the seed of carrot, cress, lettuce, radish, spinach and tomato all the pathogens became rapidly established shortly after germination, attaining cell densities of the order of 5.5-6.5 log cfu/g. In general, Es. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes became established and persisted at significantly higher levels on seedlings (9 days post-germination) than Salmonella. Es. coli O157:H7 became internalized in cress, lettuce, radish and spinach seedlings but was not recovered within the tissues of mature plants. Internalization of Salmonella was also observed in lettuce and radish but not cress or spinach seedlings. In contrast, L. monocytogenes did not internalize within seedlings but did persist on the surface of plants throughout the cultivation period. Co-inoculation of isolates recovered from the rhizosphere of plants did not significantly affect the numbers or persistence of human pathogens. The only exception was with Enterobacter cloacae, which reduced Es. coli O157:H7 Ph1 and L. monocytogenes levels by ca. 1 log cfu/g on lettuce. With the bioluminescent phenotype of Es. coli O157:H7 Ph1, it was demonstrated that the human pathogen became established on the roots of growing plants. Scanning electron micrographs of root seedlings suggested that Es. coli O157:H7 Ph1 preferentially colonized the root junctions of seedlings. It is proposed that such colonization sites enhanced the persistence of Es. coli O157:H7 on plants and facilitated internalization within developing seedlings. The results suggest that the risk associated with internalized human pathogens in salad vegetables at harvest is low. Nevertheless, the introduction of human pathogens at an early stage of plant development could enhance their persistence in the rhizosphere. The implications of the study with regards to on-farm food safety initiatives are discussed.
TI  - [Distribution and drug-resistance of 3 500 gram-negative bacteria in Guangzhou].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and drug-resistance of the common gram-negative bacteria in Guangzhou. METHODS: From July 2001 to August 2003, the resistance of 3 500 strains of common gram-negative bacteria isolated from 13 hospitals in Guangzhou to 15 to 21 antibiotics was determined by standard Kirby-Bauer method according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, 2000). WHONET-5 software was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Totally 3 500 gram-negative bacterial strains were isolated from 13 hospitals in Guangzhou in the past two years, and the top 3 most common pathogens of them were Escherichia coli (1 244 strains, 35.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (900 strains, 25.7%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (547 strains, 15.6 %). The total prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing strains was 31.0% (1 084/3 500). The prevalences of ESBLs-producing strains in the Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter SP., other Enterobacter SP., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Proteus SP. in Guangzhou were 38.7%, 37.9%, 5.3%, 55.2%, 8.2%, 27.7%, 33.3% and 9.2%, respectively. Among them, 1 463 (41.8%) strains was isolated from the respiratory tract and 943 (26.9%) from the urinary tract. According to our surveillance, the clinical antibacterial drug with the lowest total drug-resistance rates of Gram-negative bacteria was imipenem (8.7%) followed by Cefoperazone/sulbactam (13.3%), while that with the highest resistance was ampicillin (90.9%) followed by nalidixic acid (69.3%). Imipenem was the most effective agents against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter SP., other Enterobacter SP., and Proteus SP. isolated from 13 hospitals in Guangzhou, with drug-resistant rates of 1.1%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 3.2%, 0.8% and 0%, respectively, whereas the most effective agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was cefoperazone/sulbactam, with the drug-resistance rates of 10.8% and 15.9%, respectively. Most of the isolates were multi-drug resistant. The resistance rates of ESBLs-producing strains to 15 to 21 antimicrobial agents were much higher than those of non-ESBLs-producing strains (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance of the clinical isolates is a serious problem in Guangzhou, and the increasing prevalence of ESBLs-producing strains of other bacteria should be given full attention. An unanimous and effective strategy for controlling this problem is urgently needed. Imipenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam are the most effective antibiotics against the gram-negative bacteria isolated from the 13 hospitals in Guangzhou.
TI  - Isolation of gram-negative bacteria from cockroaches trapped from urban environment.
AB  - Three different areas--hospital, food-handling establishments and human dwellings, were surveyed for pathogenic gram-negative bacteria carried on the cuticles of cockroaches. Fifty species of bacteria were identified from all cockroaches. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were the most frequently found. Pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria represented 58% of all bacteria identified. The numbers of pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria were similar in hospital areas and food-handling establishments, while, human dwellings possessed a poorer bacterial flora. E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae were dominant species in hospital areas, while in food-handling establishments and human dwellings, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and C. freundii predominated. Therefore, cockroaches can play a role in bacterial transmission, due to the bacteria carried on their cuticles.
TI  - [Bactericial activity of chlorhexidine gluconate against recent clinical isolates of various bacterial species in Japan].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and bactericidal activity of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) were determined for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Eterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, isolated from patients in medical institutions all over Japan between 2000 and 2002. The following findings were obtained. 1. The MICs of CHG against MSSA, MRSA, E. coli and B. cepacia were 0.002% or less, and those against S. marcescens, E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa were 0.008% or less. 2. Rapid and strong bactericidal effects of CHG were observed against all clinical isolates of E. coli, E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa tested even at relatively low concentrations (0.02 to 0.05%). 3. Relatively high concentration or prolonged treatment time was required to achieve sufficient bactericidal effect of CHG against some isolates of S. aureus, S. marcescens and B. cepacia. These results suggest that CHG is useful antiseptic agent or disinfectant for recent clinical isolates of various bacterial pathogens. In addition, the selection of treatment concentration and treatment time for each organism and purpose was important to obtain sufficient bactericidal effect.
TI  - Evaluation of a new screen agar plate for detection and presumptive identification of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - A new agar screen plate for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) detection was evaluated with 50 clinical isolates of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae species: Enterobacter cloacae (n = 10), Escherichia coli (n = 10), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 25), and Proteus mirabilis (n = 2). Fecal samples were artificially inoculated with 2 concentrations (25 and 250 colony forming units [CFU]/plate) of the test strains and then applied to the new agar screen plates. By this approach, the new agar formula detected growth that was suggestive of ESBL activity in 44 of 50 (88%) and 50 of 50 (100%) of ESBL strains with 25 and 250 CFU/plate, respectively. A limitation of the agar screen plates was a lack of some specificity. Among 15 strains with resistant phenotypes other than ESBL (K1 producers of K. oxytoca, 6 strains; 9 strains with AmpC phenotype), growth was recorded in 7 (25 CFU/plate) and 11 (250 CFU/plate) of 15 strains. In conclusion, the new agar screen plate is a sensitive and convenient method to directly screen for ESBL organisms in rectal swabs or stool samples, with the potential for incorporation into routine clinical laboratory service.
TI  - The binding of MBL to common bacteria in infectious diseases of children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To purify Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) from human serum and detect its  binding ability to several kinds of bacteria common in infectious diseases of children. METHODS: MBL was purified from human serum by affinity chromatography on mannan-Sepharose 4B column. Its binding ability to eight species, 97 strains of bacteria was detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). RESULTS: MBL has different binding ability to bacteria and shows strong binding ability to Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Escherichia coli, but shows relatively lower binding ability to Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. To different isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, MBL shows quite different binding ability. CONCLUSIONS: MBL has different binding ability to different bacteria, and has relatively stronger binding ability to Gram-negative bacteria. Its binding ability to different isolates of certain kinds of bacteria is quite different.
TI  - Structure-activity relationship of 6-methylidene penems bearing tricyclic heterocycles as broad-spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitors: crystallographic structures show unexpected binding of 1,4-thiazepine intermediates.
AB  - The design and synthesis of a series of seven tricyclic 6-methylidene penems as novel class A and C serine beta-lactamase inhibitors is described. These compounds proved to be very potent inhibitors of the TEM-1 and AmpC beta-lactamases and less so against the class B metallo-beta-lactamase CcrA. In combination with piperacillin, their in vitro activities enhanced susceptibility of all class C resistant strains from various bacteria. Crystallographic structures of a serine-bound reaction intermediate of 17 with the class A SHV-1 and class C GC1 enzymes have been established to resolutions of 2.0 and 1.4 A, respectively, and refined to R-factors equal 0.163 and 0.145. In both beta-lactamases, a seven-membered 1,4-thiazepine ring has formed. The stereogenic C7 atom in the ring has the R configuration in the SHV-1 intermediate and has both R and S configurations in the GC1 intermediate. Hydrophobic stacking interactions between the tricyclic C7 substituent and a tyrosine side chain, rather than electrostatic or hydrogen bonding by the C3 carboxylic acid group, dominate in both complexes. The formation of the 1,4- thiazepine ring structures is proposed based on a 7-endo-trig cyclization.
TI  - Beta-lactam susceptibilities and prevalence of ESBL-producing isolates among more than 5000 European Enterobacteriaceae isolates.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility to 15 beta-lactam antibiotics was evaluated using Enterobacteriaceae isolated during the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active penicillin against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.9%, 98.3%, 87.4% and 82.9% of isolates susceptible). Of the cephalosporins, cefepime was most effective against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter cloacae (99.2%, 96.3% and 95.2% of isolates susceptible, respectively) and cefoxitin against Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae (98.6% and 95.6% of isolates susceptible). Carbapenems had excellent activity (> or =99.5% of all isolates). ESBL-production was confirmed with the ESBL-Etest and disk diffusion test in 1.3% of Escherichia coli isolates, 18.4% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12.6% of Klebsiella oxytoca and 5.3% of Proteus mirabilis isolates.
TI  - An antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the mountain chicken frog Leptodactylus fallax (Anura:Leptodactylidae).
AB  - A 25 amino-acid-residue, C-terminally alpha-amidated peptide with antimicrobial activity, which has been termed fallaxin, was isolated in high yield from the norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the mountain chicken frog Leptodactylus fallax (Anura:Leptodactylidae). The amino acid sequence of the peptide (Gly-Val-Val-Asp-Ile-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asp-Ile-Ala-Gly-His-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys- Val-Met-Asn-Lys-Leu.NH2) shows structural similarity with members of the ranatuerin-2 family previously isolated from the skins of frogs of the genus Rana that are only distantly related to the Leptodactylidae. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that many frog skin antimicrobial peptides are related evolutionarily, having arisen from multiple duplications of an ancestral gene that existed before the radiation of the different families. Fallaxin inhibited the growth of reference strains of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae) but with relatively low potency (MIC> or =20 microM) and was inactive against the Gram-positive bacterium (Staphylococcus aureus) and the yeast Candida albicans. The hemolytic activity of fallaxin was very low (HC50>200 microM). A second peptide, comprising residues (1-22) of fallaxin, was also isolated from the skin secretions but this component was inactive against the microorganisms tested.
TI  - Occurrence of antibiotic-resistant enterobacteria in agricultural foodstuffs.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant bacteria or their corresponding resistance determinants are  known to spread from animals to humans via the food chain. We screened 20 vegetable foods for antibiotic-resistant coliform bacteria and enterococci. Isolates were directly selected on antibiotic-containing selective agar (color detection). Thirteen "common vegetables" (tomato, mushrooms, salad) possessed 10(4)-10(7) cfu/g vegetable of coliform bacteria including only few antibiotic-resistant variants (0-10(5) cfu/g). All seven sprout samples showed a some orders of magnitude higher contamination with coliform bacteria (10(7)-10(9) cfu/g) including a remarkable amount of resistant isolates (up to 10(7) cfu/g). Multiple resistances (up to 9) in single isolates were more common in sprout isolates. Resistant bacteria did not originate from sprout seeds. The most common genera among 92 isolates were: 25 Enterobacter spp. (19 E. cloacae), 22 Citrobacter spp. (8 C. freundii), and 21 Klebsiella spp. (9 K. pneumoniae). Most common resistance phenotypes were: tetracycline (43%), streptomycin (37%), kanamycin (26%), chloramphenicol (29%), co-trimoxazol (9%), and gentamicin (4%). The four gentamicin-resistant isolates were investigated in molecular details. Only three (chloramphenicol) resistant, typical plant-associated enterococci were isolated from overnight enrichment cultures. In conclusion, a contribution of sprouts contaminated with multiresistant, Gram-negative enterobacteria to a common gene pool among human commensal and pathogenic bacteria cannot be excluded.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Intestinal microflora in 45 crows in Ueno Zoo and the in vitro susceptibilities of 29 Escherichia coli isolates to 14 antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Microorganisms from 45 jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) captured from July to  December 2002 at Ueno Zoo, Tokyo were identified as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Pseudomonas maltophila, Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. E. coli showed the highest rate of isolation (21.6%). In an in vitro susceptibility test for 29 isolates of E. coli to 14 antimicrobial agents, all the isolates were resistant to penicillin G, vancomycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, bicozamycin, sulfadimethoxine, and olaquindox. Several isolates of them were also resistant to tetracycline, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Twenty-nine isolates were divided into 19 serogroups and the most frequently identified serogroups were O8, O114 and O144, which showed the same multidrug-resistant patterns.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some netropsin analogues.
AB  - Nine novel lexitropsins were synthesized by linking two netropsin-like moieties through three different dicarboxylic acids; 9,10-dihydro-2,7-phenanthrenedicarboxylic acid; [(3-[[(carboxymethyl)amino]carbonyl]benzoyl)amino]acetic acid and indole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid. The netropsin residues were modified by the use of N-isopentylpyrrole, 5-methylthiophene or 5-isopropylthiazole heterocyclic building blocks in place of the usual N-methylpyrrole. The compounds were tested against five gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptomyces faecalis, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Mycobacterium fortuitum, three gram-negative bacteria: Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and three fungi: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans and Aspergillus nidulans. Some of the compounds showed significant inhibitory effects on the growth of the microorganisms.
TI  - [Development and evaluation of a PCR method for diagnosis of Salmonella enteric fever, based on DNA sequences of the hilA gene].
AB  - Typically, diagnosis of enteric fever due to Salmonella spp. is by bacterial isolation from blood culture; however, the blood culture method is slow, not always available, and not informative in patients with antibiotic treatment. Salmonella spp. uses the hilA gene (component of the pathogenicity island I) to invade epithelial cells and produce infection. Using the hilA gene sequence a PCR test was designed to detect Salmonella in blood samples. The sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the PCR method were obtained by testing the blood samples from 34 patients with suspected of enteric fever. Presence of S. typhi was confirmed by blood culture. Blood samples were also tested from 35 patients with infections due to other non-Salmonella pathogens, again corroborated by blood culture (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9; Serratia marcescens, 5; Escherichia coli, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9; Providencia alcalifaciens, 4; Enterobacter cloacae, 4). Control samples were obtained from 150 healthy volunteers. The S, SP, PPV and NPV for the PCR method were all 100%. The lowest number of colony forming units/ml detected by PCR in blood samples was 10.
TI  - Shiga toxin-encoding bacteriophages--genomes in motion.
AB  - Shiga toxins (Stx) represent a group of bacterial toxins that are involved in human and animal disease. Stx are mainly produced by Escherichia coli isolated from human and non-human sources, Shigella dysenteriae type 1, and sporadically, by Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Shigella flexneri. The genes encoding Stx are encoded in the genome of heterogeneous lambdoid prophages (Stx-converting bacteriophages; Stx-phages). They are located in a similar position in the late region of the prophage genome and stx is under control of phage genes. Therefore, induction of Stx-converting prophages triggers increased production of Stx. Following induction, Stx-phages can infect other bacteria in vivo and in vitro. Stx-phages may be considered to represent highly mobile genetic elements that play an important role in the expression of Stx, in horizontal gene transfer, and hence in genome diversification.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Molecular cloning, characterization, and overexpression of a novel [Fe]-hydrogenase isolated from a high rate of hydrogen producing Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08.
AB  - Degenerate primers were designed from the conserved zone of hydA structural gene  encoding for catalytic subunit of [Fe]-hydrogenase of different hydrogen producing bacteria. A 750 bp of PCR product was amplified by using the above-mentioned degenerate primers and genomic DNA of Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08 as template. The amplified PCR product was cloned and sequenced. The sequence showed the presence of an ORF of 450 bp with significant similarity (40%) with C-terminal end of the conserved zone (H-cluster) of [Fe]- hydrogenase. hydA ORF was then amplified and cloned in-frame with GST in pGEX4T-1 and overexpressed in a non-hydrogen producing Escherichia coli BL-21 to produce a GST-fusion protein of a calculated molecular mass of about 42.1 kDa. Recombinant protein was purified and specifically recognized by anti-GST monoclonal antibody through Western blot. Southern hybridization confirmed the presence of this gene in E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 genome. In vitro hydrogenase assay with the overexpressed hydrogenase enzyme showed that it is catalytically active upon anaerobic adaptation. In vivo hydrogenase assay confirmed the presence of H2 gas in the gas mixture obtained from the batch culture of recombinant E. coli BL-21. A tentative molecular mechanism has been proposed about the transfer of electron from electron donor to H-cluster without the mediation of the F-cluster.
TI  - Evaluation of the MicroScan ESBL plus confirmation panel for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the performance of the MicroScan ESBL plus confirmation panel using a series of 87 oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of various species. METHODS: Organisms tested included 57 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains comprising Enterobacter aerogenes (3), Enterobacter cloacae (10), Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (26), Klebsiella oxytoca (3) and Proteus mirabilis (4). Also included were 30 strains resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins but lacking ESBLs, which were characterized with other resistance mechanisms, such as inherent clavulanate susceptibility in Acinetobacter spp. (4), hyperproduction of AmpC enzyme in Citrobacter freundii (2), E. aerogenes (3), E. cloacae (3), E. coli (4), Hafnia alvei (1) and Morganella morganii (1), production of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase in K. pneumoniae (3) and E. coli (3) or hyperproduction of K1 enzyme in K. oxytoca (6). RESULTS: The MicroScan MIC-based clavulanate synergy correctly classified 50 of 57 ESBL strains as ESBL-positive and 23 of 30 non-ESBL strains as ESBL-negative (yielding a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 76.7%, respectively). False negatives among ESBL producers were highest with Enterobacter spp. due to masking interactions between ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases. False-positive classifications occurred in two Acinetobacter spp., one E. coli producing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase and two K. oxytoca hyperproducing their chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: The MicroScan clavulanate synergy test proved to be a valuable tool for ESBL confirmation. However, this test has limitations in detecting ESBLs in Enterobacter spp. and in discriminating ESBL-related resistance from the K1 enzyme and from inherent clavulanate susceptibility in Acinetobacter spp.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Newer carbapenems for urinary tract infections.
AB  - Four carbapenems have been available clinically in Japan. These are imipenem/cilastatin (IMIP/CS) and panipenem/ betamipron (PANI/BP) of the older compounds and newer carbapenems such as biapem (BIAP) and meropenem (MERO). The latter compounds are relatively stable to dehydropeptidase-1 (DHP-1) and have been reported to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the earlier carbapenems. The antimicrobial activity of these four carbapenems against fresh urinary isolates showed high activities against Enterobacteriacae such as Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli containing the class C-beta-lactamase- and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains compared to piperacillin (PIPC) and ceftazidime (CTAZ). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the carbapenems, with the exception of panipenem showed strong antimicrobial activities compared to PIPC and CTAZ. High activities were also seen against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, but methicillin-resistant strains were not affected. The first generation carbapenems showed better activity against E. faecalis than newer carbapenems. All four carbapenems were similar in clinical effectiveness in double blind trials for complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, PANI/BP is less effective in UTIs caused by P. aeruginosa than IMIP/CS. MERO showed better eradication rate of P. aeruginosa than IMIP/CS. Retrospective analysis of treated cases using carbapenems showed a rapid defervescence in the treatment of febrile complicated UTIs, which were mainly caused by mixed infection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, especially those involving P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis.
TI  - Vibrio spp. and Salmonella spp., presence and susceptibility in crabs Ucides cordatus.
AB  - The presence of Vibrio spp. and Salmonella spp. in crabs marketed at the Bezerra  de Menezes Ave., Fortaleza, State of Ceara, Brazil, was assessed between February and May, 2003. The number of individuals sampled in each one of the fifteen weekly samplings ranged between four and eight. Seven strains of Salmonella, from four different samplings, were identified, being five of them identified as serotype S. Senftenberg and two as S. Poona. All strains of Salmonella were sensitive to the tested anti-microbial drugs, with the exception of tetracycline and nalidixic acid, for which an intermediary sensibility was found. The MPN's for Vibrio ranged between 110/g and 110,000/g. Of the forty five Vibrio strains isolated from the crab samples, only 10 were identified up to the species level: two V. alginolyticus and eight V. parahaemolyticus. Bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae families were also identified, namely Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pantoea agglomerans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The proper cooking of the animals is recommended in order to avoid problems for the consumers of this crustacean.
TI  - Gram-positive merA gene in gram-negative oral and urine bacteria.
AB  - Clinical mercury resistant (Hg(r)) Gram-negative bacteria carrying Gram-positive  mercury reductase (merA)-like genes were characterized using DNA-DNA hybridization, PCR and sequencing. A PCR assay was developed which discriminated between the merA genes related to Staphylococcus and those related to the Bacillus/Streptococcus merA genes by the difference in size of the PCR product. DNA sequence analysis correlated with the PCR assay. The merA genes from Acinetobacter junii, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli were sequenced and shared 98-99% identical nucleotide (nt) and 99.6-100% amino acid identity with the Staphylococcus aureus MerA protein. A fourth merA gene, from Pantoeae agglomerans, was partially sequenced (60%) and had 99% identical nt and 100% amino acid identity with the Streptococcus oralis MerA protein. All the Hg(r) Gram-negative bacteria transferred their Gram-positive merA genes to a Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis recipient with the resulting transconjugants expressing mercury resistance. These Gram-positive merA genes join Gram-positive tetracycline resistance and Gram-positive macrolide resistance genes in their association with mobile elements which are able to transfer and express in Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Prevention of central venous catheter-related bloodstream infections using non-technologic strategies.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of nosocomial bacteremias related to the use of non-impregnated central venous catheters (CVCs) when only non-technologic strategies were used to prevent them. DESIGN: This was a prospective study of infectious complications of CVCs placed in intensive care unit (ICU) patients from April 1997 to December 2001. SETTING: The medical-surgical ICU of a tertiary-care, university-affiliated hospital in Argentina. METHODS: We studied all patients admitted to the ICU using non-impregnated CVCs. Maximal sterile barrier precautions (ie, use of cap, mask, sterile gown, sterile gloves, and large sterile drape), strict handwashing, preparation of the patients' skin with antiseptic solutions, insertion and management of catheters by trained personnel, and continuing quality improvement programs aimed at appropriate insertion and maintenance of catheters were employed. RESULTS: During the study period, 2,525 patients were admitted to the ICU. Eight hundred sixty-eight patients had 1,037 CVCs inserted. The number of CVC-related bloodstream infections (BSIs), acquired in the ICU, was 2.7 per 1,000 CVC-days (13 nosocomial CVC-related BSIs during 4,770 days of CVC use). Microorganisms isolated included methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (n = 2), coagulase-negative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (n = 2), Escherichia coli (n = 1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: A low rate of catheter-related BSI was achieved without antimicrobial-impregnated catheters. The incidence of CVC-associated bacteremias corresponded to the 10th to 20th percentile range of the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System hospitals for the same type of ICU.
TI  - Evaluation of the purification capacity of nine portable, small-scale water purification devices.
AB  - A test was performed to evaluate the microbial and chemical purification capacity of nine portable, small-scale water purification filter devices with production capacity less than 100 L/h. The devices were tested for simultaneous removal capacity of bacteria (cultured Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae), enteric protozoans (formalin-stored Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts), viral markers (F-RNA bacteriophages) and microcystins produced by toxic cyanobacterial cultures. In general, the devices tested were able to remove bacterial contaminants by 3.6-6.9 log10 units from raw water. Those devices based only on filtration through pores 0.2-0.4 microm or larger failed in viral and chemical purification. Only one device, based on reverse osmosis, was capable of removing F-RNA phages at concentrations under the detection limit and microcystins by 2.5 log10. The present study emphasised the need for evaluation tests of water purification devices from the public safety and HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) points of view. Simultaneous testing for various pathogenic/indicator microbes and microcystins was shown to be a useful and practical way to obtain essential data on actual purification capacity of commercial small-scale drinking-water filters.
TI  - Trends and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens causing bloodstream infections among febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancy.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The microbiological spectrum in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia has changed over the past several decades in western countries. The growing incidence of antimicrobial resistance is an inevitable consequence of the widespread use of antibiotics in medical settings. The aim of this study was to clarify the trends and antimicrobial resistance among pathogens causing bloodstream infections in febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancies. METHODS: The characteristics of pathogens causing bloodstream infection isolated from patients with febrile neutropenia who were treated at National Taiwan University Hospital from 1996 to 2001 were reviewed. A total of 1174 pathogens were isolated from 3093 admissions to a hematological ward during this period. Among them, 738 isolates were recovered from patients with febrile neutropenia. RESULTS: The majority (93%) of these neutropenic febrile patients had underlying acute leukemia or lymphoma. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 57% of isolated pathogens, followed by Gram-positive bacteria (32%), fungi (7%), and anaerobes (3%). In decreasing frequency, Escherichia coli (13%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (5%) were the predominant Gram-negative bacteria, while coagulase-negative staphylococci (13%), viridans group streptococci (4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (4%) were the major Gram-positive pathogens. Two-thirds (20/30) of S. aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated. Resistance to cefotaxime was found in 63% of E. cloacae, 13% of K. pneumoniae and 10% of E. coli. Overall, 33% of E. coli and 13% of K. pneumoniae were resistant to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the microbiological spectrum of microorganisms causing bloodstream infections in neutropenic febrile patients with hematological malignancies at National Taiwan University Hospital is different from western countries in that Gram-negative bacteria remain the predominant pathogens. Antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens is high and E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin are increasing.
TI  - Validation of a PCR for diagnosis of typhoid fever and salmonellosis by amplification of the hilA gene in clinical samples from Colombian patients.
AB  - Validation of a PCR test to detect hilA gene sequences of Salmonella spp. was performed in blood and faeces samples from typhoid fever and salmonellosis patients. Sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the PCR in blood samples were performed by testing: 37 patients with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever, 34 of them confirmed by isolation of S. Typhi from blood cultures; 35 patients infected with other pathogens corroborated by blood culture (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9; Serratia marcescens, 5; Escherichia coli, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9; Providencia alcalifaciens, 4 and Enterobacter cloacae, 4) and blood samples from 150 healthy volunteers. To evaluate S, SP, PPV and NPV of the PCR in faeces samples we studied: 34 patients with enteritis due Salmonella spp. (S. Typhimurium, 21; S. Enteritidis, 9; S. Choleraesuis, 3 and S. Agona, 1); faeces samples from 35 patients with enteric infection due to Shigella sonnei (8), Shigella flexneri (10), enteropathogenic E. coli (12), Aeromonas hydrophila (5) and faeces samples from 150 healthy volunteers. The S, SP, PPV and NPV of the PCR in blood samples were all 100 %. PCR detected three patients with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever and negative blood cultures. In faeces samples, S was 97 %, SP 100 %, PPV 100 % and NPV 99 %. The lowest number of c.f.u. ml(-1) detected by PCR in blood samples was 1 x 10(1) and in faeces samples 4 x 10(2).
TI  - Transcriptional analysis of the acid-inducible asr gene in enterobacteria.
AB  - We show here that transcription of the asr gene in Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae is strongly dependent on the acidification level of the growth medium, with maximal induction at pH 4.0-4.5 as determined by Northern hybridization analysis. Previous gene array analyses have also shown that asr is the most acid-induced gene in the E. coli genome. Sequence alignment of the asr promoters from different enterobacterial species identified a highly conserved region located at position -70 to -30 relative to the asr transcriptional start site. By deletion of various segments of this region in the E. coli asr promoter it was shown that sequences upstream from the -40 position were important for induction. Transcription from the E. coli asr promoter was demonstrated to be growth-phase-dependent and to require the alternative sigma factor RpoS (sigma(S)) in stationary phase. Transcription of the asr gene was also found to be subject to negative control by the nucleoid protein H-NS.
TI  - [Epidemiology and drug resistance of the pathogenic microbes in the complicated infection of hematological malignancies].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics and drug resistance profile of the infection in patients with hematological malignancies. METHODS: All the microbe strains isolated from the department of hematology in Ruijin hospital between 1998 and 2002 were collected for the assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility and the results were analysed by WHONET5 software. RESULTS: Out of the 536 strains isolated in the department of hematology, 230 (42.9%) were Gram positive and 301 (56.2%) Gram negative organisms. The first 6 strains of Gram (-) microbes in frequent order were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter Baumannii and Stenotrophomonas (xantho) maltophi. The extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) producing rates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 27.3% and 33.3%, respectively. Methylcillin resistant coagulase negative staphylococcus (MRCNS) was the most prevalent Gram (+) bacteria in the complicated infection patients with hematological malignancies, which accounted for 88.5%. Carbapenems were most sensitive for all of the gram negative bacteria, with a drug resistance rate of 11.4 (5.0% approximately 15.8%) of imipenem. For ESBLs strains, carbapenems and cefapime were the best choice, with the resistance rate of 46.4% approximately 94.4% and 50.0% approximately 75.9%, respectively. The drug resistance rate of Acinetobacter Baumannii was 25.0% approximately 41.3% for the third generation cephalosporin, 22.7% for the fourth generation cephalosporin and 12.7% for imipenem. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to carbapenems, with a resistance rate of 12.7% of imipenem; however, it was more sensitive to the third generation cephalosporin. CONCLUSION: Antibiotics should be rationally administrated with more considerations to the characteristics of epidemiology and drug resistance profile of the microbes in the given department of hematology.
TI  - Use of DNA microarrays for rapid genotyping of TEM beta-lactamases that confer resistance.
AB  - Standard clinical procedures for pathogen resistance identification are laborious and usually require 2 days of cultivation before the resistance can be determined unequivocally. In contrast, clinicians and patients face increasing threats from antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria in terms of their frequencies and levels of resistance. A major class of microbial resistance stems from the occurrence of beta-lactamases, which, if mutated, can cause the severe extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT) phenotype, which cause resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, monobactams, and beta-lactamase inhibitors. We describe an oligonucleotide microarray for identification of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 96% of the TEM beta-lactamase variants described to date which are related to the ESBL and/or IRT phenotype. The target DNA, originating from Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae cells isolated from clinical samples, was amplified and fluorescently labeled by PCR with consensus primers in the presence of cyanine 5-labeled nucleotides. The total assay, including PCR, hybridization, and image analysis, could be performed in 3.5 h. The microarray results were validated by standard clinical procedures. The microarray outperformed the standard procedures in terms of assay time and the depth of information provided. In conclusion, this array offers an attractive option for the identification and epidemiologic monitoring of TEM beta-lactamases in the routine clinical diagnostic laboratory.
TI  - Predominance and genetic diversity of community- and hospital-acquired CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in York, UK.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to detect the presence of extended-spectrum  beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae within the faecal flora of both community- and hospital-based patients in York and to characterize the bla(TEM), bla(SHV) and bla(CTX-M) genes present in these isolates. METHODS: One thousand faeces samples were collected and screened at York Hospital during October-December 2003. Ninety-five non-duplicate Enterobacteriaceae isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins were recovered; 22 isolates were selected for further study on the basis of a positive double disc diffusion test for ESBL production. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed to a range of antibiotics. The TEM, SHV and CTX-M genes were detected by PCR and the DNA sequenced. RESULTS: The distribution of ESBL-positive isolates from the hospital and community was 1.4:1. These included nine Escherichia coli, seven Enterobacter cloacae, four Citrobacter freundii and a single isolate each of Klebsiella spp. and Salmonella spp. A total of 17 isolates contained bla(CTX-M) (five bla(CTX-M-15), three bla(CTX-M-14) and nine bla(CTX-M-9)). ISEcp1 was present in isolates expressing CTX-M-14 and -15, but was absent upstream of In60-associated bla(CTX-M-9). E. coli isolates also contained either a bla(TEM-1) or bla(TEM-2), whereas six of the E. cloacae carried bla(SHV-12) and the Klebsiella spp. bla(SHV-36) in addition to bla(CTX-M-9). The single Salmonella spp. carried bla(SHV-12). CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of ESBL in isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from York was 1.9%. ESBL-producing isolates were found in both the community and hospital, with the CTX-M type most common. This is also the first report of an ESBL-producing Salmonella in the UK.
TI  - Validation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial detection of platelet (PLT)-rich-plasma (PRP)-derived PLTs  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. This study validated the BacT/ALERT for use in testing pooled PRP-derived PLTs with nine contaminating organisms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two PRP-derived PLT pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 CFUs/mL). Four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 mL was plated onto blood agar. RESULTS: All organisms (excluding P. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respective). P. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively). With E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. This was most notable with S. viridans where the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for the detection of bacteria in PRP-derived PLTs in a pooled format. Overall, the use of the BacT/ALERT system allowed the detection of pooled PRP-derived PLTs inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 CFUs per mL in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding P. acnes).
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of gram-negative bacilli from infected neonates and health care workers' hands in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  - We sought to characterize the molecular epidemiology of gram-negative bacilli (GNB) causing infections in infants and associated with carriage on nurses' hands after hand hygiene was performed. From March 2001 to January 2003, GNB caused 192 (34%) of 562 hospital-acquired infections in the 2 participating neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and were isolated from the hands of 45 (38%) of 119 nurses. Five species--Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae, all of which were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis--caused 169 (88%) of 192 of GNB infections. Overall, 58% of infections were caused by unique strains not cultured from other infants or nurses, and 31% of infections were part of unrecognized molecular clusters. In contrast, only 9% of strains that caused infections were cultured from nurses' hands. These data suggest that practices in addition to hand hygiene are needed to prevent horizontal transmission of GNB in the NICU.
TI  - Resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobials among pathogens of both bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  - This study examined the distribution of organisms and their antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted due to acute bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI). During a period of 1 year and 1 month, a total of 201 patients and 253 bacterial isolates were studied. Fever higher than 38.5 degrees C was significantly more common in the bacteremic group than the non-bacteremic group (68% vs 48%; p<0.05). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis were the most common organisms isolated. E. coli was the leading pathogen and it was significantly more predominant in bacteremic UTI than non-bacteremic UTI (73% vs 49%; p<0.01). Bacteria other than E. coli (i.e., K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Proteus spp., Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Serratia marcescens, and Providencia spp.) were more common in non-bacteremic UTI than bacteremic UTI (44% vs 22%; p<0.01). E. coli isolated from both bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients had a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (80%), cephalothin (59%), gentamicin (29%), piperacillin (61%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (56%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (34%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (36%). Isolates of P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. from the non-bacteremic group showed a higher proportion of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and ciprofloxacin. The emergence of a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) may have an impact on the antibiotic treatment of patients admitted due to acute community-acquired bacteremic or non-bacteremic UTI in Taiwan. Further studies are needed to clarify the impact of antimicrobial resistance on the outcome in these conditions.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Biotransformation of explosives by the old yellow enzyme family of flavoproteins.
AB  - Several independent studies of bacterial degradation of nitrate ester explosives  have demonstrated the involvement of flavin-dependent oxidoreductases related to the old yellow enzyme (OYE) of yeast. Some of these enzymes also transform the nitroaromatic explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). In this work, catalytic capabilities of five members of the OYE family were compared, with a view to correlating structure and function. The activity profiles of the five enzymes differed substantially; no one compound proved to be a good substrate for all five enzymes. TNT is reduced, albeit slowly, by all five enzymes. The nature of the transformation products differed, with three of the five enzymes yielding products indicative of reduction of the aromatic ring. Our findings suggest two distinct pathways of TNT transformation, with the initial reduction of TNT being the key point of difference between the enzymes. Characterization of an active site mutant of one of the enzymes suggests a structural basis for this difference.
TI  - Enteric gram-negative bacilli bloodstream infections: 17 years' experience in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the occurrence of enteric gram-negative bacilli (EGNB) bloodstream infections (BSI) in a neonatal intensive care setting during a 17-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment program was in place. To document infections, outbreaks, or epidemics, emergence of antibiotic resistance, clinical correlates, and outcomes of the most prevalent EGNB (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae). METHODS: This study analyzed demographic, clinical, and bacteriologic information from 360 infants born 1986-2002 who developed 633 blood culture-proven BSI. A total of 121 EGNB were isolated (E coli, K pneumoniae, and E cloacae). Early-onset BSI were discovered within 48 hours from birth, and late-onset BSI were those that occurred thereafter. Suspected early-onset BSI were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, suspected late-onset BSI with vancomycin and gentamicin. Antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Early-onset BSI were noted in 52 of 21,336 (244/100,000) live births (1986-1991), 40 of 20,402 (196/100,000) live births (1992-1997), and 25 of 17,926 (139/100,000) live births (1998-2002). Of these cases, 39 were caused by E coli and 4 by K pneumoniae. Antibiograms for E coli isolated during the last 5 years of the study showed an increase in antibiotic resistance that coincided with obstetric group B streptococcus antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Group B streptococcus declined from 41 to 4 cases from the first to the last period. Late-onset BSI increased from 111 to 230 cases from the first to the second 6-year study period and declined modestly (171 cases) during the last. Fifteen percent (78 cases) of late-onset BSI were caused by EGNB, 5% by other gram-negative bacilli, 67% primarily by coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and 13% by fungus. Nonspecific clinical and hematologic signs of late-onset BSI were similar across EGNB species, but necrotizing enterocolitis was often associated with E coli, whereas pneumonia and prolonged thrombocytopenia characterized K pneumoniae infections. No outbreaks or epidemics were observed, and strains of EGNB with evidence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were never isolated. CONCLUSION: Antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis may have increased antibiotic resistance in E coli isolates from early-onset BSI but has dramatically decreased group B streptococcus infections. Late-onset BSI caused by EGNB increased, but without changes in antibiotic susceptibility. In spite of medical advances, E coli, K pneumoniae, and E cloacae remain responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, especially in very low birth weight infants.
TI  - [Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study].
AB  - Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study. Between January and December 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the Bact-Alert system (14,960 FAN aerobics, 3,855 FAN anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 FAN pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of Buenos Aires city, one of La Plata city and three of the Buenos Aires province. A total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. Only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (Staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; Enterococcus faecalis 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae 2; Campylobacter spp 1; Escherichia coli 1; Enterobacter cloacae 1; Enterobacteraerogenes 1; Citrobacter freundii 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae 1; Proteus mirabilis 1; Serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of Cryptococcus neoformans). Of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the anaerobic standard (65% were Propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the FAN aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% Bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by FAN pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and 1.4% by FAN anaerobic bottle. Our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the Bact-Alert system is unnecessary.
TI  - Eight gram-negative bacteria are 10,000 times more sensitive to cationic detergents than to anionic detergents.
AB  - In liquid culture, eight typical gram-negative bacteria were ca. 10,000-fold more sensitive to cationic detergents than to the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was inhibitory at concentrations ranging from 0.0006% to 0.01%. Four pseudomonads able to form biofilms were ca. 1000-fold more resistant to CTAB on Luria-Bertani agar plates than they were in liquid culture. A lasI mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was only able to tolerate 0.1% CTAB on Luria-Bertani agar plates but could tolerate 5% CTAB when supplemented with homoserine lactone containing culture supernatants.
TI  - Evaluation of a new cefepime-clavulanate ESBL Etest to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an Enterobacteriaceae strain collection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study, we evaluated the performance of a new ESBL Etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate ESBL Etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in an Enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on Enterobacter spp. METHODS: Overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: Enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), Enterobacter cloacae (n=10), Escherichia coli (n=10), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and Proteus mirabilis (n=3). To check Etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to ESBL, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of K. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase. RESULTS: With this panel, ESBL Etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. Concentrating on Enterobacter spp., reliable ESBL detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed ESBL production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of Enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. A limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with K1 phenotypes of K. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by Etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. CONCLUSION: The new Etest ESBL strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to current methods for detection of ESBLs. In our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of ESBLs, particularly in Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Chromophoric spin-labeled beta-lactam antibiotics for ENDOR structural characterization of reaction intermediates of class A and class C beta-lactamases.
AB  - The chromophoric spin-label substrate 6-N-[3-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-oxypyrrolin-3-yl)-propen-2-oyl]penicillanic acid (SLPPEN) was synthesized by acylation of 6-aminopenicillanic acid with the acid chloride of 3-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-oxypyrrolinyl)-2-propenoic acid and characterized by physical methods. By application of angle-selected electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR), we have determined the molecular structure of SLPPEN in solution. SLPPEN exhibited UV absorption properties that allowed accurate monitoring of the kinetics of its enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis. The maximum value of the (substrate-product) difference extinction coefficient was 2824 M(-1) cm(-1) at 275 nm compared to 670 M(-1) cm(-1) at 232 nm for SLPEN [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117 (1995) 6739]. For SLPPEN, the steady-state kinetic parameters kcat and kcat/KM, determined under initial velocity conditions, were 637 +/- 36 s(-1) and 13.8 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1), respectively, for hydrolysis catalyzed by TEM-1 beta-lactamase of E. coli, and 0.5 +/- 0.04 s(-1) and 3.9 +/- 0.4 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1) for hydrolysis catalyzed by the beta-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae P99. We have also observed "burst kinetics" for the hydrolysis of SLPPEN with P99 beta-lactamase, indicative of formation of an acylenzyme reaction intermediate. In DMSO:H2O (30:70, v:v) cryosolvent mixtures buffered to pH* 7.0, the half-life of the acylenzyme intermediate formed with the P99 enzyme at -5 degrees C was > or = 3 min, suitable for optical characterization. The observation of burst kinetics in the hydrolysis of SLPPEN catalyzed by P99 beta-lactamase suggests that this chromophoric spin-labeled substrate is differentially sensitive to active site interactions underlying the cephalosporinase and penicillinase reactivity of this class C enzyme.
TI  - Frequency of extended spectrum beta lactamase producing gram negative bacilli among clinical isolates at clinical laboratories of Army Medical College, Rawalpindi.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was carried out in Microbiology department of Army Medical College, Rawalpindi to find out the frequency of extended spectrum beta lactamase producing gram negative bacilli among clinical isolates recovered from clinical specimens received from Military Hospital, Rawalpindi. METHODS: This study was carried out from 1st Jan 2002 to 30th Dec 2002. A total of 812 consecutive Gram-negative bacilli were recovered during the study period from various samples including urine, blood, pus, sputum, high vaginal swab (HVS), aspirates, i/v canula/Central venous lines (CVP), chest tubes and catheter tips. Extended spectrum beta lactamase detection in these isolates was carried out by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar. A susceptibility disk containing amoxicillin-clavulanate was placed as the inhibitor of beta lactamase in the center of the plate, and cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and aztreonam disks were placed 30 mm (center to center) from the amoxicillin-clavulanate disk. Enhancement of the zone of inhibition of the oxyimino-beta-lactam caused by the synergy of the clavulanate in the amoxicillin-clavulanate disk was considered as evidence of ESBL production. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 were used as control strains. RESULTS: The frequency of ESBL producing gram negative bacilli among the clinical isolates was 45%.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary meningitis after cranial surgery or trauma in adults.
AB  - In order to assess the clinical features, aetiology, treatment and outcome of post-neurosurgical and post-traumatic Gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM) we performed a retrospective review of all adult patients admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery who had Gram-negative bacilli cultured from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) following a neurosurgical procedure or traumatic head/spinal injury. During the 12 y of the review 33 patients had CSF isolates of Gram-negative bacilli that were thought to be significant. The median patient age was 47 y (range 22-77 y) and 21 (64%) were male. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli were the most common isolates. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) measured for half the patients' isolates resulted in 5 regimen changes, including 2 patients with E. cloacae meningitis in whom cephalosporin susceptibility decreased during cephalosporin treatment. Our recommended initial treatment was intravenous ceftriaxone and amikacin, subsequently tailored by susceptibility results; approximately half the patients remained on the antibiotics they started and half were changed to an alternate regimen, most often a carbapenem. Five patients (15%) died, 1 dying after cure of his GNBM. There were no failures in those who received more than 12 d of appropriate treatment: treatment for at least 14 d after the last positive CSF culture guaranteed cure. Initial ceftriaxone and amikacin subsequently changing to susceptibility driven alternatives, often a carbapenem, resulted in cure of 85% of our patients with GNBM.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2002 and March 2003].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2002 to March 2003 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 334 strains were isolated from 131 (75.3%) of 174 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and seventy-one strains were isolated from primary infections, and 163 strains were isolated from post-operative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citobacter freundii. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci nor P. aeruginosa producing metallo-beta-lactamase. But we noticed cefazolin-resistant E. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative bacilli isolates from inpatients and outpatients at Yaounde Central Hospital, Cameroon.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine and compare antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogenic bacteria from inpatients and outpatients at a university teaching hospital in Yaounde, Cameroon. METHODS: Gram-negative bacilli isolates (n = 522), obtained from a wide range of clinical specimens (urine, pus and blood) from inpatients and outpatients at Yaounde Central Hospital between March 1995 and April 1998, were evaluated for resistance to antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramicin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). RESULTS: Of the 522 isolates recorded, 80.3% were Enterobacteriaceae. A high incidence of resistance to amoxicillin (85%), piperacillin (75%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (71%) was observed. The proportion of antimicrobial-resistant isolates from inpatients was significantly higher than that from outpatients (P < 0.05), except for piperacillin, tobramicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The combinations of antimicrobial and organism showed that the percentage of ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter cloacae were 26.8% and 24% respectively. The rate of antimicrobial resistance in isolates from inpatients was not significantly higher than that in isolates from outpatients for all the antimicrobial/organism combinations, except for ceftazidime-resistant Escherichia coli, which was exclusively found in isolates from inpatients. Among Enterobacteriaceae, high and low level penicillinase (mostly in E. coli (13.6% and 11% respectively) and Klebsiella spp. (9% and 8% respectively) were the most important beta-lactam resistance phenotypes (31.2% and 23.6%, respectively). Wild type (exclusively observed in E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella spp.) and low level penicillinase were higher in outpatient than inpatient isolates (wild type--17.9% vs 10.8% and low level penicillinase--29.4% vs 20.5%, respectively; P < 0.05). However, extended spectrum beta-lactamase strains (Klebsiella spp. (3.5%), E. coli (2.6%), Citrobacter spp. (0.7%), Enterobacter spp. (0.4%) and P. mirabilis (0.2%)) were exclusively recovered from inpatients. Penicillinase and high level cephalosporinase resistance phenotypes were frequently observed in non-fermenter Gram-negative bacilli (46.6% and 29.1% respectively). However, there were no significant differences in penicillinase and cephalosporinase resistance between inpatient and outpatient isolates. CONCLUSION: As the incidence of antimicrobial resistance is substantially higher in isolates from inpatient than outpatient pathogens, more resources should be allocated within the hospital to encourage good antibiotic practices and good hospital hygiene.
TI  - Peritoneal fluid titer test for peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis.
AB  - Standard microbiological tests (i.e., MIC) do not account for the unique factors  of peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis which can significantly influence treatment response. Our goals were to develop a peritoneal fluid titer (PFT) test and to conduct a pilot study of its association with clinical outcome. The methodology was developed by using spent dialysate collected from patients with bacterial PD-related peritonitis prior to the initiation of antibiotics. Dialysate was processed and spiked with antibiotic to simulate two standard intraperitoneal regimens: cefazolin plus tobramycin and cefazolin alone. Thirty-six clinical isolates, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested. In the pilot study, dialysate was collected from 14 patients with bacterial PD-related peritonitis. Titers were determined by using each patient's dialysate and infecting pathogen. Titers were highly reproducible, with discrepancies in only 1% of cases. Overall, PFTs were notably higher against gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.0001). The addition of tobramycin increased titers significantly from zero to values of 1/16 to 1/64 against E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa (P < 0.0001). In the pilot study, peritoneal fluid inhibitory titers were significantly associated with clinical outcome, with a median value of 1/96 for patients who were cured compared to 1/32 for those who failed treatment (P = 0.036). In conclusion, this study provides preliminary support for the PFT as a pharmacodynamic index specific to the treatment of PD-related peritonitis. With further characterization and validation in patients, the PFT test may advance the study of antibiotic therapies for PD-related peritonitis.
TI  - [Drug-resistance analysis of Gram-negative bacilli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in lower respiratory tract infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in patients with lower respiratory tract infection and assess their drug sensitivity to provide evidence for clinical management of lower respiratory tract infection with drug-resistant ESBL-producing bacteria. METHODS: A total of 312 Gram-negative bacterial strains were isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection and identified for the presence of ESBL by Vitek ESBL detection test and double-disk synergy tests as well as standard disk diffusion test. The effects of 10 antibacterial drugs on ESBL-producing strains were compared. RESULTS: A rate of 20.1% of the isolated strains were identified to produce ESBLs, including Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginasa and Klebsiella oxytocla (accounting for 30.1%, 29.1%, 27.0%, 11.3%, and 2.5%, respectively, of the ESBL-producing strains). Imipenem possessed the most powerful antibacterial activity against ESBL-producing strains. CONCLUSIONS: Attention should be given to lower respiratory tract infections with ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacilli, and imipenem can be the primary choice for fighting such infections.
TI  - Characteristics of nosocomial bacterial meningitis in children.
AB  - Nosocomial meningitis is uncommon in children. We reviewed the medical records of all children who developed bacterial meningitis at least 72 hours after admission to Mackay Memorial Hospital for the period July 1992 through June 2000. Clinical manifestations, predisposing factors, pathogens, and outcomes were analyzed. Twenty-two cases of nosocomial meningitis were identified, comprising 9.2% (22/239) of all pediatric cases of bacterial meningitis during the study period. The male-to-female ratio was 14:8. All patients were younger than 6 months of age except for one, who was 7 years old. The mean duration between admission and onset of meningitis was 15.3 days (range, 3 to 58 days). Twenty-two organisms were isolated, including 13 Gram-negative bacteria (59%) and 9 Gram-positive bacteria (41%). The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli (5 cases), followed by Enterobacter cloacae (3), Staphylococcus aureus (3), and Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (3). Seventeen patients (77%) had concomitant bacteremia. Predisposing factors for acquisition of nosocomial meningitis included previous treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics (68%), prematurity with very low birth weight (41%), and total parenteral nutrition (32%). Two patients (9%) had previous neurosurgical intervention. Four patients (18%) died, 3 of whom were low birth weight premature infants. Nine patients (41%) had sequelae, including developmental delay, hydrocephalus, hearing impairment, and epilepsy. Neurosurgery was not a significant risk factor for the development of nosocomial meningitis, while very low birth weight played an important role. Previous intraventricular hemorrhage or hydrocephalus, prematurity with very low birth weight, infection with Gram-negative bacteria, and prior broad-spectrum antibiotic administration were associated with poor outcome.
TI  - Sanitary and bacteriological aspects of sewage treatment.
AB  - A study into the removal of contamination load and indicator bacteria was carried out in 1992-1996 in the mechanical, biological and chemical waste-water treatment plant WTP in Lezany, in the County of Reszel, in the Province of Warmia and Mazury in Poland. The results of chemical analyses found a high efficiency of removal of carbon compounds, COD (90%) and BOD (98%), in the process of purification of household sewage. In addition, a high effectiveness of total nitrogen, on average 71%, and unsatisfactory removal of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus compounds were found. The results of microbiological analyses confirmed the high efficiency of removal of indicator bacteria in the process of sewage treatment from 94 to 97%. In the sewage after the final phase of purification in stabilization ponds, the following pathogenic bacteria were identified with the use of the EPL 21tests: Escherichia coli, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter georgoriae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pnemoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Ervinia herbicola, Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia odoriefra, Serratia marcescens, Providencia alcalifaciens, Hafnia alvei, Yersina pestis, Yersina pseudotuberculosis, Yersinia fredericksenii, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, Aeromons hydrophila, Pseudomonas aerulginosa. The obtained results show that although the sewage purification system is efficient and reduces the contamination load to the level required by the regulations (Ministry of Environmental Protection, Natural Resources and Forestry from 20 September 1991) and removes a great percentage of indicator bacteria, the purified sewage may be a source of pathogenic bacteria in inland waters.

AB  
TI  - Comparative activities of doripenem versus isolates, mutants, and transconjugants of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp. with characterized beta-lactamases.
AB  - Doripenem (S-4661), a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested against over 250 clinical isolates, mutants, and transconjugants of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp., selected or derived for their beta-lactamase expression characteristics. Imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem were tested as comparators, along with cephalosporins and piperacillin-tazobactam, by using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards agar dilution methodology. Doripenem MICs were from 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml for Klebsiella isolates, irrespective of the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or plasmid-mediated AmpC or hyperproduced K1 beta-lactamase. Similarly, MICs of doripenem for both AmpC-inducible and -derepressed Enterobacter isolates were 0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml. ESBL production did not raise the MICs of doripenem for Escherichia coli transconjugants, and studies with known expression mutants confirmed that neither inducible nor depressed AmpC beta-lactamase expression was protective in Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, or Morganella morganii. In all of these respects, doripenem resembled meropenem and imipenem, whereas the MICs of ertapenem were raised (but still < or =1 microg/ml) for many ESBL-producing klebsiellas and AmpC-derepressed E. cloacae and C. freundii strains. Resistance to all carbapenems, including doripenem (MICs of mostly 16 to 64 microg/ml, compared with 0.25 to 1 microg/ml for typical strains), was seen in Acinetobacter isolates with metallo-beta-lactamases or OXA-carbapenemases. Isolates of Klebsiella and Serratia spp. with IMP, KPC, and SME beta-lactamases also were resistant to doripenem (MICs, 8 to >64 microg/ml) and to other carbapenems, although the continued apparent susceptibility (MICs, < or =0.5 microg/ml) of E. coli derivatives with cloned IMP-1 and NMC-A beta-lactamases suggested that carbapenem resistance might require other factors besides the enzymes.
TI  - Volatile compounds produced in cheese by Enterobacteriaceae strains of dairy origin.
AB  - The formation of volatile compounds in fresh cheese by 10 Enterobacteriaceae strains of dairy origin (4 Hafnia alvei, 2 Serratia liquefaciens, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Enterobacter sakazakii, and 2 Escherichia coli strains) was investigated. Small cheeses were made from pasteurized cow's milk separately inoculated with 1-3 x 10(3) CFU/ml of each of the Enterobacteriaceae strains, with glucono-8-lactone added to achieve a pH value of 5.2 in the curds. All strains reached counts close to 10(8) CFU/g in 1-day-old cheeses and survived well from day 1 to day 8. Cheeses were analyzed for volatile compounds by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, after extraction by dynamic headspace using a purge and trap apparatus. Sixty-one volatile compounds were determined in cheeses, 31 of which were further investigated. Significant increases of aldehydes, sulfur compounds, and aromatic compounds were recorded from 2-h curd to 1-day-old cheese, and of ketones, alcohols, and acids from 2-h curd to 8-day-old cheese. Acetaldehyde, 2-methyl propanal, and 3-methyl butanal predominated among aldehydes; 2,3-butanedione, 2,3-pentanedione, and 3-hydroxy 2-butanone among ketones; ethanol, 2-methyl propanol, and 3-methyl butanol among alcohols; and ethyl acetate among esters. Hierarchical cluster analysis of strains using the data of 31 volatile compounds separated clearly the strain of E. sakazakii, which produced high amounts of volatile compounds, from the other Enterobacteriaceae strains.
TI  - [Bacterial colonization of chronic wounds. Studies on outpatients in a university dermatology clinic with special consideration of ORSA].
AB  - In this retrospective investigation, we documented the bacterial colonization of  79 patients with chronic wounds, who had been treated between January 2002 and May 2003 in an outpatient wound healing clinic of a university dermatology program. We isolated 106 facultative pathogenic bacterial strains of which 56 were Staphylococcus aureus, 19 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11 Escherichia coli, 4 Proteus mirabilis, 4 Enterobacter cloacae, 2 Serratia marcescens, 2 Streptococcus group G und 8 further species. 68 of these bacterial strains were gram-positive and 46 gram-negative. Moreover we identified one patient with Candida parapsilosis. Therefore, 70.8% of all patients showed Staphylococcus aureus in their chronic wounds. Determination of the specific resistances showed 17 patients to be colonized with oxacillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA) strain; this corresponds to 21.5% of all patients. Consequently, 30.4% of all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were ORSA strains. All of the ORSA isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. Sensitivity to tetracycline was documented in 15, to amikacin in 13, to clindamycin in 7, to gentamicin and erythromycin in 6 of the ORSA-positive patients. In the case of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 10 were sensitive and 3 were intermediate in sensitivity. Beside the obligate resistance to oxacillin, penicillin G, ampicillin, cefuroxime and imipenem, none of the ORSA was sensitive to ofloxacin. The results of our investigations demonstrate the actual spectrum of bacterial colonization in chronic wounds of patients in an university dermatologic wound clinic and underline the growing problem of ORSA.
TI  - The status of antimicrobial resistance in Taiwan among gram-negative pathogens: the Taiwan surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (TSAR) program, 2000.
AB  - In a nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (Taiwan Surveillance of  Antimicrobial Resistance, TSAR), isolates were collected from 21 medical centers and regional hospitals throughout Taiwan over a three-month period in 2000 (TSAR II). This report summarizes susceptibility data of 7 common Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii) in the TSAR II collection and compared selected key forms of resistance by epidemiologic factors and with isolates collected in 1998 (TSAR I) as well as with data from international surveillance studies. Resistance of the 5 Enterobacteriaceae species to most of the commonly prescribed "first-line" antimicrobials in Taiwan, such as ampicillin (78% in E. coli, 68% in P. mirabilis), gentamicin (19% in K. pneumonia to 66% in S. marcescens), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29% in K. pneumoniae to 70% in P. mirabilis), was high, several of which are higher than other countries. Resistance to certain broad-spectrum antimicrobials is also more acute in Taiwan than most Western countries, such as ceftazidime resistant A. baumannii (73%) and ciprofloxacin resistant E. coli (12%). Differences in geographic regions and specimen types were associated with certain forms of resistance in TSAR II; however, the resistance problem is prevalent among both inpatients and outpatients of not only medical centers but also regional hospitals throughout Taiwan.
TI  - Analysis of AmpC beta-lactamase expression and sequence in biochemically atypical ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from paediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse the variation of ampC beta-lactamase gene sequence and expression in biochemically atypical Enterobacteriaceae isolates, and to identify them definitively. METHODS: beta-Lactamase gene-containing recombinant plasmids transformed into Escherichia coli were selected using ampicillin. PCR analysis was used to locate specific ampC and 16S rRNA genes, and the amplicons were sequenced. Random amplified polymorphic DNA PCR was used to group isolates and API 20E biochemical profiling was used to identify them putatively. RESULTS: Of 50 ceftazidime-resistant clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 36 were identified (>95% confidence)-using API 20E test strips-as being organisms known to express inducible class C beta-lactamases (Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii or Hafnia alvei). The rest were biochemically atypical. Of these, isolate I113, putatively identified as E. coli, possesses a chromosomally encoded ampC which differs by 15% from C. freundii OS60 ampC and by >30% from E. coli ampC. A related ampC gene was found in another seven of the atypical isolates. The use of various identification methods, including ampC sequence analysis, revealed that these I113-like ampC-positive isolates represent Citrobacter murliniae and Citrobacter youngae. CONCLUSIONS: We report sequences for two new Citrobacter spp. ampC genes, and provide evidence that ampC sequencing is a discriminatory method for identifying atypical Citrobacter spp. isolates.
TI  - A family of brevinin-2 peptides with potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the skin of the Hokkaido frog, Rana pirica.
AB  - Nine peptides displaying varying degrees of antimicrobial activity were extracted from the skin of the Hokkaido frog, Rana pirica. Five structurally related peptides were identified as members of the brevinin-2 family. These peptides were active against reference strains of Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and Gram-positive (Staphlococcus aureus) bacteria but displayed relatively low hemolytic activity. The most abundant peptide, brevinin-2PRa (680 nmol/g weight of dry skin) showed high potency [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values between 6 and 12 microM] against a range of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. In addition, activity was unaffected by NaCl concentrations up to 200 mM. Cladistic analysis based on the primary structures of brevinin-2 peptides supports a close phylogenetic relationship between R. pirica and Japanese mountain brown frog Rana ornativentris. One peptide of the ranatuerin-2 family and one strongly hemolytic peptide of the brevinin-1 family were also isolated from the extract along with two members of the temporin family, temporin-1PRa (ILPILGNLLNGLL.NH(2)) and temporin-1PRb (ILPILGNLLNSLL.NH(2)) that atypically lacked basic amino acid residues and showed only very weak antimicrobial and hemolytic activity.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in PLT components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A microbial detection system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux [formerly Organon Teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in PLTs. The recovery of nine organisms seeded into PLTs with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. The use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into Day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis PLT units to 10 and 100 CFUs per mL. Replicate samples (4 mL) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. RESULTS: All organisms (with the exception of P. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 CFUs/mL). In aggregate (with the exception of P. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). In all cases, the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. P. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 CFUs/mL), respectively. The narrower bottle neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.
TI  - Longitudinal trends in fluoroquinolone resistance among Enterobacteriaceae isolates from inpatients and outpatients, 1989-2000: differences in the emergence and epidemiology of resistance across organisms.
AB  - We conducted a 12-year study to identify and compare trends in annual prevalence  of fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance among Enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained from inpatients and outpatients in our health care system. A total of 46,070 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates underwent susceptibility testing. Although there were significant increases in inpatient FQ resistance for all Enterobacteriaceae, FQ resistance trends differed significantly across Enterobacteriaceae (P<.001). For isolates obtained from outpatients, only Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis demonstrated significant increases in FQ resistance (P<.001 for each). Trends in outpatient FQ resistance also differed significantly across Enterobacteriaceae (P<.001). There were significant differences between inpatient and outpatient FQ resistance trends for all Enterobacteriaceae except P. mirabilis and Enterobacter cloacae. Although hospital-wide use of certain antibiotics correlated significantly with inpatient FQ resistance, these correlations differed substantially across organisms. Efforts to elucidate the epidemiology of FQ resistance and identify targets for intervention must recognize and account for the variability of FQ resistance across organisms and clinical settings.
TI  - Oral bacterial flora of dogs with and without rabies: a preliminary study in Thailand.
AB  - The authors studied the bacterial flora of the dog oral cavity and of bite wounds, Aerobic bacteria were isolated from mouth swabs of 16 normal and 5 rabid dogs as well as from infected dog-bite wounds from 18 patients. A total of 20 different microbial species were recovered from mouth swab cultures. The most frequently isolated organisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pasteurella species. There were no differences in the aerobic bacterial flora between rabid and nonrabid dogs. From the cultures of the bite wound swabs, the authors found that almost all of the organisms identified were part of the normal oral flora of the dog. One or more aerobic bacteria were isolated from the infected dog-bite wounds. Two patients had four, 3 had three, 4 had two, and 6 had one of the nine organisms in their wounds. The predominant species of bacteria involved in infection of bite wounds were, as follows: Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella multocida, E. coli, Moraxella species, Pasteurella canis, and Enterobacter cloacae. However, three wound cultures had no aerobic bacterial growth. The results of this study show that the infected bite wounds may contain a mixed bacterial flora that colonize human skin and the oral cavity of dogs.
TI  - Increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Korea: KONSAR study in 2001.
AB  - The 5th year KONSAR surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. It was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of Enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. Resistance rates of Gram-positive cocci were: 70% of Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of Enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. Seventy-two percent of pneumococci were nonsusceptible to penicillin. The resistance rates of Enterobacteriaceae were: Escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and Enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. The resistance rates of P. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. Thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of Haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. Notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. With the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Primary structure and in vitro antibacterial properties of the Drosophila melanogaster attacin C Pro-domain.
AB  - In Drosophila melanogaster, seven distinct families of antimicrobial peptides with different structures and specificities are synthesized by the fat body and released into the hemolymph during the immune response. Using microscale high performance liquid chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and Edman degradation, we have isolated and characterized from immune-challenged Drosophila two novel induced molecules, under the control of the Imd pathway, that correspond to post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides or peptide fragments. The first molecule is a doubly glycosylated form of drosocin, an O-glycosylated peptide that kills Gram-negative organisms. The second molecule represents a truncated form of the pro-domain of the Drosophila attacin C carrying two post-translational modifications and has significant structural similarities to proline-rich antibacterial peptides including drosocin. We have synthesized this peptide and found that it is active against Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, this activity is potentiated when the peptide is used in combination with the Drosophila antimicrobial peptide cecropin A. The synergistic action observed between these two molecules suggests that the truncated post-translationally modified pro-domain of attacin C by itself may play an important role in the antimicrobial defense of Drosophila.
TI  - Mechanism of action of NB2001 and NB2030, novel antibacterial agents activated by beta-lactamases.
AB  - Two potent antibacterial agents designed to undergo enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic  activation were evaluated for their mechanisms of action. The compounds, NB2001 and NB2030, contain a cephalosporin with a thienyl (NB2001) or a tetrazole (NB2030) ring at the C-7 position and are linked to the antibacterial triclosan at the C-3 position. The compounds exploit beta-lactamases to release triclosan through hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring. Like cephalothin, NB2001 and NB2030 were hydrolyzed by class A beta-lactamases (Escherichia coli TEM-1 and, to a lesser degree, Staphylococcus aureus PC1) and class C beta-lactamases (Enterobacter cloacae P99 and E. coli AmpC) with comparable catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K(m)). They also bound to the penicillin-binding proteins of S. aureus and E. coli, but with reduced affinities relative to that of cephalothin. Accordingly, they produced a cell morphology in E. coli consistent with the toxophore rather than the beta-lactam being responsible for antibacterial activity. In biochemical assays, they inhibited the triclosan target enoyl reductase (FabI), with 50% inhibitory concentrations being markedly reduced relative to that of free triclosan. The transport of NB2001, NB2030, and triclosan was rapid, with significant accumulation of triclosan in both S. aureus and E. coli. Taken together, the results suggest that NB2001 and NB2030 act primarily as triclosan prodrugs in S. aureus and E. coli.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of meropenem and imipenem against Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the pharmacodynamics of meropenem and imipenem, both  administered as 500 mg every 6 hours, against populations of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. DESIGN: Ten thousand-subject Monte Carlo simulation. INTERVENTION: Variability in total body clearance (ClT), volume of distribution as calculated by the terminal elimination rate (Vdbeta), and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa) were derived from the literature for both meropenem and imipenem. For the free drug concentrations, the percentage of the dosing interval that the drug concentrations remain above the MIC (%T>MIC) for each carbapenem-bacteria combination was calculated for 10,000 iterations, substituting a different ClT, Vdbeta, fraction of unbound drug, and MIC into the equation each time based on the probability distribution for each parameter. Probabilities of attaining targets of 30%, 50%, and 100% T>MIC were calculated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Meropenem free drug %T>MIC exposure was significantly greater than that of imipenem against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, whereas imipenem exposure was greater for A. baumannii. For both agents, free drug %T>MIC exposure was greatest against Enterobacteriaceae and less for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Probabilities of target attainment for 30% and 50% T>MIC were similar between drugs for most bacteria. At 100% T>MIC, meropenem target attainments were greater than those of imipenem against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, and imipenem attainment was higher for A. baumannii. CONCLUSION: The probability of attaining lower pharmacodynamic targets for most gram-negative bacteria is similar for these carbapenems; however, differences become apparent as the pharmacodynamic requirement increases. Further study of the benefits of achieving this pharmacodynamic breakpoint with a higher probability of attaining targets is necessary.
TI  - A novel integrative and conjugative element (ICE) of Escherichia coli: the putative progenitor of the Yersinia high-pathogenicity island.
AB  - Diversification of bacterial species and pathotypes is largely caused by horizontal transfer of diverse DNA elements such as plasmids, phages and genomic islands (e.g. pathogenicity islands, PAIs). A PAI called high-pathogenicity island (HPI) carrying genes involved in siderophore-mediated iron acquisition (yersiniabactin system) has previously been identified in Yersinia pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica IB strains, and has been characterized as an essential virulence factor in these species. Strikingly, an orthologous HPI is a widely distributed virulence determinant among Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae which cause extraintestinal infections. Here we report on the HPI of E. coli strain ECOR31 which is distinct from all other HPIs described to date because the ECOR31 HPI comprises an additional 35 kb fragment at the right border compared to the HPI of other E. coli and Yersinia species. This part encodes for both a functional mating pair formation system and a DNA-processing region related to plasmid CloDF13 of Enterobacter cloacae. Upon induction of the P4-like integrase, the entire HPI of ECOR31 is precisely excised and circularised. The HPI of ECOR31 presented here resembles integrative and conjugative elements termed ICE. It may represent the progenitor of the HPI found in Y. pestis and E. coli, revealing a missing link in the horizontal transfer of an element that contributes to microbial pathogenicity upon acquisition.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - [Infective pathogens and drug resistance in burned patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To find out the changes in the infective pathogens and their drug resistance in burned patients. METHODS: The patients were divided into two groups. The first group was from July 1991 to June 1996, and the second group was from July 1996 to June 2001. The bacteria of burned body surface and blood were cultured, and the bacteria and their drug sensitivity were analyzed. RESULTS: Gram-negative bacteria were the major bacteria in burn infection, among which Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the top. Staphylococcus aureous ranked the first among the Gram-positive bacteria, and the isolation rate of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus increased; The isolation rate of Enterobacter cloacae (10.4%), Escherichia coli (8.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.3%), and fungus (4.2%) all rose. The antibiotic resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureous increased. CONCLUSION: The changes in pathogens of burn infection and bacterial drug resistance are related to the wide use of broad spectrum antibiotics such as cefazidime and imepenem, suggesting that dynamic observation of changes in pathogenic strains and sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics are useful for clinical prevention and cure of burn infection.
TI  - A molecular phylogeny of enteric bacteria and implications for a bacterial species concept.
AB  - A molecular phylogeny for seven taxa of enteric bacteria (Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Hafnia alvei, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia plymuthica) was made from multiple isolates per taxa taken from a collection of environmental enteric bacteria. Sequences from five housekeeping genes (gapA, groEL, gyrA, ompA, and pgi) and the 16S rRNA gene were used to infer individual gene trees and were concatenated to infer a composite molecular phylogeny for the species. The isolates from each taxa formed tight species clusters in the individual gene trees, suggesting the existence of 'genotypic' clusters that correspond to traditional species designations. These sequence data and the resulting gene trees and consensus tree provide the first data set with which to assess the utility of the recently proposed core genome hypothesis (CGH). The CGH provides a genetically based approach to applying the biological species concept to bacteria.
TI  - Confirmation of Escherichia coli and its distinction from Klebsiella species by gas and indole formation at 44 and 44.5 degrees C.
AB  - AIMS: In the enumeration of coliform bacteria, confirmation of Escherichia coli has been based upon gas and indole production at the elevated incubation temperature. The test for gas production has recently been questioned. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of gas production test on the reliability of confirmation of E. coli. METHODS AND RESULTS: The impact of several media on growth, gas and/or indole formation was tested at 44 and 44.5 degrees C using 547 environmental isolates. These were mainly E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca and Enterobacter cloacae strains. Another set of 250 faecal and environmental klebsiellae were tested for their maximum temperature for growth (Tmax) and for gas formation. Escherichia coli and even K. pneumoniae grew well in all the media, but gas production was more dependent on the medium used. Growth of the mainly gas negative Ent. cloacae and K. oxytoca strains was still more sensitive to the medium and incubation conditions. Tryptophan salt broth was the most productive medium for the indole test, followed by lauryl tryptose mannitole and tryptone mannitol ricinoleate broth (TRM). Tmax of K. oxytoca was clearly lower than Tmax of K. pneumoniae but a rather high fraction of its isolates produced indole at 44.5 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: False-positive E. coli confirmation is possible if gas production is not tested for and the confirmation is based on indole test only. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Erroneous positive results on routine analysis for E. coli can occur.
TI  - A new alginate-based rapid method for determining coliforms in milk.
AB  - A new rapid method for monitoring coliforms was developed on the basis of the instant gelling effects of alginate and calcium. The effectiveness of this new method in the detection of coliforms was evaluated. Tests involving Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, total coliforms in milk, cold-injured coliforms, and total coliforms in raw milk were carried out. The bacterial samples were diluted in 0.2% peptone water containing 90 mM CaCl2 and added into test tubes containing modified purple broth base medium. Coliform concentrations were determined on the basis of the time of color change and gas production in the alginate tubes. All results obtained by the alginate method correlated strongly with those obtained by the conventional violet red bile agar (VRBA) plating method. The alginate method reduced detection time by 12 to 14 h compared with the conventional VRBA plating method. The alginate method can be applied in field studies more easily than melted-agar systems can. The results of this study indicate that the alginate method is an accurate, rapid, simple, and economical way to monitor and estimate concentrations of total coliforms in food.
TI  - Evaluation of parameters affecting quantitative detection of Escherichia coli O157 in enriched water samples using immunomagnetic electrochemiluminescence.
AB  - We report here the use of immunomagnetic (IM) electrochemiluminescence (ECL) for  quantitative detection of Esherichia coli O157:H7 in water samples following enrichment in minimal lactose broth (MLB). IM beads prepared in-house with four commercial anti-O157 monoclonal antibodies were compared for efficiency of cell capture. IM-ECL responses for E. coli O157:H7 (strain SEA13B88) were similar for all four commercial anti-O157 LPS monoclonal antibodies. The ECL signal was linearly correlated with E. coli O157:H7 cell concentration, indicating a constant ECL response per cell. Twenty-two strains of E. coli O157:H7 or O157:NM gave comparable ECL signals using IM beads prepared in-house. To assess the potential for interference from background bacteria in MLB-enriched water samples, 10(4) cells of E. coli O157:H7 (strain SEA13B88) were added to enriched samples prior to analysis. There was considerable variability in recovery of E. coli O157:H7 cells; net ECL signals ranged from 1% to 100% of expected values (i.e., percent inhibition from 0% to 99%). Cultures of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Enterobacter cloacae, subsequently isolated from MLB-enriched water samples via IM separation (IMS), were observed to interfere with the binding of E. coli O157:H7 cells to IM beads. Recoveries of 10(4) E. coli O157:H7 cells were </=10% in the presence of ca. 10(8) K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, or E. cloacae cells. None of these strains gave a positive IM-ECL signal. Although competitive binding decreased sensitivity, there still was a linear correlation between ECL signal and higher E. coli O157:H7 cell concentrations. These studies indicate that IM-ECL in conjunction with MLB enrichment is capable of quantitatively detecting as few as 10(3) to 10(5) E. coli O157:H7 cells ml(-1), depending on percent recoveries, in enriched samples that contain ca. 10(9) total lactose-fermenting bacteria ml(-1). Assuming comparable growth rates for E. coli O157:H7 and other lactose-fermenting bacteria in MLB, it may be possible to detect as few as one E. coli O157:H7 in 100 ml of raw water containing as many as 10(4) to 10(6) lactose-fermenting bacteria (i.e., total coliforms).
TI  - Construction of Escherichia coli strains for conversion of nitroacetophenones to  ortho-aminophenols.
AB  - The predominant bacterial pathway for nitrobenzene (NB) degradation uses an NB nitroreductase and hydroxylaminobenzene (HAB) mutase to form the ring-fission substrate ortho-aminophenol. We tested the hypothesis that constructed strains might accumulate the aminophenols from nitroacetophenones and other nitroaromatic compounds. We constructed a recombinant plasmid carrying NB nitroreductase (nbzA) and HAB mutase A (habA) genes, both from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes JS45, and expressed the enzymes in Escherichia coli JS995. IPTG (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside)-induced cells of strain JS995 rapidly and stoichiometrically converted NB to 2-aminophenol, 2-nitroacetophenone (2NAP) to 2-amino-3-hydroxyacetophenone (2AHAP), and 3-nitroacetophenone (3NAP) to 3-amino-2-hydroxyacetophenone (3AHAP). We constructed another recombinant plasmid containing the nitroreductase gene (nfs1) from Enterobacter cloacae and habA from strain JS45 and expressed the enzymes in E. coli JS996. Strain JS996 converted NB to 2-aminophenol, 2-nitrotoluene to 2-amino-3-methylphenol, 3-nitrotoluene to 2-amino-4-methylphenol, 4-nitrobiphenyl ether to 4-amino-5-phenoxyphenol, and 1-nitronaphthalene to 2-amino-1-naphthol. In larger-scale biotransformations catalyzed by strain JS995, 75% of the 2NAP transformed was converted to 2AHAP, whereas 3AHAP was produced stoichiometrically from 3NAP. The final yields of the aminophenols after extraction and recovery were >64%. The biocatalytic synthesis of ortho-aminophenols from nitroacetophenones suggests that strain JS995 may be useful in the biocatalytic production of a variety of substituted ortho-aminophenols from the corresponding nitroaromatic compounds.
TI  - Bacteremia in hematological and oncological children with febrile neutropenia: experience in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan.
AB  - A retrospective study of bacteremia in children with febrile neutropenia admitted to a medical center in Taiwan from January 1999 to December 1999 was performed. There were 190 episodes of febrile neutropenia during this period and 46 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 38 bacteremic episodes (7 mixed infections). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%), and Enterobacter cloacae (10.9%) were the most common isolates. Three of the 5 isolates of S. aureus were resistant to methicillin. Twenty-three episodes of bacteremia (four mixed infections) were associated with recent antibiotic use. Of the 23 bacteremic episodes with recent antibiotic use, P. aeruginosa (20%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (10%), K. pneumoniae (10%), Escherichia coli (10%), and E. cloacae (10%) were isolated most often. Relapsed leukemia (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.5) and recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-7.7) were the independent risk factors of bacteremia. There were 9 mortality cases in patients with bacteremia, including 4 cases with mixed infections, and 5 cases with P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, S. aureus, and Streptococcus mitis, respectively. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were necessary in febrile neutropenic children because of the high percentage of mixed infection.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - [Prostate histopathology of NIH category IV prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  - Asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category IV in NIH classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). No report concerning this category has been present. We investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. Among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (PSA) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between January, 1996 and December, 2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as NIH category IV prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). We observed all pathological specimens stained with Hematoxylin-Eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by True et al. (1999). We also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as PSA values, PSA density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. In the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. Location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88) in stromal. No relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. However, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate cancers, later. Pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). Bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). Isolated bacteria were 4 strains of Enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Gram positive rod, and Candida sp. No relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. These results indicated that the incidence of NIII category IV prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. However, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.
TI  - The biological activity of antibacterial substance produced by Enterobacter cloacae B8.
AB  - An antibacterial substance was extracted and purified from the culture of Enterobacter cloacae B8 and the antagonistic activities of the extract to 229 clinical pathogen strains was tested by the K-B paper-dish method. The extract of Enterobacter cloacae B8 showed strongly antagonistic activity to all 146 tested stains of Staphylococcus spp.; the antagonistic diameter was about 18-32 mm, averaging about 26.5 mm; showing especially strong antagonistic activity to all 87 tested strains of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the average antagonistic diameter was about 22.6 mm. The average antagonistic diameter of the extract of Enterobacter cloacae B8 to 3 tested strains of Escherchia coli and 8 tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae was about 14 mm and 13 mm, respectively; showing only antagonistic activities to 3 strains of Acinetobacter spp. in 26 tested strains, and showing no antagonistic activities to all 25 tested strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of partially purified extract against MRSA was about 9.4 micrograms/ml determined by disc-diffusion method, and the MIC of Vancomycin was about 3.1 micrograms/ml as the control in this study.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four European countries, Canada, and the United States in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  - Access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. The present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in Europe (France, Germany, Italy, and Spain), Canada, and the United States to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. All but two isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of Proteus mirabilis from France and one isolate of Morganella morganii from Canada) were susceptible to imipenem. The susceptibility of Escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for P. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except Italy. In contrast, susceptibility of E. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (Spain) to 94.0% (France); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (Spain) to 91.6% (United States). Among Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. Considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of Serratia marcescens and M. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. For S. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (France) to 94.1% (Italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (Germany) to 90.7% (Spain). Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of Enterobacteriaceae studied. The present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Beta-lactamase stability of faropenem.
AB  - Faropenem (FAR) is an orally available member of the penem class unique among carbapenems and other available beta-lactams. This study compared FAR to cephalosporins and imipenem with respect to beta-lactamase (BLA) stability and emergence of resistance to Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. BLA stability was studied using enzyme preparations from sonicated/centrifuged 24-hour cultures of E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, S. aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis grown in the presence of 20 mg/l ampicillin or cephaloridine to induce penicillinase or cephalosporinase, respectively. Substrate hydrolysis was quantitated spectrophotometrically. Multistep acquisition of resistance was promoted by growing bacteria in broth containing 2-fold dilutions of antibiotic over 10 cycles. Aliquots from test tubes with visible growth provided the inoculum for the next series of dilutions. FAR as well as other cephalosporins tested were highly stable to penicillinase derived from S. aureus and E. coli. However, E. coli- and P. vulgaris-derived cephalosporinase hydrolyzed cephaloridine, cefaclor and cefotiam considerably, whereas FAR was highly stable. FAR was highly stable against hydrolysis by various BLAs prepared from four B. fragilis strains and the rate of FAR hydrolysis by metallo-BLA was 5 times lower than that for imipenem. Additionally, the acquisition of resistant S. aureus strains was less pronounced for FAR compared to other agents tested. MICs rose 8-fold after the 10th sub-MIC exposure, while MICs rose 16-, 31- and 512-fold for cefixime, cefazolin and cefaclor, respectively. E. coli shifts in MICs were moderate for all the agents tested. In conclusion, FAR is characterized by pronounced BLA stability compared to other cephalosporins and imipenem. Furthermore, a lower propensity for resistance development with FAR as compared to cephalosporins was observed.
TI  - Enhancement of plasmid curing by 9-aminoacridine and two phenothiazines in the presence of proton pump inhibitor 1-(2-benzoxazolyl)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-propanone.
AB  - Plasmid-containing bacteria often cause serious therapeutic failure during the treatment of infectious diseases. The selection of resistant-mutant strains and the transfer of mobile genetic determinants (such as plasmids and transposons) of resistance promote increased antibiotic resistance. In the last 30 years the antiplasmid effect of acridine dyes, ethidium bromide, sodium dodecyl sulphate and phenothiazines was described. The main aim of this study was to test the mechanism of the antiplasmid effect of promethazine and 9-aminoacridine on doxycycline-resistant enteric bacteria. The antiplasmid effects of promethazine and 9-aminoacridine were studied on plasmid elimination of native plasmid DNA and plasmid DNA isolated from drug-treated cells of plasmid-containing Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae. The effects of some phenothiazines on plasmid profiles of bacterial strains isolated from urinary tract infections were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Various complex of plasmid DNA were identified in the presence of promethazine, trifluoperazine and 9-aminoacridine in the agarose gel electrophoresis. Doxycycline resistance of tested enteric bacteria was the target of "curing" in the presence of promethazine and trifluoperazine. The frequency of elimination of tetracycline resistance was low despite the formation of antiplasmid compounds complex with isolated plasmid DNA. Tetracycline resistance plasmid was isolated and re-transformed. The plasmid curing effects of promethazine, trifluoperazine and 9-aminoacridine were increased in the presence of a trifluoroketone proton pump inhibitor on E. coli K12 LE140 strain in a model experiment. We propose that the inefficient penetration of antiplasmid compounds could be responsible for the weak plasmid-curing effect in some clinical isolates and that membrane active, calmodulin- and proton pump inhibitors may be combined for plasmid curing in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
TI  - A new view of the mechanisms of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA) and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (AroA) derived from X-ray structures of their tetrahedral reaction intermediate states.
AB  - UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA) and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (AroA) constitute the small enzyme family of enolpyruvyl transferases, which catalyze the chemically unusual reaction of enolpyruvyl transfer. MurA catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall; AroA is the sixth enzyme of the shikimate pathway leading to the synthesis of aromatic compounds in numerous microorganisms and plants. Because both metabolic pathways are absent from mammals but essential for the growth of microorganisms, MurA and AroA are attractive targets for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs. We have determined the x-ray structures of the D305A mutant of Enterobacter cloacae MurA and the D313A mutant of Escherichia coli AroA, both of which crystallized in the presence of their substrates. The structures depict the tetrahedral reaction intermediate states of the enzymes and prove that, without the aspartate side chain, the overall addition-elimination reaction in both enzymes is halted after the addition step. The presented structures lead to a new view of the catalytic mechanism and, moreover, provide an ideal starting point for the rational design of potent inhibitors of MurA and AroA.
TI  - Contemporary re-evaluation of the activity and spectrum of grepafloxacin tested against isolates in the United States.
AB  - Grepafloxacin potency and spectrum of activity were re-evaluated against contemporary pathogens collected from clinical infections in 2001-2002. A total of 995 isolates were tested for grepafloxacin by the reference agar dilution method and these results were compared to those of 25 other antimicrobial agents. Grepafloxacin activity remained comparable to that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae (MIC(90), 0.03-2 microg/ml; 0.0-7.7% resistance rates). For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, grepafloxacin was active against ciprofloxacin-susceptible (MIC(90), 2 microg/ml), but not against ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC(90), >8 microg/ml) isolates. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, grepafloxacin susceptibility rate was 91.4%, equal to that of levofloxacin. None of the fluoroquinolones showed reasonable activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Gatifloxacin and grepafloxacin had the same MIC(90) against beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.25 microg/ml) and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.25 microg/ml). Grepafloxacin and other fluoroquinolone activities were not influenced by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae. Grepafloxacin was very active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90), 0.03 microg/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90), 0.03 microg/ml) and Legionella spp. (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). These results on recently isolated organisms indicate that grepafloxacin has a sustained potency and spectrum against most clinically important and indicated pathogens.
TI  - GASP phenotype: presence in enterobacteria and independence of sigmaS in its acquisition.
AB  - The appearance of growth advantage in stationary phase or GASP was originally detected in Escherichia coli. The presence of this phenotype in other enterobacteria such as Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Providencia stuartii and Shigella dysenteriae is described in this work. E. cloacae GASP strains presented lower levels of RpoS than the parental strain, although no mutation in the gene or its promoter was detected. This work offers evidence of GASP rpoS-independent pathways as GASP was also acquired in knock-out rpoS E. cloacae and E. coli strains.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in Buenos Aires, Argentina, public hospitals.
AB  - Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). In order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of ESBLs in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from April to May 2000. Extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. From a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards' Screening and Confirmatory Tests for ESBL production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-Lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and PCR amplification using specific primers. Three different ESBLs were detected: SHV-related (4 isolates), PER-2-type (9 isolates), and CTX-M-2-related (26 isolates). Sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed CTX-M-2 in 19 of 21 and CTX-M-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. CTX-M-2 (or its variant) was detected in all Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Providencia stuartii strains, while PER-2 was detected in Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; SHV-related ESBL were found only in K. pneumoniae. These results clearly show that CTX-M-2 is the most prevalent ESBL produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in Buenos Aires.
TI  - The role of visible faecal material as a vehicle for generic Escherichia coli, coliform, and other enterobacteria contaminating poultry carcasses during slaughtering.
AB  - AIMS: A comparison of Enterobacteriaceae, coliform and Escherichia coli counts in chicken carcasses with and without visible faecal contamination was conducted to evaluate the role of contamination as a vehicle for generic E. coli, coliform and other enterobacteria contaminating broiler chicken carcasses when processed under routine commercial operations. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples were removed from the processing line immediately after evisceration, inside-outside shower and chilling for microbiological analysis. After evisceration, mean counts were significantly different only for E. coli (P < or = 0.05) in chicken carcasses with and without visible faecal contamination. While the spray wash practice was not efficient enough for complete removal of the visible contamination from carcasses, leading to microbiological reduction percentages lower than expected, 25 ppm chlorinated water chilling did reduce the contamination level considerably in all samples. CONCLUSIONS: Carcasses with and without visible faecal contamination harboured E. coli and other potentially hazardous enterobacteria. E. coli was the predominant strain isolated in all samples, Enterobacter cloacae being next most frequent. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The zero tolerance of visible faecal contamination requirement alone is not sufficient to assure safety and to improve the microbial quality of carcasses.
TI  - Modification of the double-disk test for detection of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum and AmpC beta-lactamases.
AB  - Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae is problematic. A modification of the double-disk test (MDDT) has been developed for successful detection of ESBLs in gram-negative bacilli producing well-characterized beta-lactamases as well as 212 clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Citrobacter freundii. MDDT accurately differentiated between ESBL producers and derepressed chromosomal AmpC mutants. MDDT provides a cost-effective alternative approach for clinical microbiology laboratories for routine susceptibility testing with simultaneous detection of ESBLs in enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - [Surveillance on drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli isolated from hospital  acquired infections and community acquired infections (2000 - 2001)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the resistance rates of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections (HAI) or community acquired infections (CAI) in the 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in China. METHODS: 1596 strains of gram-negative bacilli from the 2401 pathogenic strains isolated from 13 hospitals 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 were collected for susceptibility test using international standard two-fold agar dilution method. According to the criteria of guidelines of NCCLS (2001), MIC(50) and MIC(90) were detected for antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and R%, I%, and S%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of bacteria to the compounds tested. RESULTS: 15 species of gram-negative pathogens were isolated and most of them could be isolated from both CAI and HAI patients. The resistance rates of isolates, especially Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia spp. and Acinetobacter spp. from HAI were higher than those of CAI. The carbopenems were the most active compounds tested against Enterobacteriaceae. Cefoperozone/sulbactam and cefprime demonstrated excellent activity against most of Gram-negative bacilli. Most of the Gram-negative bacilli were still rather susceptible to cefatazidime, a third generation cephalosporin, with a susceptibility rate of 70% to 100%. Fluoroquinolones showed strong and broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacilli, but more than 50% of Escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones, and the susceptible rates to fluoroquinolones of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae had decreased. CONCLUSION: (1) The results obtained in the two surveillance-years, 2000 - 2001 and 1998 - 1999, were similar in the bacterial resistance pattern and the trend of rising of resistant rates for some Gram-negative pathogens. (2) The resistance rates of isolates from HAI patients were higher than those of CAI.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by E test.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by E test. We found that the MIC(50) and MIC(90) values against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae family except Serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (MIC range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. The susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for Escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although Serratia and Acinetobacter exhibited more or less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (MIC(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. The ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. We propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these three fluoroquinolones in treating Enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). These data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of Acinetobacter and P. aeruginosa), as well as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Ireland, including a novel enzyme, TEM-102.
AB  - Organisms producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) have been reported  in many countries, but there is no information on the prevalence of ESBL-producing members of the family Enterobacteriaceae in Ireland. A total of 925 isolates of ampicillin-resistant members of the Enterobacteriaceae were received from six hospitals in Ireland over a 3-year period from September 1996 to September 1999. Isolates were screened for ESBL production by the double-disk diffusion (DDD) method. DDD-positive isolates that were (i) confirmed as ESBL producers by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) confirmatory testing and (ii) susceptible to cefoxitin by disk diffusion were considered ESBL producers. By these criteria, 27 (3%) of the ampicillin-resistant members of the Enterobacteriaceae studied were categorized as ESBL producers. Molecular typing suggested that some intra- and interhospital spread of ESBL-producing isolates had occurred. DNA sequencing of amplified bla(TEM) and bla(SHV) genes resulted in the detection of a novel bla(TEM) ESBL gene, bla(TEM-102) in two isolates (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) received from the same hospital but isolated from different patients. The study suggests dissemination of ESBL-producing bacteria within the health care system in Ireland and emphasizes the need for measures to control such spread.
TI  - Identification of residues critical for catalysis in a class C beta-lactamase by  combinatorial scanning mutagenesis.
AB  - Despite their clinical importance, the mechanism of action of the class C beta-lactamases is poorly understood. In contrast to the class A and class D beta-lactamases, which contain a glutamate residue and a carbamylated lysine in their respective active sites that are thought to serve as general base catalysts for beta-lactam hydrolysis, the mechanism of activation of the serine and water nucleophiles in the class C enzymes is unclear. To probe for residues involved in catalysis, the class C beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae P99 was studied by combinatorial scanning mutagenesis at 122 positions in and around the active site. Over 1000 P99 variants were screened for activity in a high-throughput in vivo antibiotic resistance assay and sequenced by 96-capillary electrophoresis to identify residues that are important for catalysis. P99 mutants showing reduced capability to convey antibiotic resistance were purified and characterized in vitro. The screen identified an active-site hydrogen-bonding network that is key to catalysis. A second cluster of residues was identified that likely plays a structural role in the enzyme. Otherwise, residues not directly contacting the substrate showed tolerance to substitution. The study lends support to the notion that the class C beta-lactamases do not have a single residue that acts as the catalytic general base. Rather, catalysis is affected by a hydrogen-bonding network in the active site, suggesting a possible charge relay system.
TI  - Suppression of leaf feeding and oviposition of phytophagous ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) by chitinase gene-transformed phylloplane bacteria and their specific bacteriophages entrapped in alginate gel beads.
AB  - The chitinase gene-transformed strain KPM-007E/chi of Enterobacter cloacae was vitally entrapped in sodium alginate gel beads with its specific virulent bacteriophage EcP-01 to provide a new method for microbially digesting chitinous peritrophic membranes of phytophagous ladybird beetles Epilachna vigintioctopunctata. First, chitinase SH1 from a gram-positive bacterium Kurthia zopfii was overproduced by Escherichia coli cells and purified by affinity column chromatography. The purified enzyme effectively digested peritrophic membranes dissected from the ladybird beetles to expose epithelial tissues beneath the peritrophic membrane, and the beetles that had ingested chitinase after submergence in chitinase solution had considerably reduced their feeding on tomato leaves. KPM-007E/chi, entrapped in the alginate beads, released the chitinase. More chitinase was released when KPM-007E/chi was present with their specific virulent bacteriophage EcP-01 in the beads because of lysis of bacterial cells infected with the bacteriophages. This chitinase release from the microbial beads (containing KPM-007E/chi and EcP-01) was sufficient to digest the peritrophic membrane as well as to suppress feeding of bead-sprayed tomato leaves by the ladybird beetles. A daily supply of tomato leaves treated with the microbial beads considerably suppressed leaf feeding and oviposition by the ladybird beetles, suggesting a possible application of chitinase-secreting bacteria for suppressing herbivorous insect pests.
TI  - Bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. Although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MLN was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. The characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for MLN after hepatectomy were compared. Postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. RESULTS: No bacteria were cultured in MLN before hepatectomy. Bacterial translocation (BT) to MLN after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (BT group). After multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. BT group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. Among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in BT group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from MLNs. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. Such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. Thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.
TI  - The influence of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment on patients with bloodstream infections in an intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome. METHODS: From June 1995 to January 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant ICU-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. Clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. We defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the SPSS package (9.0). RESULTS: Among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. In this last group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. Bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. Eleven percent developed septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. The main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%), respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). The microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Candida species (4.5% each). The frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (OR 2.62; 95% CI: 1.10-6.21; P = 0.015). The global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. The only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (P = 0.04; OR = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.12-0.97). Septic shock was related to attributable mortality (P = 0.03; OR = 3.19; 95% CI: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (P = 0.24; OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 0.66-4.78). CONCLUSION: Almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. This fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently isolated and the source of the bacteremia.
TI  - [Continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among nosocomial gram-negative bacilli from intensive care units in China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the change of antimicrobial resistance among nosocomial gram-negative bacilli, especially those of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from intensive care units from 1994 to 2001 in China. METHODS: E test was made to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 10 279 isolates of gram-negative bacilli (including 5 829 strains of bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae) from 32 hospitals in China from 1994 to 2001. RESULTS: The most common pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Acinetobacter spp. Enterobacter spp, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The most common pathogens in respiratory tract specimens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (18%), and Acinetobacter baumanni (11%). The most common pathogens in blood and urine specimens were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antibiotic remaining the most active against all of the gram-negative bacilli for 7 years was imipenem (with a susceptibility rate of 87%), followed by cefoperazone/sulbactam (however, with a susceptibility rate decreasing from 86% to 75%), amikacin (75%), ceftazidime (73%), cefepime (72%), and piperacillin/tazobactam (71%). The susceptibility rate of Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae to imipenem remained 98% with a MIC(90) of 0.5 micro g/ml during the 7 years, much higher than those to amikacin (84%), ceftazidime (83%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (83%), piperacillin/tazobactam (80%), and cefepime (80%). The susceptibility rate of these two species to cefoperazone/sulbactam decreased from 90% in 1996 to 74% in 2001. While the susceptibility to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone decreased from 82% to 57%. The susceptibility rate of Escherichia coli to ciprofloxacin decreased from 54% to 25% and that of Klebsiella pneumoniae to ciprofloxacin decreased from 90% to 75%. The prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases in these two species increased from 11% in 1994 to 34% in 2001. The most active antibiotics against Enterobacter cloacae were imipenem, cefepime, amikacin with the susceptible rates of 95%, 76%, and 70%, respectively; the susceptibility rates of Citrobacter freundii to imipenem, cefepime, amikacin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam were 94%, 80%, 80%, and 78% respectively. Only 40% approximately 60% isolates of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. CONCLUSION: Imipenem remains highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, but the activities of other antibiotics have decreased in recent years.
TI  - Occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative bacteria isolated in haemodialysis water and dialysate of renal units: results of a Greek multicentre study.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the occurrence, identity and antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from municipal water supplies, treated water, and dialysate of all 85 Greek haemodialysis centres. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 141 Gram-negative bacterial isolates (98 non-fermentative and 43 enterobacteria) were recovered from 255 water samples. Twenty-four of them were isolated from tap water, 31 from treated water, and 86 from dialysate samples. The mean concentrations (CFU per 100 ml +/- s.d.) of the positive Gram-negative bacteria samples were 69.2 +/- 43.9, 31.2 +/- 28.7 and 3552.3 +/- 4485.0, respectively. The most common isolates, in order of frequency were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.7%), Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (14.9%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (13.5%), Escherichia coli (12.8%) and Enterobacter cloacae (7.8%), representing 71.6% of all isolates. Ps. aeruginosa was the most prevalent isolate in all types of water sample followed by C. meningosepticum in tap and treated water and by E. coli in dialysate. Nineteen per cent of the enterobacteria and 35% of the non-fermenters were resistant against three or more of the nine antibiotics tested. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that dialysate and treated water could be a source of infection for several non-fermentative and enterobacterial species. IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Microbiological monitoring of such samples is needed in order to know the identity and antibiotic resistance profiles of their potentially pathogenic bacterial population.
TI  - Altered substrate selection of the melibiose transporter (MelY) of Enterobacter cloacae involving point mutations in Leu-88, Leu-91, and Ala-182 that confer enhanced maltose transport.
AB  - We isolated mutants of Escherichia coli HS4006 containing the melibiose-H(+) symporter (MelY) from Enterobacter cloacae that had enhanced fermentation on 1% maltose MacConkey plates. DNA sequencing revealed three site classes of mutations: L-88-P, L-91-P, and A-182-P. The mutants L-88-P and L-91-P had 3.6- and 5.1-fold greater maltose uptake than the wild type and enhanced apparent affinities for maltose. Energy-coupled transport was defective for melibiose accumulation, but detectable maltose accumulation for the mutants indicated that active transport is dependent upon the substrate transported through the carrier. We conclude that the residues Leu-88, Leu-91 (transmembrane segment 3 [TMS-3]), and Ala-182 (TMS-6) of MelY mediate sugar selection. These data represent the first MelY mutations that confer changes in sugar selection.
TI  - Studies on structure-function relationships of indolepyruvate decarboxylase from  Enterobacter cloacae, a key enzyme of the indole acetic acid pathway.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae, isolated from the rhizosphere of cucumbers, produces large  amounts of indole-3-acetic acid. Indolepyruvate decarboxylase, the key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of indole-3-acetic acid, catalyses the formation of indole-3-acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide from indole-3-pyruvic acid. The enzyme requires the cofactors thiamine diphosphate and magnesium ions for catalytic activity. Recombinant indolepyruvate decarboxylase was purified from the host Escherichia coli strain JM109. Specificity of the enzyme for the substrates indole-3-pyruvic acid, pyruvic acid, benzoylformic acid, and seven benzoylformic acid analogues was investigated using a continuous optical assay. Stopped-flow kinetic data showed no indication for substrate activation in the decarboxylation reaction of indole-3-pyruvic acid, pyruvic acid or benzoylformic acid. Size exclusion chromatography and small angle X-ray solution scattering experiments suggested the tetramer as the catalytically active state and a pH-dependent subunit association equilibrium. Analysis of the kinetic constants of the benzoylformic acid analogues according to Hansch et al. [Hansch, C., Leo, A., Unger, S.H., Kim, K.H., Nikaitani, D & Lien, E.J. (1973) J. Med. Chem.16, 1207-1216] and comparison with indole-3-pyruvic acid conversion by pyruvate decarboxylases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zymomonas mobilis provided some insight into the catalytic mechanism of indolepyruvate decarboxylase.
TI  - Crystal structure of thiamindiphosphate-dependent indolepyruvate decarboxylase from Enterobacter cloacae, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid.
AB  - The thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzyme indolepyruvate decarboxylase catalyses the formation of indoleacetaldehyde from indolepyruvate, one step in the indolepyruvate pathway of biosynthesis of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid. The crystal structure of this enzyme from Enterobacter cloacae has been determined at 2.65 A resolution and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 20.5% (Rfree 23.6%). The subunit of indolepyruvate decarboxylase contains three domains of open alpha/beta topology, which are similar in structure to that of pyruvate decarboxylase. The tetramer has pseudo 222 symmetry and can be described as a dimer of dimers. It resembles the tetramer of pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis, but with a relative difference of 20 degrees in the angle between the two dimers. Active site residues are highly conserved in indolepyruvate/pyruvate decarboxylase, suggesting that the interactions with the cofactor thiamin diphosphate and the catalytic mechanisms are very similar. The substrate binding site in indolepyruvate decarboxylase contains a large hydrophobic pocket which can accommodate the bulky indole moiety of the substrate. In pyruvate decarboxylases this pocket is smaller in size and allows discrimination of larger vs. smaller substrates. In most pyruvate decarboxylases, restriction of cavity size is due to replacement of residues at three positions by large, hydrophobic amino acids such as tyrosine or tryptophan.
TI  - Polymorphism in the yclC-rpoS region of enterobacteria.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence downstream from the rpoS gene in Enterobacter cloacae and Kluyvera cryocrescens contains the slyA-pad1-yclC genes. The DNA sequence of Enterobacter cloacae CETC960 shows a 2.6-kb insertion of unknown origin between rpoS and slyA. This 2.6-kb sequence has also been detected in species of Salmonella and in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not in the same location. This insertion has been detected in all the Enterobacter cloacae clinical strains studied although the size of the rpoS-yclC region was highly variable, possibly owing to the presence of insertions and/or deletions. The study of the rpoS-mutS region in other enterobacteria also showed variability in size. Our results support the idea of a variational hot spot in the rpoS-mutS region that could be related to pathogenesis and horizontal transfer.
TI  - In vitro synergy studies using aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations against six species of Gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combination antimicrobial therapy is often necessary to eradicate infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: To evaluate the potential benefit of aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combination therapy, the activity of aztreonam in combination with ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin was assessed using checkerboard testing for four clinical isolates of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Burkholderia cepacia and Pseudomanas aeruginosa. RESULTS: All aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations demonstrated additive activity [fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index >0.5-4] or synergy (FIC index <or=0.5) for all 24 isolates tested. Aztreonam plus ciprofloxacin was the most effective combination, demonstrating synergy against 16.7% of isolates (2 P. mirabilis, 1 E. cloacae, 1 B. cepacia). Aztreonam in combination with moxifloxacin was synergistic against 2 isolates (P. mirabilis, E. cloacae), and in combination with gatifloxacin against 1 isolate (E. cloacae). Aztreonam and levofloxacin demonstrated only additive activity. CONCLUSION: Additive activity was observed for the majority of the aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations tested against six species of gram-negative bacilli. Synergy involving aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations was less common than additive activity and was isolate dependent. Although in vivo clinical successes have been documented using aztreonam in combination with other agents, confirmation by laboratory techniques requires further investigation.
TI  - Trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities among Enterobacteriaceae isolated from hospitalized patients in the United States from 1998 to 2001.
AB  - Longitudinal surveillance of Enterobacteriaceae for antimicrobial susceptibility  is important because species of this family are among the most significant and prevalent human pathogens. To estimate rates of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility among hospitalized patients in the United States, data from The Surveillance Network were studied for 14 agents tested against 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae (n = 384,279) isolated from intensive-care-unit (ICU) patients and non-ICU inpatients from 1998 to 2001. Cumulative susceptibility (percent) data for all species of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from ICU patients and non-ICU inpatients, respectively, were ranked as follows: ampicillin-sulbactam (45.5 and 57.2) << ticarcillin-clavulanate (74.8 and 83.5) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (87.0 and 84.5) congruent with cefotaxime (82.9 and 92.6) = ceftazidime (82.3 and 91.0) = ceftriaxone (86.5 and 93.9) = piperacillin-tazobactam (83.5 and 90.5) < levofloxacin (89.3 and 90.6) = ciprofloxacin (91.0 and 91.7) < gentamicin (91.8 and 94.3) < cefepime (95.0 and 97.9) < amikacin (98.5 and 99.2) < imipenem (100 and 100) = meropenem (100 and 100). Of those agents studied only susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin (94 to 89%) and levofloxacin (93 to 89%) decreased in a stepwise manner from 1998 to 2001. Decreased fluoroquinolone susceptibility was most pronounced for Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae. For all species of Enterobacteriaceae, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance was more commonly observed in isolates with a single-drug resistance phenotype while gentamicin and fluoroquinolone resistances were more common in isolates resistant to at least one additional class of antimicrobial agent. Ongoing surveillance of Enterobacteriaceae will be particularly important to monitor changes in fluoroquinolone susceptibility, as well as changes in the prevalence of isolates resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of AM-112, a novel oxapenem.
AB  - AM-112 [(1'R,5R,6R)-3-(4-amino-1,1-dimethyl-butyl)-6-(1'-hydroxyethyl)oxapenem-3-carboxy late] is a novel oxapenem compound which possesses potent beta-lactamase-inhibitory properties. Fifty-percent inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) of AM-112 for class A enzymes were between 0.16 and 2.24 micro M for three enzymes, compared to IC(50)s of 0.008 to 0.12 micro M for clavulanic acid. Against class C and class D enzymes, however, the activity of AM-112 was between 1,000- and 100,000-fold greater than that of clavulanic acid. AM-112 had affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of Escherichia coli DC0, with PBP2 being inhibited by the lowest concentration of AM-112 tested, 0.1 micro g/ml. Ceftazidime was combined with AM-112 at 1:1 and 2:1 ratios in MIC determination studies against a panel of beta-lactamase-producing organisms. These studies demonstrated that AM-112 was effective at protecting ceftazidime against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains and derepressed class C enzyme producers, reducing ceftazidime MICs by 16- and 2,048-fold. Similar results were obtained when AM-112 was combined with ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, or cefepime in a 1:2 ratio. Protection of ceftazidime with AM-112 was maintained against Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Klebsiella pneumoniae SHV-5 in a murine intraperitoneal sepsis model. The 50% effective dose of ceftazidime against E. cloacae P99 and K. pneumoniae SHV-5 was reduced from >100 and 160 mg/kg of body weight to 2 and 33.6 mg/kg, respectively, when it was combined with AM-112 at a 1:1 ratio. AM-112 demonstrates potential as a new beta-lactamase inhibitor.
TI  - Characterization of clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from Italy by the BD  Phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  - Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in Enterobacteriaceae: Identification of ESBLs based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. The Phoenix ESBL test (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, Md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of ESBL-producing gram-negative bacteria. An algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Citrobacter koseri. Of these isolates, 319 were identified as ESBL producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-ESBL producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. Combined use of isoelectric focusing, PCR, and/or DNA sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(TEM-1)- and/or bla(SHV-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(CTX-M) gene. Among the 191 non-ESBL-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an AmpC-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all K. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced K1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. The Phoenix ESBL test system gave positive results for all the 319 ESBL-producing isolates and also for two of the four K1-hyperproducing isolates of K. oxytoca. Compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the Phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. These findings suggest that the Phoenix ESBL test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of ESBL resistance in gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Factors influencing gene expression and resistance for Gram-negative organisms expressing plasmid-encoded ampC genes of Enterobacter origin.
AB  - High-level expression of AmpC beta-lactamases results in organisms resistant to multiple beta-lactam antibiotics. The mechanism of chromosomally mediated AmpC resistance has been elucidated, however the mechanism(s) driving plasmid-encoded AmpC resistance are unknown. Studies were designed to identify factors which influence expression of plasmid-encoded ampC genes and correlate these factors with resistance. As the model system, ampC genes of Enterobacter origin were used to determine how gene copy number, genetic background and genetic organization influenced resistance phenotypes. To this end, gene expression from the plasmid-encoded inducible blaACT-1 and non-inducible blaMIR-1 were compared with chromosomal ampC gene expression from both wild-type (WT) and derepressed Enterobacter cloacae isolates. RNA levels within the original clinical isolates were examined using primer extension analysis, whereas a new PCR strategy was developed to examine gene copy number. These data revealed that blaACT-1 and blaMIR-1 constitutive expression was 33- and 95-fold higher than WT expression, whereas copy numbers of the plasmid-encoded genes were 2 and 12, respectively. Differences in promoters and transcriptional starts for the respective plasmid-encoded genes were noted and contribute to increases observed in overall expression. Finally, beta-lactam MICs were increased two- to 16-fold when blaACT-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli AmpD- strains compared with E. coli AmpD+ strains. In conclusion, high-level expression of plasmid-encoded ampC genes requires interplay between multiple factors including genetic organization, promoter modifications, genetic background, and to some extent gene copy number. In addition, clinical laboratories need to be aware that genetic backgrounds of inducible plasmid-encoded genes can dramatically influence MICs for organisms not normally associated with derepressed phenotypes.
TI  - Analyses of ampC gene expression in Serratia marcescens reveal new regulatory properties.
AB  - Serratia marcescens encodes an inducible, chromosomal beta-lactamase, ampC. Studies addressing the regulation of inducible ampC genes have focused primarily on Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii. The purpose of this study was to clone and sequence the ampC, ampR and intergenic region of S. marcescens and examine both inducible and basal level ampC expression. Sequence analysis of the S. marcescens ampC gene identified an extended 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 126 nucleotides, which formed a prominent stem-loop structure. Induction of ampC expression required AmpR, and the start of transcription was determined using primer extension analysis. In vivo half-life analysis revealed that the half-life of the S. marcescens ampC transcript was 7 min. Confirmation of the in vivo half-life and the role of the stem-loop structure in the 5' UTR was demonstrated by comparing transcript half-life and luciferase expression between a wild-type (WT) and a 5' UTR stem-loop deletion mutant. These data demonstrated that the stem-loop structure was involved in transcript stability. Taken together, these findings indicate that constitutive expression of S. marcescens ampC is regulated by both transcriptional initiation and post-transcriptional events.
TI  - Growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria and mutagenicity of 2-, 3-, 4-aminobiphenyls, benzidine, and biphenyl.
AB  - 2-Aminobiphenyl (2-ABP), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-ABP) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), but not benzidine (Bz) and biphenyl (Bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, B. bifidium ATCC 11863, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047 and Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, YG1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. Bacteroides distasonis ATCC 8503, B. fragilis ATCC 25285, B. theataiotaomicron ATCC 29741, C. paraputrificum ATCC 26780, C. clostridiiforme ATCC 25537, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 and Enterococcus faecium ATCC 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. The Ames Salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat S9 mix. It was found that 4-ABP was mutagenic to both TA98 and TA100, and Bz was mutagenic to TA98 in the presence of rat S9 mix. 2-Aminobiphenyl, 3-ABP, and Bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-Aminobiphenyl and 3-ABP are chemical isomers of 4-ABP and are as strong as 4-ABP in inhibiting the growth of intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-ABP. Evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of DNA that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.
TI  - Water quality problems associated with intermittent water supply.
AB  - A controlled study was conducted in Lebanon over a period of 12 months to determine bacterial regrowth in a small network supplying the Beirut suburb of Naccache that had a population of about 3,000. The residential area, which is fed by gravity, is supplied twice a week with chlorinated water from two artesian wells of a confined aquifer. A significant correlation was detected between the turbidity and the levels of heterotrophic plate count bacteria (HPC) in the samples from the distribution network as well as from the artesian wells. However, a negative significant correlation was found between the temperature and the HPC count in the samples collected from the source. A statistically significant increase in counts, possibly due to regrowth, was repeatedly established between two sampling points lying on a straight distribution line but 1 km apart. Faecal coliforms were detected in the source water but none in the network except during a pipe breakage incident with confirmed Escherichia coli reaching 40 CFU/100 mL. However, coliforms such as Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, E. cloacae and E. skazakii were repeatedly isolated from the network, mainly due to inadequate chlorination. A second controlled study was conducted to determine the effect of storage on the microbial quality of household storage tanks (500 L), which were of two main types - galvanized cast iron and black polyethylene. The mean bacterial count increased significantly after 7 d storage in both tank types. A significant difference was found in the mean HPC/mL between the winter and the summer. Highest counts were found April-June although the maximum temperature was reported later in the summer. A positive correlation was established between the HPC/mL and pH, temperature and storage time.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of prulifloxacin, a new oral fluoroquinolone].
AB  - We compared antibacterial activity of NM394, which is the active metabolite of a  prodrug of new fluoroquinolone prulifloxacin (PUFX), against clinical isolates of bacteria with those of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), levofloxacin (LVFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), tosufloxacin (TFLX) and fleroxacin (FLRX). 1. NM394 showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 2. MIC80 of NM394 for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis were 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 of NM394 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae was lower than 0.06 microgram/ml. MIC80 of NM394 for Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.25 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 against P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, GFLX, LVFX and TFLX. 4. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 at Cmax concentration against 12 strains of P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, LVFX, GFLX and TFLX.
TI  - Identification of an unknown promoter, OUTIIp, within the IS10R element.
AB  - A novel promoter in IS10R (OUTIIp) has been found in one of its ends in an inverted position relative to promoter pOUT. OUTIIp shows characteristics similar to those of rpoS-dependent promoters such as a gearbox expression pattern. It is under catabolite repression and positively regulated by ppGpp or conditioned media. This opens new challenges in IS10R transposition.
TI  - Production of CTX-M-3 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and IMP-1 metallo beta-lactamase by five Gram-negative bacilli: survey of clinical isolates from seven laboratories collected in 1998 and 2000, in the Kinki region of Japan.
AB  - The aim of this study was to research the distribution in the Kinki region of Japan of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and metallo beta-lactamase (MBL). One thousand isolates, 200 of each of four enterobacterial species (i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens) and 200 of P. aeruginosa, were collected from seven different laboratories during two 2 month periods, one in 1998 and one in 2000. A double-disc synergy test (DDST) and 2-mercaptopropionic acid inhibition test (2-MPAT) were used to confirm beta-lactamase-producing isolates. The DDST was positive for one isolate of E. coli, five of K. pneumoniae, two of E. cloacae and 14 of S. marcescens. The 2-MPAT was positive for five isolates of S. marcescens and two of P. aeruginosa. We identified the beta-lactamase type of each isolate by molecular confirmatory tests (isoelectric focusing, PCR and DNA sequencing): CTX-M-3 ESBLs (three isolates of K. pneumoniae, two of E. cloacae and 13 of S. marcescens), CTX-M-2 ESBL (one isolate of K. pneumoniae), SHV-12 ESBLs (one isolate of E. coli and one of S. marcescens), CTX-M-3 and SHV-12 combination ESBL (one isolate of K. pneumoniae) and IMP-1 MBLs (five isolates of S. marcescens and two of P. aeruginosa). In conclusion, many species of Gram-negative bacilli that produce CTX-M-3 ESBLs and IMP-1 MBLs were disseminated widely in different hospitals of the Kinki region of Japan. Therefore, monitoring of laboratory bacterial ecology seems important to stop the spread of these strains through nosocomial outbreaks.
TI  - Microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIM: The present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. METHODS: We identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). RESULTS: Nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. A single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). Patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per mL of bile (> 105 cfu/mL). The predominant Gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were Escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), Pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). The predominant Gram-positive bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and Streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). Bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. All Gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all Gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (CIM90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/mL. Gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. Although all five isolates of E. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) E. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis and Streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase productivity of recent clinical  isolates during the period between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testings of 24 antimicrobial agents against 605 clinical strains belonging to 10 species were carried out according to the micro-broth dilution method of NCCLS M7-A4. The productivity of beta-lactamase was also determined against them isolated at 8 medical facilities in Nagano prefecture, Japan during the period between December 1999 and February 2000. When applied the nitrocefin method, beta-lactamase productivity was demonstrated to be positive for 89.2% of 74 S. aureus, 4.3% of 94 H. influenzae, and 100% of 69 M. (B.) catarrhalis isolates. On the other hand, when used the acidometry method, penicillinase/cephalosporinase were found to be positive for 21.2%/9.6% of 52 E. coli, 29.0%/3.2% of 31 K. pneumoniae, 53.2%/100% of 47 E. cloacae, 0%/11.1% of 99 S. marcescens, and 25.9%/55.6% of 54 P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. Among the beta-lactamase-producers including P. aeruginosa isolates, only 2 E. coli isolates were found to be ESBL-producers. Besides, 9.6% (9/94) of H. influenzae isolates were proved to be BLNAR strains.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and prevalence of beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates in southern Kyushu. The results of collaborative study from 1999 to 2000].
AB  - The positivity of beta-lactamase and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined in a total of 1,358 clinical isolates at 15 hospitals and clinics in four prefectures in southern Kyushu (Okinawa, Miyazaki, Kagoshima and Kumamoto) during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. The isolates collected comprised of 176 strains of S. aureus, 203 of H. influenzae, 102 of M. catarrhalis, 206 of E. coli, 153 of K. pneumoniae, 99 of E. cloacae, 95 of S. marcescens, 201 of P. aeruginosa, 79 of E. faecalis, and 44 of E. faecium. The frequency of CPDX resistance among E. coli in particular varied geographically, and was found to be higher in Kumamoto and Kagoshima. The strains of K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae resistant to common antimicrobial agents were particularly found in Kagoshima, and one strain of IPM-resistant E. cloacae was isolated in Miyazaki. Also, the geographical difference in the frequency of LVFX resistance among the isolates of E. cloacae was noted, the results indicating the higher prevalence in Okinawa and Kagoshima. Resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa were less common in Kagoshima, and four isolates of P. aeruginosa from Miyazaki were found to be resistant to CAZ and IPM. None of the isolates of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. was resistant to VCM or TEIC at all. The isolates of E. faecalis resistant at high-level GM (500 micrograms/ml) and SM (1,000 micrograms/ml) were found in 27.8% and 22.8%, and those of E. faecium were 6.8% and 38.6%, respectively. Overall, the ratio of MRSA among S. aureus was 67.6%, and three isolates were resistant to ABK with no less than 8 micrograms/ml of MIC. The frequency of BLNAR (beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin resistant) among H. influenzae isolated in Okinawa was markedly higher (isolation ratio, 37.9%) when compared with other prefectures, and the isolates of BLPACR (beta-lactamase-positive, AMPC/CVA resistant) were found only in Okinawa with a ratio of 41.6%. A total of 18 strains of ESBL defined by the NCCLS criteria (M100-S11) were isolated, eight strains of K. pneumoniae and 10 strains of E. coli. Of 18 isolates of ESBL, 13 were from Kagoshima and the remaining five were from Kumamoto.
TI  - [Drug sensitivity and beta-lactamase producibility of various types of bacteria clinically isolated during the period from December 1999 to February 2000].
AB  - beta-Lactamase activity and drug sensitivity were measured in 744 strains from 8  species of bacteria isolated at medical institutions in Chikugo District of Fukuoka Prefecture during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. Nitrocefin test revealed that beta-lactamase was positive in 48% of S. aureus, 7% of H. influenzae, and 92% of M. catarrhalis, and acidometry revealed that penicillinase/cephalosporinase were positive in 13%/14% of E. coli, 22%/8% of K. pneumoniae, 47%/97% of E. cloacae, 3%/65% of S. marcescens, and 10%/36% of P. aeruginosa. Based on the assessment of the MIC values of various types of antibacterial drugs for beta-lactamase-producing strains, there were 11 strains (1 strain of K. pneumonia, 6 strains of E. cloacae, and 4 strains of P. aeruginosa) of class-B beta-lactamase-producing bacteria out of a total of 496 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results of PCR analysis suggested that 1 strain of K. pneumonia, 1 strain of E. cloacae, and 4 strains of P. aeruginosa produced metallo-beta-lactamase. There was no strain (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) of ESBL-producing bacteria. BLNAR strains, on the other hand, were found in 9% (9/100) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [Beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics among some species of bacteria isolated from medical institution between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - We studied the beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics in 604 strains among 10 species of bacteria isolated from 10 medical institutions in Tottori and Shimane Prefectures between December 1999 and February 2000. beta-Lactamase activity was measured by the nitrocefin test and penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were measured by acidometry. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 72.1% of S. aureus, 18.8% of H. influenzae, and 96.3% of M. catarrhalis. Penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were detected in 17.8%/22.2% of E. coli, 9.7%/0.0% of K. pneumoniae, 18.6%/95.3% of E. cloacae, 12.7%/79.4% of S. marcescens, and 7.1%/31.8% of P. aeruginosa. Three of 72 strains (4.2%) of K. pneumoniae and 5 of 90 strains (5.6%) of E. coli were assessed as ESBL-producing bacteria using the NCCLS proposed screening method based on routine susceptibility testing results. BLNAR were detected in 13 of 69 strains (18.8%) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase types among clinical isolates during January and February 2000 in the Kinki area of Japan].
AB  - We studied antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase types among clinical isolates in the Kinki area of Japan. Eight hundreds isolates of eight organisms were collected by seven medical institutions during January and February 2000. The rates of beta-lactamase producing by using the chromogenic nitrocephin test were 68.0% against Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 6.0% against Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 98.0% against Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. The rate of beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae was 4.0% (4 out of 100). The result of beta-lactamase producing by using the acid-metric method were as follows the penicillinase and cephalosporinase: 27.0% and 37.0% against Escherichia coli isolates, 37.0% and 1.0% against Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 21.8% and 100% against Enterobacter cloacae isolates, 24.2% and 96.0% against Serratia marcescens isolates, 7.0% and 22.0% against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. We identified beta-lactamase type of each isolate detected by polymerase chain reaction: SHV-derived extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) (1 isolate of E. coli and 1 isolate of K. pneumoniae), CTX-M-1-derived ESBLs (1 isolate of K. pneumoniae, 1 of E. cloacae and 4 of S. marcescens), and IMP-1-derived metallo beta-lactamases (2 isolates of S. marcescens).
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility of bacteria clinically isolated during the period from December 1999 to February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility were tested in 848  clinical strains collected at 8 hospitals in Kanagawa prefecture during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. Positive rates of beta-lactamase used the nitrocefin method (Cefinase) were 21.9% of Staphylococcus aureus, 10.0% of Haemophilus influenzae, and 99.0% of Moraxella catarrhalis. Furthermore, on the acidometric method (P/Case test) penicillinase (PCase), cephalosporinase (CEPase), and both of PCase and CEPase were found to be positive in 19.0%, 16.0%, and 16.0% for Escherichia coli, 6.2/0/3.1% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/66.3/26.5% for Enterobacter cloacae, 2.8/57.7/15.5% for Serratia marcescens, and 4.0/15.0/22.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. Based on the assessment of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibacterial agents among beta-lactamase producing strains, there were 5 strains (4 strains of K. pneumoniae and 1 strain of E. coli) that may be ESBLs producing bacteria out of a total of 466 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. During this process, 1 strain of class-B beta-lactamase-producing E. cloacae was isolated. MRSA were found in 79.2% of S. aureus, and BLNAR were found in 8.9% of H. influenzae.
TI  - [beta-lactamase-producing activity and antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples. Japan beta-lactamase Research Group].
AB  - beta-Lactamase production and susceptibility to an assortment of antimicrobial agents were examined in 9,483 strains of organisms isolated from clinical materials obtained from inpatients and outpatients at 104 institutions throughout Japan from December 1999 to February 2000. The organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, 1,369 strains, including 847 methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains; Enterococcus faecalis, 735 strains; Enterococcus faecium, 302 strains; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, 730 strains; Haemophilus influenzae, 1,142 strains; Escherichia coli, 1,276 strains; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1,058 strains; Enterobacter cloacae, 772 strains; Serratia marcescens, 847 strains; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1,252 strains. The 23 antimicrobial agents used were ampicillin, sulbactam/ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefoperazone, sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpodoxime, imipenem, gentamicin, arbekacin, clarithromycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and levofloxacin. Antimicrobial agents appropriate for each organism were used. Among S. aureus strains, 61.9% were MRSA, and 62.3% were positive for beta-lactamase. Among the MRSA strains, none was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin, and only 3% were resistant to arbekacin. There was no vancomycin resistance in the Enterococcus strains. Only 0.1% of E. faecalis strains were ampicillin-resistant. Among the M. catarrhalis strains, 97.5% produced beta-lactamase, while among the H. influenzae strains, 8.5% produced beta-lactamase and 14.5% were beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR). Among the Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa strains, there were 20 (E. coli; 7/1,276, K. pneumoniae; 13/1,058) that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and 11 that produced class B beta-lactamases. Multiple drug resistance was advanced in every species, and organisms resistant to 7 or more common antimicrobial agents were isolated. The best combination of antimicrobial agent and beta-lactamase inhibitor was sulbactam/cefoperazone. Sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefepime, and imipenem still have excellent antimicrobial activity. Rates of resistance to each antimicrobial agent differed more among institutions than among geographical regions.
TI  - Inhibition of beta-lactamases by monocyclic acyl phosph(on)ates.
AB  - The cyclic acyl phosph(on)ates, 1-hydroxy-5-phenyl-2,6-dioxaphosphorinone(3)-1-oxide, its 4-phenyl isomer, and the phosphonate (2-oxo) analogue of the latter inhibited typical class A (TEM-2) and class C (Enterobacter cloacae P99) beta-lactamases in a time-dependent fashion. No enzyme-catalyzed turnover was detected in any case. The interactions occurring were interpreted in terms of the reaction scheme E + I left arrow over right arrow EI left arrow over right arrow EI', where EI is a reversibly formed noncovalent complex, and EI' is a covalent complex. Reactions of the cyclic phosphates with the P99 beta-lactamase were effectively irreversible, while that of the 4-phenyl cyclic phosphate with the TEM beta-lactamase was slowly reversible. The 4-phenyl cyclic phosphate was generally the most effective inhibitor, both kinetically and thermodynamically, with second-order rate constants of inactivation of both enzymes around 10(4) s(-1) M(-1). This compound also bound noncovalently to both enzymes, with dissociation constants of 25 microM from the P99 enzyme and 100 microM from the TEM. It is unusual to find an inhibitor equally effective against the TEM and P99 enzymes; the beta-lactamase inhibitors currently employed in medical practice (e.g., clavulanic acid) are significantly more effective against class A enzymes. The results of lysinoalanine analysis after hydroxide treatment of the inhibited enzymes and of a (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of one such complex were interpreted as favoring a mechanism of inactivation by enzyme acylation rather than phosphylation. Molecular modeling of the enzyme complexes of the 4-phenyl phosphate revealed bound conformations where recyclization and thus reactivation of the enzyme would be difficult. The compounds studied were turned over slowly or not at all by acetylcholinesterase and phosphodiesterase I.
TI  - Effects of burn wound excision on bacterial colonization and invasion.
AB  - Rates of survival after thermal injury have improved in the past two decades, and rates of wound infections and sepsis have decreased during the same period. Early excision has been advocated as one of the major factors, but its safety and efficacy and the exact timing of burn excision are still under debate. It was hypothesized that acute burn wound excision (in the first 24 hours after burning) would be superior to conservative treatment and delayed excision in preventing bacterial colonization and invasion. Twenty consecutive patients with thermal injuries were studied. Twelve patients underwent acute burn wound excision, and eight patients underwent conservative treatment and delayed excision. The second group of patients received topical treatments in another facility and underwent delayed excision after transfer to our service, on postburn day 6. Quantitative bacteriological assessments of the excised wound and biopsy samples of the wound bed, obtained before autografting and/or homografting, were performed. The effects of time on bacterial counts, differences between superficial and deep biopsy samples, and the effects of early versus late debridement were studied. Patients admitted early exhibited bacterial counts of less than 10 bacteria per gram of tissue. Patients in this group did not experience infection or graft loss. Patients admitted late exhibited counts of more than 10 bacteria (p = 0.001, compared with early admission). Three patients in the late excision group experienced infection and graft loss (p < 0.05, compared with the early excision group). Burn wound excision significantly decreased bacterial colonization for all patients (p < 0.001). Greater bacterial colonization and higher rates of infection were correlated with topical treatment and late excision (p < 0.001). It is concluded that burn wound excision significantly reduces bacterial colonization. Patients who undergo topical treatment and delayed burn wound excision exhibit greater bacterial colonization and increased rates of infection. Acute burn wound excision should be considered for all full-thickness burns.
TI  - Clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases: prevalence of CTX-M-3 at a hospital in China.
AB  - The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains was demonstrated in 5 of 44 (11.4%) Escherichia coli, 17 of 43 (39.5%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 of 50 (6.0%) Enterobacter cloacae, and 2 of 25 (8.0%) Citrobacter freundii strains at a teaching hospital in China. Nineteen of these 27 strains expressed CTX-M-3 beta-lactamase (pI 8.6). A subset of the clinical isolates expressing the CTX-M-3 enzyme, tested by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, revealed multiple clones. Five isolates expressed a novel enzyme, SHV-43 (pI 8.0), which had two substitutions (Leu113Phe and Thr149Ser) compared with SHV-1.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities and PK/PD parameters of aminoglycosides against recent  clinical isolates of gram-negative rods].
AB  - We examined antibacterial activities and PK/PD parameters of six kinds of aminoglycosides against seven bacterial species of clinical isolates in 2001. Aminoglycoseides examined were gentamicin (GM), dibekacin (DKB), tobramycin (TOB), amikacin (AMK), netilmicin (NTL), and isepamicin (ISP), and bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus spp., Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All aminoglycosides showed good activities with low MICs against 6 species of Enterobacteriacea except S. marcescens. Eight strains (3.2%) among them were resistant to one or more aminoglycosides. Resistance to multiple aminoglycosides were detected in 16 strains (32%) of S. marcescens, among which 13 strains were resistant to AMK but susceptible to ISP. Three (6%) strains of P. aeruginosa were resistant to multiple drugs, one of which was resistant to all six aminoglycosides, and others were moderately susceptible to AMK and ISP, and susceptible to GM, AMK and ISP. Using a ratio of peak serum concentration to MIC90 (Cmax/MIC90) or a ratio of area under the curve to MIC90 (AUC/MIC90) as a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameter, we estimated the efficacy of the drug. An excellent effect of ISP, which was injected intramuscularly or intravenously at a dose of 400 mg, was expected for strains of Enterobacteriacea except S. marcescens. The Cmax/MIC90 ratios for S. marcescens were comparably higher in GM and ISP and that for P. aeruginosa were rather high in TOB when compared to other aminoglycosides. Another PK/PD parameter, AUC/MIC90 ratio, was high enough in NTL and ISP for Enterobacteriacea, suggesting good efficacy of these drugs. The (AUC/MIC90) ratios for S. marcescens were comparably high in GM and ISP, and that for P. aeruginosa were high in TOB, DKB, and ISP.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial efficacy of drugs for urinary tract infections by genotyping based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
AB  - We attempted to determine whether the same bacterium isolated from patients with  urinary tract infections (UTI) before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents was of the same strain ("persisted") or of a different strain ("changed"). Furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents for UTI, we investigated whether bacterial strains could be classified as persisted or changed based on their electrophoretic patterns in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We examined eight species of bacteria ( Enterococcus avium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Escherichia coli), consisting of 41 strains (19 pairs isolated before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents) isolated from patients with complicated UTI. It was concluded that all bacteria were unchanged, based on the clinical effect on bacteriuria. The chromosomal DNA of these bacteria was digested with restriction enzymes and classified based on their electrophoretic pattern in PFGE. A comparison of the patterns of the fragments revealed that 14 pairs were indistinguishable before and after treatment, 3 pairs were closely related, 1 pair was possibly related, and 1 pair was different. These results demonstrated that 18 pairs of isolates (indistinguishable, closely related, and possibly related) were highly likely to be continued infections by the same strain, and that 1 pair (different) had been replaced by another strain. Based on these results, we believe that bacterium genotyping by PFGE is a more effective method for evaluating the antibacterial efficacy of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds in food-related bacteria.
AB  - Microbial resistance to antimicrobial agents continues to be a major problem. The frequent use and misuse of disinfectants based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in food-processing industries have imposed a selective pressure and may contribute to the emergence of disinfectant-resistant microorganisms. A total number of 1,325 Gram-negative isolates (Escherichia coli, other coliforms Vibrio spp., and Aeromonas spp.) and 500 Enterococcus spp. from food and food-processing industries and fish farming were screened for natural resistance to the QAC-based disinfectant benzalkonium chloride (BC). Of the 1,825 isolates, 16 strains, mainly from meat retail shops, showed low-level resistance to BC. None of the Enterococcus spp. from broiler, cattle, and pigs, the antibiotic-resistant E. coli from pig intestine and fish pathogens Vibrio spp. and Aeromonas spp. from the Norwegian fish farming industry were resistant to BC. The BC-resistant strains were examined for susceptibility to 15 different antibiotics, disinfectants, and dyes. No systematic cross-resistance between BC and any of the other antimicrobial agents tested was detected. Stable enhanced resistance in Enterobacter cloacae isolates was demonstrated by step-wise adaptation in increasing concentrations of BC. In conclusion, BC resistance among food-associated Gram-negative bacteria and Enterococcus spp. is not frequent, but resistance may develop to user concentrations after exposure to sublethal concentrations of BC.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis: high antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens in a neonatal intensive care unit in Karachi.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the bacterial pathogens causing neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity pattern so that guidelines can be prepared for empirical antibiotic therapy. SETTING: The study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at PNS Shifa (Naval Hospital), Karachi during January 1997 to June 1999. METHODS: Blood specimens for culture were drawn from 520 newborns admitted in a NICU with sepsis. The specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth. Subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. The isolates were identified by standard biochemical tests. Antibiotic resistance pattern of the isolates was studied by Modified Kirby Baur disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: A total of 212 organisms were isolated. These included Staphylococcus aureus (n = 65), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 23), Escherichia coli (n = 22), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 18), Citrobacter diversus (n = 5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and group B Streptococcus (n = 2). On antibiotic sensitivity testing, 61.54% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. Susceptibility to the other common drugs was also quite low while 89.23% of these were susceptible to amikacin and 100% to vancomycin. More than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to ampicillin and co-trimoxazole. Resistance to gentamicin was as high as 90.4% for Klebsiella pneumoniae; 60.87% for Acinetobacter baumannii. Resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone tested (ciprofloxacin) varied between 25-75%. Majority of the isolates were susceptible to meropenem and amikacin. CONCLUSION: In view of the isolation of highly antibiotic resistant organisms, vancomycin in combination with amikacin or a carbapenem is the drug of choice for empirically treating neonatal sepsis.
TI  - Application of a real-time biosensor to detect bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  - A spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. The system (termed LEXSAS, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. We studied the LEXSAS as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. If successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. In this study, we used the LEXSAS for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pyogenes. Bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. The results indicate that the LEXSAS could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.
TI  - Regional occurrence of plasmid-mediated SHV-7, an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, in Enterobacter cloacae in Philadelphia Teaching Hospitals.
AB  - Although the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli is an emerging problem, limited data are available regarding the frequency of ESBL production in other organisms. We provide the only description of regional occurrence of SHV-7 in Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli or K. pneumoniae in the United States, and we emphasize that, among Enterobacter cloacae strains, not all resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is the result of hyperproduction of AmpC beta-lactamase.
TI  - Flavin thermodynamics explain the oxygen insensitivity of enteric nitroreductases.
AB  - Bacterial nitroreductases are NAD(P)H-dependent flavoenzymes which catalyze the oxygen-insensitive reduction of nitroaromatics, quinones, and riboflavin derivatives. Despite their broad substrate specificity, their reactivity is very specific for two-electron, not one-electron, chemistry. We now describe the thermodynamic properties of the flavin mononucleotide cofactor of Enterobacter cloacae nitroreductase (NR), determined under a variety of solution conditions. The two-electron redox midpoint potential of NR is -190 mV at pH 7.0, and both the pH dependence of the midpoint potential and the optical spectrum of the reduced enzyme indicate that the transition is from neutral oxidized flavin to anionic flavin hydroquinone. The one-electron-reduced semiquinone states of both the free enzyme and an NR-substrate analogue complex are strongly suppressed based on optical spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. This can explain the oxygen insensitivity of NR and its homologues, as it makes the execution of one-electron chemistry thermodynamically unfavorable. Therefore, we have established a chemical basis for the recent finding that a nitroreductase is a member of the soxRS oxidative defense regulon in Escherichia coli [Liochev, S. I., Hausladen, A., Fridovich, I. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 96 (7), 3537-3539]. We also report binding affinities for the FMN cofactor in all three oxidation states either determined fluorometrically or calculated using thermodynamic cycles. Thus, we provide a detailed picture of the thermodynamics underlying the unusual activity of NR.
TI  - pKa, MM, and QM studies of mechanisms of beta-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins: acylation step.
AB  - The acylation step of the catalytic mechanism of beta-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) has been studied with various approaches. The methods applied range from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to multiple titration calculations using the Poisson-Boltzmann approach to quantum mechanical (QM) methods. The mechanism of class A beta-lactamases was investigated in the greatest detail. Most approaches support the critical role of Glu-166 and hydrolytic water in the acylation step of the enzymatic catalysis in class A beta-lactamases. The details of the catalytic mechanism have been revealed by the QM approach, which clearly pointed out the critical role of Glu-166 acting as a general base in the acylation step with preferred substrates. Lys-73 shuffles a proton abstracted by Glu-166 O(epsilon ) to the beta-lactam nitrogen through Ser-130 hydroxyl. This proton is transferred from O(gamma) of the catalytic Ser-70 through the bridging hydrolytic water to Glu-166 O(epsilon ). Then the hydrogen is simultaneously passed through S(N)2 inversion mechanism at Lys-73 N(zeta) to Ser-130 O(gamma), which loses its proton to the beta-lactam nitrogen. The protonation of beta-lactam nitrogen proceeds with an immediate ring opening and collapse of the first tetrahedral species into an acyl-enzyme intermediate. However, the studies that considered the effect of solvation lower the barrier for the pathway, which utilizes Lys-73 as a general base, thus creating a possibility of multiple mechanisms for the acylation step in the class A beta-lactamases. These findings help explain the exceptional efficiency of these enzymes. They emphasize an important role of Glu-166, Lys-73, and Ser-130 for enzymatic catalysis and shed light on details of the acylation step of class A beta-lactamase mechanism. The acylation step for class C beta-lactamases and six classes of PBPs were also considered with continuum solvent models and MD simulations.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the beta-lactamase gene and surrounding DNA sequences of Citrobacter braakii, Citrobacter murliniae, Citrobacter werkmanii, Escherichia fergusonii and Enterobacter cancerogenus.
AB  - To further identify the origins of plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases that are currently spreading worldwide, the chromosomal beta-lactamase genes of Citrobacter braakii, Citrobacter murliniae, Citrobacter werkmanii reference strains and of Escherichia fergusonii and Enterobacter cancerogenus clinical isolates were cloned and expressed into Escherichia coli and sequenced. These beta-lactamases had all a single pI value >8 and conferred a typical AmpC-type resistance pattern in E. coli recombinant strains. The cloned inserts obtained from genomic DNAs of each strain encoded Ambler class C beta-lactamases. The AmpC-type enzymes of C. murliniae, C. braakii and C. werkmanii shared 99%, 96% and 95% amino acid sequence identity, respectively, with chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases from Citrobacter freundii. The AmpC-type enzyme of E. cancerogenus shared 85% amino acid sequence identity with the chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae OUDhyp and the AmpC-type enzyme of E. fergusonii shared 96% amino acid sequence identity with that of E. coli K12. The ampC genes, except for E. fergusonii, were associated with genes homologous to regulatory ampR genes of other chromosomal class C beta-lactamases that explain inducibility of beta-lactamase expression in these strains. This work provides further evidence of the molecular heterogeneity of class C beta-lactamases.
TI  - Cefcapene inactivates chromosome-encoded class C beta-lactamases.
AB  - The stability of cefcapene and cefpodoxime, oral antibacterial cephalosporins, toward different classes of beta-lactamases was evaluated. For the class A beta-lactamases, TEM-1, SHV-1, and NMC-A, only the steady-state kinetic parameter ( k(cat)/ Km) values were calculated (3100 - 1.1 x 10(7) M(-1) x s(-1)), because these enzymes have very high Km values for cefpodoxime and cefotaxime. As for class B beta-lactamases L1, IMP-1, and CcrA, in general, similar k(cat)/ Km values were obtained. However, regarding class C beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Citrobacter freundii, we found major differences in stability between the two compounds. Cefpodoxime acted as a good substrate for the class C beta-lactamases, except for the enzyme from E. cloacae; its k(cat) and Km values were successfully calculated ( k(cat)/ Km, 1.8 x 10(5) - 1.2 x 10(7) M(-1) x s(-1)). On the other hand, cefcapene acted as a poor substrate or an inactivator for class C beta-lactamases; its k(2)/ K value was successfully calculated (8.7 x 10(5) - 7.0 x 10(6) M(-1) x s(-1)). In addition, k(3) values were determined for beta-lactamases from P. aeruginosa (2.3 x 10(-2) x s(-1)) and C. freundii (2.1 x 10(-1) x s(-1)). Even though these values could be calculated, transient inactivation as an enzyme reactivation reaction for all these enzymes was observed. These findings suggest the potential of cephem compounds as inhibitors of class C beta-lactamases.
TI  - Structural requirements of the mRNA for intracistronic translation initiation of  the enterobacterial infB gene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gene infB encodes the prokaryotic translation initiation factor IF2, a central macromolecular component in the formation of the ribosomal 70S initiation complex. In Escherichia coli, infB encodes three forms of IF2: IF2alpha, IF2beta and IF2gamma. The expression of IF2beta and IF2gamma is a tandem translation from intact infB mRNA and not merely a translation of post-transcriptionally truncated mRNA. The molecular mechanism responsible for the ribosomal recognition of the two intracistronic translation initiation sites in E. coli infB is not well characterized. RESULTS: We found three different forms of IF2 in Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella typhimurium, and two different forms in Proteus vulgaris. We identified the intracistronic translation initiation sites of the mRNA by isolation and N-terminal sequencing of the shorter isoforms of IF2 in S. enterica and S. typhimurium. A further search in the readily available public sequence databases revealed that infB from Yersinia pestis also contains an intracistronic in-frame initiation site used for the translation of IF2beta. The base composition in a part of the 5' end of the DNA coding strand of the enterobacterial infB gene shows a strong preference for adenine (A) over thymine (T) with a maximum ratio of A-to-T around the intracistronic initiation sites. We demonstrate that the mRNA has an open structure around the ribosomal binding region. CONCLUSION: Efficient intracistronic translation initiation of the infB gene is suggested to require an mRNA with this special base composition that results in an open, single-stranded structure at the ribosomal binding region.
TI  - Preassembly of membrane-active peptides is an important factor in their selectivity toward target cells.
AB  - Membrane-active peptides comprise a large group of toxins used in the defense and offense systems of all organisms including plants and humans. They act on diverse targets including microorganisms and mammalian cells, but the factors that determine their target cell selectivity are not yet clear. Here, we tested the role of peptide length and preassembly on the ability of diastereomeric cationic antimicrobial peptides to discriminate among bacteria, erythrocytes, and fungal cells, by using peptides with variable lengths (13, 16, and 19 amino acids long) and their covalently linked pentameric bundles. All the bundles expressed similar potent antifungal activity (minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.2-0.3 microM) and high antimicrobial activity. Hemolytic activity was also observed at concentrations higher than those required for antifungal activity. In contrast, all the monomers showed length-dependent antimicrobial activity, were less active toward bacteria and fungi, and were devoid of hemolytic activity. BIAcore biosensor experiments revealed a approximately 300-fold increase in peptide-membrane binding affinity between the 13- and 19-residue monomers toward zwitterionic (egg phosphatidylcholine (PC)/egg spingomyelin (SM)/cholesterol) vesicles. All the monomeric peptides display a similar high affinity to negatively charged (E. coli phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)/egg phosphatidylglycerol (PG)) vesicles regardless of their length. In contrast, irrespective of the size of the monomeric subunit, all the bundles bind irreversibly and strongly disrupt both PC/SM/cholesterol and PE/PG membranes. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that peptide assembly also affects structure as observed by an increased alpha-helical and beta-sheet content in membranes and enhances acyl chain disruption of PC/cholesterol. The correlation between the antibacterial activity and ability to depolarize the transmembrane potential of E. coli spheroplasts, as well as the ability to induce calcein release from vesicles, suggests that the bacterial membrane is their target. The data demonstrate that preassembly of cationic diastereomeric antimicrobial peptides is an essential factor in their membrane targeting.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of bacterial organisms isolated from rats.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if antimicrobial resistance occurs in various bacterial species isolated from rats. METHOD: Two hundred and fifteen rats were trapped from areas in and around Nairobi, Kenya. They were sacrificed and their intestinal, liver and spleen specimens obtained. Various bacterial species were isolated from these specimens. The species were analysed for antimicrobial susceptibility to 12 commonly used antimicrobials using the disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: The bacterial species isolated included pathogenic and potentially pathogenic ones such as Escherichia coli 137, Salmonella typhimurium 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae 2, Enterobacter cloacae 4, Enterobacter sakazakii 2, Citrobacter freundii 3, Morganella morganii (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 and Burkhoddria cepacia 6. Depending on the species, the resistance to the various antimicrobials were: 0-100% for cefotaxime, nalidixic acid, cefuroxime, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, co-amoxyclav, sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, trimethoprim and cephradine, 0-66.6% for gentamicin and 0-25% for apramycin. CONCLUSION: The results showed that, rats from the study area harboured bacterial species with antimicrobial resistance. These micro-organisms may form an important reservoir for antibiotic resistance which could pose a public health hazard. Control of rat populations, better management of sewer systems and waste dumping sites are recommended in order to reduce occurrence of these drug resistance reservoirs.
TI  - prbA, a gene coding for an esterase hydrolyzing parabens in enterobacter cloacae  and Enterobacter gergoviae strains.
AB  - The new gene prbA encodes an esterase responsible for the hydrolysis of the ester bond of parabens in Enterobacter cloacae strain EM. This gene is located on the chromosome of strain EM and was cloned by several PCR approaches. The prbA gene codes for an immature protein of 533 amino acids, the first 31 of which represent a proposed signal peptide yielding a mature protein of a putative molecular mass of 54.6 kDa. This enzyme presents analogies with other type B carboxylesterases, mainly of eukaryotic origin. The cloning and expression of the prbA gene in a strain of Escherichia coli previously unable to hydrolyze parabens resulted in the acquisition of a hydrolytic capacity comparable to the original activity of strain EM, along with an increased resistance of the transformed strain to methyl paraben. The presence of homologues of prbA was tested in additional ubiquitous bacteria, which may be causative factors in opportunistic infections, including Enterobacter gergoviae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas agglomerans, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Burkholderia cepacia. Among the 41 total strains tested, 2 strains of E. gergoviae and 1 strain of Burkholderia cepacia were able to degrade almost completely 800 mg of methyl paraben liter(-1). Two strains of E. gergoviae, named G1 and G12, contained a gene that showed high homology to the prbA gene of E. cloacae and demonstrated comparable paraben esterase activities. The significant geographical distance between the locations of the isolated E. cloacae and E. gergoviae strains suggests the possibility of an efficient transfer mechanism of the prbA gene, conferring additional resistance to parabens in ubiquitous bacteria that represent a common source of opportunistic infections.
TI  - Method for estimation of low outer membrane permeability to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria plays a major role in beta-lactam resistance as it slows down antibiotic entry into the periplasm and therefore acts in synergy with beta-lactamases and efflux systems. Up to now, the quantitative estimation of low outer membrane permeability by the method of Zimmermann and Rosselet was difficult because of the secreted and cell surface-associated beta-lactamases. The method presented here uses the acylation of a highly sensitive periplasmic penicillin-binding protein (PBP) (BlaR-CTD) to assess the rate of beta-lactam penetration into the periplasm. The method is dedicated to measurement of low permeability and is only valid when the diffusion rate through the outer membrane is rate limiting. Cytoplasmic membrane associated PBPs do not interfere since they are acylated after the very sensitive BlaR-CTD. This method was used to measure the permeability of beta-lactamase-deficient strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter aerogenes to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefotaxime, aztreonam, and cephacetrile. Except for that of cephacetrile, the permeability coefficients were equal to or below 10(-7) cm/s. For cephacetrile, carbenicillin, and benzylpenicillin, the outer membrane of E. cloacae was 20 to 60 times less permeable than that of Escherichia coli, whereas for cefotaxime, aztreonam, and ampicillin it was, respectively, 400, 1,000, and 700 times less permeable. The permeability coefficient for aztreonam is the lowest ever measured (P = 3.2 x 10(-9) cm/s). Using these values, the MICs for a beta-lactamase-overproducing strain of E. cloacae were successfully predicted, demonstrating the validity of the method.
TI  - Mutation of rpiA in Enterobacter cloacae decreases seed and root colonization and biocontrol of damping-off caused by Pythium ultimum on cucumber.
AB  - Strains of Enterobacter cloacae show promise as biocontrol agents for Pythium ultimum-induced damping-off on cucumber and other crops. E. cloacae A145 is a mini-Tn5 Km transposon mutant of strain 501R3 that was significantly reduced in suppression of damping-off on cucumber caused by P. ultimum. Strain A145 was deficient in colonization of cucumber, sunflower, and wheat seeds and significantly reduced in colonization of corn and cowpea seeds relative to strain 501R3. Populations of strain A145 were also significantly lower than those of strain 501R3 at all sampling times in cucumber, wheat, and sunflower rhizosphere. Populations of strain A145 were not detectable in any rhizosphere after 42 days, while populations of strain 501R3 remained at substantial levels throughout all experiments. Molecular characterization of strain A145 indicated mini-Tn5 Km was inserted in a region of the E. cloacae genome with a high degree of DNA and amino acid sequence similarity to rpiA, which encodes ribose-5-phosphate isomerase. In Escherichia coli, RpiA catalyzes the interconversion of ribose-5-phosphate and ribulose-5-phosphate and is a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase activity in cell lysates from strain A145 was approximately 3.5% of that from strain 501R3. In addition, strain A145 was a ribose auxotroph, as expected for an rpiA mutant. Introduction of a 1.0-kb DNA fragment containing only the rpiA homologue into strain A145 restored ribose phosphate isomerase activity, prototrophy, seedling colonization, and disease suppression to levels similar to those associated with strain 501R3. Experiments reported here indicate a key role for rpiA and possibly the pentose phosphate pathway in suppression of damping-off and colonization of subterranean portions of plants by E. cloacae.
TI  - Two novel oligosaccharides formed by 1F-fructosyltransferase purified from roots  of asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.).
AB  - Two novel oligosaccharides, tetra-and penta-saccharides were synthesized by fructosyl transfer from 1-kestose to 4G-beta-D-galactopyranosylsucrose with a purified 1F-fructosyltransferase of asparagus roots and identified as 1F-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-4G-beta-D-galactopyranosylsucrose, O-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2-->1)-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-O-[beta-D-galactopyranosy l-(1-->4)]-alpha-D-glucopyranoside and 1F(1-beta-D-fructofuranosyl)2-4G-beta-D-galactopyranosylsucrose, [O-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2-->1)]2-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-O-[beta-D-galactopyran osyl-(1-->4)]-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, respectively. Both oligosaccharides were scarcely hydrolyzed by carbohydrase from rat small intestine. Human intestinal bacterial growth by 1F-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-4G-beta-D-galactopyranosylsucrose was compared with that by the tetrasaccharides, stachyose and nystose. Bifidobacteria utilized 1F-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-4G-beta-D-galactopyranosylsucrose to the same extent as stachyose or nystose. On the other hand, the unfavorable bacteria, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli and Enterococcusfaecalis, that produce mutagenic substances did not use the synthetic oligosaccharide.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An automated bacterial culture system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. The recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into Day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU per mL. Samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. RESULTS: All organisms, except P. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 CFU/mL) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 CFU/mL) hours. P. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 CFU/mL) or 66.0 (100 CFU/mL) hours. The 10-fold increase in inoculum was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. The aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours) between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION: No difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. The new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.
TI  - BUT-1: a new member in the chromosomal inducible class C beta-lactamases family from a clinical isolate of Buttiauxella sp.
AB  - An atypical Enterobacteriaceae strain with a beta-lactam susceptibility pattern of inducible cephalosporinase was isolated in Tenon Hospital (Paris, France) from a patient's skull wound infection. Identifications by the API-50CHE biochemical system and 16S rRNA gene sequencing concluded that it was a member of the Buttiauxella genus. The bla gene was cloned and sequenced. The deduced translated product was a 383-amino acid protein (BUT-1) with 75-78% identity with the chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli. The isoelectric point of 9.0 and the kinetic constants of BUT-1 were comparable with results described for other Ambler class C enzymes. bla(BUT-1) and the associated ampR transcriptional regulator gene were divergently transcribed from a common intercistronic region, a genetic organization already described for other inducible class C beta-lactamases. The deduced amino acid sequence of AmpR shared 85% and 81% identity with AmpR from E. cloacae and C. freundii respectively.
TI  - Remarkable substituent effects on antimicrobial activities of 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium salts.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of a series of 25 diazolidinium  salts, 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium (1), together with 1,3-dialkylpyrimidinium (2), were evaluated against standard strains: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 13047), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10239). Selective and effective antibacterial activity against one gram-negative (P. aeruginosa) and two gram-positive (E. faecalis and S. aureus) bacteria were found in salts 1a, 1i and 1j, in contrast to modest to poor activity observed in the rest of the salts. The enhanced antibacterial activity is clearly linked to the introduction of two bulky mesityl or mesitylbenzyl substituents on the nitrogen atoms of the imidazoline skeleton, while the side chain of the backbone of the molecule has no influence.
TI  - Emerging fluoroquinolone-resistance for common clinically important gram-negative bacteria in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the three most commonly used fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) was measured for 2235 isolates of seven common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. Collected from a major teaching hospital in Taiwan during the years 1985-86, 1989-90, and 1996-97, the samples were evaluated using the agar dilution method. The overall susceptibility to fluoroquinolones has decreased rapidly after the wide use of these antimicrobial agents. Isolates of Escherichia coli and Morganella morganii proved quite susceptible to the fluoroquinolones until 1996. By 1996-97, 20% of the bacteria had become resistant to the fluoroquinolones. Activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis remained excellent, however, with more than 90% of the isolates susceptible during the survey period. Interestingly, some strains of Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrating in vitro resistance even before the fluoroquinolones were launched in Taiwan. This resistance increased rapidly, with around 20-30% of S. marcescens isolates fluoroquinolone-resistant by 1996-1997. After the introduction of the fluoroquinolones, resistance was demonstrated for about 15% of the P. aeruginosa isolates, and 20% of Enterobacter cloacae isolates, with the susceptibility rate remaining steady state through the 1990s. Different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns have been demonstrated for most fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, suggesting that the increased resistance was not due to the spread of a single clone. We conclude a trend of increasing fluoroquinolone resistance for many common gram-negative bacteria in Taiwan, especially in recent years. Appropriate use of the new fluoroquinolones should be encouraged in order to prevent the rapid emergence and increase of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems. Thirty-two species 2,697 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), Escherichia coli (n = 250), Citrobacter freundii (n = 153), Citrobacter koseri (n = 97), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), Serratia marcescens (n = 153), Proteus mirabillis (n = 103), Proteus vulgaris (n = 77), Morganella morganii (n = 141), Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii; n = 154), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), Pseudomonas putida (n = 49), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), Acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), Acinetobactor Iwoffii (n = 30), Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola; n = 124). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lowffii throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Development of a sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting and quantifying CMY-2 and SHV beta-lactamases.
AB  - Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against SHV-1 and CMY-2 beta-lactamases were produced and characterized, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were developed. Immunoblots revealed that the anti-SHV-1 antibody recognized SHV-1 but did not recognize TEM-1, K-1, OXA-1, or any AmpC beta-lactamase tested. The anti-CMY-2 antibody detected Escherichia coli CMY-2, Enterobacter cloacae P99, Klebsiella pneumoniae ACT-1, and the AmpC beta-lactamases of Enterobacter aerogenes, Morganella morganii, and Citrobacter freundii. No cross-reactivity of the anti-CMY-2 antibody was seen against laboratory strains of E. coli possessing TEM-1, SHV-1, K-1, or OXA-1 beta-lactamases. Operating conditions for performing ELISAs were optimized. Both anti-CMY-2 and anti-SHV-1 antibodies detected picogram quantities of purified protein in ELISAs. The reactivity of the anti-CMY-2 antibody was tested against a number of AmpC beta-lactamases by assaying known quantities of purified enzymes in ELISAs (AmpC beta-lactamases of M. morganii, C. freundii, E. coli, and E. cloacae). As the homology to CMY-2 beta-lactamase decreased, the minimum level needed for detection increased (e.g., 94% homology recognized at 1 ng/ml and 71% homology recognized at 10 ng/ml). The ELISAs were used to assay unknown clinical isolates for AmpC and SHV beta-lactamases, and the results were confirmed with PCR amplification of bla(AmpC) and bla(SHV) genes. Overall, we found that our ELISAs were at least 95% sensitive and specific for detecting SHV and AmpC beta-lactamases. The ELISA format can facilitate the identification of AmpC and SHV beta-lactamases and can be used to quantify relative amounts of beta-lactamase enzymes in clinical and laboratory isolates.
TI  - Chromosomal ampC genes in Enterobacter species other than Enterobacter cloacae, and ancestral association of the ACT-1 plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase to Enterobacter asburiae.
AB  - The amplification and sequence of ampC genes in Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter cancerogenus, Enterobacter dissolvens, Enterobacter hormaechei and Enterobacter intermedius bring the number of known cephalosporinase sequences from the genus Enterobacter to seven. Expression in Escherichia coli of the ampC genes from E. asburiae, E. hormaechei and E. intermedius established the functional nature of these genes. ampC from E. asburiae shows 96.5% identity to bla(ACT-1) encoding a plasmid-borne cephalosporinase previously believed to derive from Enterobacter cloacae. The reassignment of ACT-1 ancestry to E. asburiae is confirmed by the 95.5% identity between ampR upstream of bla(ACT-1) and ampR from E. asburiae.
TI  - Ceftriaxone activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens isolated in US clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA.
AB  - Ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the USA in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily treatment of patients with Gram-positive or Gram-negative infections. Review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. We reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five Gram-positive and 11 Gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA. All MIC results were interpreted using NCCLS breakpoint criteria. Ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). Ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. Beta-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. Among methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. Ceftriaxone resistance among Escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), Proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), Morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and Serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. Resistance to ceftriaxone among Enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other Enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. Rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among Acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. All Haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of Moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. In summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.
TI  - Synthesis of new C-6 alkyliden penicillin derivatives as beta-lactamase inhibitors.
AB  - New penicillin, penicillin sulfone and sulfoxide derivatives bearing a C-6-alkyliden substituent were prepared. Their chemical synthesis, in vitro antibacterial activity and inhibition properties against two selected enzymes representing Class A and C beta-lactamases are reported. Compounds 3a-c, 7a-c were able to inhibit either TEM-1 (a Class A enzyme, from Escherichia coli) or P-99 (a Class C enzyme, from E. cloacae), or both enzymes, when tested in competition experiments using nitrocefin as the reporter substrate. However, when tested in combination with amoxicillin, the same compounds did not show synergistic effects against E. coli and E. cloacae strains producing TEM-1 and P99 enzymes, respectively. This finding is most likely related to poor penetration through the bacterial cell wall, as shown by using a more permeable isogenic E. coli strain. Interestingly, a synergistic effect against a strain of S. aureus which produces PC1-enzyme (a Class A beta-lactamase) was observed for compound 3a when used in combination with amoxicillin.
TI  - Jaundice as an early diagnostic sign of urinary tract infection in infancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common clinical problem in febrile infants younger than 8 weeks old, with a prevalence between 5% and 11%. Previous studies have noted that jaundice may be one of the first signs of a bacterial infection in infants. Our goal was to determine the incidence of UTIs in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old and to determine which historical and laboratory parameters are associated with UTIs. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated asymptomatic, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old for evidence of a UTI (defined as >10 000 colony-forming units per milliliter of a single pathogen, obtained by bladder catheterization). A serum fractionated bilirubin level was obtained on all study patients. Detailed questionnaires were completed, which included demographic information, prenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal events. RESULTS: Twelve (7.5%) of 160 infants had a UTI (95% confidence interval: 3.9%-12.7%). Isolated organisms included Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus, Streptococcus viridans, and Staphylococcus aureus. Patients with the onset of jaundice after 8 days of age had a higher incidence of UTI, 6 (50%) of 12 infants in the positive culture group, versus 15 (10%) of 148 infants in the negative culture group. Abnormal urinalysis and microscopy results were noted in 5 (42%) of 12 infants with a UTI, and 6 (55%) of 11 infants had abnormal renal ultrasound results. CONCLUSION: A UTI was found in 7.5% of asymptomatic, afebrile, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old. In addition, infants with the onset of jaundice after 8 days of age or patients with an elevated conjugated bilirubin fraction were more likely to have a UTI. Therefore, we recommend that testing for a UTI be included as part of the evaluation in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants presenting to the emergency department.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - Transient reduction in the tRNA 4-thiouridine content induced by ultraviolet A during post-irradiation growth in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - The influence of previous exposure to ultraviolet-A radiation (UVA) was studied on the susceptibility of Enterobacter cloacae to undergo the growth delay effect. Comparison of growth curves corresponding to irradiated and control cells showed that a previous treatment with UVA almost abolished the growth delay effect. UV absorption spectra of tRNA, and reverse phase HPLC analysis of hydrolysed tRNA, demonstrated a low content of 4-thiouridine in E. cloacae cells grown after UVA exposure at low doses. Since 4-thiouridine is the UVA target responsible for initiation of growth delay, this observation explained the influence of previous exposure to UVA on the susceptibility of this organism to undergo growth delay. A similar but weaker alteration was found when Escherichia coli was assayed. The results suggest that, in addition to cross-linking with cytidine residues, the content of 4-thiouridine in tRNA may be modified by UVA by an unknown mechanism.
TI  - NB2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - Enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ECTA) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-Lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ECTA compounds, NB2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. Unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of NB2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. Evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) NB2001 is a substrate for TEM-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of greater than 77,000 M-1 s-1. (ii) Triclosan is detected in NB2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli but not in E. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) NB2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. NB2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. NB2001 is also active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. The results indicate that NB2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ECTA in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
TI  - TEM-80, a novel inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamase in a clinical isolate of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae Ecl261 was isolated with Escherichia coli Ec257 from the urine of a patient living in a nursing home. Both isolates were resistant to ticarcillin (MICs, 1,024 microg/ml), without significant potentiation of its activity by 2 microg of clavulanate per ml (MICs, 512 microg/ml), and susceptible to naturally active cephalosporins. This inhibitor-resistant phenotype was conferred in both strains by similar conjugative plasmids of 40 kb (Ecl261) and 30 kb (Ec257), which also conveyed resistance to sulfonamides and trimethoprim. Clinical and transconjugant strains produced a beta-lactamase with a pI of 5.2 which belonged to the TEM family, as indicated by specific PCR amplification. Compared with TEM-1, this enzyme exhibited lower catalytic efficiencies (14- and 120-fold less for amoxicillin and ticarcillin, respectively), and higher concentrations of beta-lactamase inhibitors were required to yield a 50% reduction in benzylpenicillin hydrolysis (750-, 82-, and 50-fold higher concentrations for clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam, respectively). Gene sequencing revealed four nucleotide differences with the nucleotide sequence of bla(TEM-1A). The first replacement (T32C), located in the promoter region, was described as being responsible for the increase in the level of beta-lactamase production. The three other changes led to amino acid substitutions that define a new inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT) beta-lactamase, TEM-80 (alternate name, IRT-24). Two of them, Met69Leu and Asn276Asp, have previously been related to inhibitor resistance. The additional mutation, Ile127Val, was demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis to have a very weak effect, at least alone, on the IRT phenotype. This is the first description of an IRT beta-lactamase in E. cloacae. The horizontal transfer of bla(TEM-80) may have occurred either from Ec257 to Ecl261 or in the reverse order.
TI  - [Can we rely on the results of urine microscopy and culture when tests are performed in general practice?].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTI) account for 2-5% of consultations in general practice, but only about half the patients with dysuria have significant bacteriuria (> 100,000 bacteria per ml). A microbiological diagnosis can be made by examination of a urine sample, and in Danish family practice the diagnosis of UTI is often reached by a microscopic analysis or a dip-slide culture test. These methods have a high validity when performed in hospital, but we need knowledge about the validity of microbiological urine examinations when performed in general practice. The aim of this study was to validate detection of bacteriuria by urine microscopy and dip-slide culture in general practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Urine specimens artificially produced by adding a known quantity of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis) to sterile urine were sent to 25 general practices for microscopic examination and dip-slide culture. No prior instruction in testing procedure was given. As the gold standard, the results of a standardised culture method performed by skilled laboratory technicians at the Department of Microbiology, University of Southern Denmark, were used. RESULTS: Significant bacteriuria was identified by microscopy with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83%. The corresponding figures for urine culture were 95% and 96%. The morphology of bacteria was interpreted correctly in 80% of microscopic examinations, and 60% of the bacteria strains were classified correctly in terms of their motility. DISCUSSION: The results of urine microscopy and culture performed in general practice are to be relied on.
TI  - Epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacter isolates  in a Spanish hospital during a 12-year period.
AB  - Fifteen Enterobacter clinical isolates (11 Enterobacter cloacae isolates, 3 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates, and 1 Enterobacter gergoviae isolate), representing 0.4% of all Enterobacter isolates recovered in our hospital from 1989 to 2000, were suspected of harboring an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). These isolates were recovered from 14 different patients. ESBLs were transferred by conjugation into an Escherichia coli recipient strain. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed a single clone of E. aerogenes and six different clones of E. cloacae. Four of these E. cloacae clonal types were represented by only one isolate each, but the other two were represented by three and four isolates, respectively. Isoelectric focusing, susceptibility phenotyping, PCR analysis, and sequencing demonstrated the presence of three different ESBLs. The most frequent was the recently characterized CTX-M-10 ESBL, which was found in the E. gergoviae isolate and in all but one of the E. cloacae isolates. The remaining E. cloacae isolate harbored a TEM-27 ESBL, and the three E. aerogenes isolates harbored a TEM-24 ESBL. PFGE revealed that our E. aerogenes strain was indistinguishable from the French TEM-24-producing E. aerogenes endemic clone. Although a low prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacter isolates was found in our institution over a 12-year period, a diversity of nonepidemic E. cloacae clones was detected, as was the persistence of the CTX-M-10 beta-lactamase. The presence of the TEM-24-producing E. aerogenes French clone in our institution also demonstrates the intercountry dissemination of ESBL-producing isolates.
TI  - A decade of antimicrobial susceptibilities at the University of Kentucky Hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility rates for key antimicrobial agents and selective bacterial pathogens in the decade of the 1990s. METHODS: Data from 1990 to 2000 from the University of Kentucky Clinical Microbiology Laboratory were analyzed by linear regression analysis to identify agents and pathogens that show a decline in susceptibility. For selected pathogens and antimicrobial agents, predictions were made for further declines in susceptibility for 2005 and 2010. RESULTS: Significant declines in susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents were found for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Further declines were predicted for 2005 and 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Examination of susceptibility rates over time in a university hospital medical center provides useful data for future planning. In our institution, antimicrobial susceptibility rates have significantly declined during the 1990s for certain antimicrobial agents and bacterial pathogens. We are attempting to change our antimicrobial use patterns through formulary manipulation and clinician education, which may retard or prevent such declines in the future.
TI  - Increase in MICs of ciprofloxacin in vivo in two closely related clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - The mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in two isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Ecl#1 and Ecl#2, from the same patient and with identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, have been analysed. MICs of ciprofloxacin were 0.25 and 1 mg/L for Ecl#1 and Ecl#2, respectively. Ecl#2 was also more resistant to chloramphenicol and organic solvents. The quinolone resistance determining regions of gyrA/B and parC/E, and the marORA and acrB genes, were sequenced. Expression of marR, acrB, soxS, robA, ramA and fis was analysed by northern blotting. The activity of a 90 bp E. cloacae mar promoter fragment was examined with the reporter plasmid pIGJ-1mar. Sequencing the gyrAB and parCE genes revealed a single amino acid substitution in GyrA (corresponding to position 83 in GyrA of Escherichia coli) in Ecl#1 and Ecl#2 (Phe83) compared with reference strain E. cloacae DSMZ 3264 (Thr83). Ecl#2 accumulated significantly less norfloxacin and displayed higher levels of expression of marR and acrB than Exl#1, indicative of greater fluoroquinolone efflux activity. Sequencing gyrB, parC/E and marORA, and northern blotting of robA, ramA and fis, did not reveal any further differences between the two strains. No homologue of soxRS was detected in E. cloacae. Expression of GFP from pIGJ1-mar in Ecl#2 was higher than in Ecl#1. In these two closely related clinical isolates of E. cloacae, a target mutation in GyrA (Ecl#1 and Ecl#2) and increased fluoroquinolone efflux by AcrAB (Ecl#2) contribute to the resistance phenotypes, corroborating findings in vitro and in vivo about the sequential development of fluoroquinolone resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative isolates from European intensive care units: data from the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) programme.
AB  - Susceptibility data were collected for 6243 gram-negative isolates from 29 European ICUs participating in the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Programme (1997-2000). The most commonly isolated bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%), Escherichia coli (19.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.4%), and Enterobacter cloacae (7.7%). The incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producers was higher in Turkish, Russian and Italian ICUs (27.9-39.6%) than in other countries (2.5-10.8%). The frequency of AmpC-cephalosporin hyper-producers was 16.8-55.4%. Meropenem was more active against Proteus mirabilis than imipenem (99.0% versus 88.8% susceptibility, respectively). Against Acinetobacter baumannii, meropenem (79.6% susceptible) and imipenem (82.2%) were more active than comparators (34.3-51.6%). Meropenem and imipenem exhibited good activity against P. aeruginosa (76.1% and 68.2%, respectively; but with inter-country variation). Ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli and K. pneumoniae increased and needs close monitoring. Meropenem (98.2-99.8% susceptibility) and imipenem (88.8-99.4%) remained potent against important species of gram-negative bacteria from European ICUs actively using meropenem.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated from patients with various infections.
AB  - AIMS: Isolates from various samples obtained during 1998 and 1999 were identified and their susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, monobactams and/or cephamycins studied along with any production of ESBLs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Of these samples, bacteria most frequently isolated by the conventional techniques and Vitek GNI card were Escherichia coli (37%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (27%) and Enterobacter cloacae (16%). Using disk diffusion and double-disk synergy tests, we found that 71% strains produced ESBLs and 18% strains produced ESBLs and cephamycinases. Banding patterns of PCR amplification with the designed primers showed that 57% strains were capable of harbouring bla(SHV) genes. The bla(TEM), bla(CMY) and bla(AmpC) genes were harboured by 55%, 31% and 12% strains, respectively. Forty-five percent of strains contained more than two types of beta-lactamase genes. In particular, one strain contained bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CMY) and bla(AmpC) genes. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of ESBL-producing strains was high. The most prevalent beta-lactamase gene was bla(SHV) gene. The bla(CMY) genes have been prevalent in cephamycin-resistant strains. The multidrug-resistant strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and cephamycins were detected in high percentage. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Resistance mechanisms to beta-lactams, comprising mostly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production, lead to the resistance against even recently developed beta-lactams in enterobacteria, which is now a serious threat to antibiotic therapy. The high prevalence of bla(CMY) genes and multidrug-resistant genes may also cause therapeutic failure and lack of eradication of these strains by third-generation cephalosporins or cephamycins.
TI  - Mechanisms of quinolone resistance in clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study and evaluate changes in the gyrA gene and the outer-membrane  protein patterns in relation to evolution of resistance against the quinolones in Enterobacter cloacae. METHODS: Strains expressing gyrA-mediated quinolone resistance become susceptible to quinolones upon insertion of the plasmid pNJR3-2. This plasmid (containing wild-type Escherichia coli quinolone-susceptible DNA gyrase A subunits) and pLA2917 (the vector) were introduced into 10 resistant or moderately susceptible clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae by conjugation. The transconjugants, the original isolates, the plasmid and the vector control were screened for susceptibility to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin. Additionally, examinations of the outer-membrane proteins were performed. RESULTS: A reduction of MICs by a factor of 8--32 was found for the transconjugants of five Enterobacter cloacae isolates in the presence of the gene probe, suggesting that these isolates harbored mutations in gyrA. No discernible difference in the patterns of outer-membrane proteins of sensitive and resistant strains could be detected. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that changes in the target site such as alterations in gyrA are important factors leading to a change in the susceptibility of bacteria to the quinolones, whereas there were no evident changes in the outer-membrane proteins to account for evolution of resistance.
TI  - Three cefotaximases, CTX-M-9, CTX-M-13, and CTX-M-14, among Enterobacteriaceae in the People's Republic of China.
AB  - Of 15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae collected from the First Municipal People's Hospital of Guangzhou, in the southern part of the People's Republic of China, 9 were found to produce CTX-M ESBLs, 3 produced SHV-12, and 3 produced both CTX-M and SHV-12. Eleven isolates produced either TEM-1B or SHV-11, in addition to an ESBL. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 12 isolates carrying bla(CTX-M) genes revealed that they harbored three different bla(CTX-M) genes, bla(CTX-M-9) (5 isolates), bla(CTX-M-13) (1 isolate), and bla(CTX-M-14) (6 isolates). These genes have 98% nucleotide homology with bla(Toho-2). The bla(CTX-M) genes were carried on plasmids that ranged in size from 35 to 150 kb. Plasmid fingerprints and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed the dissemination of the bla(CTX-M) genes through transfer of different antibiotic resistance plasmids to different bacteria, suggesting that these resistance determinants are highly mobile. Insertion sequence ISEcp1, found on the upstream region of these genes, may be involved in the translocation of the bla(CTX-M) genes. This is the first report of the occurrence of SHV-12 and CTX-M ESBLs in China. The presence of strains with these ESBLs shows both the evolution of bla(CTX-M) genes and their dissemination among at least three species of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae, isolated within a single hospital. The predominance of CTX-M type enzymes seen in this area of China appears to be similar to that seen in South America but is different from those seen in Europe and North America, suggesting different evolutionary routes and selective pressures. A more comprehensive survey of the ESBL types from China is urgently needed.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus in Italy: incidence and trends over the period 1997-1999.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and of  Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from the respiratory tract was assessed over the period 1997-1999 as part of the Italian Epidemiological Observatory survey sponsored by the Smith-Kline Foundation. A standardised method was used to determine the MICs of 22 antibiotics against isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=870), Escherichia coli (n=684), Enterobacter cloacae (n=342), Enterobacter aerogenes (n=187) and Serratia marcescens (n=135) as well as the MICs of 11 antibiotics against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n=1,606). Overall, the susceptibility rate of Enterobacteriaceae isolates was > or = 90% to 5 agents (meropenem, imipenem, amikacin, cefepime and gentamicin); 89-80% to 2 agents (ciprofloxacin and tobramycin); and <80% to 11 agents (cefotaxime, piperacillin-tazobactam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefetamet, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, tetracycline, piperacillin, cefuroxime, chloramphenicol, ticarcillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate and amoxicillin). During the 3-year monitoring period, antibiotic susceptibility increased in Klebsiella pneumoniae against amoxicillin-clavulanate, in Escherichia coli against third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam, in Enterobacter aerogenes against amoxicillin and piperacillin-tazobactam and in Serratia marcescens against most of the antibiotics. In contrast, Enterobacter cloacae showed a tendency to develop resistance to cefetamet, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. Of the total number of Staphylococcus aureus strains, 38% were methicillin resistant. Nearly 80% of the methicillin-resistant strains displayed a multiresistance pattern (additional resistance to 2 or more non-beta-lactam antibiotics). Rates of susceptibility of particular species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus) were compared using strains from different geographical areas of Italy (northern, central and southern) and from different nosocomial areas (outpatients, intensive care unit [ICU] inpatients, non-ICU inpatients). Susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae to several antibiotics was lower in southern Italy, whereas the incidence of methicillin-resistant strains was higher in northern and central Italy. The susceptibility of Escherichia coli was similar in all three areas. No significant differences in susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae or Escherichia coli were found between strains from inpatients and outpatients or from inpatients admitted to ICU and non-ICU units. The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was higher in ICU inpatients (52%) than in non-ICU inpatients (38%) and lower in outpatients (19%) than in inpatients.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an unusual 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase gene from Enterobacter cloacae UW4.
AB  - A genomic library of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase-containing plant growth-promoting bacterium Enterobacter cloacae UW4 in pUC19 in Escherichia coli was screened for the ability to utilize ACC as a sole source of nitrogen. One of the clones that was isolated contained a plasmid with an insert of approximately 0.8 kb that conferred ACC deaminase activity. Sequence analysis revealed that this DNA fragment contains an open-reading frame of 696 nucleotides predicted to encode a protein of 232 amino acids, a member of the amidohydrolase protein superfamily, i.e., a deaminase that contains a mononuclear or binuclear metal center as compared to the canonical ACC deaminase which contains pyridoxal phosphate as a co-factor.
TI  - Multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens in intensive care units in 2000 in Taiwan.
AB  - A susceptibility surveillance study of 1,274 bacterial isolates recovered from various clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) of five major teaching hospitals was carried out from March, 2000, to June, 2000, in Taiwan. This study demonstrated a high rate (66%) of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA), a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (intermediate, 50% and highly resistant, 8%), and high rates of cefotaxime nonsusceptibility for S. pneumoniae (intermediate, 29% and resistant, 4%), Enterobacter cloacae (57%), Serratia marcescens (34%), and Citrobacter freundii (60%). High rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%), and high rates of imipenem nonsusceptibility for P. aeruginosa (15%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (22%) were also found. The percentage (11.9%) of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli was greater than that (11.3%) for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin nonsusceptibility for S. pneumoniae (42%), Enterococcus faecium (71%), and ORSA (39%) were high, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in this study. The resistance rates of some pathogen varied by institution or type of ICUs. Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens in hospitals, particularly in ICU settings with a preexisting higher resistance burden, is mandatory in establishing and/or modifying guidelines for empirical treatment of severe infections in ICU patients caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Susceptibility to fluoroquinolones among commonly isolated Gram-negative bacilli  in 2000: TRUST and TSN data for the United States. Tracking Resistance in the United States Today. The Surveillance Network.
AB  - From January to May 2000, as part of the Tracking Resistance in the United States Today (TRUST) surveillance initiative, clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n=2519) and non-fermentative Gram-negatives (n=580) were prospectively collected from 26 hospital laboratories across the United States. Isolates were tested for susceptibility to three fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin) and seven other agents. In addition, data for the same period were collected from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA, an electronic surveillance network that receives data from more than 200 laboratories in the US. Both surveillance methods produced similar results. Against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, imipenem was the most active agent, followed by the fluoroquinolones; > or = 86.7% of isolates of all species of Enterobacteriaceae except Providencia spp. were susceptible to fluoroquinolones by TRUST and TSN surveillance. TRUST identified differences in susceptibility to the three fluoroquinolones of > or = 2% for Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens. Isolates of P. mirabilis were considerably more susceptible to levofloxacin (94.0%) than to ciprofloxacin (87.7%) and gatifloxacin (87.7%). Other results from TRUST included Pseudomonas aeruginosa being slightly more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (73.5%) and levofloxacin (73.0%) than gatifloxacin (71.0%). Imipenem was the only compound with significant activity (95.1% susceptible, TRUST; 87.4% susceptible, TSN) against Acinetobacter baumannii, but it was inactive against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. S. maltophilia isolates were more susceptible to levofloxacin and gatifloxacin (77.7-79.8%) than ciprofloxacin (29.7-33.0%). Against 513 urinary isolates of Escherichia coli in TRUST, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equipotent. Age and gender had no clear effect on the activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin or gatifloxacin. Similar results for all three fluoroquinolones were seen in outpatients and inpatients. TRUST and TSN data indicated that resistance rates had not changed appreciably for any compound studied since a similar study conducted in 1999. TRUST centralized in vitro and electronic (TSN) surveillance methods provided an effective strategy for monitoring trends in resistance.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. A total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. The MIC of cefpiramide for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). Fifty-one percent (26/51) of Enterobacter cloacae isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against E. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. Cefpiramide was more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. Cefpiramide-resistant P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant S. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against Acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. Ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. Cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 2 microg/ml). Against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an MIC90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. These results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against Enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylo-coccus aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and penetration rate into sputum of gatifloxacin, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, and its therapeutic efficacy in respiratory infections.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against clinical isolates of  pathogenic bacteria was evaluated. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of gatifloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and rifampicin against 20 strains each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 15 strains each of Streptococcus Pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of Mycobacterium intracellulare, and 22 strains each of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium were determined. The minimum inhibitory concentrations90's of gatifloxacin against the above species were 0.12, 8, <==0.06, 0.5, 2, 2, <==0.06, 0.39, 0.05, 0.013, 2, 0.5, and 4 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. Gatifloxacin was four times as active as ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and as active as ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gatifloxacin was as active as tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimycobacterial activity of gatifloxacin was similar to that of sparfloxacin. Five patients with chronic respiratory infections and one patient with acute pneumonia received 100-400 mg/day of gatifloxacin orally for 5-12 days (mean, 8.17 days). The clinical effects were excellent in one patient and good in five. One strain of Haemophilus influenzae was eradicated and one strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted after therapy. Adverse reactions were mild and improved after completion of therapy. In one patient with chronic bronchitis, the maximum sputum concentrations 2-4 h after oral administration of 150 mg of gatifloxacin on days 1 and 6 were 0.88 and 1.45 &mgr;g/ml, respectively, and in serum the values were 0.84 and 1.24 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. Thus it was found that gatifloxacin possesses potent activity against respiratory pathogens (including Mycobacteriaceae), and shows good penetration rate into sputum, and that it can be used as the drug of first choice in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Development of a thin tube cultivation method for determining coliform counts in  milk.
AB  - A new rapid coliform-monitoring method using thin tube cultivation (TTC) was developed. One hundred microliters of modified selective medium (1.5% agar) and 100 microl of sample were mixed in thin cultivation tubes, yielding a semisolid mixture of 0.75% agar. The tubes were incubated at 37 degrees C and checked for a positive reaction (gas production from lactose fermentation and color changes from acid production) at 30-min intervals. The positive reaction times for TTC were compared with actual coliform numbers. The first experiment was performed to validate the TTC method using pure coliform cultures (the Escherichia coli group, the Enterobacter cloacae group. and the Klebsiella pneumoniae group). The results indicated that the TTC method saved about 10 to 14 h of incubation time compared with the conventional plating method. When coliforms were present in small numbers, such as I to 1.5 log10 CFU/ml, the TTC method detected their presence within 10 h. When highly contaminated samples were assayed (6 log10 CFU/ml), the TTC method detected the presence of coliforms within 4 to 5 h. In a food system experiment, pasteurized skim milk inoculated with a coliform mixture was assayed by the TTC method. The coliforms in the milk were quickly detected, resulting in a savings of 11 to 14 h compared with the conventional plating method. Cold-injured coliforms were studied to evaluate the TTC system. The recovery and estimation of injured coliforms by the TTC method strongly agree with those of the conventional plating method. The TTC system was also applied to ascertain the levels of natural coliforms in noninoculated milk. The TTC system reduced incubation times by about 11 to 14 h compared with the conventional plating method. According to these data, this method is a rapid, simple, accurate, and economical way to monitor and estimate total coliforms in milk.
TI  - Microbial killing activity of peracetic acid.
AB  - In vitro killing activity of peracetic acid (Perasafe) at a concentration of 0.26 per cent w/v was tested against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Acinetobacter baumannii, Sternotrophomonas maltophilia, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Bacillus subtilis spore, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immuno-deficiency virus type I. Exposure to Peracetic acid (0.26% w/v) for 10 minutes resulted in massive killing of all the aforementioned organisms and spore.
TI  - Molecular properties and metabolic effect on blood cells produced by a new toxin  of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - A new toxin of Enterobacter cloacae able to lyse erythrocytes and leukocytes was  found. Purification of the toxin was performed by salt precipitation, gel filtration, ion exchange and HPLC in C8 column. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis showed more than one bank corresponding to the leukotoxin able to form polymers and aggregate like some pore-forming cytotoxins (RTX). In culture supernatant the toxin showed 1 HU/ml (hemolytic unit) and 1.5 LU/ml (leukotoxic unit); after purification it reached 15 HU/ml and 20 LU/ml. The ratio between HU and percentage red cells affected the lytic capacity. E. cloacae toxin stimulated the oxidative metabolism of neutrophils, but over 50 microg toxin/ml the stimulus ceased as it was shown by NBT assay due to cell death. Chemiluminescence evidenced an increase in superoxide anion generation, but an excess of toxin interfered with this stimulus, as was previously observed in HlyA Escherichia coli toxin. Cross-reaction was found by immunoblotting with this HlyA. E. cloacae toxin presented higher amounts of proline, valine, aspartic and glutamic acids than HlyA. E. cloacae toxin was similar to HlyA in the prescence of a glycine-rich DNA sequence and in the observed effect of calcium on toxin activity. E. cloacae toxin did not cross-react by immunoblotting with hemolysin HmpA of Proteus.
TI  - [Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and drug sensitivity test in clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae in Shanghai].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) production in clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae in Shanghai, and compare the resistant rates of ESBLs-producing strains and non-ESBLs-producing strains to 11 antibiotics. METHODS: Double-disk synergy test was used to detect ESBLs in 1,026 strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae; Kirby-bauer agar diffusion method was used to judge drug sensitivity. RESULTS: 34.31% of strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae were considered ESBLs producers by double-disk synergy test. The prevalences of ESBLs in isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae were 37.40%, 30.21% and 41.82% respectively. Except Imipinem and Cefmetazole, the resistant rates of ESBLs-producing strains to other 9 antibiotics were much higher than that of non-ESBLs-producing strains(P < 0.01). The resistant rates of Imipinem to ESBLs-producing strains were the lowest. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ESBLs in clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae in Shanghai was high; it is necessary for clinical laboratory to detect ESBLs in clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae routinely. The resistant rates of ESBLs-producing strains to most antibiotics were high. Imipinem and Cefmetazole were the effective antibiotics to infections caused by ESBLs-producing strains.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1998 and March 1999].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from April 1998 to March 1999). The number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. A total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. On the whole, among Gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from postoperative infections. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. Among Gram-negative aerobes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes have gradually declined. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. The percentage of MRSA among S. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. The susceptibilities of B. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. Among other bacteria in B. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. E. coli and K. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. We found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities among clinical isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in a Taiwanese University Hospital.
AB  - Infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria with resistance to extended-spectrum  cephalosporins require the identification of effective alternative antimicrobial therapy. To determine the role of other pre-existing or currently available antimicrobial agents in treating infections caused by these multidrug-resistant pathogens, we evaluated the in vitro susceptibilities of these agents in 411 non-duplicate isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria recovered between January 1999 and December 1999 in a major teaching hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. These isolates included cefotaxime-resistant (MICs > or = 2 mg/L) Escherichia coli (66 isolates) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (77 isolates); cefotaxime-resistant (MICs > or = 64 mg/L) Enterobacter cloacae (59 isolates), Serratia marcescens (52 isolates) and Citrobacter freundii (52 isolates); and ceftazidime-resistant (MICs > or = 64 mg/L) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50 isolates) and Acinetobacter baumannii (55 isolates). Overall, carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) had good activity against the cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae tested (>90% of isolates were susceptible). However, carbapenems had limited activity against the ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa (only 4% of isolates were susceptible) and A. baumannii (51-56% of isolates were susceptible). Among the E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates tested, 33.3% and 58.4%, respectively, exhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype, determined by the double disc method. Over 80% of cefotaxime-resistant E. cloacae and C. freundii were susceptible to cefepime, but this agent had limited activity against other bacteria tested. Susceptibilities of these isolates to ciprofloxacin varied, ranging from 25% for A. baumannii to 92% for E. cloacae. Newer fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin) had equal or less activity against these organisms, except for A. baumannii for which their MIC(90)s (8-16 mg/L) were four- to 16-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin (MIC(90) 128 mg/L).
TI  - Rapid emergence of ciprofloxacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae containing multiple gentamicin resistance-associated integrons in a Dutch hospital.
AB  - In a hematology unit in the Netherlands, the incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli increased from from 1996 to 1999. Clonal spread of single genotypes of both ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae from patient to patient was documented by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and random amplification of polymorphic DNA. In addition, genetically heterogeneous strains were isolated regularly. Integrons associated with gentamicin resistance were detected in Enterobacter cloacae and E. coli strains. Integron-containing E. coli were detected in all hematology wards. In contrast, in Enterobacter cloacae strains two integron types were encountered only in the isolates from one ward. Although in all patients identical antibiotic regimens were used for selective decontamination, we documented clear differences with respect to the nosocomial emergence of ciprofloxacin-resistant bacterial strains and gentamicin resistance-associated integrons.
TI  - Host and geographical factors influence the thermal niche of enteric bacteria isolated from native Australian mammals.
AB  - The thermal profiles of 118 bacterial strains, representing six species of the family Enterobacteriaceae, isolated from a variety of native Australian mammals were determined under in vitro conditions. Each of the bacterial species had a unique thermal profile and differed in their minimum or maximum temperature for growth and in their response to changing temperatures. The taxonomic classification of the host from which the bacterial strains were isolated explained a significant amount of the variation in thermal profile among strains of a species. Host effects were detected at all taxonomic levels: order, family, genus, and species. The locality (State or Territory) or climate zone from which the strain was collected explained a significant amount of the variation in the thermal profile of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Genetically similar strains, as determined by allozyme profiles, had similar thermal profiles for the bacterial species Hafnia alvei and Escherichia coli. The results of this study indicate that there are potentially many aspects of host biology that may determine the thermal profile of these bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides isolated from skin secretions of the diploid frog, Xenopus tropicalis (Pipidae).
AB  - Seven peptides (XT-1-XT-7) with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the diploid clawed frog, Xenopus tropicalis. Structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that amino acid sequence similarity to antimicrobial peptides previously isolated from Xenopus laevis was low, suggesting that the species are not closely related phylogenetically. Peptides XT-5 and XT-3 are probably the orthologs of X. laevis peptide glycine-leucine amide (PGL(a)) and the N-terminal spacer region of prolevitide, respectively. XT-1, XT-6 and XT-7 show limited structural similarity to the spacer region of X. laevis procaeruleins and the paralogs XT-2 and XT-4 are similar to corresponding regions of proxenopsin. Orthologs of the magainins were not identified. The C-terminally alpha-amidated peptide XT-7 (GLLGPLLKIAAKVGSNLL.NH2) showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations against reference microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus 5 microM, Escherichia coli 5 microM, and Candida albicans 40 microM) and was also active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus group C, Shigella sonnei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. The peptide was, however, hemolytic against human erythrocytes (50% lysis at 70 microM). Circular dichroism studies showed that XT-7 has a random structure in aqueous solution, pH 7.0 but adopts an alpha-helical conformation in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol. Decreasing the cationicity of XT-7 either by replacement of the C-terminal CONH2 group by COOH or by deletion of the Lys(8) residue produced analogs with greatly (>10-fold) decreased antimicrobial potencies.
TI  - Trends in quinolone susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae among inpatients of a large university hospital: 1992-98.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess trends in quinolone susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a large university hospital. METHODS: Between 1992 and 1998, bacterial isolates were collected each year during a 3-month period to evaluate annual changes in susceptibility. In addition, the activities of fluoroquinolones (pefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) against nalidixic acid-resistant strains were determined by disk diffusion and MIC methodologies during the first and last year of the study. RESULTS: The susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae to nalidixic acid was unchanged between 1992 and 1998 (86% versus 85%). However, at the species level, the susceptibility rates to nalidixic acid decreased for Escherichia coli from 92% to 89%, and for Enterobacter cloacae from 87% to 82%. In contrast, there was a 10% increase in the nalidixic acid susceptibility rates for Klebsiella pneumoniae (74% versus 83%), which was thought to be due to the control of the spread of epidemic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains. The overall susceptibility of the Enterobacteriaceae to the fluoroquinolones remained high during the study period, greater than 90% in the case of ciprofloxacin. However, nalidixic acid-resistant Escherichia coli showed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin between 1992 and 1998, as reflected by a decrease in median zone diameter (26 mm to 19 mm), an increase in MIC(50) (0.25 mg/L to 1 mg/L) and a shift in MIC distribution (unimodal in 1992 to bimodal in 1998). This has resulted in the reduced susceptibility of Escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones between 1992 and 1998 (pefloxacin, 95-90%; ciprofloxacin, 99-95%). CONCLUSIONS: The susceptibility of Escherichia coli to quinolones has decreased, and the level of susceptibility of the resistant strains has increased over the 7-year study period.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. A total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. Most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. For many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. Some strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin was less active against P. aeruginosa, but was more active against S. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in Taiwan.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - The efficacy of chemical agents in cleaning and disinfection programs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the growing number of outbreaks of infection in hospital nurseries, it becomes essential to set up a sanitation program that indicates that the appropriate chemical agent was chosen for application in the most effective way. METHOD: For the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of a chemical agent, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was reached by the classic method of successive broth dilutions. The reference bacteria utilized were Bacillus subtilis var. globigii ATCC 9372, Bacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 7953, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The strains of Enterobacter cloacae IAL 1976 (Adolfo Lutz Institute), Serratia marcescens IAL 1478 and Acinetobactev calcoaceticus IAL 124 (ATCC 19606), were isolated from material collected from babies involved in outbreaks of infection in hospital nurseries. RESULTS: The MIC intervals, which reduced bacteria populations over 08 log10, were: 59 to 156 mg/L of quaternarium ammonium compounds (QACs); 63 to 10000 mg/L of chlorhexidine digluconate; 1375 to 3250 mg/L of glutaraldehyde; 39 to 246 mg/L of formaldehyde; 43750 to 87500 mg/L of isopropanol or ethanol; 1250 to 6250 mg/L of iodine in polyvinyl-pyrolidone complexes, 150 to 4491 mg/L of chlorine-releasing-agents (CRAs); 469 to 2500 mg/L of hydrogen peroxide; and, 2310 to 18500 mg/L of peracetic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Chlorhexidine showed non inhibitory activity over germinating spores. A. calcoaceticus, was observed to show resistance to the majority of the agents tested, followed by E. cloacae and S. marcescens.
TI  - Blood components influence cytokine induction by bacterial substances.
AB  - While some studies clearly demonstrated transfer of cytokine-inducing substances  (CIS) through dialysis membranes, other authors were unable to reproduce such a transfer. This inconsistency may have been caused by marked differences in experimental design. We performed a systematic evaluation of cytokine induction in whole blood and from separated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using either purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or culture supernatants from various bacterial strains. An in vitro hemodialysis circuit with whole blood in the blood compartment was employed; the dialysate was contaminated with sterile filtrates from Pseudomonas aeruginosa cultures. Addition of plasma samples from the blood side to PBMC readily induced interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 after contamination of the dialysate, while the same samples failed to induce cytokine production in whole blood. In experiments using direct incubation, purified P. aeruginosa LPS induced more IL-1beta and IL-6 in whole blood compared to PBMC. In contrast, bacterial filtrates from Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and especially P. aeruginosa induced significantly less cytokines in whole blood compared to PBMC. Addition of erythrocytes but not granulocytes decreased cytokine induction by bacterial filtrates as well as by LPS, probably by adsorption of these substances. The addition of 30% plasma increased cytokine induction by LPS but decreased cytokine induction by P. aeruginosas filtrates. Our results suggest that cellular and plasmatic components of whole blood interact with bacterial CIS altering their pyrogenic activity. The detection of CIS depends on the test system used; whole blood cultures are not as sensitive for the detection of CIS from bacterial filtrates as PBMC cultures.
TI  - Sublethal effects of ultraviolet A radiation on Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - We report the sublethal effects of ultraviolet A (UVA) on Enterobacter cloacae in comparison with those produced in Escherichia coli. UVA-induced sublethal effects were investigated in either bacterial membrane and at tRNA level. Limited dependence on oxygen concentration for photoinduced inhibition of biochemical membrane functions and low levels of oxidative damage during the irradiation period were found in En. cloacae. On the other hand, ultraviolet spectroscopy and reversed-phase HPLC analysis of hydrolysed tRNA showed that radio induced damage to tRNA is similar in En. cloacae and E. coli. Nevertheless, growth delay induced by UVA in En. cloacae was shorter than that found in E. coli submitted to the same experimental conditions. A limited post-irradiation ppGpp accumulation and the absence of any influence of the membrane damage on the growth delay extent seem to be responsible for the shortness of this effect in En. cloacae. Most of the differences between En. cloacae and E. coli could be attributed to an increased ability of En. cloacae to overcome oxidative stress during UVA exposure.
TI  - Bacteriological quality of aquacultured freshwater fish portions in prepackaged trays stored at 3 degrees C.
AB  - Fresh trout fillets and salmon slices packed in trays were obtained from two multinational chain supermarkets and evaluated for freshness and bacteriological quality immediately after packaging and during storage at 3 degrees C. Initial aerobic counts at 30 and 25 degrees C were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in trout fillets (5.27 +/- 0.57 and 4.87 +/- 0.80 log CFU/g, respectively) than in salmon slices, where levels in excess of 6 log CFU/g were found. In both products, initial Enterobacteriaceae counts were slightly higher than 3 log CFU/g and increased significantly during shelf life by approximately 3 log CFU/g. Most of the enterobacteria were identified as Citrobacter freundii, Hafnia alvei, and Enterobacter cloacae. On day 0, most probable number (MPN) counts of total and fecal coliforms were not significantly different, numbers of the latter group being approximately 4 MPN/g. Escherichia coli was only detected when fish was spoiled. Although initial presumptive Staphylococcus aureus counts were approximately 3 log CFU/g, only 4 of 84 selected colonies belonged to this species. Neither Salmonella nor antimicrobial residues were detected in any sample. Ethanol content in salmon slices did not significantly (P > 0.05) increase until they became inedible. Significant correlation (r = +0.72, P < 0.05) was observed between this chemical index and viable counts at 30 degrees C only when salmon slices were inedible. Trout fillets were acceptable for 7 days, and salmon slices showed signs of spoilage after 4 days. Although public health concerns associated with packed trout and salmon appear to be minimal, data on sensory quality, shelf life, and total viable and Enterobacteriaceae counts strongly suggest the need to improve the quality control systems used by European multinational retailers, especially for imported salmon.
TI  - AmpD is required for regulation of expression of NmcA, a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - To further elucidate the induction process of the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase of Ambler class A, NmcA, ampD genes of the wild-type (WT) strain and of ceftazidime-resistant mutants of Enterobacter cloacae NOR-1 were cloned and tested in transcomplementation experiments. Ceftazidime-resistant E. cloacae NOR-1 mutants exhibited derepressed expression of the AmpC-type cephalosporinase and of the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase NmcA. The ampD genes of Escherichia coli and E. cloacae WT NOR-1 transcomplemented the ceftazidime-resistant E. cloacae NOR-1 mutants to the WT level of beta-lactamase expression, while the mutated ampD alleles of E. cloacae NOR-1 failed to do so. The deduced E. cloacae NOR-1 WT AmpD protein exhibited 95 and 91% amino acid identity with the E. cloacae O29 and E. cloacae 14 WT AmpD proteins, respectively. Of the 12 ceftazidime-resistant E. cloacae NOR-1 strains, 3 had AmpD proteins with amino acid changes, while the others had truncated AmpD proteins. Most of these mutations were located outside the conserved regions that link the AmpD proteins to the cell wall hydrolases. AmpD from E. cloacae NOR-1 is involved in the regulation of expression of both beta-lactamases (NmcA and AmpC), suggesting that structurally unrelated genes may be under the control of an identical genetic system.
TI  - Bacterial cholangitis in patients with biliary atresia: impact on short-term outcome.
AB  - Bacterial cholangitis (BC) is a common complication in patients with biliary atresia (BA) and is characterized by fever, acholic stools and positive blood cultures. The diagnosis is often empirical because the yield of blood cultures is low. It is difficult to differentiate BC from other febrile episodes. In order to characterize the clinical and laboratory features of BC in patients with BA, identify risk factors, and correlate cholangitis with outcome, 37 patients with BA from 1993 to 1998 who underwent a Kasai operation in our hospital were studied. The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 59 months. A total of 107 febrile episodes were documented in these patients. The diagnostic criteria for cholangitis were fever, increased jaundice, or acholic stools. The clinical features, laboratory data, results of bacterial cultures, and outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 107 febrile episodes, including 78 bouts of cholangitis and 29 non-cholangitis infections, were found in 34 patients. Patients with BC had higher postoperative bilirubin levels (P = 0.02) and less frequent use of prophylactic antibiotics (P = 0.05) than those with non-cholangitis infections. Abnormal white blood cell counts (> 12,000 or <4,000 mm3) tended to be present in patients with BC (P = 0.08). There were no statistical differences in the risk factors and laboratory data between culture-positive (n = 16) and -negative (n = 62) cholangitis cases. The occurrence of cholangitis significantly reduced survival in both patients with good (P = 0.03) and inadequate bile flow (P = 0.03). All 9 patients who had never had cholangitis survived during the follow-up period. Repeated attacks of BC further decreased survival probability. The responsive organisms were mainly enteric bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanni, and Salmonella typhi. The sensitivity tests justified empirical therapy with ceftriaxone. The effectiveness of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or neomycin warrants further studies. BC was a highly prevalent postoperative complication in patients with BA, especially those with inadequate bile drainage. It significantly affected early mortality. Aggressive and complete treatment with empirical ceftriaxone was appropriate.
TI  - Samioside, a new phenylethanoid glycoside with free-radical scavenging and antimicrobial activities from Phlomis samia.
AB  - A new phenylethanoid glycoside, samioside, was isolated from the aerial parts of  Phlomis samia and identified as 1-O-3,4-(dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1-->4)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->3)-4-O-caffeoyl-beta-D- glucopyranoside (1). In addition, one known phenylethanoid glycoside and three known flavonoids were identified as acteoside (2), apigenin, chrysoeriol, and ermanin, respectively. The structure of 1 was elucidated on the basis of its spectroscopic data. Samioside (1) demonstrated scavenging properties toward the DPPH radical and antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Design, synthesis, and evaluation of alpha-ketoheterocycles as class C beta-lactamase inhibitors.
AB  - A series of specific alpha-ketoheterocycles (benzoxazole, thiazole, imidazole, tetrazole, and thiazole-4-carboxylate) has been synthesized in order to assess their potential as beta-lactamase inhibitors. The syntheses were achieved either by construction of the heterocycle (benzoxazole) from an appropriate alpha-hydroxyimidate, followed by oxidation of the alcohol, or by direct reaction of methyl phenaceturate with a lithiated heterocycle. The properties of these compounds in aqueous solution are described and their inhibitory activity against beta-lactamases assessed. They did inhibit the class C beta-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae P99 but not the TEM beta-lactamase. The most effective inhibitor of the former enzyme (K(i)=0.11 mM) was 5-(phenylacetylglycyl) tetrazole, probably because it is an anion at neutral pH. Interpretation of the results was aided by computational models of the tetrahedral adducts. Most of the compounds also inhibited alpha-chymotrypsin but not porcine pancreatic elastase.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of argon fluoride (ArF) excimer laser on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of argon fluoride (ArF) excimer laser radiation on clinically important strains of gram-negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity of ArF excimer laser radiation was evaluated on two Acinetobacter baumannii, one Enterobacter cloacae, three Escherichia coli, two Helicobacter pylori, one Klebsiella pneumoniae and two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. The strains were isolated from clinical specimens and typed by the usual biochemical procedures. Square agar plates of 12 x 12 cm were divided into rectangular (2 x 3 cm) regions and spread with 0.5x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU)/ml of bacterial suspension. The excess liquid was removed and the plates were allowed to dry for 30 min. A total of 96 rectangular (2x3 cm) regions were used for each strain, in order to test an equal number of laser parameters. Each rectangular region was irradiated with different laser parameters, using a 193 nm ArF excimer laser, linked with a simple Galilean afocal system and a rectangular diaphragm of the same dimensions as the original laser beam cross-section, at a distance of 10 cm from the irradiated surface. This system was used in order to keep the laser pulse energy under 80 mJ and to cut-out the non-transverse electromagnetic mode branches of the laser beam. We then studied the bacterial survival ratio versus the number of laser pulses, the repetition frequency and the total laser beam fluence. Our results showed that the total laser beam fluence was the most important parameter to consider in evaluating the bactericidal effect of ArF excimer laser radiation. A critical value of the total fluence was determined for each strain, such that, for laser beam fluences greater than this critical value, no colonies appeared to survive while, for laser fluences less than this critical value, the survival ratio did not exceed 2 x 10(7) CFU (2 x 10(-5)%). These critical values were found to vary between 8 J/cm2 and 16 J/cm2 for the bacterial species studied. Under these conditions, ArF laser irradiation is promising for the sterilisation of hard surfaces and for in situ application.
TI  - Further studies on RpoS in enterobacteria: identification of rpoS in Enterobacter cloacae and Kluyvera cryocrescens.
AB  - RpoS, the alternative sigma factor sigma(s), is important for bacterial survival  under extreme conditions. Many enterobacteria are opportunistic human pathogens and their ability to survive in a changing environment could be an essential step for their virulence. To determine the presence of this gene in enteric bacteria, an Escherichia coli rpoS probe was constructed and used to detect the presence of this gene in different species. A gene homologous to rpoS was found in Citrobacter amalonaticus, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella planticola, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Serratia rubidaea, Shigella sonnei, and Yersinia ruckeri. Providencia stuartii and Proteus vulgaris were the only tested enterobacteria that did not show any signal with the E. coli rpoS probe or that did not lead to amplification of an rpoS fragment using specific primers. The rpoS gene from E. cloacae and from K. cryocrescens was cloned and sequenced and a mutant allele was constructed in E. cloacae. Survival rates under different harsh conditions were followed in order to determine the effect of rpoS inactivation in exponential- and stationary-phase cells of both strains. E. cloacae rpoS mutants were more sensitive to extreme pH, high osmolarity, and high temperature than the wild-type.
TI  - Tract microflora in Saudi patients with cholelithiasis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the microflora in the gallbladder of patients undergoing  laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones, and the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolates, as well as the usefulness of Gram staining of bile at the time of operation. METHODS: Bile samples were obtained from 112 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones and inoculated directly into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles in the operating theatre. Samples were also collected in sterile universal containers for Gram staining of a centrifuged deposit. Isolates were identified and their in-vitro susceptibilities determined by Kirby Bauer technique. RESULTS: Of 112 bile samples examined, 28 (25%) were culture positive, four of which contained more than one organism. The most common organisms isolated were Escherichia coli 9 (28.1%), Enterococcus faecalis 5 (15.6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 (9.4%). In one sample we found Aeromonas hydrophilia and Enterobacter cloacae. No anaerobes were detected but Candida albicans was isolated in one case. In 19 bile samples (67.8%) organisms were identified on Gram stain. Positive bile cultures were found statistically significant (P < 0.05) in patients over the age of 50 (13/32), in patients who developed post-operative fever (6/12) and patients who developed leucocytosis (5/6). CONCLUSION: Age over 50 years was the only significant pre-operative factor associated with positive bile cultures (P < 0.05). In view of the microflora of the gallbladder and the susceptibility pattern of our isolates we would suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis recommended for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones needs to be reviewed and the role of bacteribilia in the surgical management of cholelithiasis requires further study.
TI  - Efficacy of cefepime versus ceftazidime in the treatment of adult pneumonia.
AB  - Effective empiric treatment of pneumonia requires antibiotic coverage against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant isolates. This study evaluated the efficacy of cefepime treatment in 20 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 21 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and ceftazidime treatment in 20 patients with HAP. The mean age of patients was over 70 years. More than half of the patients had multiple lobe involvement. There was no significant difference in the severity of illness according to the acute physiology, age, chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III score between the HAP-cefepime and HAP-ceftazidime group. The most common bacteria isolated from sputum of patients with CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2). In patients with HAP, P. aeruginosa (n = 13), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 11), Serratia marcescens (n = 6), K. pneumoniae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 3), Citrobacter spp. (n = 2), and Escherichia coli (n = 2) were isolated. The cure rates were 95%, 76%, and 60% in the CAP-cefepime group, the HAP-cefepime group, and the HAP-ceftazidime group, respectively. The increased rates of antimicrobial resistance commonly found among isolates causing CAP and HAP indicate that extended-spectrum antimicrobial agents, such as cefepime, would be more appropriate therapeutic agents.
TI  - Novel cefotaximase (CTX-M-16) with increased catalytic efficiency due to substitution Asp-240-->Gly.
AB  - Three clinical strains (Escherichia coli Rio-6, E. coli Rio-7, and Enterobacter cloacae Rio-9) collected in 1996 and 1999 from hospitals in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) were resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and gave a positive double-disk synergy test. Two bla(CTX-M) genes encoding beta-lactamases of pl 7.9 and 8.2 were implicated in this resistance: the bla(CTX-M-9) gene observed in E. coli Rio-7 and E. cloacae Rio-9 and a novel CTX-M-encoding gene, designated bla(CTX-M-16), observed in E. coli strain Rio-6. The deduced amino acid sequence of CTX-M-16 differed from CTX-M-9 only by the substitution Asp-240-->Gly. The CTX-M-16-producing E. coli transformant exhibited the same level of resistance to cefotaxime (MIC, 16 microg/ml) but had a higher MIC of ceftazidime (MIC, 8 versus 1 microg/ml) than the CTX-M-9-producing transformant. Enzymatic studies revealed that CTX-M-16 had a 13-fold higher affinity for aztreonam and a 7.5-fold higher k(cat) for ceftazidime than CTX-M-9, thereby showing that the residue in position 240 can modulate the enzymatic properties of CTX-M enzymes. The two bla(CTX-M-9) genes and the bla(CTX-M-16) gene were located on different plasmids, suggesting the presence of mobile elements associated with CTX-M-encoding genes. CTX-M-2 and CTX-M-8 enzymes were found in Brazil in 1996, and two other CTX-M beta-lactamases, CTX-M-9 and CTX-M-16, were subsequently observed. These reports are evidence of the diversity of CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Brazil.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Inhibition of beta-lactamases by 6,6-bis(hydroxylmethyl)penicillanate.
AB  - beta-Lactamases of classes A and C are the two most prevalent resistant determinants to beta-lactam antibiotics among bacterial pathogens. Both these enzymes pursue different mechanisms for their catalytic processes, highlighted by the fact that the hydrolytic water molecule in each approaches the ester of the intermediary acyl-enzyme species from the opposite ends. 6,6-Bis(hydroxylmethyl)penicillanate was designed as an inhibitor that would impair the approach of the hydrolytic water molecule in either of these enzymes upon formation of the acyl-enzyme species. The design, synthesis, and kinetic evaluation of this inhibitor are disclosed herein.
TI  - Using light scatter signal to estimate bacterial biovolume by flow cytometry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past decade, flow cytometry has become a useful and precise alternative to microscopic bacterial cell counts in aquatic samples. However, little evidence of its usefulness for the evaluation of bacterial biovolumes has emerged in from the literature. METHODS: The light scattering and cell volume of starved bacterial strains and natural bacterial communities from the Black Sea were measured by flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy, respectively, in order to establish a relationship between light scattering and cell volume. RESULTS: With the arc-lamp flow cytometer, forward angle light scatter (FALS) was related to cell size in both the starved strains and natural communities, although regression parameters differed. We tested the predictive capacity of the FALS verous cell size relationship in a bacterial community from the North Sea. That analysis showed that a reliable bacterial biovolume prediction of a natural bacterial community can be obtained from FALS using a model generated from natural bacterial community data. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial biovolume is likely to be related to FALS measurements. It is possible to establish a generally applicable model derived from natural bacterial assemblages for flow cytometric estimation of bacterial biovolumes by light scatter.
TI  - Nosocomial necrotising enterocolitis outbreaks: epidemiology and control measures.
AB  - Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most serious gastrointestinal diseases among newborns and it mainly affects those in intensive care units. The aetiology of the disease has been reported to be multifactorial and both sporadic cases and nosocomial outbreaks have occurred. In this report, we review 17 epidemics of NEC reported in the literature between 1973 and 1999. The number of confirmed cases ranged from 1 to 32 with an average of 10.5 confirmed cases. On average, 16.15% of cases required surgery (range 0-66.6%). The average mortality rate was 6.25% (range 0-87.5%). The mean age at disease onset was 9.5 days (range 6.6-29 days). Most of the infants had low birth weight (median weight 1,395 g; range 1,112-2,788 g, calculated on the reported mean weights). The main risk factors associated with NEC were: low birth weight, low gestational age, low Apgar score, perinatal complications, hyaline membrane disease, and umbilical catheterisation. The bacteria involved often included Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae type 3305573. The causative role of Clostridia in NEC is controversial. With regard to viral agents, coronarovirus, rotavirus and enterovirus, such as echovirus type 22, were isolated during some of the epidemics. The recommended control measures for NEC epidemics are those used for epidemics of other orofaecally transmitted infections. CONCLUSION: Understanding the epidemiology of necrotising enterocolitis is fundamental if adequate preventive control measures are to be developed and applied.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance of coliform isolates from expressed human milk].
AB  - The dispersion of potentially pathogenic, antibiotic-resistant microorganisms via expressed human milk can be considered a risk factor. The aim of this study was to contribute to a better understanding of coliform isolates from expressed human milk and their antimicrobial resistance profiles. The sampling scheme followed a totally randomized design, using 837 samples of expressed human milk. Of these, 71 (8.48%) were identified as contaminated with total coliforms, although in none of the samples did the population exceed 1.0x10(3) MPN/ml. Most of the microorganisms isolated (91.6%) belonged to only two species, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which when subjected to antibiograms, revealed that several strains showed prior resistance to some of the antimicrobials tested. Coliforms may grow in expressed human milk if it is improperly stored, depleting protection factors and reducing the milk's nutritional value.
TI  - Transcriptional regulation of the Enterobacter cloacae UW4 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase gene (acdS).
AB  - Based on DNA sequence analysis and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity, the region of DNA immediately upstream of the Enterobacter cloacae UW4 ACC deaminase gene (acdS) contains several features that appear to be involved in its transcriptional regulation. In the present study, the 5' upstream region of acdS was cloned into the promoter-probe vector, pQF70, which carries the promoterless luciferase gene (luxAB), and luciferase expression was monitored. The data obtained from studying the expression of the luciferase gene showed that (i) a leucine responsive regulatory protein (LRP)-like protein encoded within the upstream region is located on the opposite strand from acdS under the control of a promoter stronger than the one responsible for acdS transcription, (ii) luciferase gene expression required both ACC and the LRP-like protein, (iii) luciferase expression was increased three-fold under anaerobic conditions, consistent with the involvement of a fumarate-nitrate reduction (FNR)-like regulatory protein box within the upstream region, and (iv) the addition of leucine to the growth medium decreased luciferase activity in the presence of ACC and increased luciferase activity in the absence of ACC, consistent with leucine acting as a regulator of the expression of the LRP-like protein.
TI  - Antibiotic selective pressure and development of bacterial resistance.
AB  - This study evaluates the development of resistance in Gram-negative rods to cefotaxime and ceftazidime, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and amikacin, meropenem and ampicillin/sulbactam over a five year period of use (1994-1998) at the University Hospital in Olomouc, Czech Republic. The development of bacterial resistance was linked with antibiotic use and hence selective pressure which was specific for the type of antibiotic and the bacterial species. Statistically significant correlations were found for the use of ofloxacin and resistance in Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Providencia rettgeri; cefotaxime and Enterobacter cloacae; ceftazidime and Acinetobacter spp., Enterobacter agglomerans and Proteus vulgaris; and gentamicin and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - [Activity of cefepime compared with other antibiotics against major hospital bacterial pathogens].
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate susceptibility of 976 bacterial isolates from nosocomial infections to cefepime and 9 other antibiotics used in the treatment of hospitalised patients. Bacterial strains were mainly derived from wound and soft tissue infections, sputum, abscesses and blood. The most prevalent etiologic agents were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), Escherichia coli (13.8%), Staphyloccocus aureus (9.7%, Acinetobacter baumannii (9.12%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.38%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.6%). The most susceptible to cefepime were strains of K. pneumoniae (98.62%), E. coli (98.52%) and E. cloacae (98.19%) including those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. The degree of susceptibility to cefepime was equal to that of imipenem. A. baumannii was the least susceptible species (67.42%). This study indicate that cefepime may play an important role in therapy of nosocomial infections in particular caused by Enterobacteriace.
TI  - H(2)O(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may contribute to inhibition of  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization of oral cavities in newborns.
AB  - In an accompanying report, we showed that viridans group streptococci may prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization of the oral cavities of newborns. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of prevention in vitro. Most viridans group streptococci had bacteriocin-like activity and killed MRSA, Burkholderia cepacia, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Candida albicans were resistant. The activity was induced only by H(2)O(2)-secreting strains and was inhibited by horseradish peroxidase or catalase in a dose-dependent manner. The mean concentration of H(2)O(2) produced by 18 strains of viridans group streptococci (1 x 10(8) cfu in 200 microL of culture medium+/-standard deviation was 1.24+/-0.60 mmol. Viridans group streptococci inhibited MRSA growth in saliva as well as in culture media. These results indicate that H(2)O(2) produced by viridans group streptococci may inhibit MRSA colonization of oral cavities in newborns.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Probiotic activities of Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  - The interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. In this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (Lcr35) were investigated. Using intestinal Caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. The inhibitory effects of Lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. A decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with Lcr35. Moreover, the antibacterial activities of cell-free Lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, ETEC, EPEC, K. pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Clostridium difficile. The growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. Together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.
TI  - Identification of a non-haem catalase in Salmonella and its regulation by RpoS (sigmaS).
AB  - We report the identification and functional analysis of katN, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium. katN, which is not present in Escherichia coli, is located between the yciGFE and yciD E. coli homologues in the Salmonella genome. Its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 Da and is similar to the Mn-catalases of Lactobacillus plantarum and Thermus spp. Its product, KatN, was visualized as a 37 kDa protein in E. coli maxicells. A KatN recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its C-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. KatN was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. Its expression was shown to be regulated by growth phase and rpoS. Northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream yciGFE genes. A putative rpoS-regulated promoter was identified upstream of yciG. Southern blotting revealed that katN is conserved within Salmonella serovars. katN homologues were found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. A katN mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) response of Salmonella. However, the expression of katN increased the H2O2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpoS mutants in stationary phase. Thus, KatN may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in Salmonella in certain environmental conditions.
TI  - Interaction of bladder glycoprotein GP51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE: A major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein GP51 (molecular weight 51 kD.). GP51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. GP51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Increased urinary GP51 occurs during urinary tract infection. To elucidate the role of GP51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ELISA was performed to demonstrate the binding of GP51 and various uropathogens. Immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to GP51 to determine the interaction of GP51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. Infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize GP51. Antigen inhibition ELISA was done to quantitate urinary GP51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. RESULTS: ELISA revealed that GP51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. Immunochemical methods confirmed that purified GP51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. Clinical specimens showed GP51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial cells. We observed a significant increase in urinary GP51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that GP51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolone photodegradation products determined by parallel-line bioassay and high performance liquid chromatography.
AB  - The fluoroquinolones produce multiple photodegradation products. Little is known  about these products, particularly whether any possess antimicrobial activity. To investigate this, we used the parallel-line bioassay to investigate discrepancies in zone of inhibition size in conjunction with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. A continuous flow photochemical reaction unit ('Beam-Boost') was used to partially photodegrade the fluoroquinolones ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin (0.02 mM) by between 15 and 89%, as confirmed by HPLC. The concentration of residual parent fluoroquinolone in each irradiated sample was measured by HPLC and a non-irradiated control solution was prepared at the same concentration. These were compared by parallel-line bioassays using Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca. With ofloxacin and levofloxacin, the zone size for the control solution was significantly less than that of the irradiated solutions, with >15% photodegradation in at least two of the indicator organisms, indicating that the photodegradation products possess antimicrobial activity. No difference was seen with ciprofloxacin at any level of photodegradation with any of the indicator organisms, nor with moxifloxacin at 30 and 54% photodegradation. A significant difference was observed with E. cloacae only, at 83% photodegradation.
TI  - Phenotypic resistance of Staphylococcus aureus, selected Enterobacteriaceae, and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa after single and multiple in vitro exposures to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin.
AB  - The phenotypic resistance of selected organisms to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin was defined as a MIC of > or =4 microg/ml. The dynamics of resistance were studied after single and sequential drug exposures: clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were utilized. After a single 48-h exposure of a large inoculum to four times the initial MIC for the organism, the frequency of selection of resistant mutants of MSSA was greater for trovafloxacin than levofloxacin (P = 0.008); for E. cloacae, the frequency was highest for ciprofloxacin and lowest for levofloxacin and trovafloxacin; for S. marcescens, the frequency was highest for trovafloxacin and lowest for ciprofloxacin (P = 0.003). The results of serial passage experiments were analyzed both by the Kaplan-Meier product-limited method as well as by analysis of variance of mean inhibitory values. By both methods, MSSA and MRSA expressed mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin after fewer passages than were required for either levofloxacin or trovafloxacin. For the aerobic gram-negative bacilli, two general patterns emerged. Mutants resistant to trovafloxacin appeared sooner and reached higher mean MICs than did mutants resistant to levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin appeared later and reached mean MICs lower than the MICs of the other two drugs studied. Even though individual strain variation occurred, the mean MICs were reproduced when the serial passage experiment was repeated using an identical panel of E. coli isolates. In summary, the dynamic selection of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria can be demonstrated in experiments that employ serial passage of bacteria in vitro.
TI  - Extension of resistance to cefepime and cefpirome associated to a six amino acid  deletion in the H-10 helix of the cephalosporinase of an Enterobacter cloacae clinical isolate.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae CHE, a clinical strain with overproduced cephalosporinase was found to be highly resistant to the new cephalosporins, cefepime and cefpirome (MICs> or =128 microg ml(-1)). The strain was isolated from a child previously treated with cefepime. The catalytic efficiency of the purified enzyme with the third-generation cephalosporins, cefepime and cefpirome, was 10 times higher than that with the E. cloacae P99 enzyme. This was mostly due to a decrease in K(m) for these beta-lactams. The clinical isolate produced large amounts of the cephalosporinase because introduction of the ampD gene decreased ampC expression and partially restored the wild-type phenotype. Indeed, MICs of cefepime and cefpirome remained 10 times higher than those for a stable derepressed clinical isolate (OUDhyp) transformed with an ampD gene. Sequencing of the ampC gene showed that 18 nucleotides had been deleted, corresponding to the six amino acids SKVALA (residues 289--294). According to the crystal structure of P99 beta-lactamase, this deletion was located in the H-10 helix. The ampR-ampC genes from the clinical isolates CHE and OUDhyp were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli JM101. The MICs of cefpirome and cefepime of E. coli harboring ampC and ampR genes from CHE were 100--200 times higher than those of E. coli harboring ampC and ampR genes from OUDhyp. This suggests that the deletion, confirmed by sequencing of the ampC gene, is involved in resistance to cefepime and cefpirome. However, the high level of resistance to cefepime and cefpirome observed in the E. cloacae clinical isolate was due to a combination of hyperproduction of the AmpC beta-lactamase and structural modification of the enzyme. This is the first example of an AmpC variant conferring resistance to cefepime and cefpirome, isolated as a clinical strain.
TI  - The in vitro activity of sulbactam combined with third generation cephalosporins  against third generation cephalosporin-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam combined with cefuroxime, cefotaxime or ceftazidime in the ratio of 1:1 was studied against ceftazidime- or cefuroxime-resistant Gram-negative rods and Staphylococcus aureus. Sulbactam enhanced the antibacterial activities of cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime against Gram-negative rods. The MIC(90) of ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reduced 4-fold and that of cefotaxime against E. coli, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Acinetobacter spp. reduced by 2-4-fold. However, sulbactam did not enhance the activities of cefuroxime, cefotaxime or ceftazidime against S. aureus, enterococci and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. With the combination of sulbactam and ceftazidime at the ratio of 1:1, 38.4% of E. coli, 45.3% of E. cloacae, 66.6% of C. freundii and 60% of Acinetobacter spp. initially resistant to ceftazidime became susceptible.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties and mode of action of the pyrrothine holomycin.
AB  - Holomycin, a member of the pyrrothine class of antibiotics, displayed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, inhibiting a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antibiotic lacked activity against the eukaryotic microorganisms Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida kefyr. Holomycin exhibited a bacteriostatic response against Escherichia coli that was associated with rapid inhibition of RNA synthesis in whole cells. Inhibition of RNA synthesis could have been a secondary consequence of inhibiting tRNA aminoacylation, thereby inducing the stringent response. However, the levels of inhibition of RNA synthesis by holomycin were similar in a stringent and relaxed pair of E. coli strains that were isogenic except for the deletion of the relA gene. This suggests that inhibition of RNA synthesis by holomycin could reflect direct inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Examination of the effects of holomycin on the kinetics of the appearance of beta-galactosidase in induced E. coli cells was also consistent with inhibition of RNA polymerase at the level of RNA chain elongation. However, holomycin only weakly inhibited E. coli RNA polymerase in assays using synthetic poly(dA-dT) and plasmid templates. Furthermore, inhibition of RNA polymerase was observed only at holomycin concentrations in excess of those required to inhibit the growth of E. coli. It is possible that holomycin is a prodrug, requiring conversion in the cell to an active species that inhibits RNA polymerase.
TI  - Exoproteinases of the type A in pathogenesis of insect bacterial diseases.
AB  - Immune inhibitors produced in infected larvae of Galleria mellonella by such entomopathogens as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora effectively blocked in vitro bactericidal activity of insect haemolymph against Escherichia coli D31, both in Galleria mellonella and Pieris brassicae pupae previously vaccinated with Enterobacter cloacae. Even at a trace concentration, the extracellular proteinases, by proteolytic degradation, totally destroyed the activity of cecropin peptides from Galleria and cecropin-like and attacin-family proteins from Pieris, but no ability to destroy antibacterial activity was shown by extracts obtained from Galleria larvae killed by massive doses of bacterial saprophytes. It is suggested that by blocking antibacterial immune response of the host, the proteinases help the bacteria to multiply in the haemolymph, thus they could be considered an important factor in the pathogenesis of bacterial diseases of insects.
TI  - Identification of DNA sequences that regulate the expression of the Enterobacter  cloacae UW4 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase gene.
AB  - Analysis of the DNA sequence upstream of the previously isolated Enterobacter cloacae UW4 ACC deaminase gene (Shah et al. 1998) suggests that this segment contains several features that are thought to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. These features include half of a CRP (cAMP receptor protein) binding site, an FNR (fumarate-nitrate reduction) regulatory protein binding site, an LRP (leucine responsive regulatory protein) binding site, and an LRP-like protein coding region. ACC deaminase activity was measured following growth of either various Escherichia coli strains carrying a plasmid that contained the Enterobacter cloacae UW4 ACC deaminase gene, or of Enterobacter cloacae UW4. Variables that were compared include aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, the presence and absence of ACC in the growth medium, addition of leucine to the medium, and bacterial strains that did or did not contain either lrp or fnr genes. The data reported are consistent with the involvement of most, if not all, of the above mentioned potential regulatory regions in the expression of ACC deaminase.
TI  - Conserved regulatory elements of the promoter sequence of the gene rpoH of enteric bacteria.
AB  - The rpoH regulatory region of different members of the enteric bacteria family was sequenced or downloaded from GenBank and compared. In addition, the transcriptional start sites of rpoH of Yersinia frederiksenii and Proteus mirabilis, two distant members of this family, were determined. Sequences similar to the sigma(70) promoters P1, P4 and P5, to the sigma(E) promoter P3 and to boxes DnaA1, DnaA2, cAMP receptor protein (CRP) boxes CRP1, CRP2 and box CytR present in Escherichia coli K12, were identified in sequences of closely related bacteria such as: E.coli, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In more distant bacteria, Y.frederiksenii and P.mirabilis, the rpoH regulatory region has a distal P1-like sigma(70) promoter and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(E)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. Sequences similar to the regulatory boxes were not identified in these bacteria. This study suggests that the general pattern of transcription of the rpoH gene in enteric bacteria includes a distal sigma(70) promoter, >200 nt upstream of the initiation codon, and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(E)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. A second proximal sigma(70) promoter under catabolite-regulation is probably present only in bacteria closely related to E.coli.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of the integron-located VEB-1 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in nosocomial enterobacterial isolates in Bangkok, Thailand.
AB  - Over a 21/2-month period in 1999, 37 ceftazidime-resistant nonrepetitive enterobacterial isolates were collected from 37 patients in a Bangkok hospital, Thailand. Eighty-one percent of these strains expressed a clavulanic acid-inhibited extended-cephalosporin resistance profile. An identical extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), VEB-1, was found in 16 unrelated enterobacterial isolates (Escherichia coli, n = 10; Enterobacter cloacae, n = 2; Enterobacter sakazakii, n = 1; and Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 3) and in two clonally related E. cloacae isolates. The bla(VEB-1) gene was located on mostly self-conjugative plasmids (ca. 24 to 200 kb) that conferred additional non-beta-lactam antibiotic resistance patterns. Additionally, the bla(VEB-1) gene cassette was part of class 1 integrons varying in size and structure. The bla(VEB-1)-containing integrons were mostly associated with bla(OXA-10)-like and arr-2-like gene cassettes, the latter conferring resistance to rifampin. These data indicated the spread of bla(VEB-1) in Bangkok due to frequent transfer of different plasmids and class 1 integrons and rarely to clonally related strains. Plasmid- and integron-mediated resistance to rifampin was also found in enterobacterial isolates.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities against five enterobacterial species.
AB  - After oral administration of 500 mg of levofloxacin to 12 volunteers, we investigated the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) against five strains of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Pharmacokinetic data were as follows: maximum concentration in serum, 6.36 +/- 0.57 mg/liter; area under the concentration-time curve, 43.6 +/- 6.23 mg. h/liter; elimination half-life 4.23 +/- 0.87 h. SBAs were present for 24 h against Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii. The SBAs at 1, 12, and 24 h after administration against E. coli were 1:108, 1:29, and 1:7, respectively, and those against Citrobacter freundii were 1:74, 1:25, and 1:7, respectively. The SBAs were present for 12 h against the other three organisms tested. The SBAs against Serratia marcescens were 1:28 and 1:9 at 1 and 12 h, respectively; the SBAs against Klebsiella pneumoniae were 1:25 and 1:7 at 1 and 12 h, respectively; and the SBAs against Enterobacter cloacae were 1:24 and 1:10 at 1 and 12 h, respectively.
TI  - Detection and distribution of insertion sequence 1 (IS1)-containing bacteria in the freshwater environment(1).
AB  - The distribution of insertion sequence 1 (IS1)-containing bacteria was investigated in Windermere (Cumbria, UK), a freshwater body impacted by treated sewage discharge and run-off from the surrounding catchment. Culturable IS1-containing bacteria were recovered from the water column at three depths in Windermere North Basin (WNB) and South Basin (WSB), and from sediment at both sites (at the sediment surface in WSB and to a depth of 12-13 cm in WNB). Polymerase chain reaction amplification of IS1 and the Escherichia coli/Shigella sp. specific gene uidA, from community DNA from shallow sediments, extended the detection limit beyond that of culture at both sites. This detection was extended further into deep sediment extracted from WNB as IS1 and uidA were detected in sub-samples to a depth of 4.7 and 2.3 m, respectively. Analysis of a representative subset of 90 IS1-carrying isolates recovered from water and sediment at both sites demonstrated 21 heterogeneous IS1 profiles with estimated copy numbers ranging from 1 to 16. Identification of the host bacteria showed that the element was confined mainly to Enterobacter spp. However, this study showed IS1 to be present in Citrobacter freundii for the first time. Plasmids were carried by 75.3% of enterobacterial isolates and four plasmids (2.6%) carried IS1. DNA sequence analysis of five IS1 clones demonstrated that IS1 isoforms from this study were similar (>89% nucleotide identity) to known IS1 isoforms. Two isoforms of IS1 from a single Enterobacter cloacae isolate differed by 6.7% at the nucleotide level suggesting that they had been acquired independently.
TI  - Use of oleic acid to reduce the population of the bacterial flora of poultry skin.
AB  - The effect of oleic acid on native bacterial flora of poultry skin was examined.  Skin from commercial broiler carcasses was washed once or twice in solutions of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10% (wt/vol) oleic acid and rinsed in peptone water. Aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, and enterococci in the rinsates were enumerated. Significantly fewer aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, and enterococci were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in oleic acid than from control samples. Additionally, fewer bacteria were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in higher concentrations of oleic acid than from skin washed in lower concentrations of the fatty acid. In most cases, there was no significant difference in the number of bacteria recovered from rinsates of skin washed once or twice in solutions of oleic acid. Washing skin samples twice in 10% solutions of oleic acid significantly reduced the number of aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, and enterococci that remained attached to the skin. Campylobacter sp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes isolates possessed the least resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid in vitro, while Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed higher resistance. Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus lentus, and Salmonella Typhimurium had the greatest resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid. Findings indicate that oleic acid reduces the number of bacteria on the skin of processed broilers and that the fatty acid is bactericidal to several spoilage and pathogenic bacteria associated with poultry.
TI  - Microbial evaluation of Spanish potato omelette and cooked meat samples in University restaurants.
AB  - The focus of this study was to evaluate the microbial quality of Spanish potato omelette and cooked meat samples including pork loin, chicken croquettes, long pork sausage, chicken breast, and meatballs from University restaurants. Microbiological analyses of Spanish potato omelette and cooked meat samples resulted in aerobic plate counts from <1.00 to 2.90 and from <1.00 to 6.04 log10 CFU g(-1), respectively. Total coliforms ranged from <3 to 43 most probable number (MPN) g(-1) and from <3 to >2,400 MPN g(-1) for Spanish potato omelette and meat products, respectively. Escherichia coli, coagulase-positive staphylococci, and Lancefield group-D streptococci were detected in 1.7%, 3.5%, and 12.9% of Spanish potato omelette samples, respectively. For cooked meat samples, 8.8%, 7.6%, and 24.6% contained E. coli, coagulase-positive staphylococci, and Lancefield group-D streptococci, respectively. E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. were not detected. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia spp. were isolated from Spanish potato omelette samples. For cooked meat samples, C. freundii, E. cloacae, and Aeromonas hydrophila were detected. The results suggest that some handling practices should require more attention, and as a consequence, a hazard analysis and critical control point program should be developed and implemented.
TI  - Enhancement of neonatal innate defense: effects of adding an N-terminal recombinant fragment of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein on growth and tumor necrosis factor-inducing activity of gram-negative bacteria tested in neonatal cord blood ex vivo.
AB  - Innate defense against microbial infection requires the action of neutrophils, which have cytoplasmic granules replete with antibiotic proteins and peptides. Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) is found in the primary granules of adult neutrophils, has a high affinity for lipopolysaccharides (or "endotoxins"), and exerts selective cytotoxic, antiendotoxic, and opsonic activity against gram-negative bacteria. We have previously reported that neutrophils derived from newborn cord blood are deficient in BPI (O. Levy et al., Pediatrics 104:1327-1333, 1999). The relative deficiency in BPI of newborns raised the possibility that supplementing the levels of BPI in plasma might enhance newborn antibacterial defense. Here we determined the effects of addition of recombinant 21-kDa N-terminal BPI fragment (rBPI(21)) on the growth and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inducing activity of representative gram-negative clinical isolates. Bacteria were tested in citrated newborn cord blood or adult peripheral blood. Bacterial viability was assessed by plating assay, and TNF-alpha release was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Whereas adult blood limited the growth of all isolates except Klebsiella pneumoniae, cord blood also allowed logarithmic growth of Escherichia coli K1/r and Citrobacter koseri. Bacteria varied in their susceptibility to rBPI(21)'s bactericidal action: E. coli K1/r was relatively susceptible (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)], approximately 10 nM), C. koseri was intermediate (IC(50), approximately 1,000 nM), Klebsiella pneumoniae was resistant (IC(50), approximately 10,000 nM), and Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens were highly resistant (IC(50), >10,000 nM). All isolates were potent inducers of TNF-alpha activity in both adult and newborn cord blood. In contrast to its variable antibacterial activity, rBPI(21) consistently inhibited the TNF-inducing activity of all strains tested (IC(50), 1 to 1,000 nM). The antibacterial effects of rBPI(21) were additive with those of a combination of conventional antibiotics typically used to treat bacteremic newborns (ampicillin and gentamicin). Whereas ampicillin and gentamicin demonstrated little inhibition of bacterially induced TNF release, addition of rBPI(21) either alone or together with ampicillin and gentamicin profoundly inhibited release of this cytokine. Thus, supplementing newborn cord blood with rBPI(21) potently inhibited the TNF-inducing activity of a variety of gram-negative bacterial clinical pathogens and, in some cases, enhanced bactericidal activity. These results suggest that administration of rBPI(21) may be of clinical benefit to neonates suffering from gram-negative bacterial infection and/or endotoxemia.
TI  - Antigen 43 from Escherichia coli induces inter- and intraspecies cell aggregation and changes in colony morphology of Pseudomonas fluorescens.
AB  - Antigen 43 (Ag43) is a surface-displayed autotransporter protein of Escherichia coli. By virtue of its self-association characteristics, this protein is able to mediate autoaggregation and flocculation of E. coli cells in static cultures. Additionally, surface display of Ag43 is associated with a distinct frizzy colony morphology in E. coli. Here we show that Ag43 can be expressed in a functional form on the surface of the environmentally important Pseudomonas fluorescens strain SBW25 with ensuing cell aggregation and frizzy colony types. Using green fluorescence protein-tagged cells, we demonstrate that Ag43 can be used as a tool to provide interspecies cell aggregation between E. coli and P. fluorescens. Furthermore, Ag43 expression enhances biofilm formation in P. fluorescens to glass surfaces. The versatility of this protein was also reflected in Ag43 surface display in a variety of other gram-negative bacteria. Display of heterologous Ag43 in selected bacteria might offer opportunities for rational design of multispecies consortia where the concerted action of several bacterial species is required, e.g., waste treatment and degradation of pollutants.
TI  - Characteristics of neonatal bacterial meningitis in a teaching hospital in Taiwan from 1984-1997.
AB  - During the period from 1984 to 1997, 85 bacterial meningitis neonates with positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures were treated. The ages of these patients ranged from 1 to 28 days. The male to female ratio was 1.7 to 1. The most common causative agent was group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (GBS, 31.8%), followed by Escherichia coli (20%), Proteus mirabilis (7.1%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.9%), other streptococci excluding Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.9%), Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (5.9%), enterococci (4.7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). Among the 85 patients treated, 51 (60%) were younger than 7 days old. Among them, dyspnea was the most common clinical manifestation. In contrast, fever and diarrhea were seen more frequently in neonates with late onset of disease (after seven days of age). Ampicillin and cefotaxime were the most commonly used antibiotics. The most frequently encountered complications were hydrocephalus and seizures. Since 1991, GBS has overtaken E. coli as the leading cause of neonatal bacterial meningitis. This was accompanied by a fall in the mortality rate, but a sustained high incidence of complications and sequelae. The results of this study highlight the importance of developing strategies to prevent group B streptococcal infection.
TI  - Assessment of the microbiological quality and wash treatments of lettuce served in University restaurants.
AB  - One hundred and forty-four samples of lettuce from 16 University restaurants were analyzed. The mesophilic aerobic counts of all samples ranged from 3.01 to 7.81 log10 CFU g(-1). Results of total coliforms ranged from < 0.47 to > 3.38 log10 most probable number (MPN) g(-1). Of the lettuce samples, 25.7% harbored Escherichia coli, 22.9% Staphylococcus aureus and 84% group D streptococci. Similarly, 10.4% of the samples harbored Aeromonas hydrophila, 2.8% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and coliforms such as 14.6% Citrobacter freundii, 8.3% Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4.2% Enterobacter cloacae and 1.4% Providencia spp. Salmonella, Shigella and E. coli O157:H7 were not detected. When sodium hypochlorite or potassium permanganate solutions were used in washing procedures, the aerobic microorganisms were reduced by more than two log units, and total coliforms by at least one log.
TI  - Kombucha fermentation and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Kombucha was prepared in a tea broth (0.5% w/v) supplemented with sucrose (10% w/v) by using a commercially available starter culture. The pH decreased steadily from 5 to 2.5 during the fermentation while the weight of the "tea fungus" and the OD of the tea broth increased through 4 days of the fermentation and remained fairly constant thereafter. The counts of acetic acid-producing bacteria and yeasts in the broth increased up to 4 days of fermentation and decreased afterward. The antimicrobial activity of Kombucha was investigated against a number of pathogenic microorganisms. Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella sonnei, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Yersinia enterolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermis, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Helicobacterpylori, and Listeria monocytogenes were found to be sensitive to Kombucha. According to the literature on Kombucha, acetic acid is considered to be responsible for the inhibitory effect toward a number of microbes tested, and this is also valid in the present study. However, in this study, Kombucha proved to exert antimicrobial activities against E. coli, Sh. sonnei, Sal. typhimurium, Sal. enteritidis, and Cm. jejuni, even at neutral pH and after thermal denaturation. This finding suggests the presence of antimicrobial compounds other than acetic acid and large proteins in Kombucha.
TI  - A primitive T cell-independent mechanism of intestinal mucosal IgA responses to commensal bacteria.
AB  - The immunoglobulin A (IgA) is produced to defend mucosal surfaces from environmental organisms, but host defenses against the very heavy load of intestinal commensal microorganisms are poorly understood. The IgA against intestinal commensal bacterial antigens was analyzed; it was not simply "natural antibody" but was specifically induced and responded to antigenic changes within an established gut flora. In contrast to IgA responses against exotoxins, a significant proportion of this specific anti-commensal IgA induction was through a pathway that was independent of T cell help and of follicular lymphoid tissue organization, which may reflect an evolutionarily primitive form of specific immune defense.
TI  - Meropenem versus imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of sepsis in Chinese patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meropenem and imipenem are beta-lactam antibiotics of the carbapenem  group. Carbapenems have bactericidal activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including most gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes. Experience in using meropenem in Chinese patients has not been previously reported. METHODS: Meropenem (2 g daily) and imipenem/cilastatin (2 g daily) were compared in an open, randomized, prospective study on the treatment of hospitalized Chinese septic patients. All participants (male or female) were hospitalized with a diagnosis of sepsis. All patients were randomly allocated to one of the two treatment groups: the meropenem group or the imipenem/cilastatin group. Clinical status was evaluated daily during treatment and at the end of therapy or when treatment was withdrawn. Patients were checked every day for potential side-effects, according to subjective and objective symptoms. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were enrolled in the study; 50 were evaluated for clinical efficacy and 27 patients were evaluated for bacteriologic efficacy. The most frequent clinical diagnoses were pneumonia and urinary tract infection. The predominant pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. There were 31 pathogens isolated from 27 patients. A single pathogen was identified in 23 patients, and two pathogens were isolated from four patients. Satisfactory clinical outcome (excellent and good) was 84% in the meropenem group and 76% in the imipenem/cilastatin group. Satisfactory bacteriologic response was 80% in the meropenem group and 75% in the imipenem/cilastatin group. Transiently elevated liver enzymes were the most common side-effect. One patient treated with imipenem/cilastatin experienced a seizure during the study, while another patient treated with meropenem withdrew due to urticaria. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and safety data presented in this report indicate that meropenem was well tolerated and appeared to be as effective as standard monotherapy with imipenem in bacteremic patients. Meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin were highly effective for the treatment of bacteremia in Chinese patients and only mild or negligible side-effects were noted.
TI  - Rapid discriminatory detection of genes coding for SHV beta-lactamases by ligase  chain reaction.
AB  - Ligase chain reaction (LCR) is a recently developed technique that employs a thermostable ligase and allows for the discrimination of DNA sequences differing in only a single base pair. The method has been adapted and applied to differentiation of bla(SHV) genes. We have developed an LCR typing method to characterize point mutations in genes for SHV-derived extended-spectrum beta-lactamases with four different sets of biotinylated LCR primers. To evaluate the applicability of the current technique, we tested seven Escherichia coli strains producing SHV-1, SHV-2, SHV-2a, SHV-3, SHV-4, SHV-5, and SHV-12. With the LCR typing, seven SHV genes can be distinguished according to their incorporating point mutations. In an attempt to characterize SHV beta-lactamases by LCR typing in clinical isolates, 46 strains carrying bla(SHV) genes (32 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 Enterobacter cloacae, and 4 E. coli) were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing, isoelectric focusing, and LCR typing. LCR typing allowed the characterization of beta-lactamases, and genotypes obtained by LCR typing were in accordance with phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance profile and pI value of beta-lactamase. Therefore, we concluded that LCR typing may permit defining the SHV families with simplicity and reliability and can be applied to the detailed characterization and molecular epidemiology of SHV-type beta-lactamases.

AB  
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - pK(a) calculations for class C beta-lactamases: the role of Tyr-150.
AB  - The Poisson-Boltzmann method was used to compute the pK(a) values of titratable residues in a set of class C beta-lactamases. In these calculations, the pK(a) of the phenolic group of residue Tyr150 is the only one to stand out with an abnormally low value of 8.3, more than one pK(a) unit lower than the measured reference value for tyrosine in solution. Other important residues of the catalytic pocket, such as the conserved Lys67, Lys315, His314, and Glu272 (hydrogen-bonded to the ammonium group of Lys315), display normal protonation states at neutral pH. pK(a) values were also computed in catalytically impaired beta-lactamase mutants. Comparisons between the relative k(cat) values and the Tyr150 pK(a) value in these mutants revealed a striking correlation. In active enzymes, this pK(a) value is always lower than the solution reference value while it is close to normal in inactive enzymes. These results thus support the hypothesis that the phenolate form of Tyr150 is responsible for the activation of the nucleophilic serine. The possible roles of Lys67 and Lys315 during catalysis are also discussed.
TI  - [Prevalence of bacterial contamination of standard platelet units: prospective study].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet concentrates contaminated with bacteria are a main source of transfusion-associated sepsis. Several studies have reported a very wide incidence (0-10%) of contamination. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of bacterial contamination of standard platelet units at the regional blood transfusion center in Casablanca. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: During 15.5 months, 3,458 platelet concentrates (PCs) were analysed. The plasma from the bag and the tube was homogenised. One-fifth of the tube contents were inoculated every day for five days in two tubes containing 2.5 mL of Tryptic soy broth. One tube was incubated at room temperature and the other at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. The bacteria were identified by standard procedures. RESULTS: Twenty-five (0.72%) of 3,458 platelet bags were contaminated. Twenty-two bacteria (88%) were found in the platelet bags stored three days or more, of which 14 (56%) were Staphylococci coagulase negative, two Staphylococcus aureus, one alpha-haemolytic Streptococcus, four bacillus cereus, one Enterobacter cloacae, one Escherichia Coli and two Xanthomonas maltophilia. CONCLUSION: The incidence reported in this series is higher than that reported by most authors.
TI  - Field investigations of bacterial contaminants and their effects on extended porcine semen.
AB  - Field investigations (n=23) were made over a 3-yr period at North American boar studs and farms in which the primary complaint was sperm agglutination in association with decreased sperm longevity of extended semen, and increased regular returns to estrus and/or vaginal discharges across parity. Microscopic examination of extended semen from these units revealed depressed gross motility (usually <30%), sperm agglutination, and sperm cell death occurring within 2 d of semen collection and processing regardless of the semen extender used. The extended semen exhibited a high number of induced acrosome abnormalities (>20%). Sample pH was acidic (5.7 to 6.4) in 93% of the submitted samples. Aerobic culture yielded a variety of bacteria from different genera. A single bacterial contaminant was obtained from 66% of the submitted samples (n=37 doses); 34% contained 2 or more different bacterial genera. The most frequently isolated contaminant bacteria from porcine extended semen were Alcaligenes xylosoxydans (n=3), Burkholderia cepacia (n=6), Enterobacter cloacae (n=6), Escherichia coli (n=6), Serratia marcescens (n=5), and Stenotrophomonas [Xanthomonas] maltophilia (n=6); these 6 bacteria accounted for 71% of all contaminated samples, and were spermicidal when re-inoculated and incubated in fresh, high quality extended semen. All contaminant bacteria were found to be resistant to the aminoglycoside gentamicin, a common preservative antibiotic used in commercial porcine semen extenders. Eleven genera were spermicidal in conjunction with an acidic environment, while 2 strains (E. coli, S. maltophilia) were spermicidal without this characteristic acidic environment. Bacteria originated from multiple sources at the stud/farm, and were of animal and nonanimal origin. A minimum contamination technique (MCT) protocol was developed to standardize hygiene and sanitation. This protocol focused on MCT's during boar preparation, semen collection, semen processing and laboratory sanitation. Implementation of the MCT, in addition to specific recommendations in stud management, resulted in the control of bacterial contamination in the extended semen.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against 873 clinical isolates from respiratory tract, urinary tract and surgical infections during 1997-1998 in Japan.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gatifloxacin was determined for 873 isolates from various infections during 1997-1998 in Japan. Gatifloxacin was active against streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, with MIC(90)s of </=0.39 mg/L. The activity was two- to 32-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, and comparable to that against Gram-negative bacteria. Gatifloxacin was more active than the other quinolones against quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. It also had good activity against penicillin- or macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae.
TI  - Comparative aspects of the diffusion of norfloxacin, cefepime and spermine through the F porin channel of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - In Enterobacteriaceae, the permeability of the outer membrane to hydrophilic antibiotics is associated with the presence of pore-forming proteins. We tested the diffusion of the fluoroquinolone norfloxacin in four Enterobacter cloacae strains: a clinical isolate and three derivatives variously producing or lacking the D and F porins. We analysed the entry of norfloxacin into E. cloacae cells in the presence of either the polyamine spermine or the recently developed cefepime, which are known to penetrate through the Escherichia coli OmpF porin. Uptake of the fluoroquinolone was decreased in both cases; the initial rate of penetration decreased as more spermine blocked the channel. Our results indicate that, like beta-lactam molecules, fluoroquinolones translocate through the outer membrane via the F porin and that cefepime and norfloxacin entries are polyamine-sensitive. This suggests that the closure of the F porin channel by polyamines might modulate the susceptibility of E. cloacae to both fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin antibiotics.
TI  - Treatment of sanitary-important bacteria by bacteriocin substance V24 in cattle dung water.
AB  - Quantification of sanitary-important bacteria (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae), as well  as indicators of environmental contamination, was assessed in samples of cattle dung from 25 cattle farms in 15 north-eastern Slovakia districts. The inhibitory effect of crude bacteriocin extract CBE V24 from Enterococcus faecalis V24 against Listeria monocytogenes Ohio and Yersinia enterocolitica YE85 was examined in cattle dung water with the aim of finding a new way of eliminating the health risk of the animal slurry. The following bacterial groups were quantified: Salmonella spp., Shigella-like spp. , Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp. , Escherichia coli, Listeria spp., staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci (the average count ranged from 102 up to 104 cfu ml-1). Antagonistic effect of the crude bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecalis V24 in the range of 100-600 Arbitrary units per ml (AU ml-1) was shown against the following bacteria: Enterobacter cloacae, Ent. asburiae, Proteus spp., Salmonella spp., Acinetobacter lwoffi, L. monocytogenes as well as Y. enterocolitica YE85. During tests performed to study the inhibitory effect of the crude bacteriocin CBE V24 (concentration 800, 1600 AU ml-1) against L. monocytogenes Ohio and Y. enterocolitica YE85 in experimentally contaminated cattle dung, a reduction of 2.03 and 1.44 log cfu ml-1, respectively, was already noted after 1 h after crude bacteriocin CBE V24 addition.
TI  - [Detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases producing Enterobacteriaceae in feces].
AB  - A study was made of 366 feces for detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases  producing Enterobacteriaceae from feces. The selective agar was used for modified drigalski agar (Eiken Chemical Co., LTD) with 2 micrograms/ml cefotaxime (ESBL screen agar). 92 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, 41 Escherichia coli, 15 Citrobacter freundii, 13 Enterobacter cloacae, 11 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other 12, were isolated from ESBL screen agar. And, R-plasmid that were selected by 2 micrograms/ml cefotaxime were transferred by conjugation from two of the 92 strains. These strain were E. coli TH9809927 and Proteus mirabilis TH9808262 that were amplified by "Toho-1 type" primer. The clude enzyme from two strains (donor) and transconjugants were especially hydrolysed cepharoridine and cefotaxime. Accordingly, two strains (0.5%) were detected as ESBL producers. We think that the result of our survey suggests the increase of ESBLs producing bacterial infection in Japan, and believe that there is a trend of infection of its by surveilance of the feces.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence of Tn10.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of Tn10 has been determined. The dinucleotide signature and percent G+C of the sequence had no discontinuities, indicating that Tn10 constitutes a homogeneous unit. The new sequence contained three new open reading frames corresponding to a glutamate permease, repressors of heavy metal resistance operons, and a hypothetical protein in Bacillus subtilis. The glutamate permease was fully functional when expressed, but Tn10 did not protect Escherichia coli from the toxic effects of various metals.
TI  - An antibiotic policy to prevent emergence of resistant bacilli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fear of infection in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) often leads to early use of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, a strategy that selects for resistant bacteria. We investigated whether the emergence of resistant strains could be halted by modifying the empiric antibiotic regimens to remove the selective pressure that favours resistant bacteria. METHODS: Two identical NICUs were assigned to different empiric antibiotic regimens. On unit A, penicillin G and tobramycin were used for early-onset septicaemia, flucloxacillin and tobramycin were used for late-onset septicaemia, and no broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics, such as amoxicillin and cefotaxime were used. In unit B, intravenous amoxicillin with cefotaxime was the empiric therapy. After 6 months of the study the units exchanged regimens. Rectal and respiratory cultures were taken on a weekly basis. FINDINGS: There were 436 admissions, divided equally between the two regimens (218 in each). Three neonates treated with the penicillin-tobramycin regimen became colonised with bacilli resistant to the empirical therapy used versus 41 neonates on the amoxicillin-cefotaxime regimen (p<.0001). The relative risk for colonisation with strains resistant to the empirical therapy per 1000 patient days at risk was 18 times higher for the amoxicillin-cefotaxime regimen compared with the penicillin-tobramycin regimen (95% CI 5.6-58.0). Enterobacter cloacae was the predominant bacillus in neonates on the amoxicillin-cefotaxime regimen, whereas Escherichia coli predominated in neonates on the penicillin-tobramycin regimen. These colonisation patterns were also seen when the units exchanged regimens. INTERPRETATION: Policies regarding the empiric use of antibiotics do matter in the control of antimicrobial resistance. A regimen avoiding amoxicillin and cefotaxime restricts the resistance problem.
TI  - Type I nitroreductases in soil enterobacteria reduce TNT (2,4,6,-trinitrotoluene) and RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine).
AB  - Many enteric bacteria express a type I oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase, which reduces nitro groups on many different nitroaromatic compounds under aerobic conditions. Enzymatic reduction of nitramines was also documented in enteric bacteria under anaerobic conditions. This study indicates that nitramine reduction in enteric bacteria is carried out by the type I, or oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase, rather than a type II enzyme. The enteric bacterium Morganella morganii strain B2 with documented hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) nitroreductase activity, and Enterobacter cloacae strain 96-3 with documented 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) nitroreductase activity, were used here to show that the explosives TNT and RDX were both reduced by a type I nitroreductase. Morganella morganii and E. cloacae exhibited RDX and TNT nitroreductase activities in whole cell assays. Type I nitroreductase, purified from E. cloacae, oxidized NADPH with TNT or RDX as substrate. When expression of the E. cloacae type I nitroreductase gene was induced in an Escherichia coli strain carrying a plasmid, a simultaneous increase in TNT and RDX nitroreductase activities was observed. In addition, neither TNT nor RDX nitroreductase activity was detected in nitrofurazone-resistant mutants of M. morganii. We conclude that a type I nitroreductase present in these two enteric bacteria was responsible for the nitroreduction of both types of explosive.
TI  - New beta -lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP-I) from Streptomyces exfoliatus SMF19 and its roles on the morphological differentiation.
AB  - A new beta-lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP-I) from Streptomyces exfoliatus SMF19 was purified and characterized. The molecular mass of BLIP-I was estimated to be 17.5 kDa by gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography. The N-terminal sequence was NH(2)-Asn-Ser-Gly-Phe-Ser-Ala-Glu-Lys-Tyr-Glu-Gln-Ile-Gln-Phe-Gly. BLIP-I inhibited Bacto(R) Penase (Difco), and plasmid encoded TEM-1 beta-lactamase, whereas it did not inhibit Enterobacter cloacae beta-lactamases. The K(i) value of BLIP-I against TEM-1 beta-lactamase was determined to be 0.047 nm. The gene (bliA) encoding BLIP-I protein was identified by screening a genomic library using an oligonucleotide probe with a sequence based on the N-terminal sequence of BLIP-I. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed that the gene was 558 base pairs in length and encoded a mature protein of 157 amino acid residues preceded by a 29-amino acid signal sequence. Pairwise comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence showed 38% identity with BLIP of Streptomyces clavuligerus. Furthermore, the 49th amino acid residue of BLIP-I was identical to Asp-49 of BLIP that was characterized to be an important residue for the inhibitory activity of BLIP. A modified BLIP-I in which Asp-49 was replaced by alanine (D49A) was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. The inhibitory activities of recombinant (r) BLIP-I and its D49A mutant derivative, expressed in Escherichia coli, were compared. The K(i) value of rBLIP-I against TEM-1 beta-lactamase was similar to that of wild-type BLIP-I, but the D49A mutation increased the K(i) of rBLIP-I inhibition approximately 200-fold. A disruption mutant of the bliA gene in S. exfoliatus SMF19 was obtained by replacing the wild-type bliA gene with a copy inactivated by inserting a hygromycin resistance gene. The disruption mutant showed a bald phenotype, indicating that the bliA gene plays a role in morphological differentiation.
TI  - Three-year surveillance study of nosocomial bacterial resistance in Argentina. The Antimicrobial Committee; and the National Surveillance Program (SIR) Participants Group.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A national surveillance program (SIR) was introduced in 1996 in Argentina by the Antimicrobial Committee of the Argentinean Society for Microbiology to assess bacterial resistance. The present study reports the rates of nosocomial bacterial resistance found by this program. METHODS: A 2-month point-prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (i.e., April-May and October-November) from 1996 to 1998, by 27 Argentinean centers. Susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method following the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: In all, 6343 isolates recovered from 5603 inpatients (> or =48-hr hospitalization) were included. Methicillin resistance was 58% and 56% in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), respectively. Although no vancomycin resistance was found in staphylococci, 2% and 8% of the S. aureus and CNS strains, respectively, proved resistant to teicoplanin. No ampicillin resistance was displayed by Enterococcus faecalis. High-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance in enterococci were 33% and 37%, respectively. Acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci emerged in 1997 (2%). Imipenem resistance in Acinetobacter spp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9% and 21%, respectively. Among Enterobacteriaceae, 1% and 5% of the Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively, proved resistant to imipenem. Ceftazidime and cefepime resistance was found in 63% and 33% of the E. cloacae strains. Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was shown by 48%, 26%, and 8% of the K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli isolates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The alarming rates of resistance found in this study provide compelling evidence of the need for more rational use of antimicrobial agents in Argentina.
TI  - The nose as bacterial reservoir: important differences between the vestibule and  cavity.
AB  - The difference between the spectra of potential bacterial pathogens (PBPs) in the nasal vestibule and cavity has not been taken into account in clinical studies. PURPOSE: Since one can anticipate different flora in different kinds of mucosae, the authors compared bacterial species in the vestibule with those of the cavity. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: A total of 534 healthy male clerical workers in a downtown Lucerne office building were examined with fractionated swabs. RESULTS: PBPs, notably Staphylococcus aureus, were found in 412 subjects and surprisingly, differences in flora of the two sites were noted in 130 of them: PBPs were observed in the vestibule and not in the cavity in 85 of the subjects, and in 45 of them, the reverse was true. CONCLUSION: The practical implications of these findings are considerable regarding infection control in patients at increased infection risk.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - [In vitro activity of biapenem (BIPM) against clinically isolated respiratory pathogens in 1996-1998].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of biapenem (BIPM), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was compared with those of imipenem (IPM), panipenem (PAPM), meropenem (MEPM), ceftazidime (CAZ) and piperacillin (PIPC) against 280 isolates of 9 respiratory pathogens. The MIC90s of biapenem (BIPM) for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.12, 32, 0.25, 0.06, 4 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. In comparison with other antibiotics, the activity of biapenem (BIPM) for P. aeruginosa was as potent as meropenem (MEPM), but for H. influenzae it was slightly less than those of other antibiotics, and for other respiratory pathogens it was as potent as those of other antibiotics. The MIC90s of biapenem (BIPM) for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens were 0.06, 1, 1, 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively, and which were equal to or somewhat lower than those of other antibiotics. Biapenem (BIPM) showed strong activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, especially P. aeruginosa in general. Based on these results, biapenem (BIPM) is seemed to be highly useful antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory infections with several organism.
TI  - ampR gene mutations that greatly increase class C beta-lactamase activity in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - The ampC and ampR genes of Enterobacter cloacae GN7471 were cloned into pMW218 to yield pKU403. Four mutant plasmids derived from pKU403 (pKU404, pKU405, pKU406, and pKU407) were isolated in an AmpD mutant of Escherichia coli ML4953 by selection with ceftazidime or aztreonam. The beta-lactamase activities expressed by pKU404, pKU405, pKU406, and pKU407 were about 450, 75, 160, and 160 times higher, respectively, than that expressed by the original plasmid, pKU403. These mutant plasmids all carried point mutations in the ampR gene. In pKU404 and pKU405, Asp-135 was changed to Asn and Val, respectively. In both pKU406 and pKU407, Arg-86 was changed to Cys. The ease of selection of AmpR mutations at a frequency of about 10(-6) in this study strongly suggests that derepressed strains, such as AmpD or AmpR mutants, could frequently emerge in the clinical setting.
TI  - Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in a consecutive collection of clinical isolates of Enterobacter spp. The abilities of various screening methods to detect ESBLs in enterobacters were simultaneously tested. Among the 68 consecutive isolates (56 Enterobacter cloacae and 12 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates) that were analyzed for beta-lactamase content, 21 (25 and 58%, respectively) possessed transferable ESBLs with pIs of 8.2 and phenotypic characteristics of SHV-type enzymes, 8 (14.3%) of the E. cloacae isolates produced a previously nondescribed, clavulanate-susceptible ESBL that exhibited a pI of 6.9 and that conferred a ceftazidime resistance phenotype on Escherichia coli transconjugants, and 2 E. cloacae isolates produced both of these enzymes. Among the total of 31 isolates that were considered ESBL producers, the Vitek ESBL detection test was positive for 2 (6.5%) strains, and the conventional double-disk synergy test (DDST) with amoxicillin-clavulanate and with expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam was positive for 5 (16%) strains. Modifications of the DDST consisting of closer application of the disks (at 20 instead of 30 mm), the use of cefepime, and the use of both modifications increased the sensitivity of this test to 71, 61, and 90%, respectively. Of the 37 isolates for which isoelectric focusing failed to determine ESBLs, the Vitek test was false positive for 1 isolate and the various forms of DDSTs were false-positive for 3 isolates.
TI  - Viresin. A novel antibacterial protein from immune hemolymph of Heliothis virescens pupae.
AB  - Immune hemolymph was collected from fifth instar larvae and 1-day-old pupae of Heliothis virescens after injection of prepupae with live Enterobacter cloacae. Induction of antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli K12 D31 was 7.5 times greater in pupal than in larval immune hemolymph. Lysozyme activity of immune pupal hemolymph against Micrococcus lysodeikticus was 11 times greater when compared with lysozyme activity of immune larval hemolymph. Early pupal immune response with regard to antibacterial activity was much greater than larval immune response in H. virescens. Normal pupal hemolymph showed an increase in antibacterial activity and lysozyme that was induced during metamorphosis. Antibacterial protein was isolated together with lysozyme by gel filtration chromatography and then separated from lysozyme by sequential electrophoresis with a native acid gel and SDS gel. Molecular mass of antibacterial protein was estimated to be 12 kDa. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of 12-kDa protein was different from those of antibacterial molecules found in other insects and has not been identified before. A sample containing 12-kDa protein was negative for immunoblotting with anti-synthetic cecropin B antibody. We have named the novel 12-kDa antibacterial protein viresin. Viresin showed antibacterial activity against several Gram-negative bacteria including E. cloacae but not against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan, 1998.
AB  - For the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. Besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. We re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. The most common isolates were Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among hospital-acquired infections, Acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. The oxacillin resistance of S. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. Among Enterococcus spp., 85% were either E. faecalis or E. faecium. They were 14% resistant to vancomycin. Among gram-negative bacteria, K. pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. This difference was less apparent in the case of Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa. These bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. Fifty-one percent of Salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Isolates from the East were least resistant. Plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against S. aureus, ciprofloxacin against E. coli, and ciprofloxacin against Salmonella spp. These findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.
TI  - Intestinal protozoa in HIV-infected patients: effect of rifaximin in Cryptosporidium parvum and Blastocystis hominis infections.
AB  - In HIV-1 infected patients severe enteritis and chronic diarrhea are often documented as a consequence of multiple opportunistic infections. We analyzed 48 HIV-1 positive patients for the presence of intestinal pathogenic protozoa. Patients with CD4 > or = 200/mm3 showed a higher prevalence of a single pathogenic protozoa than patients with CD4 < or =200/mm3, who showed the presence of multiple protozoal infections. Patients who proved positive for only a single protozoa, Cryptosporidium or Blastocystis, were also positive, by stool culture, for the presence of Proteus mirabilis (3 samples), Citrobacter freundii (3 samples), Escherichia coli (one sample) or Enterobacter cloacae (one sample). Treatment with rifaximin (600 mg, 3 times a day, for 14 days) was efficacious in resolving the clinical symptoms and clearing protozoan infections in HIV-1 infected patients with CD4 > or = 200/mm3, who presented enteric and systemic symptoms due to Criptosporidium or Blastocystis associated with enteropathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Convenient test for screening metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria by using thiol compounds.
AB  - A simple disk diffusion test was constructed for detection of IMP-1-type metallo-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. Two Kirby-Bauer disks containing ceftazidime (CAZ) and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor were used in this test. Several IMP-1 inhibitors such as thiol compounds including 2-mercaptopropionic acid, heavy metal salts, and EDTA were evaluated for this test. Two CAZ disks were placed on a Mueller-Hinton agar plate on which a bacterial suspension was spread according to the method recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The distance between the disks was kept to about 4 to 5 cm, and a filter disk containing a metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitor was placed near one of the CAZ disks within a center-to-center distance of 1.0 to 2.5 cm. For IMP-1-producing strains, the growth-inhibitory zone between the two disks expanded, while no evident change in the shape of the growth-inhibitory zone was observed for CAZ-resistant strains producing serine beta-lactamases such as AmpC or SHV-12. As a result, 2 to 3 microliter of undiluted 2-mercaptopropionic acid or mercaptoacetic acid able to block IMP-1 activity gave the most reproducible and clearest results, and CAZ-resistant strains producing AmpC or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were distinguishable from IMP-1 producers by this test. A similar observation was made with IMP-1-producing clinical isolates such as Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter spp., and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. The specificity and sensitivity of this test were comparable to those of PCR analysis using bla(IMP)-specific primers. Therefore, this convenient test would be valuable for daily use in clinical laboratories.
TI  - Microbiological spectrum of septicemia and peritonitis in nephrotic children.
AB  - From April 1993 to December 1997, 452 admissions of 231 children with nephrotic syndrome to Chang Gung Children's Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. There were 10 episodes of sepsis and 8 episodes of peritonitis in 18 children, and 14 microorganisms were cultured. Two children died due to Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis. Gram-positive microorganisms (n=7) and Gram-negative microorganisms (n=7) were found in equal numbers. Enterococcus (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), group D streptococcus (1), and Streptococcus viridans (1) were the Gram-positive microorganisms cultured. Two of 4 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis were penicillin resistant. Gram-negative microorganisms included Enterobacter cloacae (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Escherichia coli (2), Acinetobacter baumannii (1), Neisseria meningitidis (1), and group B salmonella (1). The last three microorganisms have not been previously associated with nephrotic children. Vancomycin therapy to cover penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and a third-generation cephalosporin therapy to cover rare Gram-negative microorganisms should be considered in serious infections of nephrotic children.
TI  - Role of penicillin-binding proteins in the initiation of the AmpC beta-lactamase  expression in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are involved in the regulation of beta-lactamase expression by determining the level of anhydromuramylpeptides in the periplasmatic space. It was hypothesized that one or more PBPs act as a sensor in the beta-lactamase induction pathway. We have performed induction studies with Escherichia coli mutants lacking one to four PBPs with DD-carboxypeptidase activity. Therefore, we conclude that a strong beta-lactamase inducer must inhibit all DD-carboxypeptidases as well as the essential PBPs 1a, 1b, and/or 2.
TI  - Comparison of five beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial pathogens using the time above MIC at different creatinine clearances.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T>MIC) for five parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics against common nosocomial bacterial pathogens at different creatinine clearances (Clcr). INTERVENTIONS: Serum concentration-time profiles were simulated for cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem at Clcr ranging from 120-30 ml/minute. The MIC data for 90% of organisms (MIC90) were collected for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and a weighted geometric mean MIC90 was calculated. The T>MIC was calculated as percentage of the dosing interval in which free concentrations exceeded the weighted geometric mean MIC90. A T>MIC of 70% or greater was considered desirable for all organisms except S. aureus (> or = 50%). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cefepime 2 g every 12 hours (Clcr > or = 70 ml/min) and every 24 hours (Clcr < or = 60 ml/min) achieved desirable T>MIC for all Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus at every Clcr. Imipenem 0.5 g achieved desirable T>MIC for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. freundii, and S. aureus at every Clcr. However, imipenem T>MIC was less than 70% for the following regimens and organisms: S. marcescens 0.5 g every 6 hours (Clcr > or = 90 ml/min), E. aerogenes 0.5 g every 6 hours (Clcr > or = 80 ml/min), E. cloacae 0.5 g every 6 hours (Clcr > or = 100 ml/min), S. marcescens 0.5 g every 8 hours (Clcr 60-70 ml/min), E. cloacae 0.5 g every 8 hours (Clcr 60-70 ml/min), and E. aerogenes 0.5 g every 8 hours (Clcr 50-70 ml/min). Ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours (Clcr 60-100 ml/min) and every 12 hours (Clcr 40-50 ml/min) achieved desirable T>MIC for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. aureus only. At every dose and Clcr, piperacillintazobactam achieved desirable T>MIC for S. aureus but not for any Enterobacteriaceae at Clcr > 50 ml/minute. Piperacillin did not achieve desirable T>MIC for any organism, and none of the beta-lactams attained a T>MIC of 70% or above for P. aeruginosa at any Clcr. CONCLUSION: At every Clcr, cefepime achieved a desirable T>MIC for more nosocomial pathogens than any other beta-lactam evaluated. Based on pharmacodynamic data, cefepime is an appropriate empiric choice for treatment of nosocomial infections. However, when P. aeruginosa is a potential pathogen, empiric combination therapy should be considered.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adult post-neurosurgical patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM) in adult postneurosurgical patients. METHODS: Thirty adult patients with GNBM were included in this study. Their clinical features, laboratory data, prognostic factors, and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. The patients were 22 males and 8 females, aged 17-72 years. Seven had community-acquired infections and 23 had nosocomial infections. Two patients were associated with brain abscess. RESULTS: The pathogens found in the 30 GNBM patients were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella species, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, and some rare pathogens including Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis. Among these 30 patients, 8 patients with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant GNBM were identified since 1994; all infections were nosocomially acquired. Appropriate antibiotics were given to 22 patients. Eight patients did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy. All eight died. The mortality rate in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 14%. CONCLUSIONS: There has been an increase of GNBM in postneurosurgical patients in recent years. In addition, the emergence of strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in this specific group of patients has also been noted in recent years, and has become a great therapeutic challenge. We noted many prognostic factors in postneurosurgical patients in this study; however, appropriate antibiotic therapy and initial consciousness level are the most significant ones. Therefore, in cases of postneurosurgical patients with nosocomially acquired GNBM, the possibility of third-generation cephalosporin resistance should be strongly suspected. Early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is needed in this potentially fatal disease.
TI  - The complexed structure and antimicrobial activity of a non-beta-lactam inhibitor of AmpC beta-lactamase.
AB  - Beta-lactamases are the major resistance mechanism to beta-lactam antibiotics and pose a growing threat to public health. Recently, bacteria have become resistant to beta-lactamase inhibitors, making this problem pressing. In an effort to overcome this resistance, non-beta-lactam inhibitors of beta-lactamases were investigated for complementarity to the structure of AmpC beta-lactamase from Escherichia coli. This led to the discovery of an inhibitor, benzo(b)thiophene-2-boronic acid (BZBTH2B), which inhibited AmpC with a Ki of 27 nM. This inhibitor is chemically dissimilar to beta-lactams, raising the question of what specific interactions are responsible for its activity. To answer this question, the X-ray crystallographic structure of BZBTH2B in complex with AmpC was determined to 2.25 A resolution. The structure reveals several unexpected interactions. The inhibitor appears to complement the conserved, R1-amide binding region of AmpC, despite lacking an amide group. Interactions between one of the boronic acid oxygen atoms, Tyr150, and an ordered water molecule suggest a mechanism for acid/base catalysis and a direction for hydrolytic attack in the enzyme catalyzed reaction. To investigate how a non-beta-lactam inhibitor would perform against resistant bacteria, BZBTH2B was tested in antimicrobial assays. BZBTH2B significantly potentiated the activity of a third-generation cephalosporin against AmpC-producing resistant bacteria. This inhibitor was unaffected by two common resistance mechanisms that often arise against beta-lactams in conjunction with beta-lactamases. Porin channel mutations did not decrease the efficacy of BZBTH2B against cells expressing AmpC. Also, this inhibitor did not induce expression of AmpC, a problem with many beta-lactams. The structure of the BZBTH2B/AmpC complex provides a starting point for the structure-based elaboration of this class of non-beta-lactam inhibitors.
TI  - An outbreak of gram-negative bacteremia in hemodialysis patients traced to hemodialysis machine waste drain ports.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate an outbreak of gram-negative bacteremias at a hemodialysis center (December 1, 1996-January 31, 1997). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. Reviewed infection control practices and maintenance and disinfection procedures for the water system and dialysis machines. Performed cultures of the water and dialysis machines, including the waste-handling option (WHO), a drain port designed to dispose of saline used to flush the dialyzer before patient use. Compared isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. SETTING: A hemodialysis center in Maryland. RESULTS: 94 patients received dialysis on 27 machines; 10 (11%) of the patients had gram-negative bacteremias. Pathogens causing these infections were Enterobacter cloacae (n = 6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and Escherichia coli (n = 2); two patients had polymicrobial bacteremia. Factors associated with development of gram-negative bacteremias were receiving dialysis via a central venous catheter (CVC) rather than via an arterio-venous shunt (all 10 infected patients had CVCs compared to 31 of 84 uninfected patients, relative risk [RR] undefined; P<.001) or dialysis on any of three particular dialysis machines (7 of 10 infected patients were exposed to the three machines compared to 20 of 84 uninfected patients, RR = 5.8; P = .005). E cloacae, P aeruginosa, or both organisms were grown from cultures obtained from several dialysis machines. WHO valves, which prevent backflow from the drain to dialysis bloodlines, were faulty in 8 (31%) of 26 machines, including 2 of 3 machines epidemiologically linked to case-patients. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of available dialysis machine and patient E cloacae isolates were identical. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that WHO ports with incompetent valves and resultant backflow were a source of cross-contamination of dialysis bloodlines and patients' CVCs. Replacement of faulty WHO valves and enhanced disinfection of dialysis machines terminated the outbreak.
TI  - Interference with murein turnover has no effect on growth but reduces beta-lactamase induction in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Physiological studies of a mutant of Escherichia coli lacking the three lytic transglycosylases Slt70, MltA, and MltB revealed that interference with murein turnover can prevent AmpC beta-lactamase induction. The triple mutant, although growing normally, shows a dramatically reduced rate of murein turnover. Despite the reduction in the formation of low-molecular-weight murein turnover products, neither the rate of murein synthesis nor the amount of murein per cell was increased. This might be explained by assuming that during growth in the absence of the major lytic transglycosylases native murein strands are excised by the action of endopeptidases and directly reused without further breakdown to muropeptides. The reduced rate of murein turnover could be correlated with lowered cefoxitin-induced expression of beta-lactamase, present on a plasmid carrying the ampC and ampR genes from Enterobacter cloacae. Overproduction of MltB stimulated beta-lactamase induction, whereas specific inhibition of Slt70 by bulgecin repressed ampC expression. Thus, specific inhibitors of lytic transglycosylases can increase the potency of penicillins and cephalosporins against bacteria inducing AmpC-like beta-lactamases.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacteria in Mexico.
AB  - Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins within members of the family Enterobacteriaceae occurs virtually world-wide. Nevertheless, nothing was known about this problem among isolates from Mexico. To address this issue, we studied oximino-cephalosporin resistant isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (13), Escherichia coli (7), and Enterobacter cloacae (23) recovered from patients in Mexico City hospitals during 1990 to 1992. In the presence of clavulanic acid, these strains increased susceptibility to cefotaxime and ceftazidime (MIC90 64 and >256 microg/ml, respectively). The ability of these isolates to transfer resistance to both antibiotics by conjugation was most successfully demonstrated by K. pneumoniae. In all the clinical isolates tested, the largest plasmid coded for the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). Characteristics of pI, by isoelectric focusing (IEF)/bioassay and DNA hybridization with specific probes of TEM and SHV, indicated that in most of the clinical isolates and all transconjugates, the most frequent beta-lactamase coded were SHV-derived (20 strains as 41% of isolates) and a plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase (12 strains as 25% of isolates) (with a pI of >8.2), which is not related to TEM/SHV. Apparently, isolates from Mexico show characteristics similar to isolates from other geographic areas. The type of beta-lactamases coded in these resistant isolates is documented for the first time in Mexico.
TI  - The distribution of enteric bacteria from Australian mammals: host and geographical effects.
AB  - Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 642 mammalian hosts, representing 16 families and 79 species, collected from throughout Australia. Escherichia coli was the most common of the 24 enteric species recovered and represented almost half of the isolates. Association analysis revealed that most other species of bacteria were less likely to be recovered from hosts in which E. coli was present. The composition of the enteric community of a host was found to be determined by both the taxonomic family to which the host belonged and the geographical area from which the host was collected. Hosts collected from the northern areas of Queensland and the Northern Territory had more diverse enteric communities than hosts collected from New South Wales or Western Australia. Hosts of the families Petauridae and Vespertilionidae had more diverse enteric communities than did members of the Macropodidae or Phalangeridae. The probability of occurrence of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Hafnia alvei, Klebsiella oxytoca and K. pneumoniae in a host was found to vary with respect to host family and/or host locality. The non-random distribution of these species demonstrates the presence of extensive population structure and may suggest the existence of adaptations specific to both the primary and secondary habitats of these enteric bacteria.
TI  - Etiology of serious infections in young Gambian infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including The Gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. The study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in Gambian infants younger than 91 days old. METHODS: At a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid. At a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. RESULTS: There were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Escherichia coli (1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (1), Streptococcus agalactiae (1) and Salmonella spp. (1). Six of these children died. Thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (17), S. pneumoniae (3), Salmonella spp. (5), E. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and S. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were investigated for common respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza A in 46, influenza B in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. Of these 184 (58%) were positive for S. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for H. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. Infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die, whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. CONCLUSIONS: The most important causes of serious infections in young Gambian infants are Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae and Salmonella spp.
TI  - Characteristics of pathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitals in North America: results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 1997.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common and involves pathogens with changing susceptibility patterns. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program evaluates international pathogen incidence patterns to detect and manage the emergence of resistant strains. We describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns among 1617 pathogens recovered from UTIs during the third-quarter of 1997 in North America (United States and Canada), as part of this worldwide program. The isolates were tested against more than 50 antimicrobial agents (20 reported) by reference broth microdilution methods, and selected isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and automated ribotyping. The five most frequently isolated species were Escherichia coli (48.6%), Enterococcus spp. (13.7%), Klebsiella spp. (12.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.2%), and Enterobacter spp. or Proteus mirabilis (3.8% each). For each nation, imipenem and cefepime produced the widest spectrum of coverage among the beta-lactams and amikacin was best among the aminoglycosides. For Gram-negative species, high resistance among beta-lactam antimicrobial agents was noted especially for various penicillins against E. coli (37.9% to 42.8%) and for the cephalosporins tested against enterococci (99.4% and 100%). Approximately 7.0% of enterococci in the USA were vancomycin-resistant (88% with Van A). P. aeruginosa provided the most consistent levels of resistance, but the following agents were most active against these organisms: amikacin (96.6 to 97.4% susceptible), tobramycin (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin/tazobactam (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin (89.5 to 96.6%), imipenem (89.7 to 92.1%), cefepime (77.6 to 89.7%), and ceftazidime (82.9 to 86.2%). E. coli (2.2 to 2.7%), K. pneumoniae (6.2 to 6.4%), and a single Enterobacter cloacae strain produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; and five other Enterobacter spp. were likely to have expressed chromosomally mediated (Amp C) Stably derepressed cephalosporinases with associated resistance to ceftazidime (16.7 to 21.2% resistance). These data demonstrated that several UTI isolates in SENTRY hospitals have high levels of resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents with little evidence of clonal dissemination.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - Glycosylation of the Enterobacter cloacae outer membrane protein OmpX in eukaryotic cells.
AB  - The topological model of the Enterobacter cloacae outer membrane protein OmpX showed three putative glycosylation sites. When OmpX was expressed in bacteria that were cultured under aerated conditions, no glycosylation was observed. The coupling of carbohydrate chains to the ompX gene product was also investigated in the eukaryotic baculovirus expression system. For this purpose, a recombinant ompX gene-containing baculovirus was made. Infection of insect cells with this recombinant virus resulted in the production of sufficient amounts of OmpX to study glycosylation. In this system, all potential N-glycosylation sites of OmpX were utilized. Furthermore, it became clear that glycosylated OmpX was retained in the insect cells and was not secreted in the medium. Given the fact that OmpX plays a role in the invasion of E. cloacae in rabbit enterocytes, glycosylation of this protein occurring only under specific conditions may be involved in this process.
TI  - Impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  - Evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. However, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. From 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of Acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens to 22 agents. Linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. Only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing D, decreasing %S) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing D, increasing %S). The mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing D, decreasing %S and decreasing D, increasing %S relationships. Multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.
TI  - Penetration of beta-lactamase inhibitors into the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The effectiveness of a beta-lactamase inhibitor/beta-lactam combination against Gram-negative pathogens depends on many interplaying factors, one of which is the penetration of the inhibitor across the outer membrane. In this work we have measured the relative penetrations of clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam and BRL 42715 into two strains of Escherichia coli producing TEM-1 beta-lactamase, two strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing either TEM-1 or K-1, and two strains of Enterobacter cloacae each producing a Class C beta-lactamase. It was shown that clavulanic acid penetrated the outer membranes of all these strains more readily than the other beta-lactamase inhibitors. For the strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae clavulanic acid penetrated approximately 6 to 19 times more effectively than tazobactam, 2 to 9 times more effectively than sulbactam and 4 to 25 times more effectively than BRL 42715. The superior penetration of clavulanic acid observed in this study is likely to contribute to the efficacy of clavulanic acid/beta-lactam combinations in combating beta-lactam resistant bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-negative bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (FOM) and Citrobacter freundii. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (MINO). While Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (CMZ). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-negative bacilli. However, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST), CMZ, latamoxef (LMOX), gentamicin (GM) and amikacin (AMK) showed good activities against some of the Gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. In conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,241 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1996. The results were as follows: Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae and showed low activities against MRSA. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ampicillin and piperacillin. The carbapenems showed high activities against Haemophilis influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Enterobacter cloacae. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains of Serratia marcescens were detected. The antibacterial activity of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable to that of CAZ, and there were some resistant strains.
TI  - In vitro activity of clinafloxacin against fluoroquinolone resistant Spanish clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of clinafloxacin against 162 ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates was determined. Isolates were selected when their MIC to ciprofloxacin was 2 mg/l (intermediate) or > 2 mg/l (resistant). The following strains were tested: 61 Escherichia coli, 12 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Proteus mirabilis, 21 Serratia marcescens, 4 Enterobacter cloacae, 21 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21 Staphylococcus. aureus (resistant to methicillin) and 15 Enterococcus spp. Clinafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin activities were evaluated by agar dilution using Mueller-Hinton agar according to NCCLS recommendations. Of the 162 isolates, 16 (9.8%) were intermediate and 146 (90.1%) resistant to ciprofloxacin. 95 of the 162 strains (58.6%) were susceptible, 27 (16.7%) intermediately susceptible, and 40 strains (24.7%) were resistant to clinafloxacin. The percentage susceptible to clinafloxacin was 65.6% for E. coli, 75% for K. pneumoniae, 71.4% for P. mirabilis, 28.6% for S. marcescens, 75% for E. cloacae, 33.3% for P. aeruginosa, 90.5% for S. aureus and 40% for Enterococcus spp. Clinafloxacin was active against 58.6% of the ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates tested. It was particularly active against S. aureus strains resistant to both ciprofloxacin and methicillin.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of six broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents tested against over 2,000 clinical isolates from 22 medical centers in Japan. Japan Antimicrobial Resistance Study Group.
AB  - Numerous broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents have been introduced into medical practice since 1985. Although several of these compounds have advanced, infectious disease therapy resistances to them has also emerged world-wide. In 1997, a Japanese 22 medical center investigation was initiated to assess the continued utility of these agents (oxacillin or piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, cefoperazone/sulbactam [C/S], imipenem). The participating medical centers represented a wide geographic distribution, and a common protocol and reagents were applied. Three control strains and a set of challenge organisms were provided to participant centers. Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) strips were used in concurrent tests of these organisms and a qualitative determination of participant skills in the identification of resistant and susceptible phenotypes was established. The quantitative controls demonstrated 97.7-99.2% of MIC values within established QC limits, and the qualitative (susceptibility category) controls documented a 97.3% agreement of participant results with that of reference values (1,320 total results). Only 0.2% of values were false-susceptible errors. After the participant quality was assured, a total of 2,015 clinical strains were tested (10 strains from 10 different organism groups including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci [CoNS], Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., indole-positive Proteae, Serratia spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The staphylococci were uniformly susceptible to all drugs tested except ceftazidime (MIC90, 24 micrograms/ml) that had a potency six- to 12-fold less than either cefepime or cefpirome. Only 3.7 and 45.1% of S. aureus and CoNS were susceptible to ceftazidime, respectively. Among E. coli and Klebsiella spp. the rank order of antimicrobial spectrum was imipenem = "fourth-generation" cephalosporins > ceftazidime > C/S > piperacillin. Possible extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotypes were identified in 2.9-8.6% of these isolates. Isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteae, and Serratia spp. that were resistant to ceftazidime and piperacillin remained susceptible to imipenem (0.0-4.5% resistance) and cefepime (0.0-5.0%). Acinetobacters were inhibited best by C/S (99.5% susceptible) and least susceptible to piperacillin (MIC90, > 256 micrograms/ml; 21.7% susceptible) activity. P. aeruginosa isolates were most susceptible to cefepime (83.6%) and this zwitterionic cephalosporin also had the lowest level of resistance (9.1% of MICs at > or = 32 micrograms/ml). Several multi-resistant organisms were identified in participant medical centers including S. marcescens strains resistant to cefepime, imipenem, or both observed in six hospitals. Clonal spread was documented in two medical centers; one hospital having two distinct epidemic clusters. Also a multi-resistant E. cloacae was found in two patients in the same hospital. Evaluations of carbapenem resistance in four species discovered only two strains (in same hospital) among 40 P. aeruginosa isolates (5.0%) with a metallo-enzyme, with nearly all of the remaining strains inhibited by an Ambler Class C enzyme inhibitor (BRL42715) indicating a hyperproduction of a chromosomal cephalosporinase. These results indicate that most newer beta-lactams remain widely useable in medical centers in Japan, but emerging often clonal, resistances have occurred. The overall rank order of antimicrobial spectrum against all ten tested bacterial groups favors the "fourth-generation" cephalosporin, cefepime (96.4% susceptible) as an equal to imipenem (95.9%) > C/S (90.9%) = cefpirome (90.0%) > ceftazidime (75.1%) = penicillins, either oxacillin or piperacillin (76.4%).
TI  - Efficacy of beta-lactam and inhibitor combinations in a diffusion chamber model in rabbits.
AB  - Using a diffusion chamber in rabbits, we evaluated therapy with the combination of ceftriaxone plus the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam in comparison with ceftriaxone alone. One sensitive and one resistant strain of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were inoculated into one of the six diffusion chambers, implanted in the same animal. In order to simulate pharmacokinetics in humans, both substances were administered in decreasing doses. Ceftriaxone was given 0, 2, 4 and 6 h after infection in dosages of 45, 35, 25 and 15 mg/kg of body weight, while tazobactam was administered either in one dose at 0 h, or divided into two doses at 0 and 1 h or 0 and 4 h, or divided into three doses at 0, 1 and 4 h after infection. The ratio of ceftriaxone:tazobactam was fixed at 8:1. Ceftriaxone, in combination with tazobactam, given in one dose immediately after infection showed a significant reduction in bacterial count. All other combinations of ceftriaxone and tazobactam did not differ from ceftriaxone in monotherapy. Co-administration of the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam significantly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against all three tested species.
TI  - Use of microdilution panels with and without beta-lactamase inhibitors as a phenotypic test for beta-lactamase production among Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens.
AB  - Over the past decade, a number of new beta-lactamases have appeared in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae that, unlike their predecessors, do not confer beta-lactam resistance that is readily detected in routine antibiotic susceptibility tests. Because optimal methodologies are needed to detect these important new beta-lactamases, a study was designed to evaluate the ability of a panel of various beta-lactam antibiotics tested alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors to discriminate between the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC beta-lactamases, high levels of K1 beta-lactamase, and other beta-lactamases in 141 isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens possessing well-characterized beta-lactamases. The microdilution panels studied contained aztreonam, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, with and without 1, 2, and 4 microg of clavulanate per ml or 8 microg of sulbactam per ml and cefoxitin and cefotetan with and without 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. The results indicated that a minimum panel of five tests would provide maximum separation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase high AmpC, high K1, and other beta-lactamase production in Enterobacteriaceae. These included cefpodoxime, cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and ceftriaxone plus 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. Ceftriaxone plus 2 microg of clavulanate per ml could be substituted for cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml without altering the accuracy of the tests. This study indicated that tests with key beta-lactam drugs, alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, could provide a convenient approach to the detection of a variety of beta-lactamases in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Role of pfkA and general carbohydrate catabolism in seed colonization by Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae A-11 is a transposon mutant of strain 501R3 that was deficient in cucumber spermosphere colonization and in the utilization of certain carbohydrates (D. P. Roberts, C. J. Sheets, and J. S. Hartung, Can. J. Microbiol. 38:1128-1134, 1992). In vitro growth of strain A-11 was reduced or deficient on most carbohydrates that supported growth of strain 501R3 but was unaffected on fructose, glycerol, and all amino acids and organic acids tested. Colonization by strain A-11 was significantly reduced (P </= 0.05) for cucumber and radish seeds compared to that of strain 501R3, but colonization of pea, soybean, sunflower, and sweet corn seeds was not reduced. Pea seeds released several orders of magnitude more total carbohydrates and amino acids than cucumber and radish seeds and approximately 4,000-fold more fructose. Fructose was the only carbohydrate detected in the seed exudates which supported wild-type levels of in vitro growth of strain A-11. Soybean, sunflower, and sweet corn seeds also released significantly greater amounts of fructose and total carbohydrates and amino acids than cucumber or radish seeds. The exogenous addition of fructose to cucumber and radish seeds at quantities similar to the total quantity of carbohydrates released from pea seeds over 96 h increased the populations of strain A-11 to levels comparable to those of strain 501R3 in sterile sand. Molecular characterization of strain A-11 indicated that the mini-Tn5 kanamycin transposon was inserted in a region of the genome with significant homology to pfkA, which encodes phosphofructo kinase. A comparison of strain A-11 with Escherichia coli DF456, a known pfkA mutant, indicated that the nutritional loss phenotypes were identical. Furthermore, the pfkA homolog cloned from E. cloacae 501R3 complemented the nutritional loss phenotypes of both E. coli DF456 and E. cloacae A-11 and restored colonization by strain A-11 to near wild-type levels. These genetic and biochemical restoration experiments provide strong evidence that the quantities of reduced carbon sources found in seed exudates and the ability of microbes to use these compounds play important roles in the colonization of the spermosphere.
TI  - Metabolism of L(-)-carnitine by Enterobacteriaceae under aerobic conditions.
AB  - Different Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis, are able to convert L(-)-carnitine, via crotonobetaine, into gamma-butyrobetaine in the presence of carbon and nitrogen sources under aerobic conditions. Intermediates of L(-)-carnitine metabolism (crotonobetaine, gamma-butyrobetaine) could be detected by thin-layer chromatography. In parallel, L(-)-carnitine dehydratase, carnitine racemasing system and crotonobetaine reductase activities were determined enzymatically. Monoclonal antibodies against purified CaiB and CaiA from E. coli O44K74 were used to screen cell-free extracts of different Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli ATCC 25922, P. vulgaris, P. mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae) grown under aerobic conditions in the presence of L(-)-carnitine.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains of Enterobacter cloacae transferring resistance to cefotaxime and ceftazidime.
AB  - Transferability of ceftazidime resistance and of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was recorded in three strains of Enterobacter cloacae from Frankfurt University Clinics. All three strains were resistant to rifampicin, carbenicillin, cephaloridine, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem and meropenem. They transferred directly determinants of resistance to carbenicillin and cephaloridine to Escherichia coli K-12 No. 185 nal+ recipient strain. All transconjugant colonies also contained determinants of resistance to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam. In the second cycle of transfers, determinants of resistance to carbenicillin, cephaloridine, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam were transferred en bloc to the recipient Escherichia coli K-12 No. 3110 rif+ indicating that the "transfer factor" (tra+) mediating the process of conjugational transfer had also been co-transferred. Double-disk diffusion test showed the same pattern of production of ESBLs both in original strains and in transconjugants. Transfer of cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam was accompanied by the transfer of ESBL production.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 560 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during the period of June 1997 to May 1998. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90s of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM and arbekacin (ABK) showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. More than a half of S. aureus strains (including MRSA) showed high susceptibilities to gentamicin (GM) and MINO, the MIC50s of 0.25 microgram/ml or 0.5 microgram/ml. 3. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90s of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90s of amikacin (AMK) and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml, the MIC90 of GM was 16 micrograms/ml. Among E. cloacae strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones have decreased in 1997, compared with those in 1996. But the other drugs were not so active in 1997 as 1996. 4. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins were active against E. coli with the MIC90s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. Particularly, flomoxef (FMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP), IPM, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 5. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to almost all the drugs except penicillins. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity with the MICs for all strains equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. FMOX, CPR, CZOP, CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a better state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 6. Proteus mirabilis Almost all the drugs except ABPC and MINO showed high activities against P. mirabilis. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), latamoxef (LMOX), CPR, cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX) and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis. The MICs of them for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 7. Pseudomonas aeruginosa The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/ml, the MIC90s of AMK, IPM and meropenem (MEPM) were 16 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a lower state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 8. Serratia marcescens IPM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC90s of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC50s of CRMN was 0.125 microgram/ml or below, the MIC50s of CPR and CZOP were 0.25 microgram/ml.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive-care unit: 12 years' experience with an antibiotic control program.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (GPC), gram-negative  bacillary (GNB), and fungal blood-stream infections (BSIs) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven BSIs was analyzed. Early-onset BSIs were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset BSIs as those that occurred thereafter. Suspected early-onset BSIs were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, and suspected late-onset BSIs with vancomycin and gentamicin. Antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Early-onset BSIs were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. GPC (83% due to group B streptococcus [GBS]) accounted for approximately one half of early-onset BSI cases and GNB (68% Enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. Early-onset GBS declined from 24 to 11 cases (P=.04) and late-onset BSI increased from 111 to 230 cases (P<.01) from the first to the last study period. Sixty-eight percent of late-onset BSIs were due to GPC (primarily coagulase-negative Staphylococcus), 18% to GNB, and 14% to fungus. Over the study period, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn BSI cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. Prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 Enterococcus faecalis isolates. All fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. CONCLUSION: We observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset BSIs due to GBS and an increase in late-onset BSIs due to GPC, GNB, and fungi. The combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset BSIs and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset BSIs has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. Controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: epidemiological, clinical and microbiological approach.
AB  - Asymptomatic urinary tract infection is a risk factor for fetal and maternal morbidity including development of pyelonephritis, premature labor and impaired intra-uterine development. In this study, 326 pregnant and 100 non-pregnant control women were screened for significant asymptomatic bacteriuria from April 8 to July 25, 1997 to gain insight into the prevalence rate, clinical characteristics of the disease and microbiological assessments of the causative agents. All the subjects were clinically identified to have no signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI). The age ranges of the study and control groups were between 15-40 years for both groups with mean of 25.1 and 25.3 years, respectively. Bacteriological screening of mid-stream urine (MSU) revealed that 24/326 (7%) and 3/100 (3%) were positive for asymptomatic bacteriuria in the study group and controls, respectively (P < 0.05). Further biochemical species identification showed that Escherichia coli was found in 11/24 (46%) followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) in 8/24 (33%) and Citrobacter freundii in 2/24 (8%). Others found in smaller number included Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus rettgeri in 1/24 (4%) each. Antimicrobial susceptibility test revealed that 10/11 (91%) of the E. coli isolates were resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin and 10/11 (91%) of them sensitive to nitrofurantoin.
TI  - Stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants.
AB  - AIM: To serially characterise aerobic and anaerobic stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants and to correlate colonisation patterns with clinical risk factors. METHODS: Stool specimens from 29 infants of birthweight <1000 g were collected on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth. Quantitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed. RESULTS: By day 30, predominant species were Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterbacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria spp were identified in only one infant. In breast milk fed (but not in formula fed) infants, the total number of bacterial species/stool specimen increased significantly with time (2.50 (SE 0.34) on day 10; 3.13 (0.38) on day 20; 4.27 (0.45) on day 30) as did quantitative bacterial counts; Gram negative species accounted for most of the increase. On day 30, significant inverse correlations were found between days of previous antibiotic treatment and number of bacterial species (r=0.491) and total organisms/g of stool (r=0.482). Gestational age, birthweight, maternal antibiotic or steroid treatment, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and mode of delivery did not seem to affect colonisation patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The gut of extremely low birthweight infants is colonised by a paucity of bacterial species. Breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical to increasing fecal microbial diversity.
TI  - Cloning, sequence analyses, expression, and distribution of ampC-ampR from Morganella morganii clinical isolates.
AB  - Shotgun cloning experiments with restriction enzyme-digested genomic DNA from Morganella morganii 1, which expresses high levels of cephalosporinase, into the pBKCMV cloning vector gave a recombinant plasmid, pPON-1, which encoded four entire genes: ampC, ampR, an hybF family gene, and orf-1 of unknown function. The deduced AmpC beta-lactamase of pI 7.6 shared structural and functional homologies with AmpC from Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens. The overlapping promoter organization of ampC and ampR, although much shorter in M. morganii than in the other enterobacterial species, suggested similar AmpR regulatory properties. The MICs of beta-lactams for E. coli MC4100 (ampC mutant) harboring recombinant plasmid pACYC184 containing either ampC and ampR (pAC-1) or ampC (pAC-2) and induction experiments showed that the ampC gene of M. morganii 1 was repressed in the presence of ampR and was activated when a beta-lactam inducer was added. Moreover, transformation of M. morganii 1 or of E. coli JRG582 (delta ampDE) harboring ampC and ampR with a recombinant plasmid containing ampD from E. cloacae resulted in a decrease in the beta-lactam MICs and an inducible phenotype for M. morganii 1, thus underlining the role of an AmpD-like protein in the regulation of the M. morganii cephalosporinase. Fifteen other M. morganii clinical isolates with phenotypes of either low-level inducible cephalosporinase expression or high-level constitutive cephalosporinase expression harbored the same ampC-ampR organization, with the hybF and orf-1 genes surrounding them; the organization of these genes thus differed from those of ampC-ampR genes in C. freundii and E. cloacae, which are located downstream from the fumarate operon. Finally, an identical AmpC beta-lactamase (DHA-1) was recently identified as being plasmid encoded in Salmonella enteritidis, and this is confirmatory evidence of a chromosomal origin of the plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of an azoreductase gene from Clostridium perfringens and comparison with azoreductase genes from other bacteria.
AB  - A genomic library of Clostridium perfringens ATCC 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the C. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. A positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb DNA fragment insert was selected and purified. Lytic and lysogenic Escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. The 3.8 kb DNA fragment was amplified by PCR and found to hybridize with one band from C. perfringens DNA digested with EcoR1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. The fragment also hybridized with DNA from other azoreductase-producing Clostridium species, a Eubacterium sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter amalonaticus and E. coli, but not with DNA from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. The data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of C. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Structure-function studies of Ser-289 in the class C beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae P99.
AB  - Site-directed mutagenesis of Ser-289 of the class C beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae P99 was performed to investigate the role of this residue in beta-lactam hydrolysis. This amino acid lies near the active site of the enzyme, where it can interact with the C-3 substituent of cephalosporins. Kinetic analysis of six mutant beta-lactamases with five cephalosporins showed that Ser-289 can be substituted by amino acids with nonpolar or polar uncharged side chains without altering the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. These data suggest that Ser-289 is not essential in the binding or hydrolytic mechanism of AmpC beta-lactamase. However, replacement by Lys or Arg decreased by two- to threefold the kcat of four of the five beta-lactams tested, particularly cefoperazone, cephaloridine, and cephalothin. Three-dimensional models of the mutant beta-lactamases revealed that the length and positive charge of the side chain of Lys and Arg could create an electrostatic linkage to the C-4 carboxylic acid group of the dihydrothiazine ring of the acyl intermediate which could slow the deacylation step or hinder release of the product.
TI  - In vivo activities of peptidic prodrugs of novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl-1  beta-methylcarbapenems.
AB  - A series of novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl (THF)-1 beta-methylcarbapenems which have excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial activities exhibit modest efficacies against acute lethal infections (3.8 mg/kg of body weight against Escherichia coli and 0.9 mg/kg against Staphylococcus aureus) in mice when they are administered orally. In an effort to improve the efficacies of orally administered drugs through enhanced absorption by making use of a peptide-mediated transport system, several different amino acids were added at the aminomethyl THF side chains of the carbapenem molecules. The resulting peptidic prodrugs with L-amino acids demonstrated improved efficacy after oral administration, while the D forms were less active than the parent molecules. After oral administration increased (3 to 10 times) efficacy was exhibited with the alanine-, valine-, isoleucine-, and phenylalanine-substituted prodrugs against acute lethal infections in mice. Median effective doses (ED50s) of < 1 mg/kg against infections caused by S. aureus, E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, or penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae were obtained after the administration of single oral doses. Several of the peptidic prodrugs were efficacious against Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and E. coli infections, with ED50s of 1 to 14 mg/kg by oral administration compared with ED50s of 14 to > 32 mg/kg for the parent molecules. In general, the parent molecules demonstrated greater efficacy than the prodrugs against these same infections when the drugs were administered by the subcutaneous route. The parent molecule was detectable in the sera of mice after oral administration of the peptidic prodrugs.
TI  - High turnover rate of Escherichia coli strains in the intestinal flora of infants in Pakistan.
AB  - The Escherichia coli flora of infants in developed countries is dominated by one  or a few strains which persist for prolonged periods of time, but no longitudinal studies have been performed in developing countries. To this end, we studied the rectal enterobacterial flora in 22 home-delivered Pakistani infants during their first 6 months of life. Three colonies were isolated and species typed on each of 11 sampling occasions. E. coli isolates were strain typed using electromorphic typing of cytoplasmic enzymes, and their O serogroups were determined. There was a very rapid turnover of enterobacterial strains in the rectal flora of individual infants. On average, 8.5 different E. coli strains were found per infant, and several biotypes of other enterobacteria. Less than 50% of the infants were colonized with E. coli from their mothers, but strains of maternal origin were four times more likely to persists in the infants' flora than other E. coli strains. Enterobacteria other than E. coli were always of non-maternal origin, and Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae biotypes recovered from contaminated feeds were later identified in the infants' rectal flora. An early colonization with klebsiella or enterobacter was significantly associated with diarrhoea during the neonatal period, although these bacteria were not likely to be the cause of the disease. The results suggest that poor hygienic conditions result in an unstable and diverse enterobacterial flora, which may influence infant health.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.
TI  - Changes in the incidence and etiological patterns of bacteremia associated with acute leukemia over a 25-year period.
AB  - During the 25-year period from 1972-1996, 360 episodes of bacteremia occurred in  248 (45%) of a total of 548 patients with acute leukemia on our hematology ward, with the rate of occurrence remaining almost unchanged. Patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, however, had a significant decrease in the incidence of bacteremia during the last 5-year period. Gram-negative bacilli decreased in relative frequency from 64% for the first 15-year period to 40% for the last 5-year period, whereas gram-positive cocci increased from 24% to 51%. Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae somewhat decreased in frequency, whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococci had considerable increases. In contrast, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated at a relatively constant frequency, forming one of the top two pathogens throughout the study period. Despite the shift toward gram-positive cocci, therefore, P. aeruginosa remains a key organism in considering the initial empiric antibiotic regimen and infection prevention during neutropenia.
TI  - Characterization of SFO-1, a plasmid-mediated inducible class A beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae 8009 produced an inducible class A beta-lactamase which hydrolyzed cefotaxime efficiently. It also hydrolyzed other beta-lactams except cephamycins and carbapenems. The activity was inhibited by clavulanic acid and imipenem. The bla gene was transferable to Escherichia coli by electroporation of plasmid DNA. The molecular mass of the beta-lactamase was 29 kDa and its pI was 7.3. All of these phenotypic characteristics of the enzyme except for inducible production resemble those of some extended-spectrum class A beta-lactamases like FEC-1. The gene encoding this beta-lactamase was cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the beta-lactamase was homologous to the AmpA sequences of the Serratia fonticola chromosomal enzyme (96%), MEN-1 (78%), Klebsiella oxytoca chromosomal enzymes (77%), TOHO-1 (75%), and FEC-1 (72%). The conserved sequences of class A beta-lactamases, including the S-X(T)-X(S)-K motif, in the active site were all conserved in this enzyme. On the basis of the high degree of homology to the beta-lactamase of S. fonticola, the enzyme was named SFO-1. The ampR gene was located upstream of the ampA gene, and the AmpR sequence of SFO-1 had homology with the AmpR sequences of the chromosomal beta-lactamases from Citrobacter diversus (80%), Proteus vulgaris (68%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (60%). SFO-1 was also inducible in E. coli. However, a transformant harboring plasmid without intact ampR produced a small amount of beta-lactamase constitutively, suggesting that AmpR works as an activator of ampA of SFO-1. This is the first report from Japan describing an inducible plasmid-mediated class A beta-lactamase in gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Mechanism of inhibition of tannic acid and related compounds on the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Tannic acid, propyl gallate and methyl gallate, but not gallic acid, were found to be inhibitory to the growth of intestinal bacteria Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285, Clostridium clostridiiforme ATCC 25537, C. perfringens ATCC 13124, C. paraputrificum ATCC 25780, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047, Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and S. typhimurium YG1041 at 100-1000 microg/ml in culture broth. Neither Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697 nor Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 was inhibited by any of the above compounds up to 500 microg/ml. Tannic acid has a much greater relative binding efficiency to iron than propyl gallate, methyl gallate or gallic acid. The inhibitory effect of tannic acid to the growth of intestinal bacteria may be due to the strong iron binding capacity of tannic acid; whereas the effect of propyl gallate and methyl gallate probably occurs by a different mechanism. The growth of E. coli was restored by the addition of iron to the medium after the precipitate caused by tannic acid was removed. Neither B. infantis nor L. acidophilus require iron for growth. This probably contributes to their resistance to tannic acid. Because tannins are abundant in the human diet, tannins may affect the growth of some intestinal bacteria and thus may have an impact on human health.
TI  - A six-domain structural model for Escherichia coli translation initiation factor  IF2. Characterisation of twelve surface epitopes.
AB  - The Escherichia coli translation initiation factor IF2 is a 97 kDa protein which  interacts with the initiator fMet-tRNAfMet, GTP and the ribosomal subunits during initiation of protein biosynthesis. For structural and functional investigations of the factor, we have raised and characterised monoclonal antibodies against E. coli IF2. Twelve epitopes have been localised at the surface of the protein molecule by three different methods: Interactions of the monoclonal antibodies with nested deletion mutants of IF2, comparison of the relative location of the epitopes in a competition immunoassay and cross-reactivity analyses of the monoclonal antibodies towards IF2 from Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, and Bacillus stearothermophilus. These data are combined with predicted secondary structure and discussed in relation to a six-domain structural model for IF2. The model describes IF2 as a slightly elongated molecule with a structurally compact C-terminal domain, a well-conserved central GTP-binding domain, and a highly charged, solvent exposed N-terminal with protruding alpha-helical structures.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of ACC deaminase genes from two different plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria.
AB  - We have recently proposed that one way that plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria  (PGPR) stimulate plant growth is through the activity of the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, which causes a lowering of plant ethylene levels resulting in longer roots. As part of an effort to understand the role of this enzyme in PGPR, the genes for ACC deaminase from two PGPR, Enterobacter cloacae CAL2 and UW4, have been isolated. These genes are highly homologous to the ACC deaminase genes from Pseudomonas strains 6G5 and F17 and similar to the ACC deaminase gene from Pseudomonas sp. strain ACP. The region downstream (i.e., at the 3'-terminal end) of the strain UW4 ACC deaminase gene has a potential hairpin-like transcription termination site. The regions upstream of the strains UW4 and CAL2 ACC deaminase genes contain putative ribosome-binding sites; however, the promoter sequences have not yet been identified. Southern hybridization experiments suggest that there is a single copy of the ACC deaminase gene in Enterobacter cloacae strains UW4 and CAL2 and that there may be several different types of ACC deaminase genes in different microbes. The cloned ACC deaminase gene can be expressed in Escherichia coli enabling this bacterium to grow on ACC as a sole source of nitrogen and confers upon both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp. strains that are transformed with this gene the ability to promote the elongation of the roots of canola seedlings.
TI  - Three-dimensional structure of AmpC beta-lactamase from Escherichia coli bound to a transition-state analogue: possible implications for the oxyanion hypothesis and for inhibitor design.
AB  - The structures of AmpC beta-lactamase from Escherichia coli, alone and in complex with a transition-state analogue, have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The native enzyme was determined to 2.0 A resolution, and the structure with the transition-state analogue m-aminophenylboronic acid was determined to 2.3 A resolution. The structure of AmpC from E. coli resembles those previously determined for the class C enzymes from Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii. The transition-state analogue, m-aminophenylboronic acid, makes several interactions with AmpC that were unexpected. Perhaps most surprisingly, the putative "oxyanion" of the boronic acid forms what appears to be a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ala318, suggesting that this atom is protonated. Although this interaction has not previously been discussed, a carbonyl oxygen contact with the putative oxyanion or ligand carbonyl oxygen appears in most complexes involving a beta-lactam recognizing enzyme. These observations may suggest that the high-energy intermediate for amide hydrolysis by beta-lactamases and related enzymes involves a hydroxyl and not an oxyanion, although the oxyanion form certainly cannot be discounted. The involvement of the main-chain carbonyl in ligand and transition-state recognition is a distinguishing feature between serine beta-lactamases and serine proteases, to which they are often compared. AmpC may use the interaction between the carbonyl of Ala318 and the carbonyl of the acylated enzyme to destabilize the ground-state intermediate, this destabilization energy might be relieved in the transition state by a hydroxyl hydrogen bond. The structure of the m-aminophenylboronic acid adduct also suggests several ways to improve the affinity of this class of inhibitor and points to the existence of several unusual binding-site-like features in the region of the AmpC catalytic site.
TI  - Structure-based enhancement of boronic acid-based inhibitors of AmpC beta-lactamase.
AB  - The expression of beta-lactamases is the most common form of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. To combat these enzymes, agents that inhibit (e.g. clavulanic acid) or evade (e.g. aztreonam) beta-lactamases have been developed. Both the beta-lactamase inhibitors and the beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics are themselves beta-lactams, and bacteria have responded to these compounds by expressing variant enzymes resistant to inhibition (e.g. IRT-3) or that inactivate the beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotic (e.g. TEM-10). Moreover, these compounds have increased the frequency of bacteria with intrinsically resistant beta-lactamases (e.g. AmpC). In an effort to identify non-beta-lactam-based beta-lactamase inhibitors, we used the crystallographic structure of the m-aminophenylboronic acid-Escherichia coli AmpC beta-lactamase complex to suggest modifications that might enhance the affinity of boronic acid-based inhibitors for class C beta-lactamases. Several types of compounds were modeled into the AmpC binding site, and a total of 37 boronic acids were ultimately tested for beta-lactamase inhibition. The most potent of these compounds, benzo[b]thiophene-2-boronic acid (36), has an affinity for E. coli AmpC of 27 nM. The wide range of functionality represented by these compounds allows for the steric and chemical "mapping" of the AmpC active site in the region of the catalytic Ser64 residue, which may be useful in subsequent inhibitor discovery efforts. Also, the new boronic acid-based inhibitors were found to potentiate the activity of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as amoxicillin and ceftazidime, against bacteria expressing class C beta-lactamases. This suggests that boronic acid-based compounds may serve as leads for the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of beta-lactam-resistant infections.
TI  - [A national multicenter study of the in-vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam. The Spanish Piperacillin-Tazobactam Group].
AB  - The action of piperacillin-tazobactam on 4,137 of the 4,364 strains collected in  a Spanish multicenter study involving 46 participating hospitals was studied. The samples were from the following: 41% urine, 18% exuded from wound abscesses, 13% respiratory, 9% blood, 3% peritoneal liquid, and the remainder from other various sources. The gram-negative bacteria included 2,778 strains from 13 genera: Escherichia (1,289), Pseudomonas (451), Proteus (230), Klebsiella (203), Haemophilus (172), Enterobacter (145), Acinetobacter (88), Salmonella (60), Bacteroides (57), Morganella (53), Serratia (46), Citrobacter (46), Stenotrophonomas (23) and Moraxella (21). The gram-positive bacteria were S. aureus (316), E. faecalis (239), S. epidermis (130), S. pneumoniae (115) and Clostridium spp. (12). The global susceptibility of the gram-negatives to piperacillin-tazobactam was 94%: E. coli 98%, P. aeruginosa 92%, and P. mirabilis, Morganella, K. pneumoniae, Serratia and Salmonella spp. all greater than 94%. The susceptibility of other bacteria was as follows: 91% Citrobacter, 77% E. cloacae, 42% A. baumannii, 61% S. maltophilia, 97% E. faecalis, 93% S. epidermidis, 100% M. catarrhalis, 99% H. influenzae and 100% anaerobic bacteria. The action on S. pneumoniae and S. aureus varied according to the susceptibility or lack there of to penicillin or methicillin. In comparison to other antibiotics (piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem and ciprofloxacin), piperacillin-tazobactam was far better than piperacillin alone and better or similar to the others.
TI  - The prognostic factors of adult gram-negative bacillary meningitis.
AB  - Seventy-seven patients with Gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM), 57 males and 20 females, aged 17-86 years, were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, over an 11-year period. Fifty-four infections were community-acquired, and 23 were nosocomial; 49 were spontaneous and 28 occurred after head surgery or neurosurgery. The organisms most frequently involved were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter. Rarer pathogens included Citrobacter species, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis. All patients who did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy died. The mortality in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 28%. Other statistically significant prognostic factors included septic shock, initial level of consciousness, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic coma, disseminated intravascular coagulation, high cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels and leucocytosis. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, only appropriate antimicrobial therapy and septic shock were strongly associated with mortality even after adjusting for other potentially confounding factors. Despite the high mortality, management can be improved by early diagnosis, early use of appropriate antibiotics, and correction of underlying and associated medical derangement.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  - Of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by Escherichia coli (E Coli), followed by Proteus mirabilis (P mirabilis), Klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. Of E coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-R), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (AMC). For P mirabilis, ampi-R isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to AMC. Klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to AMC. In these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. In the other enterobacteria (Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, P vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and AMC) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of P vulgaris to AMC. Enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and P aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. For Staphylococcus aureus, the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. All the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.
TI  - Bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in Nottingham, UK, 1985-1996.
AB  - Bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. In this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. Particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. The incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. A total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. Polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. Staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas Escherichia coli (6%), Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Klebsiella aerogenes (3.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and Acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. The two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. Bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). The overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. Surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of Enterobacter cloacae. It is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.
TI  - gyrA mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Fluoroquinolone resistance (FQ-R) in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. Two mechanisms of FQ-R have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in DNA gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. A single point mutation in gyrA has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. To determine the extent of gyrA mutations associated with FQ-R in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the QRDRs from 8 Enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens. Although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of E. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyrA QRDR were highly conserved. Conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the QRDRs of the susceptible type strains of C. freundii, E. aerogenes, K. oxytoca (Ser-83 to Thr), and P. stuartii (Asp-87 to Glu). Strains with ciprofloxacin MICs of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the Gly-81, Ser-83, or Asp-87 position. Fluoroquinolone MICs varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyrA mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyrA contribute to resistance. The type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. High-level FQ-R frequently was associated with single gyrA mutations in all species of Enterobacteriaceae in this study except E. coli.
TI  - Direct antimicrobial susceptibility testing of gram-negative bacilli in blood cultures by an electrochemical method.
AB  - Nonfastidious aerobic gram-negative bacilli (GNB) are commonly isolated from blood cultures. The feasibility of using an electrochemical method for direct antimicrobial susceptibility testing of GNB in positive blood cultures was evaluated. An aliquot (10 microliter) of 1:10-diluted positive blood cultures containing GNB was inoculated into the Bactometer module well (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, Mo.) containing 1 ml of Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with an antibiotic. Susceptibility tests were performed in a breakpoint broth dilution format, with the results being categorized as resistant, intermediate, or susceptible. Seven antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, amikacin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, and ciprofloxacin) were used in this study, with each agent being tested at the two interpretive breakpoint concentrations. The inoculated modules were incubated at 35 degreesC, and the change in impedance in each well was continuously monitored for 24 h by the Bactometer. The MICs of the seven antibiotics for each blood isolate were also determined by the standardized broth microdilution method. Of 146 positive blood cultures (1,022 microorganism-antibiotic combinations) containing GNB tested by the direct method, the rates of very major, major, and minor errors were 0, 1.1, and 2.5%, respectively. The impedance method was simple; no centrifugation, preincubation, or standardization of the inocula was required, and the susceptibility results were normally available within 3 to 6 h after inoculation. The rapid method may allow proper antimicrobial treatment almost 30 to 40 h before the results of the standard methods are available.
TI  - The in vitro bactericidal effect of microwave energy on bacteria that cause prostatitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated the in vitro nonthermal effects of microwaves delivered from Prostatron 2.0 on Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. METHODS: The fingers of powder-free, sterile gloves were ligated, and bacterial solutions were transferred into the remaining area of the glove. The gloves were then sealed using silk ligatures. One set of gloves was subjected to the microwave treatment while another set was placed in a temperature-matched waterbath to act as control samples. The gloves containing the treatment group were taped around the probe, at the site where microwave energy exits the probe. During the treatment period, the temperatures from the urethral probe and the rectal probe were carefully monitored. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) energy delivered was 46.6 +/- 9.5 kJ (range 30.0 to 59.5) for the 10 trials on E. coli and colony counts in the experimental microwaved gloves decreased significantly compared with control samples (5.26 +/- 4.5 x 10(5) versus 10.16 +/- 9.3 x 10(5) CFU/mL, P = 0.02). For the experiments on E. cloacae the mean (+/-SD) energy applied was 38.5 +/- 12.5 kJ, and a significant decrease in colony counts of microwaved samples was also observed compared with controls (11.04 +/- 4.8 x 10(5) versus 20.08 +/- 10.1 x 10(5) CFU/mL, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Microwave energy, delivered from Prostatron 2.0, independent of heat production has an in vitro bactericidal effect on laboratory-cultured E. coli and E. cloacae.
TI  - Radiological pulmonary changes during gram-negative bacillary nosocomial bloodstream infection in premature infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to characterize the changes that occur  in chest radiographs at the time of gram-negative bacilli (GNB) nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and to determine the contribution of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and airway gram-negative bacterial pathogens to the clinical diagnosis of GNB nosocomial pneumonia. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective investigation involved 41 BSI infants (study group) and 50 GNB airway colonized infants who had sepsis workup with negative blood cultures (control group). We correlated clinical findings (95 blood and 305 tracheal aspirate (TA) cultures) with radiographic findings noted within 2 days before, the day of, and the day after blood cultures. Two radiologists independently graded 258 films using a modified score for BPD and a semiquantitative score ("probable," "possible," or "unlikely") for pneumonia. RESULTS: Mean birth weight was 1057 gm and 1044 gm for the study and control groups, respectively. Of the study population, 54% were male, 21% were black, 89% received surfactant, 79% received dexamethasone, and 88% survived. Average age at the time of blood cultures for both groups was 23 days. Most common isolates from blood and TA were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eight BSI infants died, mainly as a result of P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae; three control patients also died. Radiological findings were that BPD scores did not change in relation to BSI and were similar between study and control groups. Of the BSI patients, 21 presented with newly positive TA at the time of positive blood culture; "probable" or "possible" pneumonia was diagnosed in 18 of them. Their BPD scores were higher than those of the remaining BSI patients, of whom seven were already airway colonized, nine had negative TAs, and four were not intubated. Only one of these 20 patients had "possible" pneumonia noted on chest x-ray films. CONCLUSION: Radiographic signs of air space disease accompanied by the recovery of GNB respiratory pathogens from the blood and from a previously uncolonized airway strongly support the clinical diagnosis of GNB nosocomial pneumonia. Radiological signs of BPD are stable in relation to nosocomial BSI caused by GNB, but BPD radiological scores are higher among infants who also had a newly acquired respiratory GNB. BSI, new respiratory tract GNB, and BPD are critical associations for the clinical interpretation of radiographic changes in the ventilated newborn.
TI  - Purification and characterization of wild-type and mutant "classical" nitroreductases of Salmonella typhimurium. L33R mutation greatly diminishes binding of FMN to the nitroreductase of S. typhimurium.
AB  - "Classical" nitroreductase of Salmonella typhimurium is a flavoprotein that catalyzes the reduction of nitroaromatics to metabolites that are toxic, mutagenic, or carcinogenic. This enzyme represents a new class of flavin-dependent enzymes, which includes nitroreductases of Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli, flavin oxidoreductase of Vibrio fischeri, and NADH oxidase of Thermus thermophilus. To investigate the structure-function relation of this class of enzymes, the gene encoding a mutant nitroreductase was cloned from S. typhimurium strain TA1538NR, and the enzymatic properties were compared with those of the wild-type. DNA sequence analysis revealed a T to G mutation in the mutant nitroreductase gene, predicting a replacement of leucine 33 with arginine. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, the purified protein with a mutation of leucine 33 to arginine has no detectable nitroreductase activities in the standard assay conditions and easily lost FMN by dialysis or ultrafiltration. In the presence of an excess amount of FMN, however, the mutant protein exhibited a weak but measurable enzyme activity, and the substrate specificity was similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. Possible mechanisms by which the mutation greatly diminishes binding of FMN to the nitroreductase are discussed.
TI  - Trends in beta-lactam resistance among Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - beta-Lactam resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is related primarily to the emergence of novel beta-lactamases. The class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases hydrolyze extended-spectrum beta-lactams and are inhibited by clavulanic acid. These beta-lactamases are divided in two groups: TEM and SHV derivatives and non-TEM and non-SHV extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (CTX-M1, CTX-M2, MEN-1, PER-1, PER-2, TOHO-1, and VEB-1). The plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases (MIR-1, FOX-1, MOX-1, BIL-1, CMY-1, CMY-2, and LAT-1) hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins and cephamycins and are not inhibited by clavulanic acid. They have been reported in Europe and in the United States. The 15 inhibitor-resistant penicillinases are TEM derivatives (except for SHV-10) and plasmid mediated, and they are mainly from Escherichia coli isolates. The carbapenemases noted among Enterobacteriaceae are either the chromosomally located penicillinases (Sme-1, NmcA, IMI-1) found in rare Enterobacter cloacae or Serratia marcescens isolates or the plasmid-mediated metalloenzyme IMP-1 that is widespread in Japan. The incidence of resistance among Enterobacteriaceae related to the other more common beta-lactam-resistance mechanisms has continued to rise worldwide.
TI  - Induction of beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - beta-lactamase induction in Enterobacter cloacae, which is linked to peptidoglycan recycling, was investigated with use of high-performance liquid chromatography of cell wall fragments in genetically defined cells of Escherichia coli. After treatment of cells with beta-lactams, we detected in the periplasm an increase of D-tripeptide (N-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6 anhydro N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid), D-tetrapeptide (N-acetylglucosaminyl-1, 6 anhydro N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid -D-alanine), and a yet-unknown anhydromuropeptide. We identified this anhydromuramylpeptide by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry as anhydromuramyl-pentapeptide. The amount of these molecules did not alter after treatment with cell wall-active non beta-lactams. The transmembrane protein AmpG transports not only D-tripeptide but also D-pentapeptide into the cell. In the cytoplasm these molecules are degraded into the corresponding monosaccharide peptides M-tripeptide (N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid) and M-pentapeptide (N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid-alanine-D-alanine). These findings indicate that besides M-tripeptide and D-tripeptide, probably M-tetrapeptide, D-tetrapeptide, M-pentapeptide, and D-pentapeptide are also signal muropeptides for beta-lactamase induction.
TI  - Activity of cefepime compared with other antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cefepime is a new, parenteral, fourth-generation antibiotic that is stable in the presence of Bush group 1 beta-lactamases. In vitro activity of cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem against Gram-positive cocci and cefuroxime-resistant Gram-negative bacilli was studied. METHODS: The agar dilution method described by the US National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics tested. These included cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem. The tested clinical isolates included Gram-positive cocci (methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group D enterococci) and cefuroxime-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Burkholderia cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia). RESULTS: The activity of cefepime against most Gram-negative bacilli other than B cepacia and X maltophilia is better than that of ceftazidime. However, cefepime is less active against these Gram-negative bacilli than ciprofloxacin and imipenem. The activity of cefepime against B cepacia and X maltophilia is less than that of ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin. Among Gram-positive cocci, cefepime was active against most isolates of methicillin-sensitive staphylococci, S pyogenes, viridans streptococci and S pneumoniae. However, cefepime has poor activity against methicillin-resistant S aureus and enterococci. CONCLUSIONS: Due to its extended spectrum of activity, cefepime has potential use as suitable empiric monotherapy for the treatment of a variety of community- and hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Aerobic degradation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by Enterobacter cloacae PB2 and by pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae PB2 was originally isolated on the basis of its ability to utilize nitrate esters, such as pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and glycerol trinitrate, as the sole nitrogen source for growth. The enzyme responsible is an NADPH-dependent reductase designated PETN reductase. E. cloacae PB2 was found to be capable of slow aerobic growth with 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) as the sole nitrogen source. Dinitrotoluenes were not produced and could not be used as nitrogen sources. Purified PETN reductase was found to reduce TNT to its hydride-Meisenheimer complex, which was further reduced to the dihydride-Meisenheimer complex. Purified PETN reductase and recombinant Escherichia coli expressing PETN reductase were able to liberate nitrogen as nitrite from TNT. The ability to remove nitrogen from TNT suggests that PB2 or recombinant organisms expressing PETN reductase may be useful for bioremediation of TNT-contaminated soil and water.
TI  - Minimum antimicrobial inhibitory concentration of carnosol and of the ethanol extract from Lepichinia hastata (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of carnosol and of the ethanolic extract from the aerial part of Lepechinia hastata were determined against Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. aureus (2), S. aureus "A", and S. aureus "B", (strains "A" and "B" are resistant to penicillin and ampicillin), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Carnosol and the ethanol extract showed activity against gram (+) bacteria, but no activity against the yeast and the gram (-) bacteria.
TI  - Bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies.
AB  - The decision regarding the appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy for bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies must be individualized in each institution, by taking into account variations in the patterns of microbial isolates and their resistance profiles. Microbial isolates and antibiotic resistance patterns must be taken into account at each hospital. A shift from bacteremia due to infections caused by predominantly gram-negative organisms to predominantly gram-positive organisms in patients with hematologic malignancies has been noted in reports from other countries. We investigated bacterial isolates and their antibiotic sensitivities in patients with hematologic malignancies in the Veterans General Hospital-Taipei. A total of 185 episodes of bacteremia in 140 patients with hematologic malignancies were recorded during the period from 1995 to 1996. Unlike foreign reports, our investigation shows that gram-negative organisms still predominate, accounting for 72.7% of isolates, followed by gram-positive organisms, accounting for 26.3% of isolates, and anaerobes, accounting for 1% of isolates. Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated organism, accounting for 23.9% of isolates, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (7.3%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (7.3%). A high mortality rate was observed in gram-negative bacteremia: 31% for E. coli, 26% for K. pneumoniae, 24% for P. aeruginosa, and 33% for E. cloacae. If methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia occurred, mortality was high (47%). The antibiotic sensitivity profiles of the four most common gram-negative isolates (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and E. cloacae) indicated that, in our hospital, amikacin with either cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, or imipenem, would be an ideal combination for empirical therapy for bacteremia in patients with hematologic malignancies.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with quinolones and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 Gram-negative and 498 Gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. The activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. Trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, group G streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. The reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. The commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. There was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing Enterobacter agglomerans and E. cloacae, where the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher MIC90 value.
TI  - Chromosomally encoded ampC-type beta-lactamase in a clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - A clinical strain of Proteus mirabilis (CF09) isolated from urine specimens of a  patient displayed resistance to amoxicillin (MIC >4,096 microg/ml), ticarcillin (4,096 microg/ml), cefoxitin (64 microg/ml), cefotaxime (256 microg/ml), and ceftazidime (128 microg/ml) and required an elevated MIC of aztreonam (4 microg/ml). Clavulanic acid did not act synergistically with cephalosporins. Two beta-lactamases with apparent pIs of 5.6 and 9.0 were identified by isoelectric focusing on a gel. Substrate and inhibition profiles were characteristic of an AmpC-type beta-lactamase with a pI of 9.0. Amplification by PCR with primers for ampC genes (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii) of a 756-bp DNA fragment from strain CF09 was obtained only with C. freundii-specific primers. Hybridization results showed that the ampC gene is only chromosomally located while the TEM gene is plasmid located. After cloning of the gene, analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence (1,146 bp) showed that this ampC gene is close to blaCMY-2, from which it differs by three point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions Glu --> Gly at position 22, Trp --> Arg at position 201, and Ser --> Asn at position 343. AmpC beta-lactamases derived from that of C. freundii (LAT-1, LAT-2, BIL-1, and CMY-2) have been found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, and Enterobacter aerogenes and have been reported to be plasmid borne. This is the first example of a chromosomally encoded AmpC-type beta-lactamase observed in P. mirabilis. We suggest that it be designated CMY-3.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,282 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1995. The results were as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. The antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX and CTM. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited greater antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Enterobacter cloacae is closely related to Escherichia coli.
AB  - The RNA polymerase holoenzyme (RNAP) of Enterobacter cloacae was purified by gel  filtration and heparin affinity chromatography and shown to consist of four subunits (beta', beta, alpha and sigma) of 156, 151, 45 and 82 kDa, as measured by SDS-PAGE. The 82 kDa protein was shown to be related to the Escherichia coli primary sigma factor by western blot analysis with polyclonal antisera raised against purified E. coli sigma 70. Functional reconstitution of E. cloacae core enzyme with purified E. coli sigma 70 showed that E. cloacae and E. coli sigma factors are closely related. The RNAP of E. cloacae initiated transcription from the tac promoter with an efficiency similar to that of E. coli. Measuring promoter-specific transcription, the dependence of holoenzyme activity on salt, divalent cation and temperature was also similar to that of the E. coli RNAP. We also showed that the transcriptional inhibitor, rifampicin, inhibits the enzyme activity of the purified RNAP of E. cloacae and E. coli at similar concentrations. We conclude, based on these data, that the RNAP of E. cloacae and E. coli, both enterobacteria, are closely related.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (CFTM)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. A total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across Japan during 1996. CFTM showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. Of the S. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (PRSP), with MIC values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the MIC50 of CFTM against PRSP was 1.0 microgram/ml. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. A few strains of E. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. MIC values against P. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. Most strains of S. marcescens, C. freundii, and E. cloacae demonstrated resistance to CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, N. gonorrhoeae, and H. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities of CFC-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, CFC-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to sparfloxacin. Against gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of CFC-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. However, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mouse systemic infection caused by S. aureus Smith or S. aureus TMS 33, CFC-222 demonstrated an activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. The compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 8668. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. The activity of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against P. aeruginosa MB4-16 in the same infection model. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - [Occurrence and susceptibility of hospital strains producing enzymes with a wide  spectrum of substrate profiles].
AB  - In connection with more and more frequent occurrence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases an effort has been made to detect their presence in the biological materials coming from the patients of different wards of Mining Hospital in Sosnowiec from January to September 1995. Among 38 diagnostic materials, from which the strains in question were isolated, the following materials have been examined: bronchial lavage (52.6%), surgical wounds (18.4%), urines (15.8%) and others (13.2%). The examined diagnostic materials came from Intensive Care Unit (87.0%), Casualty and Orthopaedic Surgery Clinic (5.0%) and General Surgery Clinic (3.0%). The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae. (47.4%), Serratia marcescens (36.8%), Enterobacter cloacae (10.5%) and others (5.3%). Half of the examined strains constituted those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases and probably possessing an extra resistance mechanism: (Serratia marcescens--74%, Enterobacter cloacae--21%, Enterobacter aerogenes--5.0%) and 50% were those producing extended--spectrum beta-lactamases. (Klebsiella pneumoniae--95%, Escherichia coli--5%). Susceptibility of the examined strains to anti-microbial antibiotics was diverse. Full susceptibility of the analysed strains has been observed exclusively in case of Karbapenems (Imipenem, Meropenem and Cefamycyn). In case of beta-lactamase with beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations susceptibility was diverse and dependent on the species of the examined microorganism.
TI  - Transtorine, a new quinoline alkaloid from Ephedra transitoria.
AB  - Transtorine (1), a new quinoline alkaloid, isolated from the aerial part of Ephedra transitoria by column chromatography, was identified as 4-quinolone-2-carboxylic acid. The structure was determined by spectroscopic methods. Transtorine exhibited growth inhibitory activity against the common bacteria, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Immuno-detection of the virulence determinant OmpX at the cell surface of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - A model for the topology of the Enterobacter cloacae outer membrane protein OmpX  has been proposed, based on the primary sequence and on analogy to homologous proteins. According to this model the membrane embedded part of the protein consists of eight antiparallel beta-strands. Four random coil loops are located at the bacterial surface and three beta-turns at the periplasmic side of the membrane. Antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides representing five OmpX domains, four of which are putative peripheral and one located in the membrane. The accessibilities of OmpX to these antibodies were tested in intact cells by immuno-gold electron microscopy. This study showed that OmpX is indeed an outer membrane protein, the N-proximal loop of which forms an IgG-accessible epitope at the cell surface.
TI  - Bacterial and Ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in whom gram-positive cocci (GPC), gram-negative bacilli (GNB), or Ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. Another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of BPD. STUDY DESIGN: We correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. BPD severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w PCA) and at the time of discharge. Two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. RESULTS: Of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. GPC isolates from throat cultures were mainly Staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and Streptococcus haemolyticus. A superimposed GNB colonization was present in 37% of these infants. Most common isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Sepsis caused by GPC developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by GNB. Infants infected with GNB remained receiving oxygen at 36 w PCA and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS: Hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. Mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. High radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w PCA. Infants infected with U. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. CONCLUSION: GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. GNB-infected infants had the most severe BPD course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. U. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe BPD or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.
TI  - DNA shuffling of a family of genes from diverse species accelerates directed evolution.
AB  - DNA shuffling is a powerful process for directed evolution, which generates diversity by recombination, combining useful mutations from individual genes. Libraries of chimaeric genes can be generated by random fragmentation of a pool of related genes, followed by reassembly of the fragments in a self-priming polymerase reaction. Template switching causes crossovers in areas of sequence homology. Our previous studies used single genes and random point mutations as the source of diversity. An alternative source of diversity is naturally occurring homologous genes, which provide 'functional diversity'. To evaluate whether natural diversity could accelerate the evolution process, we compared the efficiency of obtaining moxalactamase activity from four cephalosporinase genes evolved separately with that from a mixed pool of the four genes. A single cycle of shuffling yielded eightfold improvements from the four separately evolved genes, versus a 270- to 540-fold improvement from the four genes shuffled together, a 50-fold increase per cycle of shuffling. The best clone contained eight segments from three of the four genes as well as 33 amino-acid point mutations. Molecular breeding by shuffling can efficiently mix sequences from different species, unlike traditional breeding techniques. The power of family shuffling may arise from sparse sampling of a larger portion of sequence space.
TI  - [Penetration of meropenem in gram-negative bacilli. Differences in activity with  imipenem].
AB  - The outer membrane of gramnegative bacteria cell-wall contain channels formed by  proteins known as porins, which facilitate the penetration of molecules into the cell. Imipenem and meropenem possess an important intrinsic activity against most gramnegative bacteria due to their high affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins PBP-2 and/or PBP-3. Meropenem is slightly more active against certain species of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and nonfermenters bacilli. In this sense the differences in the activity between the two carbapenems may be attributable to differences in their affinity for PBPs, differences in their resistance to beta-lactamases hydrolysis, or to the differences in the capacity to employ certain porin channels. OprF is the main porin channel involved in the beta-lactam penetration of bacteria, though OprC and OprD2 may also contribute to the penetration of carbapenems into P. aeruginosa. However, evidences suggest that although impenem requires the presence of OprD2, meropenem may use other pathways for penetration. In Escherichia coli both carbapenems use ompF and ompC, and no specific porin channels have been detected. Only in the case of Enterobacter cloacae may exceptions exists among Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Sequence of a melibiose transporter gene of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - We cloned a fragment of the chromosomal DNA of Enterobacter cloacae, which enabled a melibiose-negative Escherichia coli mutant lacking melB to grow on melibiose as the sole source of carbon. Transformed cells harboring the hybrid plasmid carrying the cloned DNA showed melibiose transport activity. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA region was determined. One complete open reading frame (ORF) and a part of another ORF were found in the region, and the amino acid sequences were deduced. The complete ORF was found to encode a melibiose transporter which consisted of 425 amino acid residues. Hydropathy analysis revealed that there are about 12 hydrophobic domains in this transporter. The incomplete ORF which exists in the upstream region of the transporter gene seemed to encode an alpha-galactosidase.
TI  - Detection of mutations in the gyrA and parC genes in quinolone-resistant clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - We have determined partial sequences of the gyrA and parC genes of Enterobacter cloacae type strain including the regions analogous to the quinolone resistance-determining region of the Escherichia coli gyrA gene. The deduced 65- and 49-amino acid sequences of the determined regions of the E. cloacae gyrA and parC genes were identical to the corresponding regions of the E. coli GyrA and ParC proteins, respectively. We examined 40 clinical strains of E. cloacae isolated from patients with urinary tract infection for susceptibilities to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Based on the nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin MICs, these isolates were divided into 19 quinolone-susceptible strains (MICs of nalidixic acid, 3.13-25 mg/L; MICs of ciprofloxacin, < or = 0.025 mg/L) and 21 quinolone-resistant strains (MICs of nalidixic acid, 400 to > 800 mg/L; MICs of ciprofloxacin, 0.39-100 mg/L). We analysed five quinolone-susceptible and 21 quinolone-resistant strains for alterations in GyrA and ParC. The five quinolone-susceptible strains had amino acid sequences in GyrA and ParC identical to those of type strain. Of the 21 quinolone-resistant isolates, three (MICs of nalidixic acid, 400 to > 800 mg/L; MICs of ciprofloxacin, 0.39-3.13 mg/L) had a single amino acid change at the position equivalent to Ser-83 in the E. coli GyrA protein and no alterations in ParC; one (MIC of nalidixic acid, > 800 mg/L; MIC of ciprofloxacin, 3.13 mg/L) had a single amino acid change at Ser-83 in GyrA and a single amino acid change at the position equivalent to Glu-84 in the E. coli ParC protein; two (MIC of nalidixic acid, > 800 mg/L; MIC of ciprofloxacin, 25 mg/L) had double amino acid changes at Ser-83 and Asp-87 in GyrA and no alterations in ParC; and 15 (MICs of nalidixic acid, > 800 mg/L; MICs of ciprofloxacin, 25-100 mg/L) had double amino acid changes at Ser-83 and Asp-87 in GyrA and a single amino acid change at Ser-80 or Glu-84 in ParC. This study suggests, that in clinical isolates of E. cloacae, DNA gyrase is a primary target of quinolones, that only a single amino acid change at Ser-83 in GyrA is sufficient to generate high-level resistance to nalidixic acid and to decrease susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, and that the accumulation of amino acid changes in GyrA and the simultaneous presence of the ParC alterations play a central role in developing high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Purification, properties, and sequence of glycerol trinitrate reductase from Agrobacterium radiobacter.
AB  - Glycerol trinitrate (GTN) reductase, which enables Agrobacterium radiobacter to utilize GTN and related explosives as sources of nitrogen for growth, was purified and characterized, and its gene was cloned and sequenced. The enzyme was a 39-kDa monomeric protein which catalyzed the NADH-dependent reductive scission of GTN (Km = 23 microM) to glycerol dinitrates (mainly the 1,3-isomer) with a pH optimum of 6.5, a temperature optimum of 35 degrees C, and no dependence on metal ions for activity. It was also active on pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), on isosorbide dinitrate, and, very weakly, on ethyleneglycol dinitrate, but it was inactive on isopropyl nitrate, hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, ammonium ions, nitrate, or nitrite. The amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence was homologous (42 to 51% identity and 61 to 69% similarity) to those of PETN reductase from Enterobacter cloacae, N-ethylmaleimide reductase from Escherichia coli, morphinone reductase from Pseudomonas putida, and old yellow enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, placing the GTN reductase in the alpha/beta barrel flavoprotein group of proteins. GTN reductase and PETN reductase were very similar in many respects except in their distinct preferences for NADH and NADPH cofactors, respectively.
TI  - Novel fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents containing oxime-substituted (aminomethyl)pyrrolidines: synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7-(4-(aminomethyl)-3-(methoxyimino)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6- fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro[1,8]naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (LB20304).
AB  - New pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. These fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Variations at the C-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. The activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the C-8 substituent was in the order F (C5-NH2) > F (C5-H) > naphthyridine > Cl = OMe = H against Gram-positive organisms. In the case of Gram-negative strains, activity was in the order F (C5-NH2) > naphthyridine = F (C5-H) > H > Cl > OMe. The advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. In addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. Among these compounds, compound 20 (LB20304) showed the best in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. The MICs (microgram/mL) of LB20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: S. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), Streptococcus epidermidis 887E (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), Enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), Escherichia coli 3190Y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), Enterobacter cloacae P99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), Actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). On the basis of these promising results, LB20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.
TI  - Mechanism of suppression of piperacillin resistance in enterobacteria by tazobactam.
AB  - Resistance to piperacillin in several isolates of Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae was investigated and confirmed to occur at a frequency of 10(-7) to 10(-6). Development of resistance to piperacillin was significantly suppressed by tazobactam but not by clavulanic acid. To elucidate the mechanism by which resistance suppression occurs, the effect of piperacillin plus tazobactam on the induction of AmpC beta-lactamase was analyzed by monitoring the beta-galactosidase activity of an inducible ampC-lacZ gene fusion in Escherichia coli. The combination exerted no inhibitory effect on AmpC beta-lactamase induction. Tazobactam also had no effect on the accumulation of a key intermediate in the AmpC beta-lactamase induction pathway, 1,6-anhydromurotripeptide, in an ampD mutant strain of E. coli. However, the addition of tazobactam to liquid cultures of E. cloacae 40001 in the presence of piperacillin at four times the MIC caused a delay in the recovery of the culture to piperacillin-induced stress. At 16 times the MIC, a complete suppression of regrowth occurred. Analysis of culture viability on piperacillin plates showed that the culture recovery was due to growth by moderately resistant mutants preexisting in the cell population, which at 16 times the MIC became susceptible to the combination. Evidence from the kinetics of inhibition of the E. cloacae 40001 AmpC beta-lactamase by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam and from the effects of these drugs on the frequency of resistance to piperacillin suggests that the suppressive effect of tazobactam on the appearance of resistance is primarily mediated by the beta-lactamase inhibitory activity.
TI  - The signal molecule for beta-lactamase induction in Enterobacter cloacae is the anhydromuramyl-pentapeptide.
AB  - Beta-lactamase induction in Enterobacter cloacae, which is linked to peptidoglycan recycling, was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of cell wall fragments in genetically defined cells of Escherichia coli. After treatment of cells with beta-lactams, we detected an increase in a D-tripeptide (disaccharide-tripeptide, N-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-mes o-diaminopimelic acid), aD-tetrapeptide (disaccharide-tetrapeptide, N-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-mes o-diaminopimelic acid-D-alanine), and aD-pentapeptide (disaccharide-pentapeptide, N-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-mes o-diaminopimelic acid-D-alanyl-D-alanine)levels in the periplasms of bacterial cells. Furthermore, only the accumulation of aD-pentapeptide correlates with the beta-lactamase-inducing capacity of the beta-lactam antibiotic. The transmembrane protein AmpG transports all three aD-peptides into the cytoplasm, where they are degraded into the corresponding monosaccharide peptides. In the absence of AmpD the constitutive overproduction of beta-lactamase is accompanied by an accumulation of aM-tripeptide (monosaccharide-tripeptide, anhydro-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid) and aM-pentapeptide (L1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid-D-alanyl-D-alanine), but not aM-tetrapeptide (anhydro-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid-D-alanine), in the cytoplasm. Only the amount of aM-pentapeptide is increased upon treatment with imipenem. These findings indicate that aD-pentapeptide is the main periplasmic muropeptide, which is converted into the cytoplasmic signal molecule for beta-lactamase induction, the aM-pentapeptide.
TI  - Specificity of the high-mannose recognition site between Enterobacter cloacae pili adhesin and HT-29 cell membranes.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae has been implicated as one of the causative agents in neonatal infection and causes a septicemia thought to be initiated via the gastrointestinal tract. The adhesion of radiolabeled E. cloacae to HT-29 cells was concentration and temperature dependent and was effectively blocked by unlabeled bacteria or by millimolar concentrations of alpha-mannosides and micromolar concentrations of high-mannose oligosaccharides. A variety of well-characterized mannose oligosaccharides were tested as inhibitors of adhesion. The best inhibitor was the Man9(GlcNAc)2-tyrosinamide, which was considerably better than other tyrosinamide-linked oligosaccharides such as Man7(GlcNAc)2, Man6(GlcNAc)2 or Man5(GlcNAc)2. Further evidence that the bacteria preferred Man9(GlcNAc)2 structures was obtained by growing HT-29 cells in the presence of glycoprotein processing inhibitors that block mannosidase I and increase the amount of protein-bound Man9(GlcNAc)2 at the cell surface. Such cells bound 1.5- to 2-fold more bacteria than did control cells. The adhesin involved in binding to high-mannose structures was purified from isolated pili. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-gels, a 35-kDa protein was identified by its specific binding to a mannose-containing biotinylated albumin. The amino acid sequences of several peptides from the 35-kDa subunit showed over 85% identity to FimH, the mannose-specific adhesin of Salmonella typhimurium. Pili were labeled with 125I and examined for the ability to bind to HT-29 cells. Binding showed saturation kinetics and was inhibited by the addition of Man9(GlcNAc)2-tyrosinamide but not by oligosaccharides with fewer mannose residues. Polyclonal antibody against this 35-kDa protein also effectively blocked adhesion of pili or E. cloacae, but no effect was observed with nonspecific antibody. These studies demonstrate that the 35-kDa pilus subunit is a lectin whose specificity is directed toward Man, (GlcNAc)2 oligosaccharides.
TI  - Induction of gram-negative bacterial growth by neurochemical containing banana (Musa x paradisiaca) extracts.
AB  - Bananas contain large quantities of neurochemicals. Extracts from the peel and pulp of bananas in increasing stages of ripening were prepared and evaluated for their ability to modulate the growth of non-pathogenic and pathogenic bacteria. Extracts from the peel, and to a much lesser degree the pulp, increased the growth of Gram-negative bacterial strains Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter cloacae and Salmonella typhimurium, as well as two non-pathogenic E. coli strains, in direct relation to the content of norepinephrine and dopamine, but not serotonin. The growth of Gram-positive bacteria was not altered by any of the extracts. Supplementation of vehicle and pulp cultures with norepinephrine or dopamine yielded growth equivalent to peel cultures. Total organic analysis of extracts further demonstrated that the differential effects of peel and pulp on bacterial growth was not nutritionally based, but due to norepinephrine and dopamine. These results suggest that neurochemicals contained within foodstuffs may influence the growth of pathogenic and indigenous bacteria through direct neurochemical-bacterial interactions.
TI  - Reductive and hydrolytic activities of enteric bacteria on food colours.
AB  - Reductive and hydrolytic activities on two food colours namely metanil yellow and indigo carmine by different strains of enteric bacteria were evaluated. Enteric bacteria possessed both reductive and hydrolytic capabilities which depended upon the incubation period and the type of strain. In certain bacterial strains, (Escherichia coli and Vibrio sp.), reductive activity was visible after 3 hr. Other enteric strains showed an increasing activity right from the beginning of incubation. Enterobacter cloacae appeared to be producing maximum reductive capability followed by Enterobacter aerogenes and E. coli. Even enteric bacterial strains demonstrated a good response in obtaining hydrolytic activity of indigo carmine during incubation upto 10 hr, establishing the fact that the gut microflora may cause health problem to consumers.
TI  - [Survey of sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 20 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance of clinical isolates. Activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,326 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at the institutions between October and December 1994. The results are as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. Antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX, CTM, and ABPC. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than those exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited stronger antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - Effects of requiring prior authorization for selected antimicrobials: expenditures, susceptibilities, and clinical outcomes.
AB  - Antimicrobial control programs are widely used to decrease drug expenditures, but effects on antimicrobial resistance and outcomes for patients are unknown. When a requirement for prior authorization for selected parenteral antimicrobial agents was initiated at our urban, county teaching hospital, total parenteral antimicrobial expenditures decreased by 32%. Susceptibilities to all beta-lactam and quinolone antibiotics increased, with dramatic increased susceptibilities in isolates recovered in intensive care units, increased susceptibilities in isolates recovered in other inpatient sites, and little change in susceptibilities in isolates recovered in outpatient sites despite no change in infection control practices. For patients with bacteremia due to gram-negative organisms, overall survival did not change with restrictions. No differences occurred in the median time from initial positive blood culture to receipt of an appropriate antibiotic or in the median time from positive blood culture to discharge from the hospital. Thus, requiring preapproval for selected parenteral agents can decrease antimicrobial expenditures and improve susceptibilities to antibiotics without compromising patient outcomes or length of hospital stay.
TI  - Development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  - Very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. This study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. Specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, Mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents, including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. MICs of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the Vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarBlue; Accumed International, Westlake, Ohio). This study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, group A Streptococcus species, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In some instances, the MICs were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. The proposed in-flight experiment will include inoculation of the Vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of MICs by the mission's astronauts. Ground-based studies have shown reproducible MICs following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees C to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. For comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) MIC values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. This procedure can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.
TI  - [Antimicrobial drug therapy and microbial sensitivity tests: general concept of antibiotics].
AB  
TI  - Construction, expression, and activities of L49-sFv-beta-lactamase, a single-chain antibody fusion protein for anticancer prodrug activation.
AB  - The L49 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody binds to p97 (melanotransferrin), a tumor-selective antigen that is expressed on human melanomas and carcinomas. A recombinant fusion protein, L49-sFv-bL, that contains the antibody binding regions of L49 fused to the Enterobacter cloacae r2-1 beta-lactamase (bL) was constructed, expressed, and purified to homogeneity in an Escherichia coli soluble expression system. The variable regions of L49 were cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from L49 hybridoma mRNA using signal sequence and constant region primers. Construction of the gene encoding L49-sFv-bL was accomplished by hybridization insertion of VH, VL, and sFv linker sequences onto a pET phagemid template containing the bL gene fused to the pelB leader sequence. Optimal soluble expression of L49-sFv-bL in E. coli was found to take place at 23 degrees C with 50 microM isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside induction and the use of the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40 for isolation from the bacteria. Construction and expression of a soluble form of the p97 antigen in Chinese hamster ovary cells allowed affinity-based methods for analysis and purification of the fusion protein. Surface plasmon resonance, fluorescent activated cell sorting, and Michaelis-Menten kinetic analyses showed that L49-sFv-bL retained the antigen binding capability of monovalent L49 as well as the enzymatic activity of bL. In vitro experiments demonstrated that L49-sFv-bL bound to 3677 melanoma cells expressing the p97 antigen and effected the activation of 7-(4-carboxybutanamido)cephalosporin mustard (CCM), a cephalosporin nitrogen mustard prodrug. On the basis of these results, L49-sFv-bL was injected into nude mice with subcutaneous 3677 tumors, and localization was determined by measuring bL activity. Tumor to blood conjugate ratios of 13 and 150 were obtained 4 and 48 h post conjugate administration, respectively, and the tumor to liver, spleen, and kidney ratios were even higher. A chemically produced L49-Fab'-bL conjugate yielded a much lower tumor to blood ratio (5.6 at 72 h post administration) than L49-sFv-bL. Therapy experiments established that well-tolerated doses of L49-sFv-bL/CCM combinations resulted in cures of 3677 tumors in nude mice. The favorable pharmacokinetic properties of L49-sFv-bL allowed prodrug treatment to be initiated 12 h after the conjugate was administered. Thus, L49-sFv-bL appears to have promising characteristics for site-selective anticancer prodrug activation.
TI  - A melibiose transporter and an operon containing its gene in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - We detected inducible melibiose transport activity in cells of Enterobacter cloacae IID977. H+, but not Na+, was found to be the coupling cation for this transporter. We cloned and sequenced the gene encoding the melibiose transporter. A homology search of a protein sequence database revealed that this melibiose transporter has high sequence similarity with the lactose transporter (LacY) and the raffinose transporter (RafB) and has some similarity with the melibiose transporter (MelB) of Escherichia coli.
TI  - Microbial growth inside saline-filled breast implants.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to determine whether intraluminal saline in breast implants can support the growth of common wound-infecting microorganisms over a prolonged period of time. The bacteria tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Three fungal species also were tested: Aspergillus fumigatus, Paecilomyces variotii, and Candida albicans. In the in vitro study, four organisms survived in flasks of sterile saline for the 2 weeks in which serial cultures were performed: K. pneumoniae, C. albicans, A. fumigatus, and P. variotii. In the in vivo study, 61 white rabbits (122 implants) received both an experimental implant inoculated with one of the test organisms and a control implant containing only sterile saline. They were sacrificed at 1-, 3-, or 6-month scheduled endpoints. None of the control implants containing sterile saline had positive cultures. In contrast, the intraluminal saline was culture positive for 7 of the 10 inoculated organisms after varying lengths of time: S. epidermidis, E. coli, E. cloacae, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, A. fumigatus, and P. variotii. Samples of capsular tissue also were cultured. Of the 122 capsular tissue specimens, 21 (17 percent) had positive cultures and surrounded both inoculated and sterile implants. In most instances, capsules that were culture positive contained an organism different from the one that had been inoculated in the group. In only 3 cases was the same organism cultured from both the periprosthetic tissue and the intraluminal saline, and these may represent instances of the inoculated organism migrating through the implants filler valves. The data show that several types of bacteria (particularly gram-negative species) and fungi can grow and reproduce in a restricted saline environment for extended periods of time.
TI  - [Characterization of plasmids which mediate resistance to multiple antibiotics in gram-negative bacteria of nosocomial origin].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic and molecular mechanisms involved in antimicrobial resistance of 10 strains of gramnegative bacilli (1 Serratia marcescens; 2 Escherichia coli; 1 Proteus mirabilis; 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae; 1 Enterobacter cloacae y 1 Alcaligenes faecalis), isolated from adult patients with nosocomial pulmonary infection at the in-patient facilities of the University Hospital of Los Andes, Merida, Venezuela, have been studied. METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentrations using the dilution method in agar. The study of extrachromosomal genes was carried out by conjugation, bacterial infection with the bacteriophage M13 and curing of plasmid by acridine orange. The plasmids were isolated by alkaline lysis and analysis of restriction endonuclease digestion was carried out separately using the enzymes EcoRI and HindIII. A DNA probe, derived from the region which encodes the TEM-1 beta-lactamase of the plasmid pBR322 was used for dot-blot hybridization tests. RESULTS: All of the gramnegative bacilli showed resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin (> 128 micrograms/ml) and 3 strains also showed resistance to gentamicin (> 64 micrograms/ml). Genetic and molecular procedures showed the presence of conjugative plasmids of approximately 54 kb in all the 10 strains. The restriction patterns obtained by using EcoRI and HindIII indicated common DNA fragments in most of the plasmids studied. The dot-blot hybridization tests confirmed homology between the plasmids and the DNA probe used (TEM-1 beta-lactamase). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the gramnegative bacteria of nosocomial origin harbored self-transferable plasmids of approximately 54 kb, which mediate resistance to gentamicin and encode a beta-lactamase of the TEM group.
TI  - A monoclonal antibody reacts with maltose-binding protein of Escherichia coli and related enteric bacteria.
AB  - Maltose-binding protein (MBP) encoded by malE is essential for the energy-dependent translocation of maltose through the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. Its property of specific binding to maltose has been used in constructing fusion proteins for easy affinity purification. A monoclonal antibody named MAb SC1D7 was produced against Escherichia coli MBP. This MAb also bound to MBP-containing recombinant proteins in both Western blotting and immunoprecipitation analysis. As a result, this MAb can be a useful probe for tracing MBP-fusion proteins in various applications. Furthermore, intrinsic MBPs from E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were also detected by this MAb. No reaction was observed with the total proteins from Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas hydrophila and Plesiomonas shigelloides. These observations suggest that the MAb SC1D7-defined epitope is conserved among some enteric bacteria, but not the others. The results strengthen the phylogenetic positions of these closely related bacteria previously placed by other means.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  - The main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. Thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. Removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. The residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. Minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. These results support the ongoing efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.
TI  - Histopathology and microbiology of isolated rectal bleeding in neonates: the so-called 'ecchymotic colitis'.
AB  - Rectal bleeding in neonates is an alarming event which suggests a possible necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) but is usually the only symptom of an unexplained colitis characterized endoscopically by ecchymotic mucosal lesions, the so-called 'ecchymotic colitis' (EC). We studied histologically and bacteriologically 18 infants (mean age: 18 days) presenting with rectal bleeding by systematic rectosigmoidoscopy and intestinal biopsies. The 18 infants were hospitalized. Prematurity was found in seven cases and an underlying condition in 14 cases (respiratory distress: six cases; infection: six cases; surgery: two cases). Histology showed a mild to moderate inflammation (10/12) of the mucosa with a prevalence of polymorphonuclear cells (8/10), frequent focal haemorrhages (11/12) and foci of pneumatosis (4/12). Numerous bacteria were seen in the mucus layer focally forming large clusters. Cultures of intestinal biopsies yielded exclusively Enterobacteriaceae species: Escherichia coli (seven cases), Klebsiella spp. (seven cases), and Enterobacter cloacae (three cases); four cases were sterile. Our study demonstrates that neonatal bleeding is associated with endoscopic and histological 'ecchymotic colitis' lesions and with a peculiar microbial flora of EBC strains. EC and necrotizing enterocolitis share similar features raising the question of the link between the two syndromes.
TI  - Isolation of an Acanthamoeba strain with intracellular Burkholderia pickettii infection.
AB  - Burkholderia pickettii is a facultative pathogen that has been isolated from patient sources and environmental sources including respiratory therapy solutions, deionized water and aqueous disinfectants. The organism has been associated with septicemia and respiratory tract infections. In our investigation, Burkholderia pickettii (biovar 2) was for the first time isolated from Acanthamoeba sp. (group II), a free living amoeba species recovered from the wet area of a physiotherapy unit. Pathogenic strains of acanthamoebae may cause amoebic-encephalitis (AE) and keratitis. Light and electron microscopic examinations showed that in a first step, the bacterial were phagocytized by the amoebae. In contrast to Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli that were used as food organisms and digested within food vacuoles, Burkholderia pickettii caused the amoebae to develop large vacuoles filled with completely intact and motile bacteria. 3-5 days after infection, Pseudomonas pickettii had multiplied within the enlarging parasitophorous vacuoles. Ultrastructural changes in the host cells occurred and the amoebae finally underwent rupture or lysis. In cocultivation assays we could not only reinfect the original host amoeba but Acanthamoeba strains from other habitats could successfully be infected with Burkholderia pickettii as well.
TI  - Quality control of two rose bengal and modified DRBC and DG18 media.
AB  - The effect of storage on the performance of four mycological media, DG18, DRBC and two Rose Bengal agars, one from Difco, the other recommended by the Swedish Standard Institution, was investigated. The autoclaved media were stored (+4 degrees C) in the dark for up to 26 weeks. Following each storage period, the media were remelted and poured and the plates stored (+4 degrees C) in the dark for a maximum of 8 weeks before inoculation with test microorganisms. All media contained antibiotics. Both rapidly and slowly growing moulds, and also yeasts and bacteria were used as test microorganisms. No distinct effect of storage time on colony appearance could be shown for any of the four media. If the loss of restricted growth of Rhizopus stolonifer is used as a measure of the performance of the media, DRBC plates should not be stored for longer than 2 weeks after being poured from fresh medium. Storage of DRBC in flasks should not exceed 4 weeks and plates prepared from this medium should not be kept for more than 1 week. DG18 plates should only be poured from fresh medium and kept for a maximum of 1 week. The inhibitory effect of the antibiotic supplement on bacteria lasted for at least 4 weeks in DG18 and the two rose bengal media.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the AmpC beta-lactamase of Morganella morganii.
AB  - The chromosomal beta-lactamase gene of a clinical isolate of Morganella morganii  was cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. The beta-lactamase had a pI of 7.4 and conferred a typical AmpC susceptibility pattern. The insert obtained was found to encode a protein of 379 amino acids. Its deduced amino acid sequence revealed it to be a class C beta-lactamase: 39-56% identity with chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases of Serratia marcescens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli; and 37-56% identity with plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (MOX-1, CMY-1, FOX-1, ACT-1, LAT-1, BIL-1 and CMY-2). The ampC gene was linked to a gene only part of which (450 bp) was cloned homologous to the regulatory ampR genes of chromosomal class C beta-lactamases.
TI  - Imipenem resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae is associated with the combination of ACT-1, a plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase, and the foss of an outer membrane protein.
AB  - Six Escherichia coli and 12 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from a single hospital expressed a common beta-lactamase with a pI of approximately 9.0 and were resistant to cefoxitin and cefotetan (MIC ranges, 64 to > 128 and 16 to > 128 micrograms/ml, respectively). Seventeen of the 18 strains produced multiple beta-lactamases. Most significantly, three K. pneumoniae strains were also resistant to imipenem (MICs, 8 to 32 micrograms/ml). Spectrophotometric beta-lactamase assays with purified enzyme indicated hydrolysis of cephamycins, in addition to cephaloridine and benzylpenicillin. The 4ene encoding the pI 9.0 beta-lactamase (designated ACT-1 for AmpC type) was cloned and sequenced, which revealed an ampC-type beta-lactamase gene that originated from Enterobacter cloacae and that had 86% sequence homology to the P99 beta-lactamase and 94% homology to the partial sequence of MIR-1. Southern blotting revealed that the gene encoding ACT-1 was on a large plasmid in some of the K. pneumoniae strains as well as on the chromosomes of all of the strains, suggesting that the gene is located on an easily mobilized element. Outer membrane protein profiles of the K. pneumoniae strains revealed that the three imipenem-resistant strains were lacking a major outer membrane protein of approximately 42 kDa which was present in the imipenem-susceptible strains. ACT-1 is the first plasmid-mediated AmpC-type beta-lactamase derived from Enterobacter which has been completely sequenced. This work demonstrates that in addition to resistance to cephamycins, imipenem resistance can occur in K. pneumoniae when a high level of the ACT-1 beta-lactamase is produced in combination with the loss of a major outer membrane protein.
TI  - Coexpression of the long and short forms of CheA, the chemotaxis histidine kinase, by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - CheA is the histidine protein kinase of a two-component signal transduction system required for bacterial chemotaxis. Motile cells of the enteric species Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium synthesize two forms of CheA by utilizing in-frame initiation sites within the gene cheA. The full-length protein, CheAL, plays an essential role in the chemotactic signaling pathway. In contrast, the function of the short form, CheAs, remains elusive. Although CheAs lacks the histidine residue that becomes phosphorylated in CheAL, it exhibits both kinase activity and the ability to interact with and enhance the activity of CheZ, a chemotaxis protein that accelerates dephosphorylation of the two-component response regulator CheY. To determine whether other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae express CheAs and CheZ, we analyzed immunoblots of proteins from clinical isolates of a variety of enteric species. All motile, chemotactic isolates that we tested coexpressed CheAL, CheAs, and CheZ. The only exceptions were closely related plant pathogens of the genus Erwinia, which expressed CheAL and CheZ but not CheAs. We also analyzed nucleotide sequences of the cheA loci from isolates of Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae, demonstrating the presence of in-frame translation initiation sites similar to those observed in the cheA loci of E. coli and S. typhimurium. Since coexpression of CheAs and CheZ appears to be limited to motile, chemotactic enteric bacteria, we propose that CheAs may play an important role in chemotactic responses in some environmental niches encountered by enteric species.
TI  - Susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to a photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - The photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD-Arg(2)) on the growth of selected Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates is described as compared to the effect of hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD). Growth inhibition of HpD-Arg(2) of three Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus) and five laboratory strains of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) was observed as well. Serratia marcescens strain was resistant to light-activated HpD-Arg(2) or HpD. The antimicrobial activity of light-activated HpD-Arg(2) against P. aeruginosa may offer an additional option in the anti-pseudomonal therapy of wounds.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of cefodizime on Enterobacteriaceae in an in-vitro model simulating plasma pharmacokinetics in humans.
AB  - An in-vitro dialysis model was employed to assess the feasibility of once-daily dosing of cefodizime in the treatment of infections caused by various Enterobacteriaceae: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Providencia stuartii and Enterobacter cloacae. This model simulated the concentrations of cefodizime detected in human blood after an intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection of 1 g or 2 g of the antibiotic. Validation of the model was undertaken to confirm its utility. Based on the data obtained with this model, once-daily dosing with 1 g cefodizime (i.v.) should be effective against infections due to the commonest Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, M. morganii). For infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae strains that produce large quantities of Class I beta-lactamases, twice-daily (P. stuartii or S. marcescens) or four times daily (E. cloacae) administration of 1 g cefodizime may be required.
TI  - Production of Escherichia coli group I-like heat-labile enterotoxin by Enterobacteriaceae isolated from environmental water.
AB  - Strains of Klebsiella oxytoca (2), Citrobacter freundii (2), Enterobacter cloacae (1) and Escherichia coli (1) isolated from environmental water were identified as heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) producing strains by immunological methods and polymerase chain amplification. A 322 bp amplified fragment was obtained with specific primers LTR and LTL, and hybridized to a digoxigenin-labelled LTB probe only under low stringency conditions, and not with a cholera toxin probe. These results suggest that Enterobacteriaceae may produce a LT-like toxin antigenically and genetically related to the LT enterotoxin of E. coli.
TI  - Bacterial strains isolated from eggs and their resistance to currently used antibiotics: is there a health hazard for consumers?
AB  - In order to study the putative transfer of antibiotic resistance from poultry to  humans, hens' eggs were examined for the presence of various pathogens. Staphylococcus, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Proteus and Pseudomonas spp. were the most frequently isolated genera. Sensitivity tests, performed with the Kirby-Bauer technique, showed the presence of resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (to penicillin-G, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, cefalosporins, oxacillin, gentamycin, chloramphenicol and tobramycin), Enterococcus faecalis (to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, gentamycin and tetracyclin), Escherichia coli (to tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin and cefalosporins), Enterobacter cloacae (to ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavunalic acid, erythromycin and tetracycline), Pseudomonas stutzeri (to erythromycin and chlorampenicol) and Citrobacter freundii (to ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavunalic acid, cefalosporins and co-trimoxazole).
TI  - Molecular cloning of the nemA gene encoding N-ethylmaleimide reductase from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Using the gene mapping membrane technique, we identified a gene (nemA) that encodes N-ethylmaleimide reductase in Escherichia coli. The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 365 amino acids with a molecular mass of 39,514 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence showed a high degree of homology (87% identical) with the pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase of Enterobacter cloacae and the morphinone reductase of Pseudomonas putida (52% identical).
TI  - Neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway colonization with Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. Whether GNB are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or to the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. Data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. The severity of BPD was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with GPC (Staphylococus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). Superimposed on 36% of these infants was GNB airway colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), Enterobacter cloacae (25%), Escherichia coli (25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Serratia marcescen (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii and Haemophilus influenzae (5%). Comparison between 174 GPC- and 86 GNB-colonized infants showed that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. Fifteen percent of GNB-colonized infants developed BSI caused by GNB and 14% developed BSI caused by GPC. No significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and BSI was noted. GNB infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with GPC. GNB colonization was a predictor of severe BPD after controlling for ventilation. Ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of GNB-colonized and 33% of noncolonized infants and was not a predictor of BPD severity. CONCLUSION: GNB airway colonization creates a moderate risk for BSI. Antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate GNB. GNB airway colonization is associated with severe BPD, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate GNB from the airways should be undertaken.
TI  - Growth promotion of Mycobacterium avium-M. intracellulare complex by enterobacterial acetate.
AB  - A mycobacterial growth factor was present in the conditioned media of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae cultures, but not in Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture. This factor potentiated the growth of Mycobacterium avium-M. intracellulare complex (MAC), a patient isolate, and well-established strains of M. avium and M. intracellulare. The growth factor was not a polypeptide; it was heat-stable and possessed a molecular weight < 500 D. Acetate production by enterobacteria was responsible for the biological activities observed. Acetate promoted mycobacterial growth at concentrations up to 3 mM; higher levels were toxic. The effects of acetate on MAC growth were not influenced by the pH of the media. Our data suggest that production of acetate by enterobacteria may regulate mycobacterial growth, and therefore, intestinal acetate might be a cofactor in the pathogenicity of MAC.
TI  - Therapeutic effect of the quinolone prodrug prulifloxacin against experimental urinary tract infections in mice.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of prulifloxacin (CAS 123447-62-1, NM441), a  new quinoline prodrug, against clinical isolates from urinary tract infections was investigated. In addition, it was compared with ofloxacin (CAS 82419-36-1), levofloxacin (CAS 100986-85-4), ciprofloxacin urinary tract infections in mice, as well as its pharmacokinetics. 1. The antibacterial activity of NM394 (6-fluoro-1-methyl-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-4H-[1,3]thiazeto[3,2- a]quinoline-3-carboxylic acid), an active metabolite of prulifloxacin, against gram-positive clinical isolates was inferior to that of levofloxacin and tosufloxacin, and equal to that of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Against gram-negative clinical isolates, the activity of NM394 was superior to that of the reference drugs. 2. The therapeutic effect of prulifloxacin on experimental urinary tract infection with Escherichia coli in mice was equal to that of tosufloxacin and ciprofloxacin and superior to that of ofloxacin and levofloxacin. Its therapeutic effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection was equal to that of tosufloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and superior to that of ofloxacin. Against urinary tract infection with olfloxacin-resistant Enterobacter cloacae, prulifloxacin was the most effective of all the drugs tested. 3. The maximal serum concentration of prulifloxacin was slightly higher than that of ciprofloxacin, and the area under the curve (AUC) for prulifloxacin was 1/4 that of ofloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. The maximal concentration and AUC of prulifloxacin in lung and kidney were slightly higher than the corresponding values for ciprofloxacin but only 1/2 to 1/4 of the values for ofloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. In conclusion, prulifloxacin (NM394) showed potent antibacterial activity against clinical isolates and potent therapeutic efficacy against experimental infection in spite of its lower AUCs compared with the reference drugs. These findings suggest that prulifloxacin may be a useful drug in the treatment of urinary tract infections.
TI  - Evaluation of swirling, pH, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. This study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular pH, and low plasma glucose levels. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees C for up to 5 days. In the morning and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet pH, plasma glucose, and swirling. Quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine pH and glucose levels. RESULTS: Platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus mitis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. The sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. Although the sensitivity of the pH test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with E. cloacae had normal pH despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) CFU/mL). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular pH or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with Gram stain (10(5)-10(6) CFU/mL), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) CFU/mL), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal RNA (10(3)-10(4) CFU/mL), and automated bacterial culture (1 CFU/sample volume).
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a locus encoding an indolepyruvate decarboxylase  involved in indole-3-acetic acid synthesis in Erwinia herbicola.
AB  - Erwinia herbicola 299R synthesizes indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) primarily by the indole-3-pyruvic acid pathway. A gene involved in the biosynthesis of IAA was cloned from strain 299R. This gene (ipdC) conferred the synthesis of indole-3-acetaldehyde and tryptophol upon Escherichia coli DH5 alpha in cultures supplemented with L-tryptophan. The deduced amino acid sequence of the gene product has high similarity to that of the indolepyruvate decarboxylase of Enterobacter cloacae. Regions within pyruvate decarboxylases of various fungal and plant species also exhibited considerable homology to portions of this gene. This gene therefore presumably encodes an indolepyruvate decarboxylase (IpdC) which catalyzes the conversion of indole-3-pyruvic acid to indole-3-acetaldehyde. Insertions of Tn3-spice within ipdC abolished the ability of strain 299R to synthesize indole-3-acetaldehyde and tryptophol and reduced its IAA production in tryptophan-supplemented minimal medium by approximately 10-fold, thus providing genetic evidence for the role of the indolepyruvate pathway in IAA synthesis in this strain. An ipdC probe hybridized strongly with the genomic DNA of all E. herbicola strains tested in Southern hybridization studies, suggesting that the indolepyruvate pathway is common in this species. Maximum parsimony analysis revealed that the ipdC gene is highly conserved within this group and that strains of diverse geographic origin were very similar with respect to ipdC.
TI  - Characterization of a nosocomial outbreak involving an epidemic plasmid encoding  for TEM-27 in Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serotype Othmarschen.
AB  - A ceftazidime-resistant Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serotype Othmarschen strain, harboring the plasmid-mediated new extended-spectrum beta-lactamase TEM-27, was involved in a nosocomial outbreak (8 patients) at the Pediatric Cardiology Department of the Ramon y Cajal Hospital in Madrid. Genomic DNA polymorphism analysis, using an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction, demonstrated the clonal nature of all Salmonella isolates. The plasmid encoding TEM-27 (pJMM1) was characterized by EcoRI, SacI, and BglI restriction. An identical restriction pattern was found in plasmid from all S. enterica strains. Possible in vivo intergeneric plasmid spread was suggested by the identification of an identical plasmid in Escherichia coli RYC5H and Enterobacter cloacae RYC39737 strains isolated during the outbreak. Results indicate that this outbreak involved dissemination of a single ceftazidime-resistant Salmonella strain and the spread of a single TEM-27-encoding plasmid among different Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of aerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated from severe infections in 1992: results of a French multicenter study. Groupe d'Etude d'Infections a bacilles a Gram Negatif (GEIGN)].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antibiotic susceptibility of 649 gram-negative bacilli involved in severe infections and isolated in 18 teaching hospitals from January to December 1992 was evaluated. METHODS: Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations were determined by agar dilution method for piperacillin, piperacillin+ tazobactam and imipenem, and by a microdilution method for 11 other antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin, ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin). Criteria of Comite Francais de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie were followed for interpretation. Betalactamases were identified by isoelectric focusing and overproduction of cephalosporinase was defined by the resistance phenotype. The main species isolated were Escherichia coli (45%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8%), Salmonella spp. (7.5%), Enterobacter cloacae (4%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (4%). Most of the strains were isolated from blood culture (72.3%), respiratory tract (11.4%) and intraabdominal infections (8.6%). Most of the enterobacteria isolates were susceptible to imipenem, aztreonam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin (percentages of susceptibility were respectively 99.3, 98, 98.3 and 96.3); in most of cases clavulanic acid did not entirely restore sensitivity to amoxicillin of penicillinase-producing strains. Among 89 P. aeruginosa strains, 82% were susceptible to imipenem and ceftazidime, 81% to the association piperacillin + tazobactam and 51% to ticarcillin. Resistance rates are very high for Acinetobacter baumannii except for imipenem. CONCLUSION: Production of TEM-type penicillinase and over-production of the chromosomal cephalosporinase are the most widely observed mechanisms of resistance (respectively 22% and 9% of 649 strains). Prevalence of extended spectrum betalactamases was low (1%) and essentially observed for K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Beta-lactam stability in frozen microdilution PASCO MIC panels using strains with known resistance mechanisms as biosensors.
AB  - The stability of amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, and meropenem in PASCO (PASCO System, DIFCO Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) frozen microdilution susceptibility panels stored for 16 weeks at -20 degrees C and -70 degrees C was evaluated. The increase in MIC values for the five American-Type Culture Collection (ATCC) quality control strains for susceptibility testing recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) and for 13 strains with different well-characterized resistance mechanisms was indicative of bioactivity deterioration. The overall agreement (+/- 1 twofold dilution) at purchase between the MIC values of PASCO frozen microdilution susceptibility panels and the standard agar dilution method was 97.7%. Minimum inhibitory concentration values for the associations of amoxicillin/clavulanate and piperacillin/tazobactam remained unchanged for the study period at -70 degrees C. In contrast, a carbapenem bioactivity decrease was detected only with strains having well-characterized resistance mechanisms from the 12th week onwards. At -20 degrees C, antibiotic deterioration with these latter strains was observed earlier than with ATCC strains: the activity of meropenem and imipenem remained unchanged only for the first 2 weeks, while a loss of activity was detected for amoxicillin/clavulanate and piperacillin/tazobactam at the 7th and 10th week, respectively. Cefepime was highly stable both at -20 degrees C and -70 degrees C. Strains with well-characterized resistance mechanisms should be used in routine quality control studies of antibiotic stability for susceptibility testing panels during the storage period.
TI  - Gene cloning, purification, and characterization of NfsB, a minor oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase from Escherichia coli, similar in biochemical properties to FRase I, the major flavin reductase in Vibrio fischeri.
AB  - nfsB, encoding a minor oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase, was isolated by PCR using primers corresponding to two amino acid sequences conserved among the major flavin reductase from Vibrio fischeri and classical nitroreductases from Salmonella typhimurium and Enterobacter cloacae. The gene product, NfsB, was purified to homogeneity from extracts of Escherichia coli cells overexpressing it. NfsB was found to be situated at 13 min on the E. coli map. Biochemical analysis indicated NfsB to be a polypeptide having a calculated molecular weight of 23,904, capable of forming a homodimer and associated tightly with FMN as a prosthetic group. Although it exhibited a lower affinity to the NfsB apoenzyme than FMN, FAD could serve as an effective substitute for FMN. It was also shown that NfsB has a broad electron acceptor specificity and is associated with a low level of the NAD(P)H-flavin oxidoreductase. The NfsB catalysis obeys the ping pong Bi-Bi mechanism. The Km value for NADH varied depending on the second substrate used.
TI  - A kinetic study of NMC-A beta-lactamase, an Ambler class A carbapenemase also hydrolyzing cephamycins.
AB  - In order to analyze its kinetic parameters, an Ambler class A carbapenemase NMC-A was purified. NMC-A demonstrated unusually strong hydrolytic activity towards imipenem and meropenem. Moreover, it hydrolyzed cephamycins with kcat values uncommonly high for this class of beta-lactamases. Clavulanic acid and tazobactam had comparable inhibitory activity against NMC-A, whereas sulbactam was the least active inhibitor. Noticeably, NMC-A was more readily inhibited by brobactam. All these catalytic properties suggest that NMC-A possesses an original structure of its active site allowing hydrolysis of beta-lactams usually stable to the hydrolytic activity of class A beta-lactamases.
TI  - Low prevalence of gastrointestinal colonization with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in high risk units in a Canadian tertiary care centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria among  patients receiving care in high risk units in a Canadian tertiary care centre. DESIGN: Prevalence study over a four-month period in 1995 with rectal swab or freshly passed stool specimen collected from each patient included in study. Standardized record data extraction for selected patient variables was used. SETTING: Units at high risk for antimicrobial-resistant organisms at the Health Sciences Centre, Winnipeg, including neonatal (NICU), pediatric (PICU), surgical (SICU) and medical intensive care units (MICU), central dialysis unit (CDU), and the in-patient oncology ward (ONC). PATIENTS: One hundred and fifty-seven patients admitted to the high risk care units for at least 72 h were screened. Ward distribution was NICU 13 (8.3%), PICU nine (5.7%), SICU 24 (15.3%), MICU 19 (12.1%), CDU 62 (39.5%) and ONC 30 (19.1%). Fifty-one of 157 (32.5%) patients had urinary drainage devices, 108 (68.8%) had invasive vascular devices, and 57 (36.3%) had had a surgical procedure within the month before specimen collection. In the month before sampling, 114 (72.6%) had received antimicrobial therapy, including 21 (13.3%) who had received vancomycin, and 81 (51.5%) were receiving antimicrobials, seven (10.8%) vancomycin, on the day of sampling. RESULTS: Antimicrobial susceptibilities were performed on 371 bacterial isolates. There were no vancomycin-resistant enterococci or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Eleven (10.8%) enterococci were resistant to ampicillin, none of which were beta-lactamase producers, 19 (18.6%) and five (4.9%) demonstrated high level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively. One (0.7%) Escherichia coli was resistant to ciprofloxacin and another to gentamicin. Six (20.7%) Enterobacter cloacae samples were resistant to cefotaxime. One (2.4%) Klebsiella species was resistant to ciprofloxacin and another to cefotaxime. Two (16.6%) Citrobacter species were resistant to cefotaxime. One of 11 (9%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates was resistant to ceftazidime; none were resistant to piperacillin, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin or imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant organisms colonizing the gastrointestinal tract in patients in these high risk units is low. The reasons for this low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance require further exploration.
TI  - Location of N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamylmesodiaminopimelic acid, presumed  signal molecule for beta-lactamase induction, in the bacterial cell.
AB  - Using a chromatographic method for the isolation and detection of periplasmic and cytoplasmic muropeptides avoiding radioactive labeling, we found that in the ampD-negative strain JRG582 the anhydromuropeptide N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamylmesodiaminopimelic acid (anhMurNAc tripeptide) accumulates not only in the cytoplasm but also in the periplasm. Simultaneously JRG582 carrying the Enterobacter cloacae genes ampC and ampR, which are necessary for the induction of beta-lactamase expression, overproduces beta-lactamase. We confirmed that the transmembrane protein AmpG transports a precursor muropeptide into the cytoplasm and that the formation of the anhMurNAc tripeptide takes place in the cytoplasm. anhMurNAc tripeptide can then be secreted into the periplasm. Therefore, the amount of anhMurNAc tripeptide in the cytoplasm is reduced not only by AmpD but also by transport out of the cell.
TI  - A rob-like gene of Enterobacter cloacae affecting porin synthesis and susceptibility to multiple antibiotics.
AB  - A chromosomal gene of Enterobacter cloacae affecting the synthesis of major outer membrane proteins in E. cloacae and Escherichia coli was cloned by using selection for resistance to cefoxitin in E. coli. The presence of the gene, when plasmid-borne, led to a decrease in the amount of porin F in E. cloacae and the amount of OmpF in E. coli and caused 2- to 32-fold increases in the MICs of chloramphenicol, tetracycline, quinolones, and beta-lactam antibiotics. The gene encoded a 33-kDa protein, similar (83% identity) to the protein Rob involved in the initiation of DNA replication in E. coli, which was called RobA(EC1) by analogy. RobA from E. cloacae was found to inhibit ompF expression at the posttranscriptional level via activation of micF, a gene also apparently present in E. cloacae, as detected by PCR. As with its homolog from E. coli, RobA(EC1) is related to the XylS-AraC class of positive transcriptional regulators, along with MarA and SoxS, which also cause a micF-mediated decrease in the level of ampF expression.
TI  - Ultraviolet-B lethal damage on Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa has shown an increased sensitivity compared with that of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae, when they were exposed to 0.4 kJ/m2 of ultraviolet-B radiation. The rapid decay in cell viability observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa after the irradiation was influenced by factors such as culture media and the presence of pyocyanine during the irradiation. The radioinduced lethal damage could be prevented by photoreactivating treatment, indicating that pyrimidine dimer formation was the mechanism causing bacterial death. The results indicate that several environmental conditions may act as protective agents against ultraviolet-B-induced damage.
TI  - Comparative characterization of the cephamycinase blaCMY-1 gene and its relationship with other beta-lactamase genes.
AB  - A plasmidic beta-lactamase which hydrolyzed cephamycins was first detected and reported in 1989. At that time its description was restricted to phenotypic characteristics. We analyzed nucleotide sequence of its gene and explored it genetic relationship with other bla genes. The deduced amino acid sequence of the blaCMY-1 product was compared with those of other known plasmidic cephamycinases and of chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases. The results indicate that the relationship of CMY-1 is closest to MOX-1 among the plasmidic cephamycinases and to AmpC of Pseudomonas aeruginosa among the chromosomal cephalosporinases. We conclude that the plasmidic cephamycinases described up to now may be classified into three families, as follows: CMY-1, MOX-1, and FOX-1 with AmpC of P. aeruginosa; CMY-2, BIL-1 and LAT-1 with AmpC of Citrobacter freundii; and MIR-1 with AmpC of Enterobacter cloacae. Plasmidic cephamycinases are now recognized as clinically relevant class C beta-lactamases.
TI  - Comparison of three different in vitro methods of detecting synergy: time-kill, checkerboard, and E test.
AB  - An in vitro method of detecting synergy which is simple to perform, accurate, and reproducible and has the potential for clinical extrapolation is desirable. Time-kill and checkerboard methods are the most widely used techniques to assess synergy but are time-consuming and labor-intensive. The Epsilometer test (E test), a less technically demanding test, has not been well studied for synergy testing. We performed synergy testing of Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 23355, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 with various combinations of cefepime or ceftazidime with tobramycin or ciprofloxacin using time-kill, checkerboard, and E test techniques. Time-kill testing was performed against each organism alone and in combinations at one-fourth times the MIC (1/4 x MIC) and 2 x MIC. With checkerboard tests, the same combinations were studied at concentrations ranging from 1/32 x to 4 x MIC. Standard definitions for synergy, indifference, and antagonism were utilized. E test strips were crossed at a 90 degree angle so the scales met at the MIC of each drug alone, and the fractional inhibitory concentrations index was calculated on the basis of the resultant zone on inhibition. All antimicrobial combinations demonstrated some degree of synergy against the test organisms, and antagonism was infrequent. Agreement with time-kill testing ranged from 44 to 88% and 63 to 75% by the checkerboard and E test synergy methods, respectively. Despite each of these methods utilizing different conditions and endpoints, there was frequent agreement among the methods. Further comparisons of the E test synergy technique with the checkerboard and time-kill methods are warranted.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LB10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro activity of LB10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. Against gram-positive bacteria, LB10522 was most active among the compounds tested. It was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. LB10522 was highly effective against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested. Ninety percent of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. These activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LB10522 with a MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus giorgio, Streptococcus pneumoniae III, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E, Escherichia coli 851E, Proteus mirabilis 1315E, Serratia marcescens 1826E, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Ac-54. LB10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as TEM-3, TEM-7, SHV-1, FEC-1, and P-99. LB10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. Time-kill study showed that LB10522, at concentrations of two or four times the MIC, had a rapid bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus 6538p, Escherichia coli 851E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E.
TI  - Group of peptides that act synergistically with hydrophobic antibiotics against gram-negative enteric bacteria.
AB  - A synthetic peptide, KFFKFFKFFK [corrected], consisting of cationic lysine residues and hydrophobic phenylalanine residues was found to sensitize gram-negative bacteria to hydrophobic and amphipathic antibiotics. At a concentration of 3 micrograms/ml, it decreased the MIC of rifampin for smooth, encapsulated Escherichia coli by a factor of 300. Other susceptible bacterial species included Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhimurium, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant. Similar results were obtained with another synthetic peptide, IKFLKFLKFLK [corrected]. The fractional inhibitory concentration indices for the synergism of these peptides with rifampin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, and novobiocin were very close to those determined for the previously characterized potent outer-membrane-disorganizing agents polymyxin B nonapeptide and deacylpolymyxin B. KFFKFFKFFK [corrected] had direct activity against the gram-positive organism Micrococcus strain ML36, was strongly hemolytic, and was as active on polymyxin-resistant E. coli mutants as on their parent. These three attributes made KFFKFFKFFK [corrected] different from polymyxin derivatives and similar to cationic detergents, such as cetylpyridinium chloride. However, whereas the MIC of cetylpyridinium chloride for E. coli is low (0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml), that of KFFKFFKFFK [corrected] is much higher (30 to 100 micrograms/ml). Other groups of synthetic peptides studied included polymyxin-like peptides with an intrachain disulfide bridge. Their synergism with antibiotics was less marked. Still other peptides, including KEKEKEKEKE and KKKKKKFLFL, lacked any synergism with the probe antibiotics.
TI  - Diffusion of carbapenems through the outer membrane of enterobacteriaceae and correlation of their activities with their periplasmic concentrations.
AB  - Scarce information is available on the real mechanism by which carbapenemes penetrate in Enterobacteriaceae, although a considerable amount of evidence suggests that in many species of this family the lack of certain outer membrane proteins is associated with the acquisition of resistance to these antibiotics. The existance of specific pathways for the carbapenems has never been demonstrated, although at times it has been postulated in both wild and mutant strains, on the basis of evident discordances between permeability patterns and suceptibility data. By using the Zimmerman and Rosselet technique, which requires the strain under investigation to harbor a suitable beta-lactamase, the permeability of intact Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae cells to meropenem and imipenem was investigated by transferring a constructed vector carrying the carbapenem hydrolyzing CphA metallo-beta-lactamase gene into the parental strains and their porin-deficient mutants. Reduced amounts of nonspecific porins significantly reduced the penetration of both carbapenems. The virtual absence of porins caused the MICs of meropenem to increase, mostly in Enterobacter cloacae, while it did not affected the MICs of imipenem. No evidence of specific porin pathways of the type described in Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found.
TI  - [Determination of serum aminoglycoside and vancomycin concentrations by the microbiological method in the presence of other antimicrobials].
AB  - The determination of serum concentrations of antimicrobials with a narrow therapeutic range by microbiological method requires some modifications when the patient is under combined antimicrobial therapy. The methodological conditions for the appraisal of aminoglycosides and vancomycin in the presence of other drugs were evaluated by using strains with selective sensitivity to the antimicrobial to be tested or by the adding crude extracts of beta-lactamases for the inactivation of the beta-lactam antimicrobials. These beta-lactamases were obtained from Enterobacter cloacae P99 (derepressed mutant) cultures for the inactivation of penicillins and first, second and third generation cephalosporins, as well as from Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia M 1484 cultures for the hydrolysis of imipenem. The strains allowing vancomycin appraisal and indifferent to the synergic activity of other drugs in the mixture were S. aureus M 2120, when the accompanying antimicrobials were gentamicin, ciprofloxacin or rifampicin, and E. faecalis M 2113, E. avium M 2091 and S. aureus M 2101 when the drugs in the mixture were amikacin, lincomycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. For the appraisal of gentamicin in the presence of vancomycin or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin), E. coli M 1376 was the most suitable strain, while the use of K. pneumoniae ATCC 10031 was required for the appraisal of amikacin or netilmicin. When rifampicin was the accompanying antimicrobial, E. coli M 1495 turned out more adequate. E. coli M 1462 proved to be more satisfactory for gentamicin, amikacin and netilmicin dosages in samples also containing chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or tetracycline.
TI  - The influence of incubation conditions on the adherence of oral Enterobacteriaceae to HeLa cells.
AB  - The adherence of 12 oral isolates and 4 type strains of Enterobacteriaceae (equally representing Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii) to HeLa cell monolayers following five different incubation conditions (sucrose, D-mannose, serum, MEM and Candida albicans GDH 1957) was investigated. Incubation with sucrose and D-mannose resulted in the greatest and least adherence, respectively. The presence of preadherent C. albicans GDH 1957 on the HeLa cells tended to enhance the adherence of certain strains of E. cloacae and C. freundii, but had no overall impact on Enterobacteriaceae adherence. While heterogeneity of behaviour existed between strains within species, E. cloacae was the most, and K. pneumoniae the least, adherent species irrespective of incubation conditions. Haemagglutination assays indicated the presence of mannose-resistant type 1 fimbriae associated with all Enterobacteriaceae. In clinical terms, the variations in adherence properties observed in vitro may contribute to an understanding of the different prevalence rates of oral Enterobacteriaceae reported in the literature.
TI  - A simple gel electrophoretic method for analyzing the muropeptide composition of  bacterial peptidoglycan.
AB  - The muropeptide composition of bacterial peptidoglycan is currently most efficiently determined by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Though sensitive, the HPLC procedure is technically demanding and has been applied to a relatively small number of bacterial strains and species. We have found that fluorescence-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) is a simple, rapid method by which reducing muropeptides from multiple peptidoglycan samples can be visualized. Individual reducing muropeptides were covalently labeled with the fluorescent molecule 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid, after which they were separated by electrophoresis through a 35% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by exposure to UV light. FACE detected the appropriate numbers of reducing muropeptides in the proper proportions for four bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Yersinia enterocolitica. As little as 2 to 5 pmol per muropeptide was detected when the intensity of the fluorescent signal was measured with a charge-coupled device camera, at a level of sensitivity between 50 and 250 times higher than that of the classic HPLC technique. Thus, FACE may be used to identify interesting peptidoglycan samples prior to more-extensive analysis by HPLC, or FACE may eventually replace HPLC for some applications.
TI  - [The anticomplement activity of the commercial strain of Bacillus cereus IP 5832  and of enterobacteria when cocultured].
AB  - Bacillus cereus production strain IP 5832 of the preparation "Bactisubtil" has been characterized with respect to its anticomplementary activity (ACA) and the parameters of its heterogeneity in the process of adaptation to trypticase-soybean medium and during cultivation in anaerobic conditions have been determined. The cultivation of B.cereus strain IP 5832 jointly with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, isolated in enteric disbiosis, affects ACA in different ways, which leads to structural changes in the populations of these enterobacteria, characterized by an increase of their heterogeneity with respect to ACA.
TI  - [Current aspects of the fecal flora of the newborn without antibiotherapy during  the first 7 days of life: Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, staphylococci].
AB  - Last years, il became obvious that the colonization pattern described in 1976-1978 was no more valid: early colonization by Enterobacteriaceae at the 2-3 rd day of life in all newborns, with constant presence of antibioresistant strainseven in non treated newborns. To establish the new pattern of colonization, the same quantitative method of dilution and culture on selective media was used daily from day 1 to day 7 (5 days only for M). The number of Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci and staphylococci was determined in the stools of 10 newborns in the Maternity unit (= M) (term 40 weeks +/- 1, birth weight 3,356 g +/- 383), 10 in the Premature nursery (= P) (term 34.9 weeks +/- 1, birth weight 2,457 g +/- 676), and 14 in the Neonatal intensive care unit (= R) (term 35.2 weeks +/- 3.8, birth weight 2,457 g +/- 763). The results establish that colonization by Enterobacteriaceae is no more constant at D3. It could be demonstrated only in 8/10 M, 1/10 P, and 6/14 R (statistically different - p < 0.01 - between M and P). At D5, 9/10 M, 5/10 P, 10/14 R, and at D7, 6/10 P and 10/14 R were colonized. Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae) could be found in only 3/10 M, 4/10 P and 6/14 R. Enterococci could be found in 1 newborn M, 2 P and 7 newborns R. Staphylococci appeared earlier: all newborns M, P and R were colonized at D2, 4 and 5 respectively. These bacteria were coagulase negative, associated with Staphylococcus aureus in 3 P. Our hypothesis is that late colonization with Enterobacteriaceae and enterococci is due to the improvement of hygiene procedures and due to the decontaminating effect of antibiotics in other treated newborns (Enterobacteriaceae by 3 rd generation cephalosporin and enterococci by pharyngeal vancomycin).
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 567 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1994 to May 1995. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 26.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 73.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis. Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC) and biapenem (BIPM) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA. VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) were not so active with the MIC90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis. MINO showed the strongest activity against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. ABK was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Cephems were active with the MIC90s of 2 approximately 16 micrograms/ml, but penicillins and quinolones were not so active with the MIC90s and 64 approximately 128 micrograms/ml. 4. Citrobacter freundii. Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activities against C. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. IPM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 5. Enterobacter cloacae. IPM showed the highest activities against E. cloacae. Its MIC90 was 0.5 microgram/ml. GM and amikacin (AMK), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosulfloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except latamoxef (LMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Escherichia coli. Most of antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. CPR, CZOP, IPM, carumonam (CRMN), CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), flomoxef (FMOX) CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), and LMOX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneumoniae. CRMN showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae. Its MIC90 was < or = 0.125 microgram/ml. CZOP was also active with the MIC90 of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Proteus mirabilis. P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, CAZ, LMOX, CRP, cefpodoxime (CPDX), CRMN, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MINO was not so active with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most of the agents were not so active against P. aeruginosa. IPM showed MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. CPFX showed MIC50 of 0.5 microgram/ml.
TI  - The role of residues glutamate-50 and phenylalanine-496 in Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase.
AB  - Several enzymes require thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) as an essential cofactor, and we have used one of these, pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC; EC 4.1.1.1) from Zymomonas mobilis, as a model for this group of enzymes. It is well suited for this purpose because of its stability, ease of purification, homotetrameric subunit structure and simple kinetic properties. Crystallographic analyses of three ThDP-dependent enzymes [Muller, Lindqvist, Furey, Schulz, Jordan and Schneider (1993) Structure 1, 95-103] have suggested that an invariant glutamate participates in catalysis. In order to evaluate the role of this residue, identified in PDC from Zymomonas mobilis as Glu-50, it has been altered to glutamine and aspartate by site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned gene. The mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. Here we demonstrate that substitution with aspartate yields an enzyme with 3% of the activity of the wild-type, but with normal kinetics for pyruvate. Replacement of Glu-50 with glutamine yields an enzyme with only 0.5% of the catalytic activity of the wild-type enzyme. Each of these mutant enzymes has a decreased affinity for both ThDP and Mg2+. It has been reported that the binding of cofactors to apoPDC quenches the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence [Diefenbach and Duggleby (1991) Biochem. J. 276, 439-445] and we have identified the residue responsible as Trp-487 [Diefenbach, Candy, Mattick and Duggleby (1992) FEBS Lett. 296, 95-98]. Although this residue is some distance from the cofactor binding site, it lies in the dimer interface, and the proposal has been put forward [Dyda, Furey, Swaminathan, Sax, Farrenkopf and Jordan (1993) Biochemistry 32, 6165-6170] that alteration of ring stacking with Phe-496 of the adjacent subunit is the mechanism of fluorescence quenching when cofactors bind. The closely related enzyme indolepyruvate decarboxylase (from Enterobacter cloacae) has a leucine residue at the position corresponding to Phe-496 but shows fluorescence quenching properties that are similar to those of PDC. This suggests that the fluorescence quenching is due to some perturbation of the local environment of Trp-487 rather than to a specific interaction with Phe-496. This latter hypothesis is supported by our data: mutation of this phenylalanine to leucine, isoleucine or histidine in PDC does not eliminate the fluorescence quenching upon addition of cofactors.
TI  - Gram-negative bacteremia in four patients with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome.
AB  
TI  - Characterization of a Cys115 to Asp substitution in the Escherichia coli cell wall biosynthetic enzyme UDP-GlcNAc enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA) that confers resistance to inactivation by the antibiotic fosfomycin.
AB  - The antibiotic fosfomycin inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by inactivation of UDP-GlcNAc enolpyruvyl tranferase (MurA). Prior work has established that Cys115 of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae MurA is the active site nucleophile alkylated by fosfomycin and implicated this residue in the formation of a covalent phospholactyl-enzyme adduct derived from substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). On the basis of sequencing information from putative MurA homolog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we generated a C115D mutant of E. coli MurA that was highly active but fully resistant to time-dependent inhibition by fosfomycin. Fosfomycin still bound to the active site of C115D MurA, as established by the observed reversible competitive inhibition by fosfomycin. Fosfomycin still bound to the active site of C115D MurA, as established by the observed reversible competitive inhibition vs PEP. In contrast to the broad pH-independent behavior of wild-type (WT) MurA, C115D mutant activity titrated across the pH range examined (pH 5.5-9) with an apparent pKa approximately 6, with kcatC115D ranging from approximately 10kcatWT at pH 5.5 to <0.1kcatWT at pH9.0. Km(PEP)115D was relatively constant in the pH range examined and increased approximately 100-fold relative to Km(PEP)WT. A fosfomycin-resistant C115E mutant with -1% activity of the C115D mutant was found to follow a pH dependence similar to that observed for C115D MurA. The contrasting pH dependences of WT and C115D MurA was also observed in the reaction with the pseudosubstrate, (Z)-3-fluorophosphoenolpyruvate, strongly suggesting a role for Cys/Asp115 as the general acid in the protonation of C-3 of PEP during MurA-catalyzed enol ether transfer. The difference in nucleophilicity between the carboxylate side chains of Asp115 and Glu115 and the thiolate group of Cys115 suggests that covalent enzyme adduct formation is not required for catalytic turnover and, furthermore, provides a chemical rationale for the resistance of the C115D and C115E mutants to fosfomycin inactivation.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of l-ofloxacin and FK037 to other agents against 10,040 fresh clinical isolates.
AB  - Fresh clinical isolates collected from November 1, 1992 through November 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including FK037 and l-ofloxacin. Among the 10 040 organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 455), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), Staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), Staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), Escherichia coli (n = 2326), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), Proteus mirabilis (n = 445), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). Both l-ofloxacin and FK037 inhibited 98% of S. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. FK037 was at least 4 times more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against MRSA, inhibiting 79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. While the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.
TI  - Bacterial reduction of N-oxides of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNA).
AB  - 1. Contrary to established metabolic pattern, a recent investigation of NNK metabolism produced in rat urine higher levels of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) than their N-oxides, suggesting that reconversion of N-oxides could occur after urine formation. 2. To verify the possible role of bacteria in the reduction of NNK-N-oxide and NNAL-N-oxide to their respective parent compounds, NNK and NNAL, in smokers with urinary tract infection (UTI), the N-oxides were isolated from the urine of rats treated with [5-3H]NNK and individually incubated at 37 degrees C with ten bacterial species in sterile human urine under different pH regimens. After incubation with the bacteria, aliquots of culture media were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with radiochemical detection. 3. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis possessed varying capacity to regenerate NNK and NNAL from their N-oxides while others showed no detectable reductive capability within 24 h. 4. This result constitutes the first experimental evidence that in tobacco users with concomitant UTI, bacterial regeneration of the procarcinogenic NNK and NNAL from their N-oxides could occur in the bladder leading to increased carcinogen burden in these individuals.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of sulopenem, a new parenteral penem antibiotic].
AB  - Sulopenem, a new penem antibiotic, was compared with other antibiotics with regard to in vitro antibacterial and bactericidal activities, stabilization against beta-lactamases, and effect on the release of lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Sulopenem showed more potent activities than other antibiotics against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria except Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2. Sulopenem showed potent bactericidal activities (MIC/MBC) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Time kill studies against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii showed potent bactericidal activities of sulopenem. 3. Sulopenem was found to possess a stronger activity than other antibiotics against beta-lactamase-producing strains except P. aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. 4. In particular, sulopenem was found to be more stable to the hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases produced by Gram-negative bacteria than any other antibiotics tested. Vmax/Km values of sulopenem were smaller than those of cefotiam for all tested beta-lactamases, which reflected a broad antibacterial spectrum of sulopenem. 5. E. coli ML4707 exposed to sulopenem and imipenem released less endotoxin than did controls at all concentration ranges tested. In contrast, the strain exposed to ceftazidime at bacteriostatic concentrations released a large amount of endotoxin.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - Piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of hospitalized patients with urinary tract infections: an open non-comparative and multicentered trial.
AB  - The aim of this multicentered, prospective and open study was to determine the clinical and bacteriological efficacy and safety of piperacillin/tazobactam (4g/500 mg IV tid) in the treatment of 79 adult patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTI) requiring hospitalization. Forty-seven women and 32 men (mean age 54.2 years, and range 21-91) from 4 Argentinean and 6 Mexican hospitals were enrolled. Sixty-one clinically and bacteriologically evaluable patients were treated for a mean of 9.1 days (range 5-15). A favorable clinical response was seen in 83.6% and 80% at early and late assessment, respectively. Bacteriological eradication was achieved in 85.3% and 80% at early and late estimation, respectively. Escherichia coli was isolated in 33 cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 8, Enterococcus spp. in 7, Proteus mirabilis in 6, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3, Enterobacter spp. and Morganella morganii in 2. While 21% of all the clinical isolates were resistant to piperacillin, none of them was initially resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam. However, one female patient with a persistent UTI caused by E. coli developed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam during treatment. A 64-year-old man with frontal meningioma developed purulent meningitis due to Enterobacter cloacae after neurosurgery. He was initially treated with ciprofloxacin, rifampin and amikacin and because of persistence of fever, he was moved to piperacillin/tazobactam. After 5 days of therapy, he developed coma secondary to intracranial hemorrhage and died. By then, the platelet count was normal (220,000/microliters), but the prothrombin time (19.5 seconds) and the partial thromboplastin time (63 seconds) were significantly prolonged. Our data suggest that piperacillin/tazobactam is a reliable therapy for complicated, non-complicated, community or hospital-acquired UTI.
TI  - Enterobacter cloacae producing a Shiga-like toxin II-related cytotoxin associated with a case of hemolytic-uremic syndrome.
AB  - Two Shiga-like toxin-producing organisms were isolated from the feces of an infant with hemolytic-uremic syndrome by PCR followed by colony blot hybridization. One strain was identified as Escherichia coli OR:H9, while the other was identified as Enterobacter cloacae. Both isolates were highly cytotoxic for Vero cells, and Southern hybridization analysis of chromosomal DNA indicated that both contained a single slt-II-related gene and that these genes were located on similarly sized restriction fragments. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the toxin encoded by the E. cloacae slt-II-related gene was very similar to Shiga-like toxin II variants from E. coli, differing from the most closely related toxin by 3 residues in the A subunit.
TI  - [Specificities of antibacterial activity of zwitterionic 7-methoxyimino cephems (cephalosporins of fourth generation].
AB  - Zwitterionic 7-methoxyimino cephalosporins possess a variable substitution at C3  which contains a quaternary nitrogen. These cephalosporins display low affinities for class I beta-lactamase and rapid penetration through the outer membrane of Gram negative bacilli. Hence, they remain active against some, but not all, ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Antipseudomonas activities are generally similar to that of ceftazidime except that cefelidin is more active. The new zwitterionic compounds express greater antistaphylococcal potency than does ceftazidime. On the basis of structural and antibacterial characteristics the expression "forth generation" is acceptable to describe the wzitterionic 7-methoxyimino cephalosporins.
TI  - Incidence and susceptibility of aerobic Gram-negative bacilli from 20 Canadian intensive care units: 1989-1993.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Canadian intensive care units. DESIGN: The antimicrobial profiles of 1939 Gram-negative bacilli isolated in 20 Canadian intensive care units were analyzed using a custom designed MicroScan panel. SETTING: The majority of the hospitals were tertiary care institutions, but some community hospitals were included. PATIENTS: Adult intensive care unit patients were the sources of isolates. MAIN RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated microorganism overall, with Escherichia coli the most common initial isolate. Comparison of initial and repeat isolates showed that P aeruginosa readily acquired resistance to all antibiotic classes except the aminoglycosides. Enterobacter aerogenes developed resistance to ciprofloxacin and Enterobacter cloacae demonstrated resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics except for imipenem on repeat isolation. Other Enterobacteriaceae remained susceptible. Historical comparison with data derived four years previously from 15 of the centres showed increased resistance of P aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species to ciprofloxacin while other susceptibility patterns remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Gram-negative resistance in Canadian hospitals is less than that reported in surveys done in some other countries, and was relatively stable over four years.
TI  - Prevalence of microorganisms in dead mink kits from Aleutian-disease-infected and non-infected farms.
AB  - Bacterial and fungi were isolated from different tissues (brain, liver, heart) taken from 81 dead newborn mink originating from Aleutian disease (AD) infected and AD-non-infected farms. Of the 123 isolates obtained, 96% were bacterial isolates (predominantly Gram-negative) and 4% were fungi. The prevalence of microorganisms appeared less common in kits from AD-non-infected farms (55%) than from AD-infected farms (73%), although the difference was not significant. The liver was the most highly infected site in both groups and generally was only infected by one microorganism species. Proteus spp (23%), Escherichia coli (16%), Staphylococcus aureus (11%) and Enterobacter cloacae (9%) were the most frequently isolated germs. These findings are similar to those of other studies but the role of these microorganisms as specific pathogens or secondary invaders remains controversial.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight European countries.
AB  - In this multicenter study conducted in eight European countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, five in Germany, in the Netherlands and Switzerland, four in Greece and Spain, three in Hungary and one in Finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor system, BBL, Heidelberg, Germany) were used throughout all assays. The most frequently encountered species were: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid Salmonella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Moraxella catarrhalis and Shigella spp. The percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and European-wide with all the data available. For many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. However, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-G-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in Hungary and Spain; some of the low-level penicillin-G-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. The high frequency of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates in Spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. The penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against Gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against Gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance and prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase among clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria in Riyadh.
AB  - The activity of ciprofloxacin, imipenem and 12 other commonly used antibiotics was evaluated against 106 documented clinical isolates from a medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The resistance rates to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, aztreonam and ceftazidime were 42, 25, 24 and 21%, respectively. Apart from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and imipenem. Complete cross resistance among tested beta-lactam groups was uniformly evident in Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and P. aeruginosa. On the other hand, penicillins and second generation cephalosporins showed cross resistance among Escherichia coli and Klebseilla pneumoniae isolates. Induction experiments indicate that 70 and 62% of P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae or C. freundii produce class I cephalosporinase, respectively. Among all tested isolates, plasmid mediated extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was detected in one isolate of K. pneumoniae. The plasmid mediated beta-lactamase is transferable and inhibited by beta-lactamase inhibitors. The transconjugates not only expressed resistance to extended spectrum beta-lactams and aztreonam but also toward tested aminoglycoside antibiotics, with the exception of gentamicin. The obtained transconjugates conferred high level resistance to ceftazidime and aztreonam but considerably low resistance to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. The isoelectric point for the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase is 8.2.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial properties of T-5575 and T-5578 novel parenteral 2-carboxypenams.
AB  - T-5575 and T-5578, novel 2-carboxypenams in which a carboxyl group has been introduced into the C-2 beta position of the nucleus, were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial properties. The spectrum of activity of T-5575 was similar to that of aztreonam. However, it showed stronger activities than those of aztreonam against most gram-negative bacteria. T-5575 also showed potent activities against isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime, with MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited of 0.39, 0.39, and 3.13 microgram/ml, respectively. T-5578 showed moderate levels of activity against gram-negative bacteria, compared with those of T-5575. Its activity against P. aeruginosa, however, was superior to those of T-5575 and the reference drugs tested. The most characteristic feature of T-5578 was its potent activities against ceftazidime-, imipenem-, and gentamicin-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates, with MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited at 0.39, 3.13, and 3.13 microgram/ml, respectively. These two compounds were unfortunately poorly active against gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci. Both compounds were found to be stable for hydrolysis by various kinds of beta-lactamases and to have low affinities for these enzymes, with Ki values of > 100 microM. These novel penams bound most tightly to penicillin-binding protein 3 of Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results indicate that T-5575 and T-5578 can be regarded as promising 2-carboxypenams specially targeted against gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Isolation and sequence analysis of rpoH genes encoding sigma 32 homologs from gram negative bacteria: conserved mRNA and protein segments for heat shock regulation.
AB  - The rpoH genes encoding homologs of Escherichia coli sigma 32 (heat shock sigma factor) were isolated and sequenced from five gram negative proteobacteria (gamma or alpha subgroup): Enterobacter cloacae (gamma), Serratia marcescens (gamma), Proteus mirabilis (gamma), Agrobacterium tumefaciens (alpha) and Zymomonas mobilis (alpha). Comparison of these and three known genes from E.coli (gamma), Citrobacter freundii (gamma) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma) revealed marked similarities that should reflect conserved function and regulation of sigma 32 in the heat shock response. Both the sequence complementary to part of 16S rRNA (the 'downstream box') and a predicted mRNA secondary structure similar to those involved in translational control of sigma 32 in E.coli were found for the rpoH genes from the gamma, but not the alpha, subgroup, despite considerable divergence in nucleotide sequence. Moreover, a stretch of nine amino acid residues Q(R/K)(K/R)LFFNLR, designated the 'RpoH box', was absolutely conserved among all sigma 32 homologs, but absent in other sigma factors; this sequence overlapped with the segment of polypeptide thought to be involved in DnaK/DnaJ chaperone-mediated negative control of synthesis and stability of sigma 32. In addition, a putative sigma E (sigma 24)-specific promoter was found in front of all rpoH genes from the gamma, but not alpha, subgroup. These results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms, as well as the function, of the heat shock response known in E.coli are very well conserved among the gamma subgroup and partially conserved among the alpha proteobacteria.
TI  - [Pathogenic bacteria isolated from the sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema].
AB  - Isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume (FEV1.0), PaO2 and PaCO2. VC of the patients from whom MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) or Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Branhamella catarrhalis (B. catarrhalis) or Haemophilus influenza (H. influenza) were isolated. FEV1.0 had a similar tendency as VC in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. Similarly, PO2 of the patients from whom MSSA or E. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated, and PCO2 of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza were isolated. There was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom MSSA, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Xanthomonas maltophilia (X. maltophilia) or Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom S. pneumonia, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated. These results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza to MSSA, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, X. maltophilia or E. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. The treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpirome against selected clinical enterobacterial isolates with beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that there is a high incidence of resistance to cephalosporins among enterobacteria isolated in Greek hospitals. This resistance is mainly due to either the derepression of chromosomal cephalosporinases or the acquisition of plasmids coding for SHV-5 type beta-lactamase. In the present study the activity of cefpirome against a number of enterobacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Serratia marcescens) possessing the mechanisms mentioned above was examined. Cefpirome was found active against all the strains characterized by stable derepression of chromosomal class-C enzymes. The antibiotic was less potent against strains expressing SHV-5 type beta-lactamase due to its hydrolysis by the enzyme. Also cefpirome exhibited good activity against E. aerogenes strains with reduced susceptibility to imipenem. These in vitro data suggest that cefpirome might be useful in treating infections caused by these resistant microorganisms that are frequently encountered in Greek hospitals.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 657 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1993 to May 1994.

TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

Gentamicin (GM) and arbekacin (ABK) were also active with the MIC90s of 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. But minocycline (MINO) and penicillins were not so active showing the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 7.

TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1990). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 848 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1990 to May 1991. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 23.9% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 76.1% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis: Ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC) was also active with the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus: VCM and arbekacin (ABK) showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 1 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Escherichia coli: Cefozopran (CZOP), carumonam (CRMN) and ofloxacin (OFLX) showed the highest activities against E. coli isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. IPM, cefotiam (CTM) and cefmenoxime (CMX) were also active with the MIC90s of 0.25 micrograms/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 4. Klebsiella pneumoniae: Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and CRMN showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. IPM and gentamicin (GM) were also active with the MIC90s of 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. All other cephems were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii: GM and IPM showed the highest activities against C. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. Amikacin (AMK) was also active with the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active. 6. Enterobacter cloacae: IPM and GM showed the highest activities against E. cloacae isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them MIC90s of 0.5 microgram/ml. AMK and OFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems generally showed lower activities. 7. Proteus mirabilis: Most of the agents were active against P. mirabilis. Cephems were generally active with the MIC90s in a range of < or = 0.125 microgram/ml-4 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Nosocomial bacteremia-induced increases in abscess formation correlate with in vitro upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to common nosocomial pathogens can alter the host response to a later, distant infectious insult (peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation), and that these changes are related to the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. DESIGN: A multiexperiment, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Animal research laboratory of a university medical center. SUBJECTS: One hundred sixty-five Balb/c mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were used for in vivo experiments and as the source of peritoneal macrophages for in vitro experiments. INTERVENTIONS: Nine groups of mice (n = 10 to 18 per group) were twice systemically preexposed to sublethal amounts of live Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, or Candida albicans, or to 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms E. coli lipopolysaccharide O26:B6. One week later, mice underwent the induction of mixed E. coli/Bacteroides fragilis peritonitis, leading to abscess formation. In parallel experiments in vitro, 10(6) mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with similar amounts of nosocomial pathogens or lipopolysaccharide to determine the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The three Gram-negative bacilli tested significantly upregulated both abscess formation and macrophage procoagulant activity, with a strong linear correlation between abscess formation and procoagulant activity. These effects were not seen with the Gram-positive cocci or with C. albicans. Pre-exposure of mice to endotoxin alone did not alter later abscess formation, but did increase macrophage procoagulant activity. CONCLUSIONS: Sublethal exposure to some Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens can significantly alter a host's response to a later, distant, infection, even when caused by different bacteria. In the case of peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation, these changes may be mediated by the upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity. The presence of endotoxin alone does not completely explain these phenomena.
TI  - Antibiotic-induced endotoxin release in patients with gram-negative urosepsis: a  double-blind study comparing imipenem and ceftazidime.
AB  - The clinical significance of differences between antibiotics in endotoxin-liberating potential is unknown. Thirty patients with gram-negative urosepsis were randomized between imipenem and ceftazidime, which have, respectively, a low and a high endotoxin-liberating potential in vitro. In patients treated with ceftazidime, a slower defervescence was noticed. After 4 h of treatment, the blood endotoxin level decreased in all 3 endotoxemic patients receiving imipenem, whereas it increased in 2 of the 4 endotoxemic patients receiving ceftazidime, and in ceftazidime-treated patients, the endotoxin level in urine decreased less than in imipenem-treated subjects. Serum and urine cytokine levels increased 10%-40% after 4 h of ceftazidime treatment compared with no increase in the imipenem-treated patients (P > .05). Endotoxin release during antibiotic killing in vitro, assessed for all microorganisms, was 10-fold higher with ceftazidime (P < .001). These results indicate that differences between antibiotics in endotoxin release may affect the inflammatory response during treatment.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1989 to May 1990. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis Imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The followings, ampicillin (ABPC) and vancomycin (VCM) showed potent activities, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC), minocycline (MINO) and chloramphenicol (CP) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus VCM showed the highest activity against S. aureus with MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Dicloxacillin (MDIPC) and arbekacin (ABK) were active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. MINO showed the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. All other agents except ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed lower activity. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis MINO showed the highest activity against S. epidermidis. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. The followings, ABK and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others except CPFX were not so active. 4. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) Most of the agents were active against CNS. IPM, ABK and MINO showed the highest activities with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MDIPC, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml. Clindamycin (CLDM) showed lower activity, with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 5. Streptococcus agalactiae CEZ, cefuzonam (CZON), IPM and CLDM showed the potent activity, all strains were inhibited at the MIC of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. The followings, cefmenoxime (CMX) and erythromycin (EM) were active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. PIPC and VCM were also active with the MIC90S 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively Amikacin (AMK) showed lower activity. Escherichia coli IPM, CTM, flomoxef (FMOX), CMX, carumonam (CRMN), norfloxacin (NFLX), ofloxacin (OFLX) and CPFX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were .125 microgram/ml or below. ceftazidime (CAZ) and CZON were also active with the MIC90S of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins except mecillinam (MPC) were not so active showing the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneuminiae FMOX, CMX, cefixime (CFIX), IPM, CRMN and NFLX showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Typing of sequential bacterial isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - We typed 39 sets of multiple bacterial isolates of the same species from patients by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA (PFGE). Isolates were cultured from different sites or over a 2-week or longer interval. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae were tested. Excluding E. cloacae, 28 of 32 sets of isolates (87%) demonstrated only identical or highly related PFGE types. Four of the seven sets of E. cloacae showed different types. For species other than E. cloacae, our results suggest that patients are usually colonized and infected with a single strain of these bacterial pathogens. Unlike all of the other tested species, E. cloacae PFGE typing differences suggested the presence of multiple strains causing colonization and infection.
TI  - Inhibitory action of metabolites of Pseudomonas aeruginosa against gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  - Fifty clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested for inhibition of growth of clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella infantis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Gram-negative bacteria in the authors' laboratory. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was strongly active against both E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae, with 89.4% and 94.7% inhibition respectively, but weakly active against S. infantis, K. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis with 56.3%, 48.8% and 23.8% inhibition, respectively. The pigmented strains were found to have stronger antimicrobial activity than the unpigmented strains. Pyocyanin, the major metabolite of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been shown to inhibit Escherichia coli, Proteus spp. and other Gram-negative bacteria, by research with a few strains of P. aeruginosa and a single inhibited strain. However, little attempt has been made to determine the inhibitory action of many strains of P. aeruginosa against a large number of clinical isolates such as Escherichia spp., Klebsiella spp., and Salmonella spp., up to now. For this reason, in this study we examined 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa for inhibition of growth of a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria, including 30 strains of E. coli, 30 of K. pneumoniae, 30 of S. infantis, 6 of Enterobacter cloacae and 9 of Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Multidrug resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae: a novel gene, ramA, confers a multidrug resistance phenotype in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Spontaneous multidrug-resistant (Mdr) mutants of Klebsiella pneumoniae strain ECL8 arose at a frequency of 2.2 x 10(-8) and showed increased resistance to a range of unrelated antibiotics, including chloramphenicol, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, ampicillin, norfloxacin, trimethoprim and puromycin. A chromosomal fragment from one such mutant was cloned, and found to confer an Mdr phenotype on Escherichia coli K12 cells that was essentially identical to that of the K. pneumoniae mutant. Almost complete loss of the OmpF porin in the E. coli transformant, and of the corresponding porin in the K. pneumoniae mutant, was observed. The presence of the Mdr mutation in K. pneumoniae or the cloned K. pneumoniae ramA (resistance antibiotic multiple) locus in E. coli also resulted in active efflux of tetracycline, and increased active efflux of chloramphenicol. After transformation of a ramA plasmid into E. coli, expression of chloramphenicol resistance occurred later than expression of resistance to tetracycline, puromycin, trimethoprim and nalidixic acid. The ramA gene was localized and sequenced. It encodes a putative positive transcriptional activator that is weakly related to the E. coli MarA and SoxS proteins. A ramA gene was also found to be present in an Enterobacter cloacae fragment that has previously been shown to confer an Mdr phenotype, and it appears that ramA, rather than the romA gene identified in that study, is responsible for multidrug resistance. The ramA gene from the wild-type K. pneumoniae was identical to that of the mutant strain and also conferred an Mdr phenotype on E. coli, indicating that the mutation responsible for Mdr in K. pneumoniae had not been cloned.
TI  - Effects of mutations and deletions on expression of the Enterobacter cloacae ompX gene.
AB  - The Enterobacter cloacae outer membrane protein OmpX is involved in resistance to beta-lactams, and possesses virulence characteristics. To gain more insight into the genetic elements that are important for OmpX expression, several mutations were introduced at, and immediately upstream of, the N-terminus of the OmpX coding sequence. These mutations enabled us to delete the 5' untranslated region and the signal peptide coding sequence. The former led to decreased ompX expression, indicating an unexpected and hitherto unexplained role for this region. Deletion of the signal peptide coding sequence blocked transport across the cytoplasmic membrane, indicating that translocation of OmpX across the cytoplasmic membrane is mediated by the general secretory pathway.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Helichrysum aureonitens (Asteraceae).
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extracts from Helichrysum aureonitens was investigated. The dichloromethane extract was active against all five gram positive bacteria tested and the methanol extract was active only against Bacillus cereus, B. pumilus and Micrococcus kristinae, while the water extract had no activity against any of the organisms. None of the extracts inhibited the growth of the five gram negative bacteria tested.
TI  - Ceftibuten: a review of antimicrobial activity, spectrum and other microbiologic  features.
AB  - Ceftibuten is a new, orally administered cephalosporin with exceptional beta-lactamase stability and potency against commonly isolated Gram-negative pathogens. More than 90% of recent Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were inhibited by < or = 8 micrograms/ml of ceftibuten. In only five enteric species (Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens) were more than 15% of strains resistant (minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC, with percent of strains inhibited in subscript numbers) > 16 micrograms/ml) to ceftibuten. Enteritis-producing bacteria such as Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia coli and Yersinia were very ceftibuten-susceptible (MIC50 < or = 0.13 microgram/ml). Fastidious Gram-negative species causing respiratory tract or genital infections had very low ceftibuten MICs, including beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.06 to 2 micrograms/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml). Beta-hemolytic streptococci and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci were also inhibited by ceftibuten. Staphylococci, enterococci, Pseudomonas species and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria were generally resistant to ceftibuten. Ceftibuten has demonstrated bactericidal activity against susceptible pathogens, has high affinity for several lethal penicillin-binding proteins and possesses stability to common plasmid- or chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases, including those enzymes that hydrolyze parenteral third generation cephalosporins. The microbiologic features for ceftibuten indicate its clinical potential as chemotherapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of FK037: a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antibacterial and bactericidal activities and the stability of FK037 to beta-lactamases were investigated and compared with those of cefpirome, flomoxef, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and vancomycin. Against clinical isolates of methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, FK037 was less active than vancomycin but more potent than the other drugs tested. Among highly methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC for methicillin: 200 mg/l or higher), none of the strains were highly resistant to FK037 (MIC > or = 100 mg/l) unlike the other cephalosporins. With the exception of Enterococcus faecalis, FK037 had an activity equipotent to that of cefpirome and far superior to those of flomoxef, ceftazidime and ceftizoxime against other gram-positive clinical isolates. The activity of FK037 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas cepacia was equipotent to that of cefpirome but 2- to 4-fold less active than that of ceftazidime. FK037 inhibited 90% of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii growth at a concentration of 6.25 mg/l; it was as active as cefpirome and much more active than ceftazidime. Against the other gram-negative bacteria tested, FK037 was equipotent to cefpirome and ceftazidime and was more effective than flomoxef. FK037, like cefpirome, portrayed a high stability to various beta-lactamases except type II penicillinase and oxyimino-cephalosporinase (CXase). FK037 scored an MIC range of 0.013-6.25 mg/l against numerous beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains with the exception of some CXase-producing strains and a cephalosporinase-producing C. freundii; and against strains other than P. aeruginosa FK037 was as active as cefpirome and 2- to 32-fold more active than ceftazidime. FK037 displayed highly potent activities against cephalosporinase-producing E. cloacae, C. freundii and Serratia marcescens which were resistant to flomoxef and ceftizoxime. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus and Escherichia coli at its MIC or higher.
TI  - Biological and immunological comparisons of Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia  coli porins.
AB  - Bacteriocin susceptibilities indicate that during cloacin DF13 uptake the F porin of Enterobacter cloacae plays a similar role to that reported for the OmpF porin of Escherichia coli during colicin A entry. The translocatory activities of these two porins during the bacteriocin uptake can be substituted by the porins D and OmpC, respectively, under conditions not requiring the receptor binding step. Using anti-peptide antibodies, a peptide located in the internal loop L3 of the Escherichia coli OmpF porin was identified in the D and F porins of Enterobacter cloacae. The results demonstrated the existence of a close relationship between porins in terms of both antigenic determinants and bacteriocin susceptibilities.
TI  - Emergence and mechanisms of bacterial resistance in surgical infections.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is commonplace among bacteria involved in surgical infections, including Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides species. Resistance traits can be encoded on chromosomes or transmissible plasmids. The basic mechanisms of resistance are alteration of drug target, prevention of drug access to target, and drug inactivation. Examples include alteration of penicillin-binding proteins in resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins, ribosomal binding site protection in tetracycline resistance, and beta-lactamase destruction of beta-lactam compounds. Resistance due to the many types of beta-lactamases that have thus far been identified is wide-spread among common pathogens; use of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations has proved effective as one means of counteracting such resistance. Contending with resistance involves appropriate use of available antimicrobials, development of novel agents or modification of existing agents, and measures to forestall emergence and spread of resistant organisms.
TI  - Control-related effective regrowth time and post-antibiotic effect of meropenem on gram-negative bacteria studied by bioluminescence and viable counts.
AB  - A study was performed to compare viable counts and bioluminescence for determining control related effective regrowth time (CERT) and postantibiotic effect (PAE) on Gram-negative bacteria after two hours of exposure to meropenem. There was a good correlation between bioluminescence and viable counts in determining the cell numbers in growing cultures of Escherichia coli. CERT was defined as the time required for the resumption of logarithmic growth and an increase of 1 log10 to occur over the pre-exposure inoculum in the test culture minus corresponding time for the control culture. PAE and CERT were studied on reference strains of Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. At 4 x MIC of meropenem the CERTs of these four Gram-negative strains were 4.1, 4.9, 4.2, and 3.6 h, respectively, when assayed by bioluminescence. Corresponding CERTs using viable counts were 4.2, 5.0, 5.1 and 3.8 h, respectively. In contrast to this good agreement between the methods in assessing CERT, the corresponding PAEs were highly method dependent. At 4 x MIC of meropenem the PAEs on E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were 3.9, 4.8, 4.7, and 3.5 h, respectively, when assayed by bioluminescene. However, the corresponding and simultaneously determined viable count PAEs were -0.4, 0.5, -0.1, and 0.7 h, respectively. The poor correlation between these methods in assessing the PAE is caused by greater initial decrease in viability compared with the less prominent initial change in cell density as measured by bioluminescence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Pharmacodynamic effects of meropenem on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro initial killing and post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of meropenem on five gram-negative reference strains were evaluated by bioluminescence assay of bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and viable count. Morphology studies were performed in parallel. Meropenem showed concentration-dependent long (2-5 h) PAEs on Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens when assayed by bioluminescence and induced spheroplasts at almost all concentrations. The bioluminescence PAEs reached a maximum response at 4 x MIC. These PAEs of meropenem on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens were longer than corresponding PAEs of imipenem shown in previous studies. The higher affinity of meropenem than imipenem for PBP 3 might explain the longer PAEs obtained with meropenem. However, there was only a very short PAE, no PAE or even a negative PAE when viable count was used as the initial value for the PAE calculation. A strong initial decrease in viability but a less pronounced change in intracellular ATP was registered. Since this initial change in cell numbers is the initial value for the PAE calculation, the length of PAE was highly method dependent. In summary, a strong initial killing and no PAE were shown using viable count as the initial value for the PAE calculation, but a weak initial killing and long PAEs were shown when bioluminescence was used throughout the experiments.
TI  - Cephalosporin derivatives of doxorubicin as prodrugs for activation by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates.
AB  - The synthesis of a series of cephalosporin doxorubicin derivatives that differ with respect to the substituent at position 7 of the cephem nucleus is described. These compounds are designed as prodrugs of doxorubicin for activation by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates. The key step in the synthesis of this series of compounds involves the use of the phenylacetamido group as an enzymatically removable protecting group for the 7-amino group on the cephem. In vitro cytotoxicity assays with H2981 lung adenocarcinoma cells revealed that cephalosporin doxorubicin derivatives were all less toxic than the released drug. Prodrugs containing negatively charged groups in the side chain, such as the delta-carboxybutanamido derivative 4 and the alpha-sulfophenylacetyl derivative 5, displayed the least cytotoxic activity and were 46- and 26-fold less toxic than doxorubicin, respectively. The efficiency of activation of all the prodrugs was evaluated in cytotoxicity assays on H2981 cells with the beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae P99, Escherichia coli TEM-1, and Bacillus cereus (type II). In general, the E. cloacae enzyme was found to most rapidly activate the majority of these prodrugs. Phenylacetamido prodrug 2 and delta-carboxybutanamido prodrug 4 were both activated in an immunospecific manner by L6-E. cloacae beta-lactamase, a monoclonal antibody conjugate that binds to receptors on H2981 lung adenocarcinoma cells.
TI  - Environmental contamination by organisms causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - We have examined the bedsheets, floor and bedside chairs of 33 patients with urinary tract infections for organisms causing urinary infection. In ten patients the causative organism was recovered from the undersheet, and in two of these it was also recovered from the floor and bedside chair. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis were recovered from sheets, while Group B beta-haemolytic streptococci and Candida tropicalis were also found on floors and chairs.
TI  - Molecular evolution of a class C beta-lactamase extending its substrate specificity.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae GC1, a clinical strain isolated in 1992 in Japan, was found  to produce a chromosomal class C beta-lactamase with extended substrate specificity to oxyimino beta-lactam antibiotics, significantly differing from the known E. cloacae beta-lactamases such as the P99 beta-lactamase. The 1560 nucleotides including the GC1 beta-lactamase gene were sequenced, and the amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme comprising 364 amino acids was deduced. A comparison of the amino acid sequence with those of known E. cloacae beta-lactamases revealed the duplication of three amino acids at positions 208-213, i.e. Ala-Val-Arg-Ala-Val-Arg. This duplication was attributed to a tandem duplication of a 9-nucleotide sequence. The chimeric beta-lactamases produced by the chimeric genes from the GC1 and P99 beta-lactamase genes indicated that the extended substrate specificity is entirely attributed to the 3-amino acid insertion. Two mutant beta-lactamases were prepared from P99 beta-lactamase by site-directed mutagenesis, i.e. an Ala-Ala-Ala sequence was inserted before or after the native Ala-Val-Arg at positions 208-210. These mutant enzymes revealed that the Ala-Val-Arg located from positions 211 to 213 in the GC1 beta-lactamase are the newly inserted residues, and this phenomenon is independent of the characteristics of the amino acids inserted.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of 7-alkylidenecephems.
AB  - Several 7-alkylidenecephalosporins were synthesized and biologically evaluated as beta-lactamase inhibitors. The three beta-lactamase enzymes used in this study included two type C beta-lactamases, derived from Enterobacter cloacae P99 and E. cloacae SC12368, and one type A beta-lactamase, derived from Escherichia coli WC3310. Of the cephalosporins prepared, compound 7e, the sodium salt of 7-[(Z)-(2'-pyridyl)methylene]cephalosporanic acid sulfone, was found to have excellent inhibitory properties against both type C enzymes. Also, compound 7f, the sodium salt of 7-[(Z)-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)methylene]cephalosporanic acid sulfone showed high activity as an inhibitor of the type A enzyme. The inhibition kinetics of 7e were further explored. The IC50 value of 7e indicated that this compound was approximately 20-fold more active than tazobactam against the enzyme derived from E. cloacae P99 and 167-fold more active than tazobactam against the enzyme derived from E. cloacae SC12368. A plot of enzymatic activity vs incubation time with stoichiometric amounts of inhibitor reveals a rapid deactivation of the enzyme followed by an extremely slow reactivation. 7e exhibited a second-order rate constant of k3' = 5.3 x 10(6) L/mol.min, and a partition ratio of approximately 20:1 inhibitor:enzyme was determined for this inhibitor. After separation of excess inhibitor with Sephadex filtration, a rate constant of enzyme reactivation was measured at kreactiv = 1.0 x 10(-3) s-1. Following 24 h of incubation of enzyme with a large excess of inhibitor and sephadex filtration to remove excess inhibitor, the enzyme was able to recover only 43% of its original activity, indicating an irreversible component to the inhibition. Potential mechanisms of inhibition for both 7e and 7f are suggested.
TI  - FimH adhesin of type 1 pili is assembled into a fibrillar tip structure in the Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Type 1 pili are heteropolymeric mannosebinding fibers produced by all members of  the Enterobacteriaceae family. The bulk of the fiber is composed of FimA. Two macromolecular complexes responsible for mediating an interaction with mannose-containing receptors were purified from fimA- Escherichia coli by mannose affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. One complex contained only the mannose-binding adhesin, FimH, associated with FimG, a minor component of the type 1 pilus. In the other complex the FimG-FimH moiety was loosely associated with a chaperone-minor subunit complex (FimC-FimF), possibly representing an intermediate in tip fibrilla assembly. The FimC chaperone has also been shown to form a preassembly complex with FimH that has been purified and characterized previously. Purified FimC did not bind to the FimG-FimH complex but did recognize FimH dissociated from the FimG-FimH complex. Quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy revealed that the FimG-FimH complex had a thin fibrillar architecture. High-resolution electron microscopy of type 1 pili revealed that a 16-nm fibrillar tip structure with an architecture identical to that of the FimG-FimH complex was joined end-to-end to the pilus rod. In a fimH- deletion mutant, the tip fibrillae joined to pilus rods were approximately 3 nm in length. The full-length tip fibrilla was restored by complementation with the fimH gene in trans. The bipartite nature of the type 1 pilus was also demonstrated on pili purified from clinical isolates of members of the Enterobacteriaceae family arguing that it is a conserved feature of the type 1 pilus.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies to Pseudomonas pseudomallei and their potential for diagnosis of melioidosis.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for Pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens were  produced by immunizing BALB/c mice with a crude whole cell extract. Hybrids secreting MAbs specific for P. pseudomallei antigens were identified by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a panel of crude whole cell extracts from P. pseudomallei, P. cepacia, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. alcaligenes, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi, S. krefeld, S. enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Of the six specific clones, clone 5F8, which was IgM-producing and which reacted with all 56 P. pseudomallei isolates, was selected for further characterization and evaluation of its possible diagnostic potential. Results obtained from the indirect ELISA against various P. pseudomallei antigens, from direct bacterial agglutination, and from immunofluorescence tests suggested that 5F8 reacted with the surface envelope, and probably specifically with an epitope of the lipopolysaccharide. The antibody could be readily used to identify P. pseudomallei in primary culture or in a simulated hemoculture. The antibody was also used to prepare an affinity-purified antigen for use in an indirect ELISA that was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of circulating antibody in patients with acute septicemic melioidosis.
TI  - Identification and characterization of an outer membrane protein, OmpX, in Escherichia coli that is homologous to a family of outer membrane proteins including Ail of Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - We previously reported that a region of the Escherichia coli chromosome at 18 min increased E sigma E activity when cloned in multicopy (J. Mecsas, P. E. Rouviere, J. W. Erickson, T. J. Donohue, and C. A. Gross, Genes Dev. 7:2618-2628, 1993). In the present report, we identify and characterize the gene responsible for the increase in E sigma E activity. This gene is in a monocistronic operon with two promoters and a rho-independent terminator. Sequence analysis of this gene indicated that it encodes an outer membrane protein which is 83% identical to OmpX in Enterobacter cloacae, leading us to name this gene ompX. There are four other proteins that are homologous to OmpX. Several of these proteins, Ail of Yersinia enterocolitica and Rck and PagC of Salmonella typhimurium, have properties that allow bacteria to adhere to mammalian cells, survive exposure to human serum, and/or survive within macrophages. We therefore characterized strains deleted for ompX for their growth phenotypes, E sigma E activity, serum resistance, and adherence to mammalian cells. No differences in growth rates, serum resistance, or adherence to mammalian cells were observed; however, E sigma E activity was dependent on expression of OmpX in certain strain backgrounds.
TI  - In vitro activity of BMS-181139, a new carbapenem with potent antipseudomonal activity.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the carbapenem BMS-181139 were determined in comparison with those of imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. BMS-181139 was the most active against species of Pseudomonas and related genera Alteromonas and Burkholderia, with MICs for 147 of 149 isolates of < 4 micrograms/ml. Of 22 imipenem-resistant (MIC > 8 micrograms/ml) P. aeruginosa strains, only 1 required an MIC of BMS-181139 of > 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 14 requiring the same meropenem MIC. BMS-181139 was the most active carbapenem against the majority of other gram-negative species except members of the tribe Proteeae, against which meropenem was more active. Although imipenem was more active against gram-positive species, BMS-18139 MICs at which 90% of strain tested were inhibited were < 1 microgram/ml for these species. BMS-181139 was generally active against isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin or broad-spectrum cephalosporins, including those containing plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases or high levels of chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases, as well as anaerobes except Clostridium difficile. Inoculum effects were noted for all three carbapenems against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens but not Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Staphylococcus aureus. BMS-181139's inoculum effect tended to be more marked. BMS-181139 exhibited bactericidal activity at the MIC for some strains and up to four to eight times the MIC for others. The postantibiotic effect of BMS-181139 was equal to or less than that of imipenem and, like meropenem, exhibited intraspecies variability. BMS-181139 was 30-fold more stable than imipenem and 7-fold more stable than meropenem to hydrolysis by hog kidney dehydropeptidase.
TI  - Different biological conditions influencing bacterial adherence assay.
AB  - Adherence of bacteria to animal cells is considered the first step in the pathogenesis of many infectious diseases. The most suitable techniques developed in vitro to check the capacity of bacteria to adhere to different tissues use monolayers of established cell lines. We studied the influence of incubation time (1, 2, 3 hours), cell substrates (Hep-2, H-407) and the number of bacteria per cell (1, 10, 100, 1000) on the adherence index (number of adherent bacteria per cell determined by microscopic count) of the fimbriated Escherichia coli 454 strain, Proteus rettgeri 25 and Enterobacter cloacae 10. The data were analyzed with different statistical methods and the results evidenced that all the conditions considered affect either the end-point of the test or the adherence index. Our observations indicate that the different methods used make it impracticable to compare many data from the literature and suggest the need to search for more homogeneity in this type of assay.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five Mediterranean countries.
AB  - In 5 Mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, 4 centers in Greece, 3 centers in Spain, and 1 center in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia contributed to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor, BBL, Heidelberg, FRG). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (n = 1267), Proteus mirabilis (n = 843), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric Salmonella spp. (n = 629), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), Citrobacter freundii (n = 383), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 246), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and Shigella spp. (n = 185). Statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. The penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the gram-positive cocci, exceeding the MIC90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. Regarding the gram-negatives (above all Klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (MIC90 = 1 mg/l). Regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. There was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC90 = 2 mg/l). By far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 11 newer and investigational drugs tested against aerobic isolates from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of 124 aerobic bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) were tested against 11 antimicrobial agents, including parenteral or oral cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Most SBP isolates were Gram-negative organisms, and Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were responsible for 63% of the episodes evaluated. The fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) and the "fourth-generation" cephalosporin cefpirome were the most active agents against the Gram-negative bacteria. Commonly used cefotaxime and cefotaxime-desacetylcefotaxime (DES-CTX) combinations were also very active against Gram-negative bacteria with only few Enterobacter cloacae isolates being resistant (minimum inhibitory concentrations > 32 micrograms/ml). All streptococci were susceptible to cefotaxime, cefpirome, and cefdaloxime and to the cefotaxime-DES-CTX combinations, whereas only ofloxacin demonstrated acceptable activity against the enterococci. The widest spectrum of activity versus SBP isolates was found for ofloxacin (98% susceptibility) among the fluoroquinolones. For the beta-lactams, the widest spectrum of activity was demonstrated by cefpirome and the 2:1 cefotaxime-DES-CTX combination (93% susceptibility). These results indicate that the role of ofloxacin and newer parenteral or orally administered cephalosporins in the treatment of prophylaxis of SBP should be further evaluated.
TI  - Role of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor as adjunct therapy for septicemia in children with acute leukemia.
AB  - The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been shown to accelerate recovery from severe neutropenia and to decrease the incidence of documented infections after intensive chemotherapy in cancer patients. However, the routine prophylactic use of G-CSF is expensive. This study was conducted to determine the role of G-CSF as adjunct therapy for septicemia following neutropenia caused by chemotherapy in children with acute leukemia. Fifty consecutive episodes of septicemia were studied involving 34 episodes of Gram-negative, 7 episodes of Gram-positive, 5 episodes of polymicrobial bacterial septicemia, one episode of fungemia, and 3 episodes of disseminated fungal infection. In the first 25 episodes, G-CSF was not used (group A). For the next 16 episodes, G-CSF 200 micrograms per square meter per day subcutaneously was given immediately after the septicemia was documented until the absolute neutrophil count was maintained at more than 1,500 per cubic millimeter (group B). Thereafter, G-CSF at the same dose as that of group B was prophylactically used in all the children who received high-dose cytosine arabinoside-containing regimens. Nine episodes of septicemia occurred (group C). The incidences of mortality per episode of septicemia in groups A, B, and C were 12.0% (3/25), 12.5% (2/16) and 0% (0/9), respectively. Statistically, there was no difference between the three groups overall and in pair-wise comparisons (all P > 0.5). The durations of G-CSF administration in group B ranged from 6 to 26 days with a median of 12 days and the durations of G-CSF administration in group C ranged from 10 to 23 days with a median of 19 days. With or without G-CSF, there may be no significant difference in the mortality of septicemia following neutropenia caused by chemotherapy in children with acute leukemia.
TI  - Growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  - The initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. Expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". In the present study, the CSH of 133 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, group A streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus magnus, and of 8 Candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. Cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate CSH, i.e., they aggregated in 0.01-2 M ammonium sulfate. When the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher CSH, and 44 strains the same CSH as after growth without serum. The CSH of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and PDM agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The highest CSH was expressed after growth in 5% CO2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. Identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 C, 20 min) serum. The reduced surface tension obtained in 5% CO2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of CSH.
TI  - Variability of peptidoglycan structural parameters in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Muropeptide composition of peptidoglycan from the Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas sp., Acinetobacter acetoaceticus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Vibrio parahaemolyticus Yersinia enterocolitica and Escherichia coli, was analyzed by HPLC. In all instances peptidoglycan was built up from the same subunits. A wide disparity in the relative abundance of muropeptides and all structural parameters was observed. The contribution of LD-A2pm-A2pm cross-linked muropeptides was extremely variable; from 1 to 45% of cross-linked muropeptides. Muropeptides with the dipeptides Lys-Lys or Arg-Lys, indicative of murein-bound (lipo)proteins, were detected in all instances although abundance was very variable.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of SY5555 dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on SY5555 dry syrup (powder which is dissolved before use), a new penem antibiotic for oral use, were performed. The following results were obtained. 1. Antibacterial activities. MICs of SY5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefaclor (CCL) and cefdinir (CFDN) were determined against clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae at a dose of 10(6) CFU/ml. MICs of SY5555 against S. aureus, CNS, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, E. coli and E. cloacae were 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, < or = 0.025, 0.78, 0.2, 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing excellent antibacterial effects on these pathogens. Although the effects of SY 5555 against H. influenzae and E. coli were slightly inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN, the drug showed the most excellent antibacterial effect on other strains as compared with the control drugs. 2. Absorption and excretion In this study, plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates were examined after administration of SY5555 at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg (potency) after meals. With both 5 and 10 mg/kg doses, peak plasma concentrations were reached 1 hour after administration, at 0.25-2.61 micrograms/ml (mean 1.47 micrograms/ml) and 1.08-2.17 micrograms/ml (mean 1.74 micrograms/ml), respectively. The plasma levels rapidly decreased to 0.06-0.19 micrograms/ml (0.12 micrograms/ml) and 0.0503-0.0637 micrograms/ml) after 6 hours. The half-lives 1.12 hours in the 5 mg/kg group and 1.0 hour in the 10 mg/kg group. The urinary recovery rates were determined in the first 8 hours after administration in the 5 mg/kg and 6 hours in the 10 mg/kg group, and the values were as low as 1.05-12.3% and 1.6-4.33%, respectively. 3. Clinical results The clinical responses were examined in a total of 73 cases including 4 acute pneumonia, 13 acute bronchitis, 11 tonsillitis, 3 pharyngitis, 12 scarlet fever, 2 pertussis, 6 urinary tract infection, 6 otitis media, 7 lymphadenitis, 2 staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, 2 phlegmon, 4 impetigo and 1 purulent parotitis. The treatment was effective or better in 66 of 70 cases with an efficacy rate of 94.3% (3 undeterminable cases were excluded). Bacteriological effects were examined during the clinical course for detected or suspected pathogens found before administration of SY5555. The effects were determined in 50 cases including 7 cases of polymicrobacterial infections, 57 strains in total. Eight strains, however, persisted, hence the overall eradication rate was 86.0%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Disinfection of dental stone casts: antimicrobial effects and physical property alterations.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of disinfecting solutions incorporated into dental stone casts against a standard and representative group of microorganisms and to note changes in the physical properties of the casts. METHODS: Irreversible hydrocolloid impressions were contaminated individually with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Actinobacter calcoaceticus, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium phlei and Candida albicans. Four readily available disinfecting solutions (glutaraldehyde, povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite) were added to the die stone mix used to pour up the impressions. The set cast surfaces were swabbed at 1 h and 24 h, the samples plated on agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h and 3 d for M. phlei. Subsequently, colony forming units were counted. The physical properties assessed were setting time, setting expansion, compressive strength, detail reproduction and delayed expansion of the stone. RESULTS: Only glutaraldehyde and povidone-iodine killed all contaminating microorganisms within 1 h, while the 1:5 dilution of sodium hypochlorite solution was equally effective after 24 h. Two percent glutaraldehyde was the most effective disinfectant with the least adverse effects on the physical properties of the set cast. Although povidone-iodine caused a decrease in the compressive strength of the set cast, it can be considered to be a sound alternative. SIGNIFICANCE: This study supports the concept of incorporating disinfectants into model stone as a standard operating procedure for impressions of unknown history and, most sensibly, all dental impressions.
TI  - Detection of the covalent intermediate of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase by solution-state and time-resolved solid-state NMR spectroscopy.
AB  - Uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-NAG) enolpyruvyl transferase from Enterobacter cloacae catalyzes the transfer of an enolpyruvyl moiety from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to the 3-hydroxyl of UDP-NAG to form enolpyruvyl UDP-NAG and inorganic phosphate. Indirect evidence for the involvement of a covalent intermediate, in which the C-2 of O-phosphothioketal moiety is attached to Cys-115, in the reaction catalyzed by UDP-NAG enolpyruvyl transferase has been reported by Wanke and Amrhein [Wanke, C., & Amrhein, N. (1993) Eur. J. Biochem. 218, 861-870]. In the enzyme from Escherichia coli, a noncovalent tetrahedral intermediate in which the C-2 of PEP is attached to the 3-OH of UDP-NAG via an ether linkage has been isolated by Marquardt et al. [Marquardt, J.L., Brown, E.D., Walsh, C.T., & Anderson, K.S. (1993) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115, 10398-10399]. In this study, we provide direct evidence for the formation of a covalent O-phosphothioketal enzyme intermediate from UDP-NAG enolpyruvyl transferase of E. cloacae overexpressed in E. coli. The intermediate was obtained by incubation of the enzyme with [2,3-13C2]PEP and UDP-NAG and was characterized by solution-state 1D 13C and 31P NMR, 13C DEPT NMR, and 1H[13C]2D HMQC NMR spectroscopy. The 13C NMR spectra showed two coupled resonances at 29.3 and 88.7 ppm which were assigned to the C-3 and C-2 of the covalent intermediate, and the 13C DEPT confirmed that C-3 was a methyl group and C-2 was quaternary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Enterobacteria in mineral, spring and table water].
AB  - Whereas coliform bacteria rank first, non-coliform enterobacteria can be isolated second in frequency from bottled mineral, spring and table waters in South Bavaria. Escherichia coli were found in 8, coliforms in 44 and non-coliform enterobacteria in 41 of 54 manufactories with hygienic problems. 11 different bacterial species were determined from coliforms with Enterobacter cloacae occurring most numerous in 19, Citrobacter freundii in 12 and Enterobacter amnigenus in 7 manufactories. From non-coliform enterobacteria 18 different species could be determined. Again Enterobacter cloacae was found most frequently in 17 manufactories followed by Enterobacter amnigenus in 11 and Serratia liquefaciens in 7 manufactories. The investigation of total Enterobacteriaceae is suggested as a suitable quality criterion for bottled mineral, spring and table waters.
TI  - Physical characterisation of the Escherichia coli B gene encoding nitroreductase  and its over-expression in Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - The Escherichia coli B gene (nfnB) encoding nitroreductase has been cloned in Escherichia coli K-12 and its nucleotide sequence determined. The translated amino acid sequence was found to share substantial identity (88.5%) with the equivalent proteins of Enterobacter cloacae and Salmonella typhimurium. When the structural gene was placed under the transcriptional control of either the trp or lac promoter, recombinant nitroreductase was accumulated to 33% and 25% of the cell's soluble protein, respectively. Substitution of the nfrB ribosome binding site with that of the E. coli lacZ gene reduced production levels of nitroreductase. The sequenced region also contained two incomplete open reading frames of unknown function.
TI  - Production of a plasmid mediated AmpC-like beta-lactamase by a Klebsiella pneumoniae septicaemia isolate.
AB  - A septicaemia Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from Greece (Ath1) was shown to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and cefoxitin and this resistance was not decreased in the presence of clavulanic acid. The gene coding for the resistance phenotype, associated with a beta-lactamase showing cephalosporinase activity and a pI of 8.6, could be transferred into Escherichia coli K-12 by conjugation and transformation. DNA-hybridisation showed that this gene was located on two different plasmids, 7.8 and 80 kb respectively. The larger, conjugative plasmid also carried genes coding for another beta-lactamase (pI 6.6) and resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim. Under highly stringent conditions the gene coding for the pI 8.6 beta-lactamase hybridised with chromosomal DNA from Citrobacter freundii OS60 but not from E. coli or Enterobacter cloacae. Furthermore, the restriction map of this beta-lactamase gene corresponded to that of ampC from C. freundii OS60. The regulatory ampR gene could not be detected in the plasmid DNA from the Ath1 K. pneumoniae by DNA hybridisation. The relationship between a plasmid-mediated extended spectrum beta-lactamase in a K. pneumoniae septicaemia isolate and chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase from C. freundii was demonstrated.
TI  - In vitro activity of SCE-2787, a new cephalosporin with potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The in vitro activity of SCE-2787, 7-[(Z)-2-(5-amino-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3- yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(1-imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazinium)methy l-3- cephem-4-carboxylate, was compared with those of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and imipenem against recent clinical isolates. SCE-2787 inhibited 50% of tested isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. SCE-2787 was equally active as or more active than ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, with the exception of Proteus vulgaris. The MIC of SCE-2787 at which 90% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited was 2 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold lower than those of imipenem and ceftazidime, respectively. SCE-2787, like ceftazidime and imipenem, did not inhibit the majority of strains of Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia. SCE-2787 inhibited beta-hemolytic streptococci at < or = 0.12 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, or the anaerobic species tested. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci required SCE-2787 MICs of > or = 16 micrograms/ml, whereas methicillin-susceptible staphylococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. No difference between the MICs and MBCs was noted, except for P. aeruginosa, for which there was a fourfold difference. SCE-2787 was active over a pH range of 6 to 8. The inoculum size of 10(5) to 10(7) CFU caused only a twofold change in the MIC for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus but a 4- to 16-fold change in Enterobacter cloacae and P. aeruginosa. beta-Lactamases from Bush groups 1, 2a, and 2b did not hydrolyze SCE-2787. There was significant hydrolysis of SCE-2787 by the beta-lactamases designated 2b', i.e., TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, and TEM-9, and by the group 2d beta-lactamases. SCE-2787 had poor affinity for group 1 and group 2b enzymes and constitutively produced chromosomal beta-lactamases such as P-99 of Enterobacter cloacae and plasmid-mediated TEM-1 of E. coli. SCE-2787 has in vitro activity comparable to that of current parenteral cephalosporin and is more active against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.
TI  - Invasion of rabbit ileal tissue by Enterobacter cloacae varies with the concentration of OmpX in the outer membrane.
AB  - The outer membrane protein OmpX of Enterobacter cloacae shows high amino acid homology with virulence proteins PagC and Rck from Salmonella typhimurium and with Ail from Yersinia enterocolitica. Here we demonstrate a role for OmpX in the invasion of rabbit ileal tissue by E. cloacae. An organ culture system was used for maintenance of rabbit gut tissue during the experiments. The invasiveness of three E. cloacae strains, which differed in OmpX content, were compared with each other and with that of Salmonella typhimurium TML (a highly invasive strain) and S. typhimurium LT7 (a noninvasive strain). There was no significant difference between the invasiveness of the wild type and that of an ompX deletion mutant strain of E. cloacae; they were equally as invasive or less invasive than S. typhimurium LT7. The invasiveness of an OmpX overproducer strain of E. cloacae was 10-fold higher than that of its immediate parent carrying only the multicopy plasmid, higher than that of S. typhimurium LT7, but lower than that of S. typhimurium TML. The invasiveness of E. cloacae thus varied directly with the level of OmpX in the outer membrane in rabbit ileal enterocytes challenged in situ.
TI  - Clinical and bacteriological survey after change in aminoglycoside treatment to control an epidemic of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - The effect of a change in the first line antibiotic treatment in a neonatal unit  was studied. A total of 238 neonates (G1), admitted between 1 January and 31 July 1989, and treated with gentamicin, were compared with 398 (G2) admitted between 1 August 1989 and 31 July 1990 who received amikacin, in the combination of ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside. This change was implemented in an attempt to prevent the spread of an epidemic strain of Enterobacter cloacae resistant to third generation cephalosporins and all aminoglycosides, except amikacin. The change in treatment had no effect on the incidence of nosocomial infections [19.7% (G1) vs. 16.3% (G2) RR = 1.21 (0.86-1.70)], but the proportion of patients with nosocomial infections caused by the E. cloacae decreased (6.3% vs. 2.0% RR 3.14 CI 1.35-7.28). Certain trends in the bacterial ecology emerged: E. aerogenes and Enterococci increased in G2. The proportion of gentamicin-resistant strains such as E. cloacae or Staphylococci decreased and there was no increase in aminoglycoside-resistant strains, except in Escherichia coli, in which resistance to amikacin rose from 0 to 3%. This study illustrates the influence of antimicrobial therapy on the species and the resistance of strains isolated in nosocomial infections. It also highlights the need for epidemiologic surveillance, and poses the question of how best to modify antibiotic policy.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the beta-galactosidase gene from Enterobacter cloacae GAO.
AB  - The gene encoding a beta-galactosidase from Enterobacter cloacae GAO was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the insert of a positive clone had an open reading frame of 3084 bp that encoded a polypeptide of 1028 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 116,677 daltons. The amino acid sequence of beta-galactosidase deduced from the nucleotide sequence, especially the sequence around the putative active site and of the fourteen regions, showed significant homology to beta-galactosidases of other microorganisms, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Clostridium acetobutylicum.
TI  - Survival of allochthonous bacteria in still mineral water bottled in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and glass.
AB  - The mortality of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, based on the culturability of these bacteria, was assessed in non-carbonated mineral water, bottled in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) containing the indigenous flora, sterile mineral water bottled in PVC, sterile mineral water in glass containers, and sterile tap water in glass containers. There was a general decrease in the culturability of these organisms in the four test waters, except that Ps. aeruginosa grew in sterile tap water. Escherichia coli and Kl. pneumoniae had the highest mortality rates under the conditions tested, while Ent. cloacae had a very low and constant mortality rate that would have resulted in the persistence of this organism in mineral water for a long period of time. After a sharp initial decrease in culturability, Ps. aeruginosa also had a very low mortality rate in mineral water bottled in PVC.
TI  - Resistance of bacterial strains to dry conditions: use of anhydrous silica gel in a desiccation model system.
AB  - The viability of 18 bacterial strains desiccated on anhydrous silica gel and stored at a temperature of 22 degrees C for at least 3 months was determined. According to their stability in the dried state, these strains could be classified into three typical groups. Group 1, containing Gram-positive strains and Salmonella serotypes, was marked by a very slow decrease of the concentration of culturable cells from day 14 on (respectively day 21 for Salmonella thompson). The rate of decrease expressed as regression coefficient (b) ranged from -0.000389 to -0.00521 log (cfp ml-1) per d. The Group 2 strains Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli did not reach a comparable slow decrease in the dry material within the indicated time period. Regression coefficients were respectively -0.04406 and -0.03412 log (cfp ml-1) per d. The reciprocal values -(1/b) were respectively 23 d per log (cfp ml-1) and 29 d per log (cfp ml-1), indicating the time periods in which a reduction of 1 log unit of culturable cells occurred. Group 3 strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila and Aer. sobria were marked by a significant susceptibility to cell damage caused during desiccation and reconstitution. A high initial decrease (ID) of the concentration of culturable organisms seems to be a characteristic property of these bacterial strains: culturable organisms could not be detected after storage for 1 d (Aer. hydrophila, Aer. sobria) or 7 d (Ps. aeruginosa). The wide range of resistance of the different bacterial strains tested indicated that the silica gel model system is a suitable tool for microbiological challenge tests to investigate the survival of micro-organisms exposed to desiccation and their stability in dry materials.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activities of 3-thiazol-4-yl-1-carba-1-dethiacephalosporins.
AB  - The synthesis and microbiological evaluation of a new series of 3-thiazol-4-yl-carba-1-dethiacephalosporins is described. Structure activity relationship was achieved by changing substitution at the 2-position of the thiazole moiety. The result was a marked variance of microbiological activity in the C7 side-chain derivatives. ATMO derivatives possess potent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. For example, MICs (microgram/ml) of LY215226 against representative organisms are as follows: S. aureus 0.25, S. pneumoniae 0.008, H. influenzae 0.008, E. coli 0.25, K. pneumoniae 0.008, E. cloacae 0.5, S. typhi 0.25, and M. morganii 0.25.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. The study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). In addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups C and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. Cefpodoxime showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral beta-lactam antibiotics examined. The drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.
TI  - Enterobacter cloacae causing pneumatocele in a neonate.
AB  - Pneumatocele formation, a cyst-like rarefaction that develops within the lung parenchyma, is an unusual complication of pneumonia in the neonate. It has been reported to occur with Staphlococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. We describe a case of a premature neonate with pneumonia and subsequent pneumatocele formation caused by Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - Gene sequence and biochemical characterization of FOX-1 from Klebsiella pneumoniae, a new AmpC-type plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase with two molecular variants.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae BA32, a clinical isolate from Buenos Aires, Argentina, was  found to produce a plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase (FOX-1) which conferred resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and cephamycins. Resistance could be transferred by conjugation or transformation into Escherichia coli K-12 via a 48.5-kb plasmid (pGLK1) that produced two FOX-1 molecular variants with isoelectric points of 6.8 and 7.2 and apparent molecular sizes of 37 and 35 kDa, respectively. The kinetic study revealed that the two variants had very similar substrate and inhibition profiles. These values resemble those of chromosomally mediated class C (group 1) cephalosporinases. The structural gene of FOX-1 (blaFOX-1) was cloned into a 2,270-bp PstI-PstI fragment and was expressed in E. coli TG1. The deduced 382-amino-acid sequence of FOX-1 exhibited a high degree of similarity with chromosomally encoded AmpC beta-lactamases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli, and Citrobacter freundii. These findings suggest that FOX-1 is a plasmid-mediated AmpC-type beta-lactamase that is encoded by a single gene and that has two molecular variants.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Analysis of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing class A beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae and of its LysR-type regulatory protein.
AB  - Carbapenems such as imipenem are extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics, which are not hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamases commonly found in Enterobacteriaceae. Here we report a gene encoding a carbapenemase, which was cloned from the chromosome of a clinical isolate of Enterobacter cloacae, strain NOR-1, into pACYC184 plasmid in Escherichia coli. Unlike all the sequenced carbapenemases, which are class B metallo-beta-lactamases, the mature protein (NmcA) is a class A serine beta-lactamase. NmcA shares the highest amino acid identity (50%) with the extended-spectrum class A beta-lactamase MEN-1 from E. coli. In the opposite orientation from the nmcA promoter, an overlapping and divergent promoter was detected, along with an open reading frame, which encoded a 33.5-kDa protein (NmcR). The NmcR amino acid sequence displays homology with LysR-type transcriptional regulatory proteins, including the conserved residues near its N terminus within a helix-turn-helix motif. Deletion of nmcR resulted in decreased carbapenem resistance and a loss of beta-lactamase inducibility, demonstrating a positive role of NmcR in NmcA expression.
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CP-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. CP-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin G and erythromycin (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). The activity of CP-99,219 against Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, C. diversus, Helicobacter pylori, and K. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with MIC90 values to CP-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for Bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for CP-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. CP-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x MIC against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broths. The spectrum and potency observed with CP-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.
TI  - Microbiological changes in mawe during natural fermentation.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria increased from 3.2 x 10(6) and 1.6 x 10(7) c.f.u./g (wet wt) to 2 x 10(9) and 1.6 x 10(9) c.f.u./g after 12 to 24 h of fermentation of home-produced mawe (a dough produced from dehulled maize) and commercial mawe, respectively. In commercial mawe, the yeast count increased from 1.3 x 10(5) to 2.5 x 10(7) c.f.u./g after 48 h of fermentation before decreasing, whereas in the home-produced mawe it increased from 2.5 x 10(4) to 3.2 x 10(7) c.f.u./g after 72 h of fermentation; the dominant yeasts were mainly Candida krusei, although C. kefyr, C. glabrata and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were also present. Enterobacteriaceae counts increased slightly during the initial stage ofthe fermentation, but decreased below the detection level after 24 to 48 h. Enterobacter cloacae was mostly found in commercial mawe and Escherichia coli mostly in homeproduced mawe.
TI  - Investigation of synergism with combinations of dibromopropamidine isethionate or propamidine isethionate and polymyxin B.
AB  - Combinations of polymyxin B and dibromopropamidine isethionate exhibited synergistic inhibitory and bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Similar results were obtained with polymyxin B plus propamidine combinations except that propamidine was not as active as dibromopropamidine and the combination of polymyxin B plus propamidine against S. aureus only had additive activity. The antibacterial agents were tested in solutions and in a cream formulation. The findings indicate a potential for the use of selected combinations of these antibacterial agents in the treatment of wound and superficial eye infections.
TI  - Identification of the gene encoding the major NAD(P)H-flavin oxidoreductase of the bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri ATCC 7744.
AB  - The gene encoding the major NAD(P)H-flavin oxidoreductase (flavin reductase) of the luminous bacterium Vibrio fischeri ATCC 7744 was isolated by using synthetic oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme. Nucleotide sequence analysis suggested that the major flavin reductase of V. fischeri consisted of 218 amino acids and had a calculated molecular weight of 24,562. Cloned flavin reductase expressed in Escherichia coli was purified virtually to homogeneity, and its basic biochemical properties were examined. As in the major flavin reductase in crude extracts of V. fischeri, cloned flavin reductase showed broad substrate specificity and served well as a catalyst to supply reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2) to the bioluminescence reaction. The major flavin reductase of V. fischeri not only showed significant similarity in amino acid sequence to oxygen-insensitive NAD(P)H nitroreductases of Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli but also was associated with a low level of nitroreductase activity. The major flavin reductase of V. fischeri and the nitroreductases of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae would thus appear closely related in evolution and form a novel protein family.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of the gene for a carbapenem-hydrolyzing class A beta-lactamase, Sme-1, from Serratia marcescens S6.
AB  - Serratia marcescens S6 produces a pI 9.7 carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase that is probably encoded by the chromosome (Y. Yang, P. Wu, and D. M. Livermore, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 34:755-758, 1990). A total of 11.3 kb of genomic DNA from this strain was cloned into plasmid pACYC184 in Escherichia coli. After further subclonings, the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene (blaSme-1) was sequenced (EMBL accession number Z28968). The gene corresponded to an 882-bp open reading frame which encoded a 294-amino-acid polypeptide. This open reading frame was preceded by a -10 and a -35 region consistent with a putative promoter sequence of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. This promoter was active in E. coli and S. marcescens, as demonstrated by primer extension analysis. N-terminal sequencing showed that the Sme-1 enzyme had a 27-amino-acid leader peptide and enabled calculation of the molecular mass of the mature protein (29.3 kDa). Sequence alignment revealed that Sme-1 is a class A serine beta-lactamase and not a class B metalloenzyme. The earlier view that the enzyme was zinc dependent was discounted. Among class A beta-lactamases, Sme-1 had the greatest amino acid identity (70%) with the pI 6.9 carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase, NMC-A, from Enterobacter cloacae NOR-1. Comparison of these two protein sequences suggested a role for specific residues in carbapenem hydrolysis. The relatedness of Sme-1 to other class A beta-lactamases such as the TEM and SHV types was remote. This work details the sequence of the second carbapenem-hydrolyzing class A beta-lactamase from an enterobacterial species and the first in the genus Serratia.
TI  - Assessment of bacterial cross-transmission as a cause of infections in patients in intensive care units.
AB  - The prevalence of possible cross-transmission of selected bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci) among infected patients was evaluated in five intensive care units (ICUs) over 6 months. A total of 284 isolates from clinical specimens were typed by plasmid profile analysis (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae), restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid DNA (S. aureus), and/or pulse-field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal DNA (P. aeruginosa, enterococci, S. aureus, and other bacteria without plasmid DNA). By typing criteria, only 13% of the 177 isolates obtained after > 2 days in an ICU were classified as possibly cross-transmitted. Many patients whose cultures yielded bacteria of an identical type may have been the sources rather than the recipients of these organisms. Episodes of possible cross-transmission were scattered among all ICUs, usually affected only two patients, and were associated with most bacterial species. These data suggest that endemic bacterial cross-transmission in ICUs is relatively infrequent and that cross-transmitted bacteria are not common causes of endemic ICU-related nosocomial infections.
TI  - [Bacteria-reducing properties of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. II. Relationship between microbiocide effect of copper-containing materials and copper ion concentration after contamination with moist and dry hands].
AB  - The bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. In first examinations (I. communication) (19) the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). The following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. In this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. Materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. The bactericide effect on Micrococcus luteus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. This results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.
TI  - The tryptophan repressor sequence is highly conserved among the Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Tryptophan biosynthesis in Escherichia coli is regulated by the product of the trpR gene, the tryptophan (Trp) repressor. Trp aporepressor binds the corepressor, L-tryptophan, to form a holorepressor complex, which binds trp operator DNA tightly, and inhibits transcription of the tryptophan biosynthetic operon. The conservation of trp operator sequences among enteric Gram-negative bacteria suggests that trpR genes from other bacterial species can be cloned by complementation in E. coli. To clone trpR homologues, a deletion of the E. coli trpR gene, delta trpR504, was made on a plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis, then crossed onto the E. coli genome. Plasmid clones of the trpR genes of Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae were isolated by complementation of the delta trpR504 allele, scored as the ability to repress beta-galactosidase synthesis from a prophage-borne trpE-lacZ gene fusion. The predicted amino acid sequences of four enteric TrpR proteins show differences, clustered on the backside of the folded repressor, opposite the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix substructures. These differences are predicted to have little effect on the interactions of the aporepressor with tryptophan, holorepressor with operator DNA, or tandemly bound holorepressor dimers with one another. Although there is some variation observed at the dimer interface, interactions predicted to stabilize the interface are conserved. The phylogenetic relationships revealed by the TrpR amino acid sequence alignment agree with the results of others.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of an Azospirillum brasilense indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase gene.
AB  - Azospirillum brasilense isolated from the rhizosphere of different plants has the ability to excrete indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) into the culture media. Cosmid p0.2, isolated from an A. brasilense Sp245 genome library in pLAFR1, complements the Tn5-induced mutant SpM7918 of A. brasilense Sp6 which excretes reduced amounts of IAA. Restriction mapping and gene expression studies identified a BglII-EcoRI 4.3 kb fragment of p0.2 sufficient for the restoration of high levels of IAA production in mutant SpM7918. Tn5 mutagenesis localized the gene responsible on a 1.8 kb SmaI fragment. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that this fragment contains one complete open reading frame. The predicted protein sequence shows extensive homology with the indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase of Enterobacter cloacae and the pyruvate decarboxylases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zymomonas mobilis. The A. brasilense mutant Sp245a, constructed by homogenotization of a Tn5 insertion derivative of the 1.8 kb SmaI fragment, also displayed reduced IAA production. Introduction of the cloned wild-type gene into Rhizobium meliloti 1021 resulted in increased IAA production. Cell-free extracts prepared from R. meliloti and A. brasilense transconjugants harboring this gene could convert indole-3-pyruvic acid to indole-3-acetaldehyde and tryptophol. These results clearly demonstrate that IAA production in A. brasilense is mediated by indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase.
TI  - Role of residue Lys315 in the mechanism of action of the Enterobacter cloacae 908R beta-lactamase.
AB  - The role of the highly conserved Lys315 residue in the catalytic mechanism of a class C beta-lactamase has been probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Lys315 has been replaced by a histidine in the Enterobacter cloacae 908R beta-lactamase, thus introducing a tritratable group to probe the role of the positive charge, and by a glutamine. The effects of these mutations have been studied on the kinetics of penicillin G and cephalothin turnover and on the pre-steady-state kinetics with carbenicillin at different pH. Results showed that substrate binding was not impaired by the mutations, so that an interaction with the substrate-free carboxylate in the Henri-Michaelis complex could be ruled out. Lys315 must have a catalytic role as shown by the decreased acylation and deacylation rates observed with the mutant enzymes. The mutants exhibited a lower activity at acidic pH, and this observation could be correlated with a decreased affinity for (3-aminophenyl)boronate, a compound devoid of free carboxylate which binds to the active site and forms an adduct mimicking the tetrahedral intermediate. This suggested that Lys315 was somehow involved in accelerating the nucleophilic substitutions along the reaction pathway. The study was extended to modified substrates where the free carboxylate had been esterified. Neither acylation nor deacylation seemed severely impaired with these compounds, showing that the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate-free carboxylate did not play a major role in catalysis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates (PC) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (PCD) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and long wavelength UV light (UVA) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic PC. Twelve phylogenetically distinct pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into PC to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Contaminated PC were treated with 8-MOP (5 micrograms/mL) and 5 J/cm2 of UVA, a PCD treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. Greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of all 5 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. The remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) CFU/mL inactivated under these conditions. The inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when PC were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-MOP concentration (23.4 micrograms/mL). Illumination with 3 J/cm2 of UVA in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (Salmonella choleraesuis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) CFU/mL of the most resistant gram-negative organism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This level of PCD treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. These results demonstrate that PCD using 8-MOP (5 to 23.4 micrograms/mL) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in PC with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of aztreonam against clinical isolates].
AB  - To evaluate the antibacterial activity of a monobactam antibiotic, aztreonam (AZT), MICs of AZT and other antibiotics against clinical isolates collected at 36 participating institutions after January 1992 were determined using the agar plate dilution method (size of inoculum, 10(6) cfu/ml) according to the Japan Society of Chemotherapy standard. The antibiotics that were tested along with AZT included piperacillin (PIPC), cefoperazone (CPZ), and amikacin (AMK). AZT was found to be more active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Providencia rettgeri than CPZ, PIPC, and AMK. AZT was also more active against Serratia marcescens than the other antibiotics, but about 6% of the strains tested were resistant to AZT with MIC of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii, however, was more active AMK than AZT. AZT showed a normal activity distribution with a single peak at the MIC of 3.13-6.25 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 35% of inoculum was resistant with high MIC values (MIC > or = 25 micrograms/ml). Activities of AZT against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were comparable to those of CPZ.
TI  - Induction of cecropin-like and attacin-like antibacterial but not antiviral activity in Heliothis virescens larvae.
AB  - Inducible cecropin-like and attacin-like proteins were isolated from immune hemolymph obtained from vaccinated Heliothis virescens larvae. The attacin-like protein had a molecular weight of approximately 25,000 daltons and was not dialyzable. The cecropin-like peptide had an estimated molecular weight of 6,000-7,000 daltons and was dialyzable, heat-stable and sensitive to trypsin digestion. The cecropin-like peptide showed bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae, and the attacin-like protein showed bactericidal activity against E. coli. The immune hemolymph was bactericidal against E. coli, E. cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ultrastructural cell envelope damage to E. coli, produced by the immune hemolymph, was observed by scanning electron microscopy. No antiviral activity by the inducible cecropin-like and attacin-like proteins was detected against herpes simplex virus-1 and the vesicular stomatitis virus.
TI  - Susceptibility of respiratory and urinary pathogens to ceftibuten and other comparative drugs: results of an Italian multicenter survey. The Italian Ceftibuten Study Group.
AB  - A survey aimed at assessing the ability of ceftibuten, a new oral third-generation cephalosporin, to eradicate in vitro selected bacterial pathogens was conducted in 1991 in 17 microbiology laboratories evenly distributed in Italy. Over 8700 organisms collected from in- and outpatients affected mainly by respiratory and urinary tract infections were analyzed. This collection of bacteria did not include staphylococci, enterococci, Pseudomonas and other oxidative species naturally refractory to the action of most antibiotics employed. Susceptibility to ceftibuten, cefaclor, cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cotrimoxazole and erythromycin was assessed using a standardized agar-diffusion method. Production of beta-lactamases was confirmed by the nitrocefin test. Among the microorganisms studied E. coli (32.1%) prevailed, followed by P. mirabilis (17.1%), K. pneumoniae (10.9%), S. pyogenes (6.6%), E. cloacae (5.1%), Serratia spp. (4.5%), Enterobacter spp. (4.2%), H. influenzae (3.6%), S. pneumoniae (2.2%) and M. catarrhalis (2%). Within this group of pathogens amoxicillin resistance, often mediated by synthesis of beta-lactamases, was widely diffused (46.2%). The overall inhibitory activity of the drugs tested decreased as follows: ceftibuten (90.4%), cefuroxime (80.4%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (77.4%), cotrimoxazole (75.3%), cefaclor (72.6%), amoxicillin (53.8%) and erythromycin (32.8%). When the efficacy of the antibiotics was assessed against the collection of respiratory isolates producing beta-lactamases only ceftibuten maintained the same overall potency manifested against the general population while the comparative agents were far less effective. The results of this national survey indicate that, given the low incidence of resistance among the most prevalent causative agents of respiratory and urinary tract infections, ceftibuten can be safely used at present in the empiric therapy of these conditions especially when they occur in community settings.
TI  - Comparative serum bactericidal activities of three doses of ciprofloxacin administered intravenously.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities of three intravenous doses of ciprofloxacin were studied comparatively in 30 patients. Single 200-, 300-, and 400-mg intravenous doses of ciprofloxacin were given over 30 min to 10 patients each, and serum samples were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 h after the start of the infusion. Serum drug concentrations were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by using noncompartmental analysis methods. Serum bactericidal activity against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Staphylococcus aureus was determined for samples obtained at 0.5, 4, 8, and 12 h. Excellent activity was demonstrated up to 12 h by all doses against E. coli and E. cloacae. Much poorer titers were observed for the remaining organisms, although the 400-mg dose prompted improved results against P. aeruginosa with a mean bactericidal titer of 1:2.9 at 8 h. In conclusion, while the 200-mg dose appears to be largely adequate for infections caused by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, it seems that when P. aeruginosa is involved, 400 mg twice a day or even three times a day is more appropriate. Intravenous ciprofloxacin performs poorly against A. calcoaceticus and S. aureus, even at a higher dose.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates in south Sweden including a 13-year follow-up study of some respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility of consecutive isolates of the upper respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, (100 strains of each species collected each year during March through April 1985, 1988 and 1992) to penicillin V, amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole was investigated by MIC determination on PDM and PDM II agar. The MICs of the upper respiratory isolates from 1992 supplemented with 100 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus collected during 1992 were determined against the above antibiotics plus cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and BAY Y 3118. Beta-lactamase production was found in 10% of H. influenzae and 80-90% of S. aureus and B. catarrhalis in 1992. Among H. influenzae isolates, non-beta-lactamase-induced resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics was first detected in 1988 and amounted to 3% of isolates in 1992. Decreased susceptibility of S. preumoniae to penicillin (> or = 0.12 mg/l), co-trimoxazole > or = 32 mg/l, doxycycline (> or = 2 ml/l) and erythromycin (> or = 1 mg/l) was detected in 11%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, in 1992, which is significantly higher than in previous years at the same laboratory. Decreased susceptibility of S. pyogenes to doxycycline and erythromycin was detected in 11% and 9% in 1992. The two most recently developed antibiotics, cefpodoxime and BAY Y 3118, showed high antibacterial activity. The study emphasizes the need to screen for resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamase production and lowered penicillin affinity.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates from urinary tract to antimicrobial agents in Japan, 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of urinary tract isolates to antimicrobial agents examined at 123 hospital laboratories in Japan from September to December in 1991. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory. The susceptibility testing was performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. MRSA showed high resistance rates to all agents tested except to minocycline (MINO). MSSA had good susceptibility to imipenem (IPM) and cephalosporins with susceptibility rates higher than 90%. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to IPM, ampicillin and piperacillin (PIPC) and highly resistant to cephalosporins, gentamicin (GM), erythromycin, clindamycin and MINO. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX). High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii to IPM, GM, and OFLX and of Serratia marcescens for IPM and GM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were highly susceptible to IPM, ceftazidime, AMK, cefsulodin, cefoperazone, PIPC in this order.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of biapenem against enterobacteria with beta-lactamase-mediated antibiotic resistance.
AB  - The effects of enterobacterial beta-lactamases were studied for biapenem (L627),  a new carbapenem. Susceptibility tests were performed for isogenic mutant series of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris which varied only in chromosomal beta-lactamase expression. beta-Lactamase-derepressed organisms in these series were as susceptible as beta-lactamase-inducible strains to biapenem; beta-lactamase-basal mutants were up to eight-fold more susceptible. Similar patterns of relative activity against the different expression types were noted for imipenem and biapenem. These data were related to direct induction and hydrolysis assays: biapenem, like imipenem, was a strong inducer of several Class I enzymes and of the P. vulgaris cefuroximase and, like the other carbapenems, was only very slowly hydrolysed by these enzymes. Moreover, like meropenem, biapenem reversibly deactivated these beta-lactamases. Piperacillin and the cephalosporins, tested as comparators, were more labile than carbapenems to the Class I enzymes, were weak inducers below their MICs and lacked deactivator function. In consequence their MICs were higher for derepressed organisms than for those with inducible or basal beta-lactamase expression. Unlike the carbapenems, they selected derepressed mutants from inducible populations. Biapenem, like imipenem and meropenem, retained full activity against most transconjugants of Escherichia coli K-12 that produced plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, including extended-spectrum TEM mutants. Only production of OXA-10 (previously PSE-2) enzyme gave a slight reduction in susceptibility to the new carbapenem. Biapenem resistance (MIC 16 mg/L) did, however, occur in S. marcescens S6, which produced a chromosomal carbapenemase. This enzyme hydrolysed biapenem. Overall, our findings indicate that biapenem shares the favourable properties of imipenem and meropenem in its interactions with the most important beta-lactamases of enterobacteria.
TI  - Electric fields induce curved growth of Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis cells: implications for mechanisms of galvanotropism and bacterial growth.
AB  - Directional growth in response to electric fields (galvanotropism) is known for eukaryotic cells as diverse as fibroblasts, neurons, algae, and fungal hyphae. The mechanism is not understood, but all proposals invoke actin either directly or indirectly. We applied electric fields to bacteria (which are inherently free of actin) to determine whether actin was essential for galvanotropism. Field-treated (but not control) Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli cells curved rapidly toward the anode. The response was both field strength and pH dependent. The direction of curvature was reversed upon reversal of field polarity. The directional growth was not due to passive bending of the cells or to field-induced gradients of tropic substances in the medium. Field-treated Bacillus subtilis cells also curved, but the threshold was much higher than for E. cloacae or E. coli. Since the curved morphology must reflect spatial differences in the rates of cell wall synthesis and degradation, we looked for regions of active wall growth. Experiments in which the cells were decorated with latex beads revealed that the anode-facing ends of cells grew faster than the cathode-facing ends of the same cells. Inhibitors of cell wall synthesis caused spheroplasts to form on the convex regions of field-treated cells, suggesting that the initial curvature resulted from enhanced growth of cathode-facing regions. Our results indicate that an electric field modulates wall growth spatially and that the mechanism may involve differential stimulation of wall growth in both anode- and cathode-facing regions. Electric fields may therefore serve as valuable tools for studies of bacterial wall growth. Use of specific E. coli mutants may allow dissection of the galvanotropic mechanism at the molecular level.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antibacterial labdane-type diterpenes from the aerial parts of Cistus incanus subsp. creticus.
AB  - Seven labdane-type diterpenoids were isolated from the leaves of Cistus incanus subsp. creticus; their structures were established by spectroscopic means. All compounds were tested in vitro for their cytotoxicity against three cell line systems: KB, P-388; and NSCLC-N6. Their antibacterial and antifungal activities were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Torulopsis glabrata, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans as well.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effect of FK-037 and biapenem tested against five bacterial species.
AB  - The in-vitro post-antibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for two newer beta-lactams, FK-037 (a cephalosporin) and biapenem (a carbapenem). Our PAE results for these drugs were consistent with what has been reported previously for similar beta-lactams, e.g. Gram-positive organisms had measurable effects (0.4-2.2 hours), while Gram-negatives had variable results (0.0 to 1.4 hours). Even though the PAE test conditions generally coincided with achievable clinical levels for most organisms tested (< or = 4 mg/L for biapenem and < or = 8 mg/L for FK-037), the marginal or species dependent, short PAE values support the selection of multiple daily doses (two-to-four) based on conventional pharmacokinetic parameters such as the Cmax, AUC, and serum elimination half-life.
TI  - Plasmid labeling confirms bacterial translocation in pancreatitis.
AB  - To examine whether the gut is a source of infection in acute pancreatitis, bacterial translocation and alterations of intestinal microecology and morphology were studied in 16 dogs. Dogs were colonized with a strain of Escherichia coli (E. coli 6938K) bearing the plasmid pUC4K, which confers kanamycin resistance. In eight dogs (group I), pancreatitis was induced by sodium taurocholate/trypsin injection. Eight other dogs (group II) underwent laparotomy only. The pancreas, mesenteric lymph nodes, peritoneal fluid, liver, and spleen were harvested 7 days later for culturing and histologic analysis. Identification of E. coli 6938K was accomplished by plasmid DNA analysis. Group I dogs had severe pancreatitis and ischemic changes in small bowel mucosa. Group II dogs had no changes. Translocation to the pancreas occurred in five dogs and to mesenteric lymph nodes in six dogs with pancreatitis. No translocation occurred in group II dogs (p < 0.05). In addition to E. coli 6938K, other gram-negative kanamycin-resistant species were isolated, including E. coli (other than 6938K) and Enterobacter cloacae. Enteric origin of these strains was confirmed by antibiography and plasmid DNA analysis. No overgrowth of cecal gram-negative bacteria was found. This study suggests that the gut is a primary source of infection in pancreatitis and that ischemic damage of intestinal mucosa may promote bacterial translocation.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect, and postantibiotic effect of subinhibitory concentrations, of sparfloxacin on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The postantibiotic effect (PAE), the postantibiotic sub-MIC effect (PA SME), and  the sub-MIC effect (SME) of a new oral quinolone, sparfloxacin, were determined for different strains of gram-negative bacteria. A PAE was induced by 10 x MIC of sparfloxacin for 2 h and the antibiotic was then eliminated by washing and dilution. The PA SME was studied by adding different sub-MICs during the postantibiotic phase, and the SME by exposing the controls to the sub-MICs alone. Growth curves were followed for 20 h by continuous monitoring of optical density in an automatic incubator. Sparfloxacin induced a PAE of 0.9-2.4 h for all strains except two clinical strains of Enterobacter cloacae. In accordance with earlier experiments with sparfloxacin and gram-positive bacteria, this study showed a PA SME that was nearly equal to the PAE plus the effect of the subinhibitory concentration alone (SME).
TI  - Antibiotic-induced release of endotoxin from bacteria in vitro.
AB  - The ability of cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and tobramycin to cause release of endotoxin was examined in vitro with cultures of Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli. Endotoxin was measured by a quantitative limulus amoebocyte lysate assay and its presence was confirmed by silver staining of the lipopolysaccharide moiety following SDS-PAGE. The morphology of the bacteria during antibiotic exposure was examined by scanning electronmicroscopy. Cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin caused significant endotoxin release, correlating with their ability to affect cell-wall morphology, causing filamentation, wall breakage and cell lysis. In contrast, little endotoxin was released when bacteria were exposed to tobramycin and no morphological changes were observed when bacteria were exposed to bactericidal concentrations of this aminoglycoside. Its antimicrobial spectrum and bactericidal activity make tobramycin an appropriate agent for treatment of sepsis caused by gram-negative bacteria and its lack of propensity to elicit excessive release of endotoxin may avoid exacerbation of endotoxin-related shock in sepsis.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of gram negative bacilli isolated from urinary tract infections at NUHC of Cotonou (Benin) from March to December 1992].
AB  - Eleven antibiotics were tested against 1,194 Gram negative bacilli isolated from  urinary tract infections at the National University Hospital Center at Cotonou. Among the betalactams tested, only cefotaxime remained active against most of the bacteria tested: 90% of the strains of Escherichia coli and 75% of the strains of Enterobacter cloacae were sensitive. Ampicilline, on the other hand, had lost its activity even on strains which are usually the most susceptible. Thirteen percent of the E. coli strains were sensitive. This reduction in antibiotic activity against bacterial strains in Cotonou, which concerned to various degrees the tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, is less pronounced for the amino-sides (gentamicine and netilmicine), and the quinolones of which nalidixique acid was active against 83.9% of the strains of E. coli. The low frequency of isolation of wild type strains (sensitive to betalactams) is probably the consequence of strong selection pressure due to a massive, and uncontrolled use of antibiotics in Cotonou.
TI  - Genetics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - Bacteria have adapted to the introduction of aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime,  ceftriaxone and other oxyimino-beta-lactams by altering existing plasmid-mediated class A and class D beta-lactamases so as to expand their spectrum of activity. In the TEM and SHV families of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, relative activity toward oxyimino-substrates increases with the number of amino acid substitutions but at the price of lowered intrinsic efficiency, so that compensatory up-promoter events are often associated with increased enzyme expression. Another new mechanism of resistance is the capture on plasmids of normally chromosomal genes from Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which upon transfer can provide Klebsiella pneumoniae or Escherichia coli with resistance to alpha-methoxy-beta-lactams, such as cefoxitin or cefotetan, as well as to oxyimino-beta-lactams.
TI  - [Staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. Bacteriologic aspects].
AB  - Struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. Ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. Incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. This trial examines the bacteriologic aspects pre and post-ESWL. Eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (UTI) were submitted to urine cultures pre and post-ESWL. The first 50 patients underwent during and post-ESWL, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of generalized sepsis. No patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. With respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-ESWL UTI, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a UTI post-ESWL. The distribution of organisms pre and post-ESWL was as follows: Proteus mirabilis (22/22), Escherichia coli (11/11), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), Enterobacter cloacae (0/1), Alcaligenes odorans (1/2) Enterococcus faecalis (1/3), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and Candida albicans (1/1). In this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-ESWL probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. According to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. In 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial infection.
TI  - Evidence that the reaction of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase proceeds through the O-phosphothioketal of pyruvic acid bound to Cys115 of the enzyme.
AB  - The enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase (enolpyruvyltransferase, EC 2.5.1.7) catalyses the transfer of the intact 1-carboxyvinyl moiety of phosphoenolpyruvate to the 3'-hydroxyl group of the glucosamine moiety of UDP-(2')-N-acetylglucosamine with the concomitant release of inorganic phosphate, the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan. Overexpression of the enzyme from Enterobacter cloacae in Escherichia coli allowed the isolation of large amounts of purified enzyme (approx. 900 mg/20 g fresh mass bacteria). By incubating the enzyme with 14C-labelled phosphoenolpyruvate, 32P-labelled orthophosphate and unlabelled UDP-(2')-N-acetyl-(3')-1-carboxyvinylglucosamine, we were able to isolate and characterise a reaction intermediate, covalently bound to the protein. It contains stoichiometric quantities of the C3 moiety (0.98 mol/mol) as well as of the phosphate moiety (0.95 mol/mol) of phosphoenolpyruvate relative to protein. The rapid turnover of this protein-bound intermediate in the presence of UDP-(2')-N-acetylglucosamine towards the product UDP-(2')-N-acetyl-(3')-1-carboxyvinylglucosamine suggests that the intermediate is kinetically competent. We also present evidence that the intermediate is bound as the O-phosphothioketal of pyruvic acid to Cys115 of the enzyme. This is the same Cys residue to which phosphomycin, an irreversible inhibitor of the UDP-GlcNAc carboxyvinyltransferase, binds covalently. Exchange of Cys115 for a Ser residue resulted in an inactive enzyme, demonstrating the essential role of Cys115 for the reaction. The only other enzyme known to catalyse the transfer of the intact 1-carboxyvinyl moiety of phosphoenolpyruvate to a substrate is the 3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.19), the sixth enzyme of the shikimate pathway. The reaction of this synthase is known to proceed through a single, tightly but not covalently bound, tetrahedral intermediate. Even though the two enzymes share similarities in their primary amino acid sequences, their reaction mechanisms appear to be substantially different.
TI  - Cloning and Characterization of Aerobactin Biosynthesis Genes of the Biological Control Agent Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Five strains of Enterobacter cloacae that are biological control agents of Pythium damping-off diseases produced the hydroxamate siderophore aerobactin under iron-limiting conditions. Genes determining aerobactin biosynthesis of the biocontrol strain E. cloacae EcCT-501 were localized to a 12.3-kb region, which conferred aerobactin production to Escherichia coli DH5alpha. The aerobactin biosynthesis genes of E. cloacae hybridized to those of the pColV-K30 plasmid of E. coli, but restriction patterns of the aerobactin regions of pColV-K30 and E. cloacae differed. A derivative strain with a deletion in the aerobactin biosynthesis locus was as effective as strain EcCT-501 in biological control of Pythium damping-off of cucumber. Thus, aerobactin production did not contribute significantly to the biological control activity of EcCT-501 under the conditions of this study.
TI  - Evaluation of five different methods to prepare bacterial extracts for the identification of beta-lactamases by isoelectric focusing.
AB  - The X-PRESS, osmotic shock, chloroform treatment, lysozyme treatment and ultrasonic disruption methods to release five different plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases from Escherichia coli and one chromosomal beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae were compared. The main activities of TEM-1, SHV-1, OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-4 and chromosomal P99 beta-lactamases were found at the same isoelectric point irrespective of the method used. However, additional satellite bands were found with TEM-1, OXA-1, OXA-2 and PSE-4 beta-lactamases released by the lysozyme method. In addition, beta-lactamase released by osmotic shock treatment was found to be unstable during storage at -20 degrees C or during the 18 h period of iso-electric focusing at +4 degrees C. Chloroform treatment produced similar band patterns and at least as good an enzyme yield as ultrasonic disintegration and was equally simple and fast to perform.
TI  - Transfer of plasmid RP4 from Escherichia coli K-12 to indigenous bacteria of seawater.
AB  - Transfer of plasmid RP4 from Escherichia coli K-12 donor strain to bacteria isolated from seawater was shown to occur on filters and in sterile seawater incubated at 24 degrees C. Ten of 12 seawater isolates tested were recipient active for RP4 when the plasmid transfers were assessed by filter matings. When matings were performed in sterile seawater, seven of the 12 isolates received RP4. In sterile seawater, the transfer of RP4 from E. coli to pseudomonads was more efficient than transfer between E. coli strains. Transfer of RP4 to indigenous seawater bacteria was shown to take place both on filters and in seawater amended with Luria Bertani broth. No transconjugants were found in experiments with unamended seawater, but in experiments with amended seawater 10(-7)-10(-6) transconjugants per recipient were found. In filter matings with a 100-fold-concentrated total population of indigenous seawater bacteria, the transfer efficiency of RP4 was 4 x 10(-5) per recipient. The majority of the isolated transconjugant seawater bacteria consisted of fluorescent pseudomonads, but transconjugant strains of Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Enterobacter cloacae were also found. Using an auxotrophic donor strain, selection of transconjugants on selective minimal media was shown to be an efficient strategy for detection of gene transfer to indigenous bacteria of seawater.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. The bacteria studied were Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Bacteroides fragilis. In contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (MIC90s) were < 1 microgram/mL against most tested species. Ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. All fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, with MIC90s < or = 1 microgram/mL. For methicillin-resistant strains, on the other hand, the MIC90s were > or = 4 micrograms/mL. There was no significant difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. Most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against B. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. The MIC90s of most quinolones assayed against K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp., E. cloacae, S. aureus and S. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. Therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - [Ciprofloxacin resistance in gram negative bacilli. Epidemiologic aspects].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present was to study the resistance to ciprofloxacin (CIP) in gram negative bacilli (April 1990-March 1992) and to determine the temporary distribution of the resistant strains by species, samples and departments. METHODS: Seven thousand four hundred seventy-eight samples were studied. The identification and determination of the sensitivity was performed by the PASCO (Difco) system. Haemophilus spp. and Campylobacter spp. were excluded from the study. The microorganisms with CIM 2 mg/l were considered as resistant (CIPr). RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-one CIPr isolations were identified (6.4%). With regard to the percentage of resistant strains, the species with the highest were: Providencia stuartii (50%); Pseudomonas cepacia (44.4%); Xanthomonas maltophilia (26.9%); Acinetobacter baumannii (25.8%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%); Citrobacter freundii (12.5%); Serratia marcescens (8.4%); Enterobacter cloacae (5.8%) and Escherichia coli (4.3%). With respect to the absolute number of resistant strains, the most frequent resistant strains were: P. aeruginosa (205), E. coli (144), and A. baumannii (41). Isolation of E. coli and A. baumannii CIPr increased over the study period. Forty-four point five percent of the E. coli CIPr were of extrahospitalary origin; most of the A. baumannii (92.9%) and P. aeruginosa (77.6%) in contrast were of intrahospitalary origin. CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and A. baumannii are the most frequently resistant species. The frequency of isolation of resistant strains of E. coli and A. baumannii significantly increased (p < 0.001) over the two years of the study.
TI  - Early bacterial infections in lung transplant recipients.
AB  - Early bacterial pulmonary infections within 2 weeks after lung transplantation were studied in 29 patients undergoing surgery between December 1989 and May 1992. Suspected pulmonary infections occurred in 11 patients (38 percent). The most common bacterial organisms isolated were Klebsiella pneumoniae (45 percent; 5/11), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36 percent; 4/11), Escherichia coli (27 percent; 3/11), Staphylococcus aureus (18 percent; 2/11), and Enterobacter cloacae (18 percent; 2/11). The mortality due to infection was 3 percent (1/29) in the early postoperative period. None of the following variables was found to be of prognostic significance: positive donor cultures, ischemic time of the graft, use of cardiopulmonary bypass, number of courses of methylprednisolone for acute rejection, duration of postoperative intubation, and type of surgical procedure. The presence of infection in the early postoperative period did not influence long-term survival. In the absence of prognostic parameters, prompt adjustment of antibiotic therapy to the results of antibiograms remains the most important therapeutic step in the management of infections in the early postoperative period after lung transplantation.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of cefepime: a multicentre study.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro against 1757 recent clinical Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates. Cefepime was active at low concentrations (MIC50 values < or = 0.06 mg/L and MIC90 values < or = 0.12 mg/L) against non-cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.). For Klebsiella pneumoniae, MICs were between 0.016 and 16 mg/L; the highest MIC values were observed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Against Enterobacteriaceae, such as cephalosporinase producing Enterobacter cloacae, MICs were < or = 0.5 mg/L, but MICs against cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains were generally higher. Ticarcillin-sensitive strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefepime concentrations of 0.5-16 mg/L, while cefepime MICs were 8-64 mg/L for strains resistant to ticarcillin. The cefepime MIC50 value for Haemophilus spp. including many resistant to amoxycillin, was 0.03 mg/L. Against methicillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus, cefepime MICs were 0.5-16 mg/L; MICs against methicillin-resistant staphylococci were 16- > 128 mg/L). Against methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, cefepime MIC values were 0.03-16 mg/L; corresponding values for methicillin-resistant strains were 2-128 mg/L. Streptococci (Groups A, C and G) were sensitive to cefepime with MICs ranging from < or = 0.008-2 mg/L (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L; MIC90, 0.25 mg/L). The activity of cefepime against Group B streptococci and pneumococci were comparable, with MIC50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively, and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. Most enterococci and all Listeria monocytogenes strains had MICs > or = 32 mg/L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Low-dosage cefepime as treatment for serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Since infection develops in significant numbers of hospitalized patients, the problem of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is of increasing concern. We evaluated the efficacy of cefepime 1 g bd as treatment for acute, moderately severe bacterial infection in 239 hospitalized patients (mean age 60 years). Of these patients, 204 were evaluated clinically for urinary tract infection (UTI) (n = 90), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) (n = 70), skin and soft tissue infection (S/STI) (n = 12) and bacteraemia which was associated with either UTI or LRTI (n = 32) but not included in the previously mentioned UTI and LRTI groups. Amongst the pathogens isolated (36 Gram-positive, 150 Gram-negative), the most predominant species were Escherichia coli in UTI and bacteraemia (n = 81), Streptococcus pneumoniae in LRTI and bacteraemia (n = 23), Haemophilus influenzae in LRTI (n = 16), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and Enterobacter cloacae (n = 2) in S/STI. The mean duration of treatment was 8.5 days and was the same for the 204 clinically evaluable patients. Overall, the clinical cure rate for cefepime was 94% (191/204). Pathogen eradication was achieved in 93% (185/199) of infections. Of the patients with associated bacteraemia, the clinical cure rate was 97% (31/32) and 94% (16/17) of the pathogens were eradicated. Cefepime therapy was well-tolerated. Treatment was discontinued in eight patients (3%) because of local intolerance and in five patients (2%) because of drug-related adverse events (rash, headache and pruritus). Cefepime 1 g bd is as safe and effective as other parenteral cephalosporins for the treatment of acute bacterial UTI, LRTI and S/STI, including those cases with associated bacteraemia. The bd dosing schedule and reported lack of cross-resistance with other cephalosporins against some species of aerobic Gram-negative bacilli make cefepime an attractive treatment option in hospitalized patients.
TI  - [Bacterial reducing qualities of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. I. Contamination and sedimentation in humid and dry conditions].
AB  - In this examination the bactericide qualities of different materials were tested. Particularly the effect of humidity was examined. 3 materials containing copper ("copper", "brass" and "brass sheet") and 2 materials not containing copper ("polyamide B" and "high-grade steel") were tested. The surfaces of the 5 types of material were contaminated with a suspension of 2 different bacteria species (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus). After defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined by the standardized method of the "Guidelines of the German Society of Hygiene and Microbiology". Additionally the sedimentation of airborne microorganisms on the materials was tested by determining the number of colony-forming-units after defined exposure times. In further examinations the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. After defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined. The results show, a bactericide quality of copper depends on the percent of copper-content of the tested materials, exposure time, humidity, frequency of contamination and bacteria species. Humidity and only single contamination cause a reduction of bacteria. Reduction of gram-negative bacteria is more easily than reduction of gram-positive bacteria. Enterococcus faecium shows the highest, Pseudomonas aeruginosa the lowest reduction rate of bacteria in the following sequence: Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin following multiple oral doses in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Fourteen adult males participated in a randomized three-way crossover study to compare the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers (SBTs) of 500 mg of ciprofloxacin (regimen A), 750 mg of ciprofloxacin (regimen B), and 400 mg of ofloxacin (regimen C) administered every 12 h for seven doses. Mean steady-state peak concentrations in serum for regimens A, B, and C were 3.0, 4.4, and 6.5 micrograms/ml, respectively (P < 0.01, all comparisons) and mean half-lives were 4.5, 4.3, and 6.5 h, respectively (P < 0.05, C versus A and B). Mean steady-state areas under the concentration-time curve were 14.1, 21.1, and 48.1 micrograms/h/ml for regimens A, B, and C, respectively (P < 0.05, all comparisons). SBTs were determined at different times postdose for three isolates each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mean steady-state peak SBTs for regimens A, B, and C, respectively, were as follows: S. pneumoniae, < 1:2, 1:8, 1:8, S. aureus, 1:16, 1:16, 1:16; E. coli, 1: > or = 128, 1: > or = 128, 1:64; E. cloacae, 1: > or = 128, 1: > or = 128, 1:64; P. aeruginosa, 1:8, 1:8, 1:2. These differences in SBTs within each genus were statistically significant. The majority of predicted SBTs were within one dilution of measured SBTs. Areas under the serum bactericidal time curves for E. coli, E. cloacae, and P. aeruginosa were significantly higher for ciprofloxacin; areas under the serum bactericidal time curves for S. pneumoniae and S. aureus were significantly greater for ofloxacin. Ofloxacin achieved higher concentrations in serum than ciprofloxacin, but differences in in vitro activity were a more important determinant of SBTs.
TI  - Analysis of the aac(3)-VIa gene encoding a novel 3-N-acetyltransferase.
AB  - Biochemical analysis (G. A. Papanicolaou, R. S. Hare, R. Mierzwa, and G. H. Miller, abstr. 152, Program Abstr. 29th Intersci. Conf. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 1989) demonstrated the presence of a novel 3-N-acetyltransferase in Enterobacter cloacae 88020217. This organism was resistant to gentamicin, and the MIC of 2'-N-ethylnetilmicin for it was fourfold lower than that of 6'-N-ethylnetilmicin, a resistance pattern which suggested 2'-acetylating activity. However, high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis demonstrated that the enzyme acetylated sisomicin in the 3 position. We have cloned the structural gene for this enzyme from a large (> 70-kb) conjugative plasmid present in E. cloacae. Subcloning experiments have localized the aac(3)-VIa gene to a 2.1-kb Sau3A fragment. The deduced AAC(3)-VIa protein showed 48% amino acid identity to the AAC(3)-IIa protein and 39% identity to the AAC(3)-VII protein. Examination of the 5'-flanking sequences demonstrated that the aac(3)-VIa gene was located 167 bp downstream of the aadA1 gene and was present in an integron. In addition, the aac(3)-VIa gene is also downstream of a 59-base element often seen in an integron environment. Primer extension analysis has identified a promoter for the aac(3)-VIa gene downstream of both the aadA1 gene and a 59-base element.
TI  - In vitro experiments on catheter-related infections due to gram-negative rods.
AB  - Although many complications may arise with the use of central venous catheters, catheter-related bacteremia is considered to be the most serious complication. Microflora on the patient's skin (coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus) is thought to represent the major source of microorganisms causing catheter-related infections. Gram-negative rods are increasingly observed as causative agents. We therefore performed an in vitro study to elucidate the pathogenesis of polymer-associated infections caused by enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenters and to study the resistance of polymer surface-grown gram-negative rods against antibiotics. Using a modification of the semiquantitative method for culturing vascular cannulas on solid media described by Maki et al., we studied the adherence of various gram-negative rods to 1-cm segments of silastic catheters, a material used for Port-A-Cath-systems. Organisms were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae). All organisms but Klebsiella showed extensive irreversible adherence. Production of an extracellular slime substance was observed only with antimicrobially treated Pseudomonas. After 'infection', the silastic catheter segments were treated with various antimicrobial agents. The following antibiotics were used either individually or in combination: cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, fosfomycin and gentamicin. Despite the fact that the antibiotic concentrations used were many times greater than the respective MICs of the various antibiotics, none of the antibiotics tested succeeded in eliminating the organisms. E. coli was found to be the most susceptible organism. These in vitro data substantiate our clinical impression that it is hardly possible to successfully eliminate the colonization of central venous catheters with gram-negative rods by using the antimicrobial agents employed here.
TI  - Antitumor activities of a cephalosporin prodrug in combination with monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates.
AB  - 7-(Phenylacetamido)cephalosporin mustard (CM) and 7-(4-carboxybutanamido)cephalosporin mustard (CCM) were developed as anticancer prodrugs that could be activated site selectively by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates targeted to antigens present on tumor cell surfaces. Both CM and CCM were hydrolyzed by purified beta-lactamases from Escherichia coli (EC beta L), Bacillus cereus (BC beta L), and Enterobacter cloacae (ECl beta L). This resulted in the release of phenylenediamine mustard (PDM), a potent cytotoxic drug. The Km and kcat values of the reactions were determined, and it was found that ECl beta L effected the hydrolysis of CM and CCM more rapidly than the other enzymes. Conjugates of ECl beta L were prepared by reacting maleimide-substituted F(ab')2 fragments of the monoclonal antibodies L6 and P1.17 to ECl beta L that had been modified with sulfhydryl groups. In vitro experiments indicated that CCM (IC50 = 25-45 microM) was less toxic than PDM (IC50 = 1.5 microM) to H2981 lung adenocarcinoma cells (L6 antigen positive, P1.17 antigen negative) and that immunologically specific prodrug activation took place when the cells were treated with L6-ECl beta L. In vivo experiments in nude mice demonstrated that CCM was less toxic than CM, and that both prodrugs were much less toxic than PDM. Neither CCM nor PDM exerted antitumor activity on subcutaneous H2981 tumors in vivo. However, a significant antitumor effect was obtained in mice that received L6-ECl beta L 96 h prior to the administration of CCM. The effect was immunologically specific (P < 0.05), since a smaller degree of antitumor activity was obtained in mice that received the nonbinding control conjugate P1.17-ECl beta L prior to CCM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Ex vivo pharmacodynamic study of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam, compared with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid.
AB  - Ten volunteers received piperacillin (4 g), piperacillin (4 g) plus tazobactam (0.5 g) (Tazocin), and ticarcillin (3 g) plus clavulanic acid (0.2 g) (Timentin) intravenously over 30 min in a cross-over blinded scheme. Blood samples were obtained 0.5 and 3 h after the end of infusion to measure by (high-pressure liquid chromatography) the concentration and bactericidal titers against 70 gram-negative bacilli. Serum time-kill curves were done against 35 strains to measure killing rates and area under the time-kill curve. Using the measure of serum bactericidal activity, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin-tazobactam were equally effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Bacteroides fragilis. Piperacillin-tazobactam was superior to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid against piperacillin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 to 16 times) and S. marcescens (2 to 4 times). By using the area under the time-kill curve, piperacillin-tazobactam was equivalent to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid against piperacillin-susceptible strains; piperacillin-tazobactam was significantly more active than piperacillin against piperacillin-resistant strains and was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanic acid when the sample obtained 3 h after the end of infusion to volunteers was considered. Serum piperacillin concentrations (mean +/- standard error of the mean; in mg/liter) were 115 +/- 13 at 0.5 h and 7.4 +/- 1.4 at 3 h after the administration of piperacillin alone and 105.5 +/- 12.6 (0.5 h) and 7.7 +/- 1.6 after the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam. Serum tazobactam concentrations (in milligram per liter) were 13.1 +/- 1.4 at 0.5 h and 1.2 +/- 0.2 at 3 h. The piperacillin-tazobactam ratio was 8 +/- 0.3 at 0.5 h and 6.2 +/- 0.5 at 3 h. Piperacillin-tazobactam appears promising against beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - [A clinical study of lomefloxacin on the patients with urinary tract infections--focused on lomefloxacin-induced photosensitivity reaction].
AB  - Between April and October 1990, photosensitivity reactions were observed in 19 out of 338 patients who were administered lomefloxacin (LFLX) for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTI) in our hospital. To certify the effectiveness and safety of LFLX to UTI, we carried out a controlled study with fixed dosages and durations. Patients with acute uncomplicated UTI and chronic complicated UTI were enrolled and LFLX dosages of 200 mg b.i.d. for 7 days and 14 days, respectively, were administered. The overall efficacy rates were 100% and 84% respectively. Concerning the bacteriological effect, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were eliminated in every case, while 3 strains of Enterococcus faecalis 2 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain of Enterobacter cloacae persisted. No photosensitivity reaction or noteworthy severe adverse reactions were observed among 200 cases enrolled in this study of restricted dosages and durations. We, urologists, need to be well-informed about photosensitivity reactions induced by quinolone antimicrobial agents. LFLX was proven to be effective in UTI without showing any photosensitivity reactions when administered by our fixed dosages and durations.
TI  - DNA-based diagnostic tests for Salmonella species targeting agfA, the structural  gene for thin, aggregative fimbriae.
AB  - Salmonella enteritidis 27655-3b and a few diarrheagenic Escherichia coli strains  produce morphologically and antigenically related, thin, aggregative fimbriae, collectively named GVVPQ fimbriae (S. K. Collinson, L. Emody, T. J. Trust, and W. W. Kay, J. Bacteriol. 174:4490-4495, 1992). To determine whether GVVPQ fimbriae are common to Salmonella spp. and other enteropathogenic members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 113 isolates were phenotypically screened for Congo red binding and aggregative colony morphology. Presumptive positive and representative negative strains were examined by Western blotting (immunoblotting) by using antiserum to SEF 17, the native GVVPQ fimbria of S. enteritidis. Only four S. enteritidis strains and six E. coli isolates possessed substantial amounts of GVVPQ fimbriae after 24 h of incubation on T medium. Following 5 days of incubation, 56 of 93 Salmonella isolates (60%) and 1 of 7 additional E. coli clinical isolates possessed detectable levels of GVVPQ fimbriae. Since variable expression of GVVPQ fimbriae was observed among Salmonella isolates and some E. coli strains produced scant amounts, as revealed by immunoelectron microscopy, the ability to produce these fimbriae was evaluated by genotypic screening. The structural gene for the SEF 17 fimbrin, agfA, was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced to provide a characterized DNA probe. An agfA DNA fragment hybridized strongly to 603 of 604 (99.8%) Salmonella isolates but very weakly to 31 of 266 other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae including 26 of 137 E. coli strains, 3 of 14 Citrobacter spp., and single isolates of Shigella sonnei and Enterobacter cloacae. The agfA DNA probe proved to be a valuable diagnostic tool for Salmonella isolates arrayed on hydrophobic grid membrane filters. Unique agfA sequences were targeted in the development of a polymerase chain reaction assay specific for Salmonella spp.
TI  - Controlled clinical comparison of two lysis-based blood culture systems, isolator and Septi-Chek Release, for detection of bloodstream infections.
AB  - A controlled clinical comparison was made of the Isolator (Wampole Laboratories,  Cranbury, N.J.) and the Septi-Chek Release bottle (Roche Diagnostics, Nutley, N.J.). From 6,345 blood culture sets fulfilling minimum criteria for volume of blood cultured, 840 strains were isolated, of which only 691 (82%) were considered to be representative of bloodstream infection according to Centers for Disease Control definitions. Statistically significant differences were found between the systems for the following organisms, which were all detected more frequently in the Isolator system: Staphylococcus aureus (P = 0.0001), Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (P = 0.008), Klebsiella pneumoniae (P = 0.05), Salmonella spp. (P = 0.03), and Candida albicans (P = 0.02). The Septi-Chek Release system required a longer period of time than the Isolator system for detection of the following organisms:S. aureus (P = 0.0001), Enterococcus spp. (P = 0.0001), Enterobacter cloacae (P = 0.03), Escherichia coli (P = 0.0001), Klebsiella oxytoca (P = 0.03), K. pneumoniae (P = 0.02), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P = 0.002), and C. albicans (P = 0.005). There were 430 episodes of bloodstream infections identified in the study; of these episodes, only those due to S. aureus were detected significantly more frequently (P = 0.0001) by the Isolator system than by the Septi-Chek Release system. However, episodes of bloodstream infections due to S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., and E. coli were detected significantly faster by the Isolator system.
TI  - Infection and antibiotic therapy in 4000 burned patients treated in Milan, Italy, between 1976 and 1988.
AB  - The pathogenic flora, isolated from burn wounds of patients admitted to a burn care unit during the years between 1976 and 1988 were typed and the in vitro susceptibility to antibacterial agents was recorded. Between 1976 and 1988 the general therapeutic approach was changed three times, in congruence with the prevalent nosocomial bacterial resistance. The most frequent isolates were: Pseud. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp. and other Enterobacteriaceae, such as Acinetobacter, Citrobacter. The most striking finding was the increase in antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus isolates. Staph. aureus, Klebsiella and E. cloacae showed susceptibility to cephalosporins, imipenem, pefloxacin, vancomycin; Enterococcus susceptibility to pefloxacin and vancomycin, and Pseud. aeruginosa sensitivity to piperacillin, amikacin, tobramycin was generally good. E. coli showed a satisfactory susceptibility on average, and P. mirabilis showed a good sensitivity to piperacillin, cephalosporins, amikacin, tobramycin, aztreonam and imipenem. Thus, the general bacterial flora and susceptibility have remained mostly unchanged over the years, with the conspicuous exception of Enterococcus spp. and E. cloacae, which demonstrated a marked increase in incidence, with a concomitant dramatic decrease in the sensitivity of Enterococcus spp. to antibiotics.
TI  - The North American component (the United States and Canada) of an International Comparative MIC trial monitoring ofloxacin resistance.
AB  - Common lots of reference MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) method reagents were used to monitor ofloxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, and 13 other drugs against 3200 recent clinical isolates in February-April 1992. Five medical centers in the United States and Canada contributed 640 strains per facility as follows: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100 strains each); Streptococcus pneumoniae (40 strains); and Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (20 strains each). Quality-control strains were processed concurrently, MICs recorded, and data processed at a common location. Selected ofloxacin-resistant isolates were retested at a reference laboratory to confirm resistances and determine cross-resistant patterns. Results indicate the following (a) fluoroquinolones were superior in usable spectrum of activity to other orally administered drugs (for example, cefaclor, cefixime, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, minocycline, oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); (b) ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were generally equal to gentamicin and cefotaxime against commonly isolated Gram-negative pathogens; (c) fluoroquinolone resistance was rare among enteric bacilli, pneumococci (ciprofloxacin > ofloxacin), H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, but more common among oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and P. aeruginosa; (d) cross resistance was generally observed between ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin but was species or genus dependent; and (e) a new fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin, demonstrated promising activity against contemporary pathogens.
TI  - AmpG, a signal transducer in chromosomal beta-lactamase induction.
AB  - The chromosomal ampC beta-lactamase in Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae is inducible by beta-lactam antibiotics. When an inducible ampC gene is introduced on a plasmid into Escherichia coli together with its transcriptional regulator ampR, the plasmid-borne beta-lactamase is still inducible. We have isolated mutants, containing alterations in a novel E. coli gene, ampG, in which a cloned C. freundii ampC gene is unable to respond to beta-lactam inducers. The ampG gene was cloned, sequenced and mapped to minute 9.6 on the E. coli chromosome. The deduced amino acid sequence predicted AmpG to be a 53 kDa, transmembrane protein, which we propose acts as a signal transducer or permease in the beta-lactamase induction system. Immediately upstream of ampG there is another 579-base-pair-long open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative lipoprotein shown to be non-essential for beta-lactamase induction. We have found that ampG and this ORF form an operon, whose promoter is located in front of the ORF. Located closely upstream of the putative promoter is the morphogene bolA, which is transcribed in the opposite orientation. However, using transcription fusions, we have found that the ampG transcription is not regulated by bolA. In addition, we show that transcription is probably not regulated by either the starvation specific sigma factor RpoS, which controls bolA, or by AmpD the negative regulator for ampC transcription.
TI  - Bacterial flora detected of the uterine endometrial cavity of diabetic patients with myoma uteri.
AB  - Patients with diabetes frequently suffer from various postoperative complications, especially infection. Diabetic patients also have a high incidence of uterine endometrial cancer. The nature of the intrauterine bacterial flora may be related to both infection and carcinogenesis. Therefore, identification of the intrauterine bacterial flora in diabetic patients may be useful. Bacteria were detected in the uterine endometrial cavity of 100% of ten diabetic patients with myoma uteri. However, among 20 non-diabetic control patients with myoma uteri, only three 15% harbored bacteria. Members of the Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were the predominant bacteria. We speculate that bacterial products contribute to carcinogenesis, as has been proposed for colon carcinoma. Antimicrobial agents active against Enterobacteriaceae should be used to prevent postoperative infections in gynecologic procedures in diabetic patients.
TI  - Infectious sequelae after endoscopic sclerotherapy of oesophageal varices: role of antibiotic prophylaxis.
AB  - In order to determine the incidence of infection following sclerotherapy and the  role of antimicrobial prophylaxis, a prospective randomized control study was performed comparing i.v. imipenem/cilastatin, with an infusion of dextrose-saline as a control group. One hundred patients with bleeding esophageal varices were included. All episodes of infection were documented during admission to the unit. Ninety-seven patients were evaluable. Post-sclerotherapy bacteremia developed in six (5.6%) of 107 sclerotherapy sessions in the control group and one (1.1%) of the 88 sclerotherapy sessions in the imipenem/cilastatin group (P < or = 0.1, NS): six of these seven post-sclerotherapy bacteremias occurred after emergency sclerotherapy. Infection within 7 days of the procedure was documented after 43 (22.1%) of the 195 sclerotherapy sessions, 18 (20.5%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group and 25 (23.4%) in the control group (P = NS). These infections were significantly more common after emergency sclerotherapy, 40 (34.8%) of 115 sessions, than after elective sclerotherapy, three (3.8%) of 80 sessions (P < or = 0.0001). A short prophylactic antibiotic regime does not reduce the risk of early bacteremia or the frequency of infection after sclerotherapy. The higher risk of infection after emergency sclerotherapy may be therefore related more to the gastrointestinal hemorrhage and its associated effects than to sclerotherapy.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - A two-part energy burden imposed by growth of Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli in sodium dodecyl sulfate.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae, like most enteric bacteria, can grow in the presence of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The bacteria tolerate the detergent and do not metabolize it. In a defined glucose-salts medium the growth rate remained unchanged (G = 55 min) as the detergent concentration was increased from 0 to 10% SDS. However, growth in SDS exhibited a two-part energy dependence. In part 1, the SDS-grown cells underwent rapid lysis when they ran out of energy. Cells that had entered stationary phase owing to carbon limitation lysed, while those that had entered owing to nitrogen or phosphorus limitation did not. We attribute part 1 of the energy dependence to SDS as a detergent. In part 2, the cells grown in 5 or 10% SDS exhibited longer lag periods, potassium accumulation, decreased cell yields, and higher oxygen consumption. The higher oxygen consumption occurred during both exponential phase and nitrogen-limited stationary phase. However, the decreased cell yield and higher oxygen consumption of SDS-grown cells were mimicked by cells grown in equivalent concentrations of sucrose or polyethylene glycol. We attribute part 2 of the energy dependence to SDS as a solute. Finally, with regard to the as yet unidentified bacterial osmotic stress detector, we used the micelle-forming nature of SDS to conclude that the detector was responding to turgor pressure-water activity rather than to osmolarity itself.
TI  - Biochemical properties of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae and cloning of the gene into Escherichia coli.
AB  - A clinical isolate of Enterobacter cloacae, strain NOR-1, exhibited resistance to imipenem and remained susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Clavulanic acid partially restored the susceptibility of the strain to imipenem. Two beta-lactamases with isoelectric points (pI) of 6.9 and > 9.2 were detected in strain E. cloacae NOR-1; the higher pI corresponded to AmpC cephalosporinase. Plasmid DNA was not detected in E. cloacae NOR-1 and imipenem resistance could not be transferred into Escherichia coli JM109. The carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene was cloned into plasmid pACYC184. One recombinant plasmid, pPTN1, harbored a 5.3-kb Sau3A fragment from E. cloacae NOR-1 expressing the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase. This enzyme (pI 6.9) hydrolyzed ampicillin, cephalothin, and imipenem more rapidly than it did meropenem and aztreonam, but it hydrolyzed extended-spectrum cephalosporins only weakly and did not hydrolyze cefoxitin. Hydrolytic activity was partially inhibited by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam, was nonsusceptible to chelating agents such as EDTA and 1,10-o-phenanthroline, and was independent of the presence of ZnCl2. Its relative molecular mass was 30,000 Da. Induction experiments concluded that the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase biosynthesis was inducible by cefoxitin and imipenem. Subcloning experiments with HindIII partial digests of pPTN1 resulted in a recombinant plasmid, designated pPTN2, which contained a 1.3-kb insert from pPTN1 and which conferred resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Hybridization studies performed with a 1.2-kb HindIII fragment from pPtN2 failed to determine any homology with ampC of E. cloacae, with other known beta-lactamase genes commonly found in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (bla(TEM-1)) and bla(SHV-3) derivatives), and with previously described carbapenemase genes such as those from Xanthomonas maltophilia, Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis (cfiA), and Aeromonas hydrophila (cphA). This work describing the biochemical properties of a novel chromosome-encoded beta-lactamase from E. cloacae indicates that this enzyme differs from all the previously described carbapenemases. This is the first reported cloning of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing gene from a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Identification of a novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase with chromosomal cephalosporinase characteristics from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - A clinical isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to a wide variety of beta-lactams, including third generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and cephamycins, as well as to beta-lactam/clavulanate and sulbactam combinations was examined. It was found that this resistance was transmissible to Escherichia coli recipients via a small 5.3 MDa plasmid encoding for an unusual beta-lactamase produced in relatively large quantities. The enzyme, designated LAT-1, exhibited a highly basic isoelectric point (pI = 9.4) and its hydrolytic activity resembled closely that of a class-I chromosomal cephalosporinase. In vitro, LAT-1 hydrolysed cephaloridine, cephalothin and cephalexin more rapidly than penicillins. A slow hydrolysis of cefoxitin, ceftibuten, ceftazidime and cefotaxime was also observed. The enzyme was inhibited by low concentrations of aztreonam and cloxacillin but it was virtually unaffected by clavulanate. Under stringent conditions, the LAT-1 encoding plasmid did not hybridize with probes specific for TEM-1 and Enterobacter cloacae AmpC beta-lactamase genes. The plasmid was not self-transferable but was readily mobilized by a conjugative R-plasmid harboured by the same K. pneumoniae strain.
TI  - The Pseudomonas cepacia 249 chromosomal penicillinase is a member of the AmpC family of chromosomal beta-lactamases.
AB  - Pseudomonas cepacia 249 produces an inducible beta-lactamase with penicillinase activity. The nucleotide sequence of the penA gene, which encodes this beta-lactamase, was determined and found to include regions with a significant homology to the ampC-encoded beta-lactamases of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The predicted amino acid sequence of the PenA beta-lactamase contained 17 amino acids immediately preceding the putative active-site serine which were highly conserved among the enzymes of the AmpC family. Although the penA-coding sequence had a total GC content of 60%, the predicted codon usage was more characteristic of Escherichia coli ampC-encoded beta-lactamase, with 53% of the codons having G or C in the third position, in contrast to the values for the P. aeruginosa ampC (88.5%) or Pseudomonas cepacia (88 to 92%) metabolic genes. The inducible expression of penA can be regulated by the E. coli gene product AmpD. A putative P. cepacia AmpR homolog was associated with the positive regulation of both Enterobacter cloacae ampC and P. cepacia penA expression, as confirmed by gel retardation studies. The E. cloacae AmpR did not regulate penA expression. Thus, by homology studies, codon usage, and genetic analysis, the P. cepacia penA beta-lactamase appears to have been acquired from members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and belongs to the class C group of beta-lactamases.
TI  - The use of colonization rate and epidemic index as tools to illustrate the epidemiology of faecal Enterobacteriaceae strains in Swedish neonatal wards.
AB  - The epidemiology of faecal Gram-negative bacteria was studied in 953 infants from 22 neonatal special care wards in Swedish hospitals. Two complementary methods to measure presumed nosocomial transmission of bacterial strains were used: the prevalence rate of major (M) phenotypes (strains that had colonized at least 10% of the infants in a particular ward) and the epidemic index (Ei) (which measures the probability of isolating identical strains from different infants in a ward). About 1500 strains of the most common species (Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) were typed by the Phene Plate (PhP) biochemical fingerprinting system, and selected Klebsiella isolates were also typed by K antigen serotyping. Klebsiella spp. showed a high propensity to spread (median Ei 0.034, max 0.234), whereas E. coli (median Ei 0.006, max 0.140) and E. cloacae (median Ei 0.0, max 0.012) were more seldom involved in outbreaks. High total Eis in the wards were correlated with high cephalosporin usage (Rs = -0.56, P < 0.05). A total of about 600 biochemical phenotypes of Enterobacteriaceae strains were isolated from the 953 infants. Most of these were found in only one or a few infants, but 24 M phenotypes belonging to Klebsiella spp. (N = 19), E. coli (N = 4) and E. cloacae (N = 1) had colonized altogether 239 (25%) infants. Klebsiella M phenotypes similar or identical to each other and carrying K antigen 55 were isolated from 108 (11%) infants in eight wards, and were thus responsible for 45% of the M phenotype carrier rate in all studied infants. It is suggested that they represent a clone of Klebsiella with a high ability to multiply and spread in hospital environments.
TI  - Effect of antibiotics on endotoxin release from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Antibiotics may inhibit bacterial growth or may kill bacteria by inhibiting cell  wall synthesis or protein synthesis. The amount of endotoxin released during antibiotic action has been found to be clinically important. Nine antibiotics, representing seven classes, were studied for the amounts of endotoxin released during their action on susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococcus aureus, which produces no endotoxin, was used as a control organism. Aztreonam induced the highest release of endotoxin, whereas other antibiotics such as imipenem and the quinolones induced the lowest release of endotoxin. Although the quantities of endotoxin released are not easily explained from the established mechanisms of antibiotic action, our findings may have implications for therapy of the acutely ill, septic patient in whom release of large quantities of endotoxin may be catastrophic.
TI  - Decimal assay for additivity of drugs permits delineation of synergy and antagonism.
AB  - Although there are many in vitro tests for drug interactions, few possess a linear, predictable dose-dependent end point or have a precise definition for additivity. Therefore, a new test with both of these features, the decimal assay for additivity, was developed. This test is based on a disk diffusion assay and the strict linear relationship between drug mass and size of the inhibition zone. When the decimal assay for additivity was applied to combinations known on a mechanistic basis to be additive, synergistic, or antagonistic, results of the new test always reflected the expected drug interaction. For example, synergy between trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole was detected in tests with Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae, as was antagonism between cefoxitin and cefotaxime in tests with Enterobacter cloacae. Quinolones plus chloramphenicol appeared to be antagonistic. In addition to correctly identifying the drug interaction, the decimal assay for additivity identified the drug ratio producing the maximal drug interaction. These results suggest that the decimal assay for additivity should prove very useful in future studies of drug interactions.
TI  - Sequences of wild-type and mutant ampD genes of Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - The ampD gene product regulates the expression of AmpC beta-lactamase in gram-negative bacteria and is proposed to be involved in peptidoglycan metabolism. In this study, we sequenced the ampD wild type and three mutant genes of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii. They exhibited a high degree of homology with the corresponding gene of Escherichia coli except in the carboxy termini, where, in the wild-type genes of E. cloacae and C. freundii, four additional amino acids yielding the Ser-X-X-Lys motif were found. Evidence that this C-terminal region of the ampD gene product is necessary for activity was shown by constructing a deletion of the last 16 amino acids. The spontaneous mutation of ampD02 is an out-of-frame insertion and yields an inactive AmpD protein. The single-base-pair substitution of Gly for Asp-121 in ampD05 is responsible for a hyperinducible phenotype. These results demonstrate regions of the ampD gene and the corresponding protein which have functional importance for the induction of AmpC beta-lactamase in E. cloacae.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of unripe papaya.
AB  - The meat, seed and pulp of Carica papaya Linn., a popular traditional medicinal herb grown in the tropics, was shown by the agar-cup method to be bacteriostatic against several enteropathogens such as Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The same parts of papaya were unequivocably demonstrated by electron spin resonance spectrometry to scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (5.8 x 10(14) spins/ml), hydroxyl (5.1 x 10(14) spins/ml) and superoxide (1.2 x 10(14) spins/ml) radicals with the seed giving the highest activity at concentrations (IC50) of 2.1, 10.0 and 8.7 mg/ml, respectively. The superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity in the meat, seed and pulp amounts to about 32, 98 and 33 units/ml; comparable to those of soybean paste miso, rice bran and baker's yeast. Vitamin C, malic acid, citric acid and glucose are some of the possible antioxidative components in papaya. Our study correlates the bacteriostatic activity of papaya with its scavenging action on superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which could be part of the cellular metabolism of such enteropathogens. This is indicative of the pathophysiological role of these reactive oxygen species in gastrointestinal diseases and papaya's ability to counteract the oxidative stress.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - Phospholipid impregnation of abdominal rubber drains: resistance to bacterial adherence but no effect on drain-induced bacterial translocation.
AB  - In order to evaluate the effect of surface modification of biomaterials on bacterial adherence and bacterial translocation after intraperitoneal biomaterial implantation, phosphatidylcholine- or phosphatidylinositol-impregnated rubber drain pieces, which had been intraperitoneally implanted in the rat for 2 and 7 days, or unimplanted, were incubated in vitro with 3H-labelled Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. As compared with unimpregnated pieces, the adherence of bacteria significantly decreased to phosphatidylcholine- and phosphatidylinositol-impregnated rubber drain pieces that were either unimplanted or implanted for 2 days, but not for 7 days. The supplementation of albumin in the medium reduced the adherence of bacteria to the unimplanted, unimpregnated drain pieces, but did not further decrease adherence of bacteria to the unimplanted, phospholipid-impregnated brain pieces. Bacterial growth was inhibited after incubation in nutrient broth supplemented with phospholipids. The incidence of enteric bacterial translocation induced by intraperitoneal drain implantation did not differ between phospholipid-impregnated and unimpregnated drain pieces. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a large amount of biofilm and fibrous deposition on the surface of the implanted, phospholipid-impregnated rubber drain pieces. Thus, phospholipid impregnation of rubber drains reduces bacterial adherence and inhibits bacterial growth, without influencing the incidence of bacterial translocation.
TI  - The occurrence of inducible anti-Escherichia coli activity in hemolymph from the  migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes.
AB  - 1. Inducible antibacterial activity against an Escherichia coli strain has been shown to occur in the hemolymph of Melanoplus sanguinipes. 2. This anti-E. coli activity was induced by the infection with Serratia marcescens or E. coli K12 but not Enterobacter cloacae. 3. The greatest anti-E. coli activity was observed in hemolymph extracted from grasshoppers 6 hr after the injection of any of the two species of bacteria. 4. Anti-E. coli activity disappeared in hemolymph extracted from grasshoppers 8 hr after injection or longer.
TI  - Bacterial galvanotropism: mechanisms and applications.
AB  - Galvanotropism is the process by which a cell alters its shape to grow directionally in response to an electric field. This phenomenon is known for a wide variety of eukaryotic cells but the first report of bacterial galvanotropism appeared only recently. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and (to a lesser extent) Bacillus subtilis curve rapidly and reversibly towards the anode of a uniform electric field. The mechanism for the response is not known but two observations permit a degree of speculation. Firstly, the anode-facing ends of cells elongate more rapidly than the cathode-facing ends of the same cells, suggesting that the field affects regional rates of wall synthesis and degradation. Secondly, the magnitude of the response depends on the extracellular pH, implicating anodal electrophoresis of membrane proteins in the mechanism. The ability of a field to modulate rates of wall growth locally can be exploited to investigate at least two fundamental, yet intractable, questions: the mechanism by which bacteria maintain non-spherical shapes and grow without bursting and the mechanism for the uniform segregation of DNA into daughter cells. Additionally, use of molecular biological techniques may permit identification of the molecular basis for galvanotropism, an approach that has not been feasible for most galvanotropic eukaryotic cells.
TI  - The bioactivation of 5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide (CB1954)--I. Purification and properties of a nitroreductase enzyme from Escherichia coli--a potential enzyme for antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT).
AB  - A nitroreductase enzyme has been isolated from Escherichia coli B. This enzyme is an FMN-containing flavoprotein with a molecular mass of 24 kDa and requires either NADH or NADPH as a cofactor. Partial protein sequence analysis showed extensive homology with the "classical nitroreductase" of Salmonella typhimurium and a nitroreductase induced in Enterobacter cloacae. In common with the Salmonella enzyme, the E. coli B enzyme is capable of reducing nitrofurazone. The E. coli nitroreductase is also capable of reducing the anti-tumour agent CB1954 [5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide], a property shared with the mammalian enzyme DT diaphorase [NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone)] as isolated from Walker cells. The reduction of CB1954 by the E. coli enzyme results in the generation of cytotoxic species. Both enzymes also share the properties of being able to reduce quinones and are both inhibited by dicoumarol. The nitroreductase is a more active enzyme against CB1954 (kcat = 360 min-1) than Walker DT diaphorase (kcat = 4 min-1) and also has a lower Km for NADH (6 vs 75 microM).
TI  - Chromogenic redox assay for beta-lactamases yielding water-insoluble products. I. Kinetic behavior and redox chemistry.
AB  - We describe a chromogenic detection system for beta-lactamase which yields water-insoluble colored products. The assay is based on kinetic measurement of the appearance of color due to the beta-lactamase-initiated redox reaction. The substrates are C3' thiolate-substituted cephalosporins, which, after enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring, undergo elimination of the thiolate ion. This thiolate, in a postenzymatic step, reduces the tetrazolium salts, which are water-soluble colorless compounds, to a colored water-insoluble precipitate of formazan. Our model in this study was a beta-lactamase Enterobacter cloacae P-99-catalyzed reaction of thiolacetate cephalosporin with several tetrazolium salts. We found that the reaction rate is dependent on the concentration of the electron carrier 5-methyl phenazinium methyl sulfate, the pKa of the C3' thiolate substituent of the cephalosporin substrate, and the reduction potential of the tetrazolium salts. A kinetic study of this system yielded a rate law for the reaction. We present a mechanism of the reaction and determination of the kinetic parameters for the process. The sensitivity of this kinetic assay is very high; we detect 3 x 10(-10) M beta-lactamase P-99, which is approximately 30 mIU. The assay times are very short, lasting from 2 to 5 min. The new assay system is particularly suitable for a rapid detection of beta-lactamases in bacterial colonies and in enzyme immunoassays where beta-lactamase may be used as the label.
TI  - Phosphate starvation affects the synthesis of outer membrane proteins in Thiobacillus ferrooxidans.
AB  - The outer membrane protein (omp40) component from the chemolithoautotrophic acidophilic Thiobacillus ferrooxidans is apparently regulated by the external pH and the concentration of phosphorus. Its amino-terminal sequence showed little identity with the Escherichia coli OmpC, OmpF or PhoE porins, but was 38.5% identical to the outer membrane channel-forming protein NosA from Pseudomonas stutzeri, whose expression is also regulated environmentally. In addition, the partial amino acid sequence of T. ferrooxidans omp40 showed between 34 and 38% identity with the amino-terminal end of the small outer membrane proteins Rck and PagC from Salmonella typhimurium and OmpX from Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - Analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, Plesiomonas and Acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  - Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. The following micro-organisms were tested: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), Escherichia coli (3 strains), Hafnia alvei, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Proteus mirabilis (3 strains), Serratia liquefaciens and Serratia marcescens. Negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). Generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17 and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to PE(32:1), PE(33:1), PE(34:1), PE(34:2), PG(30:2), PG(31:2), PG(32:2), PG(34:1) and PS(33:0). However, quantitative differences were observed. For example, Acinetobacter lacked PE (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, PS(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. Unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. In some cases, unknown peaks appeared to constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). For chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. Using the Pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains analysed. Typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: Ent. cloacae vs Ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (Ent. cloacae vs Ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). Thus FAB-MS represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.
TI  - Survey of the prevalence of beta-lactamases amongst 1000 gram-negative bacilli isolated consecutively at the Royal London Hospital.
AB  - beta-Lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive Gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the Microbiology Laboratory of the Royal London Hospital. This survey, performed between January and April, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. The distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. This increase was balanced by a decreased proportion of enterobacteria. Amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, TEM-1 (especially), TEM-2, SHV-1 and OXA types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. Their frequency in Escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst Proteus mirabilis isolates. An apparent decrease in their frequency amongst Enterobacter cloacae isolates, from 48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. Plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of P. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. In the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of E. cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia spp. and Morganella morganii, and in 2/170 P. aeruginosa isolates. These proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (P approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). Extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were found in 11/70 Klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. Ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced TEM-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified SHV-derived enzyme.
TI  - [Effect of meropenem on fecal flora in children].
AB  - Meropenem (MEPM, SM-7338), a novel parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, was examined for its effect on intestinal flora in children. Seven children with infectious diseases (3 male and 4 female children of age's ranging from 4 months to 8 years and 9 months weighing from 7.3 to 23.0 kg) were treated with MEPM at doses ranging 10.3 to 40.5 mg/kg 3 or 4 times a day for 6 to 12 days. Before, during and after the treatment, identities and numbers of various bacteria contained in 1 g of feces were determined and fecal beta-lactamase activity and Clostridium difficile D-1 antigen were also assayed. Changes in fecal flora during MEPM treatment was somewhat different depending on cases. Regarding Enterobacteriaceae among aerobes, all of 7 cases exhibited moderate or pronounced reductions in Escherichia coli. Some of the cases exhibited the tendency to increase in Klebsiella oxytoca. Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii. E. coli which was reduced during the treatment increased rapidly after the treatment in 5 out of 7 cases, and the initial bacterial counts were restored. Diverse strains were observed within the genus Enterococcus, while the overall bacterial counts of this genus exhibited the tendency to increase during the treatment. As a result, no significant change in total aerobe count was observed in any case except 1 case where Enterococcus count was somewhat reduced. Among anaerobes, major bacteria such as Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium and Peptococcaceae exhibited tendencies to decrease in some cases during the antibiotic treatment. Two infants and 1 child exhibited significant decreases in total anaerobe counts. In most of the cases, such changes in major anaerobes were transient and bacterial counts recovered to their initial values rapidly after completion of the treatment. In no cases, glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli or fungus became predominant. Although C. difficile D-1 antigen was observed in 4 cases, its changes had no relationship with characteristics of feces. C. difficile was not detected in any of the cases. MEPM was detected in feces in 4 cases being treatment, in concentrations ranging from 0.35 to 66.0 micrograms/g. Fecal MEPM levels were very low except in 1 case in which beta-lactamase was negative. From these results, effects of MEPM on intestinal flora in children were relatively minor compared to other new beta-lactam drugs. However, a care should be taken to minimize diarrhea and bacterial turnover when a prolonged use of the antibiotic, was practiced because of potential significant effects on intestinal flora.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1988). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Isolation frequencies and sensitivities to antibacterial and antibiotic agents were investigated on 801 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 9 hospitals during the period of June to November 1988. Of the above total bacterial population, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus spp. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis: Vancomycin was most active with its MIC90 < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. Ampicillin, piperacillin, ofloxacin (OFLX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and imipenem (IPM) were also active. 2. Staphylococcus aureus: Arbekacin and minocycline were most active with their MIC90s 0.39 microgram/ml and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Among penicillins, dicloxacillin was the most active. Activities of cephems were considerably lower. 3. E. coli: Most of the agents were tested active. Particularly the second and third generation cephems were active in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. Carumonam (CRMN), IPM, OFLX and CPFX were also active with MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml. 4. Klebsiella pneumoniae CRMN and IPM were highly active. Penicillins generally showed lower activities. Cephems and new quinolones had high activities with their MIC90s in a range of 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. 5. Proteus mirabilis: The third generation cephems were active with their MIC90s in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. CRMN, OFLX and CPFX were also active with their MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml, 0.39 microgram/ml and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. 6. Pseudomonas aeruginosa: IPM and tobramycin were active with their MIC90s 1.56 micrograms/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. CRMN and new quinolones showed MIC80s of 25-100 micrograms/ml. Most of penicillins and cephems were not active. 7. Other Gram-negative rods: Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, IPM, CPFX and OFLX were active. Penicillins and cephems were not so active. CRMN was active against S. marcescens with its MIC80 at 6.25 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Outbreak of surgical wound infections associated with total hip arthroplasty.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Describe an outbreak of surgical wound infections associated with total hip arthroplasty; identify risk factors for surgical wound infection during the pre-outbreak and outbreak periods. SETTING: A 100-bed hospital. From May 1 to September 30, 1988, 7 of 15 patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty developed surgical wound infections from Staphylococcus aureus (5), Enterobacter cloacae (1), beta-hemolytic streptococci (1), enterococci (1), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1), and Escherichia coli (1) (attack rate = 46.7%). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort studies comparing surgical wound infection rates by patient- and procedure-related risk factors during the pre-outbreak and outbreak periods were conducted. Drop plate quantitative air culturing was conducted in 10 consecutive total hip arthroplasties in the subsequent 6 months. RESULTS: Rates of surgical wound infection were surgically higher for arthroplasties in which no intraoperative prophylactic antimicrobials were given (44% versus 8%, relative risk [RR] = 5.4, p = .01), or in which the posterior approach (20% versus 3%, RR = 6.7, p = .04) or a specific prosthesis (39% versus 5%, RR = 6.3, p = 0.01) was used. The surgical wound infection rate was highest when one circulating nurse, Nurse A, assisted (47% versus 4%, RR = 12.8, p less than .001). Logistic regression analysis identified use of the posterior approach (RR = 1.8, p = .04) and Nurse A's participation (RR = 5.0, p less than .001) as independent risk factors for surgical wound infection. Interviews of the nursing supervisor indicated that Nurse A had recurrent dermatitis on her hands. During 6 months following Nurse A's reassignment, the rate declined significantly (from 7/15 to 0/10, p = .01). Drop plate culturing yielded 2 to 10 colonies per plate of organisms that did not match outbreak organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Outbreaks associated with personnel generally involve only 1 species. In this outbreak, Nurse A (possibly because of her dermatitis), technique, the posterior approach, and/or other undetermined factors were the primary predictors of surgical wound infection.
TI  - Purification and characterization of indolepyruvate decarboxylase. A novel enzyme for indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Indolepyruvate decarboxylase, a key enzyme for indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis, was found in extracts of Enterobacter cloacae. The enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of indole-3-pyruvic acid to yield indole-3-acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity from Escherichia coli cells harboring the genetic locus for this enzyme obtained from E. cloacae. The results of gel filtration experiments showed that indolepyruvate decarboxylase is a tetramer with an M(r) of 240,000. In the absence of thiamine pyrophosphate and Mg2+, the active tetramers dissociate into inactive monomers and dimers. However, the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate and Mg2+ to the inactive monomers and dimers results in the formation of active tetramers. These results indicate that the thiamine pyrophosphate-Mg2+ complex functions in the formation of the tetramer, which is the enzymatically active holoenzyme. The enzyme exhibited decarboxylase activity with indole-3-pyruvic acid and pyruvic acid as substrates, but no decarboxylase activity was apparent with L-tryptophan, indole-3-lactic acid, beta-phenylpyruvic acid, oxalic acid, oxaloacetic acid, and acetoacetic acid. The Km values for indole-3-pyruvic acid and pyruvic acid were 15 microM and 2.5 mM, respectively. These results indicate that indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis in E. cloacae is mediated by indolepyruvate decarboxylase, which has a high specificity and affinity for indole-3-pyruvic acid.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - To investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (SISO), MICs of SISO as well as other aminoglycosides (AGs) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. Results are summarized below: 1. No SISO-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii. 2. In comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was higher, and SISO-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the MRSA. Also, SISO-resistant strains of Serratia marcescens increased. However, the rate of SISO-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, SISO-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. MICs of SISO against Providencia rettgeri and Providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of SISO was weak against genus Providencia. 4. For comparison, according to MICs of ofloxacin and imipenem, new quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. 5. SISO is still one of the useful AGs in the 1990's since it maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.
TI  - Changing patterns of blood culture isolates from patients with acute leukemia: a  review of twenty years' experience.
AB  - During the 20-year period, 1972-1991, 286 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 200  (45%) of 445 patients with acute leukemia in a hematology ward, giving an incidence of 482 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. The frequency of bacteremia was almost unchanged throughout the study period. The frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of all the isolates for the first half of the study period to 50% for the latter half. Despite the common use of ceftazidime and imipenem during the last 5-year period, Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in frequency to be the most frequent organism. This was opposite to the decreased frequencies of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The isolates of P. aeruginosa obtained during this period, all of which proved sensitive to ceftazidime and/or imipenem, were almost equally distributed among five serogroups, although a temporal preponderance of a limited number of serogroups was observed during the preceding 15-year period. On the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9% in the first decade to 35% in the latter decade. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species and, to a lesser extent, Staphylococcus aureus were ranked as major pathogens. Among the recent isolates of S. aureus, methicillin-resistant strains virtually replaced methicillin-sensitive ones. Therefore, until more effective means for control of P. aeruginosa bacteremia in particular become available, the occurrence of this infection will continue to limit the successful treatment of acute leukemia.
TI  - Characterization of the plasmid mediated beta-lactamase BIL-1.
AB  - A multi-resistant strain of Escherichia coli isolated from a patient from Pakistan was shown to possess a new plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase. This enzyme, designated BIL-1, conferred resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime. However, unlike other plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases capable of conferring resistance to these drugs, the BIL-1 was not a member of the TEM or SHV group of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and it also conferred resistance to beta-lactam drugs in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors (i.e. clavulanic acid). The biochemical properties of the enzyme suggest that BIL-1 is related to the Richmond & Sykes Class I chromosomal beta-lactamases. Its inhibition properties by various beta-lactam drugs are similar to the inhibition properties of the chromosomally-encoded P99 enzyme of Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of ticarcillin alone and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against beta-lactamase producing and non-producing microorganisms.
AB  - A total of 818 clinical bacterial isolates were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method and for the susceptibility to ticarcillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/mL) by agar dilution method. These included 83 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 31 of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 49 of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 58 of Haemophilus influenzae, 112 of Escherichia coli, 118 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 58 of Proteus mirabilis, 30 of Proteus vulgaris, 60 of Serratia marcescens, 113 of Enterobacter cloacae, 60 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 46 of Bacteroides fragilis. The results revealed that 46.6% of P. mirabilis, 53.4% of H. influenzae, 57.1% of N. gonorrhoeae, 80% of P. vulgaris, 83.9% of MRSA, 85.6% of MSSA, 87.5% of E. coli, 91.7% of S. marcescens, 95.7% of B. fragilis, 98.2% of E. cloacae, and 100% of K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa strains produced beta-lactamase. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to ticarcillin than beta-lactamase producers. The ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ticarcillin for beta-lactamase nonproducers of MSSA, MRSA, H. influenzae, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, E. cloacae, B. fragilis and beta-lactamase producers of MSSA, H. influenzae strains were all within the in vitro susceptible range. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the antibacterial activity of ticarcillin against beta-lactamase producers of MRSA, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris and B. fragilis strains. Clavulanic acid had no synergistic activity for ticarcillin against S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae.
TI  - Epidemiological survey of genes encoding aminoglycoside phosphotransferases APH (3') I and APH (3') II using DNA probes.
AB  - The epidemiological survey of APH (3') I and APH (3') II genes, at a time when the specific antibiotic pressure was very low, was carried out by DNA-DNA hybridization. The sample included 334 aminoglycoside resistant Gram-negative bacteria collected from patients of a General Hospital. Of these, 251 hybridized with the APH (3') I-probe and 19 with the APH (3') II-probe but only 190 strains showed high resistance levels (CIM greater than 64 micrograms/ml) for kanamycin, neomycin and paromomycin. These strains were isolated both from inpatients and outpatients with different infectious diseases. The APH (3') I-gene was dispersed among all the bacterial species and clinical specimens tested but the APH (3') II-gene was not found in Pseudomonas spp, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae, nor in infected catheters. Several plasmids of different sizes carrying APH (3') genes were detected among different bacteria. Plasmids along with transposable elements (the probes used in this work were developed from Tn906 and Tn5) and the high consumption of other antibiotics whose resistance is carried by these bacteria might be playing an important role in the maintenance and dispersion of APH (3') genes.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - Characterization of the chromosomal aac(6')-Ic gene from Serratia marcescens.
AB  - The DNA sequence of the chromosomal aac(6')-Ic gene from Serratia marcescens, which had been previously cloned (H. M. Champion, P. M. Bennett, D. A. Lewis, and D. S. Reeves, J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 22:587-596, 1988) was determined. High-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of extracts prepared from Escherichia coli carrying the chromosomal aac(6')-Ic gene on a plasmid confirmed the presence of 6'-N-acetyltransferase activity in this strain, which was suggested by the aminoglycoside resistance profile. DNA sequence analysis of the cloned 2,057-bp PstI fragment revealed several regions of homology to previously characterized sequences from GenBank, including the rpoD and tRNA-2 genes of E. coli. Subcloning experiments confirmed the coding sequence of the aac(6')-Ic gene to be at positions 1554 to 1992. The predicted amino acid sequence of the AAC(6')-Ic protein suggested that it was the third member of a family of AAC(6') proteins which included a coding region identified between the aadB and aadA genes of Tn4000 and an AAC(6') protein encoded by pUO490, which was isolated from Enterobacter cloacae. Primer extension analysis suggested that the -35 region of the aac(6')-Ic promoter overlapped a large palindromic sequence which may be involved in the regulation of the aac(6')-Ic gene. Hybridization experiments utilizing a restriction fragment from the aac(6')-Ic gene showed that all S. marcescens organisms carried this gene whether or not the AAC(6')-I resistance profile was expressed. Organisms other than Serratia spp. did not hybridize to this probe.
TI  - Influence of transient salivary flora on assessment of mutans streptococci level  by the "Strip mutans" method.
AB  - The Dentocult SM ("Strip mutans") method occasionally shows decoloration of broth and of colonies of mutans streptococci on the plastic strip, thereby making interpretation difficult. In an attempt to explain the phenomenon and to investigate the influence of the salivary flora on the "Strip mutans" method, a total of 46 subjects were sampled. Saliva was analyzed using the "Strip mutans" method and conventional plating techniques to identify mutans streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, and yeasts. Approximately 85% of the "Strip mutans" scores coincided with the conventional MSB-plating method. Two samples showed decolored mutans streptococci colonies on the "Strip mutans" strip. Enterococcus spp. were present in the saliva of these test subjects and could grow in the "Strip mutans" broth. Enterococcus faecalis was able to induce the same type of decoloration under experimental pure culture conditions. Three "Strip mutans" samples showed small colonies of mutans streptococci, visible only under magnification (x 10-20). Staphylococcus epidermidis was present in these saliva samples and showed heavy growth in the broth. Under experimental pure culture conditions S. epidermidis also inhibited the growth of mutans streptococci to some extent.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a C-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. Cefquinome inhibited members of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella Shigella, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella, and Providencia. Although most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. Serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. The majority of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Most enterococci had cefquinome MICs of 4-8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome was extremely active against group-A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MICs less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. It inhibited some Enterobacter and Citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. Cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella, Branhamella, and Pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9. Its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for most species except for Enterobacter were within a dilution of MICs.
TI  - Use of a commercial double-test tablet (Rosco PGUA/indole) for screening of Escherichia coli.
AB  - A commercial double-test tablet (Rosco PGUA/indole) for detection of beta-glucuronidase (beta-GUR) activity and indole production was evaluated on a collection of 393 isolates of Enterobacteria. Both beta-GUR and indole were positive on 96.6% of Escherichia coli strains. beta-GUR, only, was also detected in 25 Shigella spp., four Enterobacter cloacae, eight Citrobacter freundii, and five Salmonella enteritidis strains, none of which were indole producers. An additional 261 consecutive clinical isolates of oxidase-negative nonswarming Gram-negative bacilli were studied in a parallel comparative field trial against conventional identification methods. For 200 strains, the standard method and PGUA/indole test were performed from the primary culture plate. The remaining 61 (23.4%) required subculture before testing. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of PGUA/indole test in the screening for E. coli were, respectively, 94.1%, 100%, 100%, and 87.1%. In our experience, PGUA/indole test is a rapid, precise, simple-to-perform, and economical method for screening E. coli. However, the need for a large inoculum may limit its application on primary cultures.
TI  - Multicenter open-label study of parenteral ofloxacin in treatment of pyelonephritis in adults.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of parenteral ofloxacin were evaluated in an open, multicenter study of hospitalized patients with pyelonephritis. The patients received ofloxacin 400 mg IV as an initial dose followed by ofloxacin 200 mg IV b.i.d. for a minimum of three days. The patients could then continue ofloxacin orally 200 mg b.i.d. for a total of seven to fourteen days. The most common pathogens isolated were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Microbiologic eradication was achieved in 65 of 66 evaluable patients (98%), and clinical cure or clinical improvement was noted in all patients. Of 82 patients evaluable for safety, 12 (15%) reported drug-related adverse events, the most frequent of which was pruritus or rash. None of the patients experienced drug-related central nervous system symptoms. Ofloxacin is well tolerated and highly effective in the treatment of pyelonephritis.
TI  - Handwashing and disinfection of heavily contaminated hands--effective or ineffective?
AB  - Hands are among the principal vehicles for transfer of nosocomial pathogens in hospitals. Often, outbreaks of infection are thought to be caused by a lack of compliance with handwashing guidelines, rather than due to the inadequacy of the handwashing agents used. In this study the effectiveness of proper handwashing and the use of three different hand disinfectants: ethanol 70% (E), isopropanol 40% (I) and alcoholic chlorhexidine (70%) (AC) was compared using three volunteers whose fingertips were heavily contaminated with a succession of bacteria including: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. After each contamination, thorough handwashing and application of one disinfectant on the hands were performed three times. Fingerprint-samples were taken before and 1 min after application of the disinfectants. Thorough handwashing with an ordinary liquid soap ('Sterisol') did not reduce the confluent growth of bacteria on fingertips for any of the species used (197 examinations). Only AC had a significant effect on fingers heavily contaminated with S. aureus (126 examinations; AC compared with E and I; P less than 0.0002 and P less than 0.0002 respectively), but did not completely eradicate the bacteria. After contamination with Ent. cloacae (118 examinations), none of the three agents were particularly effective, but E and AC seemed to be somewhat more effective than I (P less than 0.0002 and P less than 0.01 respectively). When successive contamination was performed using all bacterial species, AC was the most effective decontaminant. However, Ent. cloacae was still present on the fingertips after 15 repeated courses of handwashing and applications of disinfectants. Bathing of hands in AC for 20s completely eradicated all bacteria from the hands. The study demonstrates that, when heavily contaminated, an ordinary handwashing followed by disinfectants is not enough to eradicate potentially pathogenic bacteria from the hands.
TI  - The UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyl-transferase of Enterobacter cloacae. Molecular cloning, sequencing of the gene and overexpression of the enzyme.
AB  - The UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase (enolpyruvyltransferase, EC 2.5.1.7) which catalyses the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell-wall peptidoglycan was purified to near homogeneity from Enterobacter cloacae and the NH2-terminal amino-acid sequence determined. Using the polymerase chain reaction a 53-bp DNA fragment was synthesized; this fragment encodes the NH2-terminal sequence of the enzyme. A clone was then isolated which contained an open reading frame of 1257 bp coding for a protein of 419 amino acids. This protein was overexpressed 100-fold in transformed Escherichia coli cells and shown to possess the enolpyruvyltransferase activity. The overall amino-acid sequence of the enolpyruvyltransferase is significantly similar to that of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase, the only other enzyme known to catalyse the transfer of the enolpyruvate moiety of phosphoenolpyruvate to a substrate.
TI  - Cloacal flora isolated from wild black-bellied whistling ducks (Dendrocygna autumnalis) in Laguna La Nacha, Mexico.
AB  - Cloacal swabs from 110 adult black-bellied whistling ducks trapped at Laguna La Nacha, Tamaulipas, Mexico, were cultured to determine the prevalence of normal and potentially pathogenic bacteria. Twenty-five gram-negative enterobacteria and four gram-positive cocci were isolated. The most common isolates included Escherichia coli (54%), Staphylococcus spp. (29%), Streptococcus spp. (22%), Aeromonas hydrophila (15%) Enterobacter cloacae (14%), and Micrococcus sp. (14%). The implications of whistling ducks as possible reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria are discussed.
TI  - RU 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester HR 916. II. Stability to beta-lactamases and affinity for penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - The aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin RU 29 246, the active metabolite of the prodrug-ester HR 916, is active against strains producing the widespread plasmid-encoded TEM-1, TEM-2 and SHV-1 beta-lactamases. Except for TEM-7 the activity of RU 29 246 against strains producing extended broad spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-6, SHV-2, SHV-4, SHV-5, CMY-1, CTX-M), however, is low. Relative hydrolysis rates of RU 29 246 are comparable with those of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of CS-807, and are extremely low for the TEM-1 and SHV-1 beta-lactamases. The compound demonstrates remarkable inhibitory activity against the chromosomal beta-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae P99. In the presence of 1.7 microM this enzyme loses 50% of its activity. At concentrations of 0.43, 0.003 and 0.01 micrograms/ml the compound binds preferentially to the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 3 of Escherichia coli K12, to the PBPs 2x and 3 of Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 and to PBP 1 of Staphylococcus aureus SG 511, respectively.
TI  - Homeostasis as regulated by activated macrophage. III. Protective effect of LPSw  (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of wheat flour) on gastric ulcer in mice as compared with those of other LPS from various sources.
AB  - Protective effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from various sources on gastric ulcer has been examined in mice using parenteral as well as oral route. Ulcer is induced by indomethacin, stress or alcohol. LPS was prepared from 6 species of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pantoea agglomerans, Serratia ficaria, Enterobacter cloacae, Bordetella pertussis, Alcaligenes faecalis) and from wheat flour. When administered intravenously, LPS of Pantoea agglomerans was the most effective among other LPS examined. Lipopolysaccharide of wheat flour (LPSw) showed a significantly protective effect by the oral route, especially when given ad libitum in drinking water to mice.
TI  - Homeostasis as regulated by activated macrophage. II. LPS of plant origin other than wheat flour and their concomitant bacteria.
AB  - In order to seek a macrophage-activating substance, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of plant origin other than that of wheat flour was surveyed. A large amount of LPS (10-100 micrograms/g) was detected in Laminaria japonica (kelp), Curcuma longa (turmeric), Undaria pinnatifida and other substances. Since concomitant bacteria possibly existing in root of farm products can be considered to contribute to LPS of plant origin, a count was taken of bacterial cells both dead and alive. This count revealed that some LPS were derived from concomitant bacteria which had probably come from root. Few concomitant bacterial cells were found in seaweed, while stem-root contained enough bacterial cells. Three predominant bacteria have been isolated and identified; Pantoea agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia ficaria. These LPSs were purified and their chemical compositions were examined. They are similar to that of Escherichia coli except that their molecular sizes are smaller. Since LPS is non-toxic when taken orally or percutaneously, these LPSs may also be advantageous in the cure of intractable diseases.
TI  - Plasmid profiles of Acinetobacter and Enterobacter species of hospital origin: restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid DNA and transformation of Escherichia coli by R plasmids.
AB  - A total of 37 multi-resistant strains (20 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and 17 Enterobacter cloacae) were isolated from patients of the Intensive Care Units. All the isolates were examined for resistance to a battery of antimicrobial agents by the disk diffusion method. Plasmid profiles and restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid DNA by EcoR1 revealed the spread of one A. calcoaceticus and two E. cloacae endemic strains. Transformation experiments on Escherichia coli competent cells by three plasmids established the presence of R plasmids in the multi-resistant isolates.
TI  - Detergent-shock response in enteric bacteria.
AB  - Our work on bacterial detergent resistance started with the realization that bacteria growing in a sink full of soap must be resistant to the detergents in that soap. We chose sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) as a model detergent and decided to see how much SDS the bacterium growing in the sink could tolerate. The research program thus initiated has shown that bacteria such as Enterobacter cloacae can grow in up to 25% SDS and that SDS-shock proteins constitute c. 8% of the proteins synthesized by SDS-grown Escherichia coli. It has also provided explanations why enteric bacteria are oxidase negative, and how pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) enters the periplasmic space. Finally, for E. coli, it has provided evidence for an alternate, phosphate-limited, aquatic life style which places greater emphasis on the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Detergent resistance is important both medically and ecologically, e.g. entry of pathogens via bile-salt-containing intestinal tracts and biodegradation of detergent-like pollutants such as those resulting from oil spills. Our current research is focused on SDS-induced modifications of the cytoplasmic membrane and the presence of SDS in the periplasm.
TI  - Bacteriophage lytic patterns for identification of salmonellae, shigellae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - A series of bacteriophages specific for Escherichia coli (E-1, E-2, E-3, and E-4), Citrobacter freundii (phi I, phi II, and phi III), Enterobacter cloacae (Ent), and Shigella spp. (Sh) have been isolated from hospital sewage. These bacteriophages, in combination with Felix Salmonella phage O-I, were used as a diagnostic phage typing set which included seven phage preparations: O-I, C (phi I and phi III), Sh, E (E-1 and E-2), CE (phi II and E-3), E-4, and Ent. After 20,280 cultures of 27 species and 9 biogroups of 15 genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae and 276 cultures of 8 species of 6 genera outside the Enterobacteriaceae were tested, it was shown that most strains of salmonellae, E. coli, C. freundii, and E. cloacae can be identified accurately. The sensitivities of identification were 83.6% for E. cloacae, 88.8% for C. freundii, 90.3% for E. coli, and 95.76% for salmonellae. The specificities were 99.78% for salmonellae, 99.84% for E. cloacae, 99.89% for E. coli, and 99.97% for C. freundii. The results of bacteriophage lytic patterns were highly correlated with Shigella serotypes. Therefore, such a phage typing set may be used routinely in public hygiene and clinical laboratories.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Amino acid substitutions in naturally occurring variants of ail result in altered invasion activity.
AB  - Yersinia enterocolitica is the causative agent of a variety of gastrointestinal syndromes ranging from acute enteritis to mesenteric lymphadenitis. In addition, systemic infections resulting in high mortality rates can occur in elderly and immunocompromised patients. More than 50 serotypes of Y. enterocolitica have been identified, but only a few of them commonly cause disease in otherwise healthy hosts. Those serotypes that cause disease have been divided into two groups, American and non-American, based on their geographical distributions, biotypes, and pathogenicity. We have been studying two genes, inv and ail, from Y. enterocolitica that confer in tissue culture assays an invasive phenotype that strongly correlates with virulence. Some differences between the American and non-American serotypes at the ail locus were noted previously and have been investigated further in this report. The ail locus was cloned from seven Y. enterocolitica strains (seven different serotypes). Although the different clones produced similar amounts of Ail, the product of the ail gene from non-American serotypes (AilNA) was less able to promote invasion by Escherichia coli than was the product of the ail gene from American serotypes (AilA). This difference is probably due to one or more of the eight amino acid changes found in the derived amino acid sequence for the mature form of AilNA compared with that of AilA. Seven of these changes are predicted to be in cell surface domains of the protein (a model for the proposed folding of Ail within the outer membrane is presented). These results are discussed in relation to the growing family of outer membrane proteins, which includes Lom from bacteriophage lambda, PagC from salmonella typhimurium, and OmpX from Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - Comparative activity of meropenem (SM-7338) against major respiratory pathogens and amikacin-resistant nosocomial isolates.
AB  - Meropenem, a new broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic, demonstrated excellent in  vitro activity against major respiratory pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of meropenem for Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were frequently less than those of imipenem. For nosocomial amikacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli, meropenem had eightfold lower MIC90 values compared to imipenem against strains of Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli; it was 32-fold more active than imipenem against Proteus mirabilis isolates. Activity was similar to that of imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Overall, meropenem showed excellent activity against common community-acquired pathogens as well as amikacin-resistant nosocomial pathogens.
TI  - Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry for bacterial chemotaxonomy: influence of culture age, growth temperature, gaseous environment and extraction technique.
AB  - Extracted phospholipids of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter cloacae were examined by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry which yielded major peaks between m/z 225 and 761. The result of extracting freeze-dried or 'wet' cells showed that freeze-drying may be omitted although weighing of dried cells offers a useful means of standardizing the extraction procedure. Anaerobic growth quantitatively altered the chemical finger-print as a result of increase in ratio of saturated: unsaturated carboxylic acids. Growth temperature also affected profiles over the temperature range 24-45 degrees C. A less drastic influence on mass spectra was culture age, over the range 16-48 h. Comparison of spectra was possible with Pearson's coefficient of linear correlation which yielded the following values: wet and lyophilized cells, r = 0.97; aerobic and anaerobic growth, r = 0.82; 24 degrees C and 45 degrees C, r = 0.76; 16 h and 48 h, r = 0.95. These results show that although quantitative differences do occur between spectra for the same organism prepared in different ways, they are less than interspecies variation, e.g. with E. coli and P. mirabilis, r = 0.46. Any differences which are due preparation method can be overcome by standardization of technique.
TI  - [Synergistic action of cefodizime with other antimicrobial agents on clinically isolated microorganisms. II. Synergistic action with sisomicin].
AB  - Cefodizime (CDZM) possesses a broad antimicrobial spectrum and a relatively long  half life in the blood. In addition, it shows excellent therapeutic efficacies in the treatment of infections in leukopenic animal models, hence it is expected that CDZM may have good efficacies against various infections in immunocompromised hosts. In the meantime, sisomicin (SISO) not only has strong antibacterial activities against Gram-negative rods (GNR), but has relatively low nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Thus, we examined antibacterial effectiveness of the combination of CDZM and SISO against clinical isolates in vitro. 1. Antibacterial effects of CDZM+SISO combination were examined using SISO susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Observations that the combination of the 2 drugs showed FIC indices between less than 0.5-less than 1.0 against most of these strains at SISO concentrations of 1 MIC or sub MIC levels strongly suggested the presence of a synergistic action between the 2 drugs against SISO susceptible strains of GNR. 2. Of the strains tested, 10% of C. freundii, 6.7% of E. cloacae, 63.3% of S. marcescens, 23.3% of P. vulgaris and 18.0% of P. aeruginosa were found to be resistant to SISO, and little synergistic effect of the 2 drugs was observed against these strains. 3. As the synergistic effect of the 2 drugs against GNR was observed against SISO susceptible strains including those which were resistant to CDZM, but not against those strains which were resistant to SISO, it seems reasonable to conclude that the appearance of the synergistic effect between the 2 drugs depends on the activity of SISO.
TI  - Urinary tract infection in infants in spite of prenatal diagnosis of hydronephrosis.
AB  - The efficacy of preventing neonatal urinary infection in infants by diagnosing hydronephrosis in the fetus on obstetrical ultrasonography was studied. 426 infants had uroradiologic evaluation between 1984 and June 1991 because they had hydronephrosis detected in utero. Thirteen with posterior urethral valves were excluded. Of the remaining 413, 13 (3.1%) presented with urinary infection in the first 6 months of life. Ten of the 13 were boys and 7 were not circumcised. Eleven of the 13 infants less than 2 months old were formula-fed. The causes of hydronephrosis were reflux alone in 6, ureteropelvic junction obstruction in 6 (with coexisting ipsilateral reflux in 4), and primary megaureter in 1. Ultrasonography alone was insufficient to exclude reflux. Amoxicillin-resistant bacteria were the causative organisms in all 10 for whom bacteriology data was available. Four categories of management failure were identified: 1) failure of communication of the prenatal findings, 2) antibiotics not prescribed, 3) antibiotics prescribed but not administered, and 4) infection in spite of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis. Uncircumcised formula-fed male infants with reflux seemed to be at special risk for infection.
TI  - [Occurrence of P.fimbrii in strains from selected genera of Enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - This study was aimed at recognition of frequency of occurrence of P fimbriae in strains of Escherichia coli isolated from samples of feces of children with symptoms of diarrhoea and at search of these adhesions in strains representing other than Escherichia genera of Enterobacteriaceae strains. One hundred forty laboratory strains were investigated. They belonged to genus Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Hafnia, Klebsiella, Morganella, Proteus, Providencia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia. Also were tested 1277 colonies of enteric rods isolated from the MacConkey's medium inoculated with samples of feces from 163 children with symptoms of diarrhoea. Mannose-resistant active hemagglutination test was performed with human group O erythrocytes and guinea pig erythrocytes stabilized with glutaraldehyde. Presence of P fimbriae was detected by the slide latex test with latex covered by P1 glycoprotein. Among 140 laboratory strains of Enterobacteriaceae in 21 strains (3-E. cloaceae, 2-Hafnia, 13-K. pneumoniae, 2-P. rettgeri and in one strains of Providencia) presence of MRHA adhesins was demonstrated. Nine of these strains (2-Hafnia, 5-K. pneumoniae and 2-P. rettgeri) reacted specifically in the latex test. Among 1142 colonies of E. coli isolated from children with symptoms of diarrhoea, 326 colonies belonged to 13 EPEC serotypes. With 118 (36.2%) of EPEC colonies a positive result of MRHA reaction was found with human erythrocytes and 34 (10.4%) with guinea pig erythrocytes. Positive latex test was obtained with 77 (23.6%) colonies. All these colonies possessed MRHA adhesins. Remaining 816 colonies of E. coli strains did not represent microorganisms belonging to serotypes accepted as enteropathogenic. From 112 (13.7%) colonies out of 816 not belonging to EPEC, positive results was obtained in the MRHA test with human erythrocytes and this was the case also with 41 (5.0%) colonies in MRHA reaction with application of guinea pig erythrocytes. The latex test was positive in 65 (7.9%) colonies of E. coli. From remaining 135 colonies other than E. coli, positive result of latex test of presence of P fimbriae was obtained with 54 (40.0%) colonies, including 14 colonies of E. cloacae, 23-K. pneumoniae and 17-K. oxytoca. In all these strains presence of MRHA adhesins was demonstrated. These investigations demonstrated that among EPEC strains significantly more frequently, than not belonging to these serotypes of E. coli, MRHA adhesins, including P fimbriae was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Retrospective 6-year study of enterobacter bacteraemia in a Danish university hospital.
AB  - In order to study the epidemiology of invasive enterobacter infections, data from 53 consecutive cases of bacteraemia due to this organism were compared with data from 72 randomly selected cases of Escherichia coli bacteraemia. The cases occurred among patients admitted to a Danish University hospital over a 6-year period. Forty-eight cases were due to Enterobacter cloacae and five were due to Ent. aerogenes. Enterobacter bacteraemia was more often of nosocomial origin than E. coli bacteraemia and more often polymicrobial. Patients suffering from enterobacter bacteraemia were younger than E. coli patients, and males tended to predominate. Apart from cancer of the prostate, other malignant diseases tended to be more frequent among patients with enterobacter bacteraemia than among E. coli patients. Enterobacter bacteraemia was more often associated with a focus in central venous catheters and burns, whereas patients with E. coli bacteraemia more often showed a focus of infection in the urinary tract. Patients with enterobacter bacteraemia and a microbiologically documented focus in the respiratory tract or the urinary tract more often had an endotracheal tube or indwelling urinary catheter compared to patients with E. coli bacteraemia with a similar focus of infection. In patients with no microbiologically documented focus enterobacter bacteraemia was more often associated with the presence of central and peripheral venous catheters. During the preceding 12 weeks patients with enterobacter bacteraemia, more often than E. coli patients, had been treated with beta-lactam antibiotics, especially penicillins. The close association with devices may indicate that Enterobacter has a special affinity for foreign body material. Studies are planned to elucidate this aspect in further detail.
TI  - Detection of ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-negative bacteria due to alterations in gyrA.
AB  - Two plasmids containing the cloned Escherichia coli wild-type gyrA gene were used to transform ciprofloxacin-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates to screen for DNA gyrase A-mediated quinolone resistance. The results show that the technique is simple and applicable to a wide range of Gram-negative species including E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The use of an arithmetical MIC series of dilutions (as opposed to standard geometrical ones) was found to be essential during screening for the detection of altered gyrase A. The observations were consistent with the suggestion that DNA gyrase is highly conserved among different species of bacteria and that gyrase A-mediated resistance can occur in all.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - Drug treatment of pneumonia in the hospital. What are the choices?
AB  - Mortality and morbidity of nosocomial pneumonia remain high. Successful treatment of pulmonary infections depends on several factors including type of infection, offending pathogen, status of host defences, and adequate choice of antibiotic therapy. The physician's decision should aim at achieving antibiotic concentrations beyond the MIC at the site of infection. Gram-negative bacilli, notably Pseudomonos aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, remain the most frequent agents in nosocomial pneumonia. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae predominate among the Gram-positive cocci. Pneumocystis carinii predominates in immunocompromised patients. Protected sample bronchoscopy associated with quantitative cultures of samples, and quantification of intracellular microorganisms in cells recovered by broncho-alveolar lavage are two promising procedures which might replace previous, more aggressive methods. Penetration of antibiotics into lung tissue depends on physicochemical properties of the drug and the degree of inflammation of lung tissue. Quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim penetrate well into bronchial secretions. Penetration is moderate to low for aminoglycosides and beta-lactams. Fluoroquinolones and new beta-lactam agents, including third-generation cephalosporins imipenem, aztreonam and ticarcillin-clavulanate, showed comparative clinical efficacy in treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, with an efficacy rate close to 80%. Aminoglycosides should not be used alone. Combination therapy reduces but does not eliminate the risk of selection of Gram-negative resistant mutants. It should not be used routinely except for P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens infections.
TI  - Multiple copies of IS10 in the Enterobacter cloacae MD36 chromosome.
AB  - Repetitive sequences were isolated and characterized as double-stranded DNA fragments by treatment with S1 nuclease after denaturation and renaturation of the total DNA of Enterobacter cloacae MD36. One repetitive sequence was identical to the nucleotide sequence of IS10-right (IS10R), which is the active element in the plasmid-associated transposon Tn10. Unexpectedly, 15 copies of IS10R were found in the chromosomal DNA of E. cloacae MD36. One copy of the central region of Tn10 was found in the total DNA of E. cloacae MD36. IS10Rs in restriction fragments isolated from the E. cloacae MD36 total DNA showed 9-bp duplications adjacent to the terminal sequences that are characteristic of Tn10 transposition. This result suggests that many copies of IS10R in E. cloacae MD36 are due to transposition of IS10R alone, not due to transposition of Tn10 or to DNA rearrangement. I also found nine copies of IS10 in Shigella sonnei HH109, two and four copies in two different natural isolates of Escherichia coli, and two copies in E. coli K-12 strain JM109 from the 60 bacterial strains that were examined. All dam sites in the IS10s in E. cloacae MD36 and S. sonnei HH109 were methylated. Tn10 and IS10 transpose by a mechanism in which the element is excised from the donor site and inserted into the new target site without significant replication of the transposing segment; thus, the copy numbers of the elements in the cell are thought to be unchanged in most circumstances. Accumulation of IS10 copies in E. cloacae MD36 has interesting evolutionary implications.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effect of beta-lactam antibiotics on gram-negative bacteria in relation to morphology, initial killing and MIC.
AB  - The in vitro post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and imipenem on reference strains of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens were evaluated by bioluminescence assay of bacterial ATP. In parallel with the PAE determination, initial killing and morphology studies were performed. Imipenem produced greater than 1 h PAE on all strains tested, cefepime and cefotaxime on four strains and ceftazidime only on one of the strains tested. The length of the PAE on different strains did not correlate in the same way to MIC. Imipenem induced greater than 1 h PAE at 1/4-2 MIC while the cephalosporins caused greater than 1 h PAE at 4-256 x MIC. A PAE exceeding 1.2h was seen concomitantly with spheroplasts but there was not necessarily strong (greater than or equal to 99%) initial killing at the same time. The PAE duration at greater than or equal to 99% initial killing varied between 2.0 h and 5.0 h. When the cephalosporins produced less than 1 h PAEs, this was seen concomitantly with production on filaments and weak initial killing. The bioluminescence method was not jeopardized by filament formation and no negative PAE was found in contrast to the viable count method. The study showed that neither a certain multiple of MIC, the presence of spheroplasts nor strong initial killing can predict the length of PAE for beta-lactam antibiotics on gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Active components of intestinal bacteria for abdominal irradiation-induced inhibition of lung metastases.
AB  - We have previously reported that abdominal irradiation of mice inhibited lung metastases of a weakly immunogenic fibrosarcoma, and that transmigration after the irradiation of Enterobacter cloacae into mesenteric lymph nodes coincided with this phenomenon. In this paper, we show that Escherichia coli as well as E. cloacae reduce the number of metastatic lung colonies when these bacteria were intravenously injected into mice prior to the tumour cell challenge. The inhibition was caused not only by the administration of living bacteria but also by that of killed bacteria. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of membrane, replaced at least in part the effect of whole bacteria. Transfer of spleen cells from LPS-treated mice into intact recipients prominently inhibited metastatic development in the recipient mice. 'Cross transfer' between LPS high responders and LPS low responders suggested an indirect activity of transferred spleen cells. The antimetastatic activity of LPS depended on the tumour cell type; metastasis of fibrosarcomas was extensively inhibited by LPS irrespective of tumour immunogenicity while that of adenocarcinomas was only slightly inhibited. These results suggest that non-immunological mechanisms are involved in the antimetastatic activity of LPS.
TI  - Environmental contamination during tracheal suction. A comparison of disposable conventional catheters with a multiple-use closed system device.
AB  - The extent of airborne environmental bacterial contamination which occurs following tracheal suction has been investigated in patients undergoing intermittent positive pressure ventilation in the intensive therapy unit. Two methods of performing suction, one using a conventional open technique and one using a closed system (Stericath), have been compared. Significantly lower levels of environmental contamination were observed when the closed system was used.
TI  - Growth and disinfestation of 6 different bacteria in embryogenic suspension cultures of cotton.
AB  - Growth of 6 different common laboratory bacteria (Escherichia coli, Flavobacterium balustrum, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens) in a bacterial medium, fresh plant medium, and "spent" plant media was initially measured. In all cases, bacteria grew best in the bacterial medium followed by the fresh plant medium. The spent plant medium did not support growth of the bacteria and apparently was actively toxic to bacterial cells. Proliferating, embryogenic suspension cultures of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) were then inoculated with these 6 different bacteria. Two to three d following bacterial inoculation, embryogenic tissues were placed in various concentrations of bleach for various amounts of time, rinsed with sterile water, and placed on a bacterial culture medium. Clumps of embryogenic tissue which showed no visible bacterial growth after 3 d of culture were then transferred to an agar-solidified plant tissue culture medium to determine viability of bleachdisinfested tissues. Viable, single pieces of the disinfested embryogenic tissue were then used to reinitiate embryogenic suspension cultures. Treatment of contaminated tissue with a 1% bleach solution for 1-5 min resulted in the highest recovery of viable, disinfested tissues using 5 of the 6 bacteria. It was not possible to remove F. balustrum from clumps of embryogenic tissue without also killing the plant tissue.
TI  - The use of the PhP-KE biochemical fingerprinting system in epidemiological studies of faecal Enterobacter cloacae strains from infants in Swedish neonatal wards.
AB  - The PhenePlate (PhP) biochemical fingerprinting system is an automated method for typing of bacteria, based on the evaluation of the kinetics of biochemical reactions, performed in microtitre plates. In the present study the PhP-Klebsiella/Enterobacter (KE) system was evaluated for typing of Enterobacter cloacae and employed to study the epidemiology of faecal E. cloacae strains isolated from infants in 22 Swedish neonatal wards. The PhP-KE system showed a high reproducibility and discrimination for E. cloacae isolates. Among 64 epidemiologically unrelated E. cloacae strains, 49 distinct phenotypes were found, and the diversity index was 0.985. E. cloacae was found as a part of the dominating Gram-negative aerobic bacterial flora in 83 out of 953 infants studied. The incidences of E. cloacae colonization varied between 0 and 35% in different wards, but in contrast to previous data for Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, there was little evidence of spread of particular strains in the wards. We also discuss two different measures of nosocomial transmission of bacterial strains: transmissible strains and epidemic index.
TI  - [Desiccated rattlesnake capsules: a potential source of gram-negative bacterial infection].
AB  - The ingestion of rattlesnake powder capsules is frequent in Mexico in view of their alleged curative properties in various diseases, among them different malignancies. Based on previous reports showing both bacteremia and septicemia in patients with malignant diseases ingesting such capsules, we conducted a study to evaluate the presence of microorganisms in 16 different preparations of rattlesnake powder capsules, obtained in six different cities of our country. We found that all the samples were significantly contaminated with gram-negative coliform bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter agglomerans, E. cloacae, Salmonella arizona and Salmonella of groups B, E4 and G. Eighty one percent of the capsules were contaminated with Salmonella sp. The most frequent was S. arizona with a natural reservoir in snakes. Contamination was probably derived from both the flesh of the snake and fecal contamination during the domestic preparation of the powder to produce the capsules. These data, together with those previously published regarding bacteremia and septicemia derived from the ingestion of the capsules, suggests that there is danger in their use.
TI  - Comparative study of pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activity of ceftizoxime and cefotaxime.
AB  - Single 2-g intravenous doses of ceftizoxime (CZX) and cefotaxime (CTX) were given over 30 min to 10 adult volunteers in a crossover manner on two separate occasions. Concentrations of CZX, CTX, and the primary metabolite of CTX, desacetylcefotaxime (dCTX), in serum, suction-induced-blister fluid, and urine were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by using an extended least-squares modeling program (MKMODEL). CZX exhibited a half-life in serum (2.05 h) longer than that of CTX (1.43 h) but comparable to that of dCTX (2.02 h). The percentage of penetration in blister fluid, estimated by area under the curve ratios, was significantly higher for CZX (164.4%) than for CTX (60.8%). Serum bactericidal activity, determined for volunteer samples at 1, 6, 8, and 12 h after patients were dosed, against clinical isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Morganella morganii were significantly higher for CZX than those for CTX against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae at all times. Serum bactericidal titers against B. fragilis were also higher for CZX than for CTX at 1 h postinfusion. Neither CZX nor CTX exhibited any bactericidal activity at any other time against the B. fragilis group. In conclusion, the serum bactericidal activity of CZX was greater and more-prolonged than that of CTX against tested strains in spite of the in vitro synergistic contribution of dCTX to CTX, equal serum elimination half-lives of dCTX and CZX, and similar antibacterial activity and similar instability under microbiological testing for CZX and CTX.
TI  - Increased resistance to multiple drugs by introduction of the Enterobacter cloacae romA gene into OmpF porin-deficient mutants of Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Introduction of the romA gene cloned from Enterobacter cloacae into Escherichia coli K-12 resulted in almost complete inhibition of OmpF expression and a concomitant increase in resistance to quinolones, beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines. In addition, the romA gene reduced the susceptibility to these multiple drugs even in the OmpF porin-deficient mutants of E. coli K-12. Results indicate the presence of romA-sensitive penetration pathway(s) for these multiple drugs other than the OmpF porin in E. coli.
TI  - Beta-lactamase inhibitors: relation between kinetic data and in-vitro synergism studies.
AB  - Because of the need for control of beta-lactamase-mediated resistance and the recent development of tazobactam, the author has examined the inhibitors of various beta-lactamases for their effectiveness. On the basis of the kinetic data, tazobactam exhibited the highest affinity to various beta-lactamases. A combination with tazobactam was found to enhance the effectiveness of piperacillin against S. aureus producing penicillinase, E. coli producing TEM-1 or TEM 2 enzymes and class I beta-lactamase-derepressed isolates of E. cloacae, Serratia spp. and C. freundii, however not P. aeruginosa, while there was no marked synergism in beta-lactamase-derepressed clones of K. oxytoca.
TI  - Microbial growth and endotoxin production in the intravenous anesthetic propofol.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we measured microbial growth and endotoxin production in the intravenous anesthetic propofol using 10 different microbial strains; 6 isolated from outbreak cases and 4 from laboratory stock cultures. DESIGN: In each trial, endotoxin-free glass tubes containing 10 ml propofol were inoculated with 10(0)-10(3) CFU/ml of the test organism and incubated at 30 degrees C for 72 hours. SETTING: In May and June 1990, the Centers for Disease Control received reports of 5 outbreaks in 5 states of postsurgical patient infections and/or pyrogenic reactions. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations implicated extrinsic contamination of an intravenous anesthetic, propofol, as the probable source of these outbreaks. RESULTS: After 24 hours, 9 of the 10 cultures increased in viable counts by 3 to 6 logs. At least 1 ng/ml of endotoxin was produced within 24 hours by Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol can support rapid microbial growth and endotoxin production. To avoid infectious complications, scrupulous aseptic technique should be used when preparing or administering this anesthetic.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of RU29246 (HR916 metabolite) compared with four other oral beta-lactams tested against more than 5000 clinical isolates.
AB  - The activity of RU29246, the active metabolite of the oral cephalosporin ester HR916, was compared in a multicenter study with that of the four oral beta-lactam antibiotics cephalexin, cefaclor, cefixime and amoxicillin/clavulanate (amoxicillin/CA). RU29246 was generally 2- to 8-fold more active than the other oral cephalosporins and comparable to amoxicillin/CA against staphylococci, and was the most active cephalosporin against group B streptococci. All four cephalosporins were ineffective against enterococci. RU29246 was the only cephalosporin consistently active against Acinetobacter, but all beta-lactam antibiotics had poor activity against Pseudomonas spp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia. RU29246 was comparable to cefixime and more active than the other cephalosporins against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. However, all of the antibiotics had poor activity against Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Quality control reference ranges for the quality control organisms Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 are proposed for the broth dilution method based on data derived from this multicenter study.
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. The frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. In this study isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. Type 3, P, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. The Klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. Also, both type 3 and Escherichia coli P fimbrial genotypes were detected by using DNA colony blot assays. The frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: Enterobacter (38.6%), Klebsiella (26.8%), Serratia (17.7%), E. coli (13%), and Proteus (5.2%). Isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. The phenotype and genotype for E. coli P fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. In addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes. Finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among K. oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis isolates. The frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic  acid correlated with beta-lactamase production.
AB  - Amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, was tested for its effect in combination with clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against 9 species of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. A total of 698 strains of bacteria were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. Their susceptibilities to amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid were tested by the agar dilution method. The percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 46.6% in Proteus mirabilis to 100% in Klebsiella pneumoniac. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to amoxicillin than beta-lactamase producers. For beta-lactamase producers, clavulanic acid decreased the MICs of amoxicillin prominently in strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacteroides fragilis, when combining clavulanic acid with amoxicillin in the ratio of 1:2. Their MIC50s, MIC90s and geometric means of MICs all decreased 4 folds or greater. For beta-lactamase non-producing strains, the MICs did not show significant differences by adding clavulanic acid in most species we tested, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, N. gonorrhoeae, H. influenzae, Proteus vulgaris and E. cloacae.
TI  - Growth kinetics of coliform bacteria under conditions relevant to drinking water  distribution systems.
AB  - The growth of environmental and clinical coliform bacteria under conditions typical of drinking water distribution systems was examined. Four coliforms (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae) were isolated from an operating drinking water system for study; an enterotoxigenic E. coli strain and clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae and E. coli were also used. All but one of the coliforms tested were capable of growth in unsupplemented mineral salts medium; the environmental isolates had greater specific growth rates than did the clinical isolates. This trend was maintained when the organisms were grown with low levels (less than 1 mg liter-1) of yeast extract. The environmental K. pneumoniae isolate had a greater yield, higher specific growth rates, and a lower Ks value than the other organisms. The environmental E. coli and the enterotoxigenic E. coli strains had comparable yield, growth rate, and Ks values to those of the environmental K. pneumoniae strain, and all three showed significantly more successful growth than the clinical isolates. The environmental coliforms also grew well at low temperatures on low concentrations of yeast extract. Unsupplemented distribution water from the collaborating utility supported the growth of the environmental isolates. Growth of the K. pneumoniae water isolate was stimulated by the addition of autoclaved biofilm but not by tubercle material. These findings indicate that growth of environmental coliforms is possible under the conditions found in operating municipal drinking water systems and that these bacteria could be used in tests to determine assimilable organic carbon in potable water.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
AB  - Cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. Its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Cefcanel had excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, MIC90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. However, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, MIC greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the MICs were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides spp. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the MICs of cefixime. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were resistant. Cefcanel was hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-3 and Moraxella Bro-1 beta-lactamases. Escherichia coli containing TEM-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel MICs of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited Haemophilus influenzae carrying TEM-1.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 09-1428 compared to other cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, E-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Ro 09-1428 inhibited group A streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group B, C and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for Staphylococcus aureus Ro 09-1428 had MICs of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and E-1040. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml, and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. The majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, Providencia, Salmonella and Shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. For most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae Ro 09-1428 had higher MICs of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. Anaerobes, enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes were resistant to Ro 09-1428. Ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-2, Staphylococcus aureus PC-1, Moraxella catarrhalis Bro-1, Enterobacter P-99, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Sabath-Abraham or Klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-7 and TEM-9. Ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid pH.
TI  - Phenotypic characterization of quinolone-resistant mutants of Enterobacteriaceae  selected from wild type, gyrA type and multiply-resistant (marA) type strains.
AB  - The NCTC type strains of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella pneumoniae were exposed to 3, 5 and 10 x MIC of nalidixic acid, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, PD 117596 and PD 127391. From each strain a mutant with a high MIC of quinolones alone (gyrA) and a mutant with intermediate resistance to quinolones, some beta-lactams, chloramphenicol and tetracycline (multiply resistant, m-r) were selected on agar containing antibiotics. The gyrA mutants required a higher concentration of quinolone to inhibit DNA synthesis by 50% but quinolone uptake kinetics and outer membrane profile were the same as the wild type. The m-r mutants had similar DNA synthesis IC50 as the wild type, decreased quinolone uptake kinetics and had decreased expression of an OMP of approximately 40 kD. The gyrA and m-r mutants were then exposed to 3, 5 and 10 x MIC of the same quinolones and new mutants (F2) selected. The F2 mutants from the gyrA mutants displayed a further increase in quinolone MIC; the F2 mutants from the m-r mutants had several phenotypes: high quinolone MICs with cross resistance to other agents, high quinolone resistance alone, or intermediate quinolone resistance alone. Most F2 mutants had MICs above the recommended breakpoint concentrations for quinolones. The F2 mutants often had altered biochemical profiles (API 20E), however, only in the case of E. cloacae did this affect speciation with the strains being identified as Rhanella aquatalis.
TI  - Comparison of ribotyping with conventional methods for the type identification of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - An Escherichia coli rRNA probe was compared with a combination of O serotyping, phage susceptibility, and biotype pattern for the type identification of strains of Enterobacter cloacae. Forty-five isolates of E. cloacae from 36 patients in nine hospitals were examined. By conventional typing, only 26 (57.7%) could be assigned to a specific serotype and 6 (13.3%) were autoagglutinating owing to rough lipopolysaccharide antigens. All isolates could be assigned to one of three biotypes, but many phage sensitivity patterns were evident. Twenty-nine distinct strains were identified by combined typing. Probing of EcoRI and BamHI digests of chromosomal DNA with a cDNA copy of E. coli rRNA proved to be highly discriminating between strains. Thirty different ribotypes based on 28 bands were recorded. Overall, agreement between the ribotyping and combined typing methods was good (84.4%), and discrepancies were generally confined to serologically unclassifiable strains and variability in biotype codes. Ribotyping was reproducible, and five of six pairs of isolates from the same and different patients gave identical hybridization profiles on separate occasions. We conclude that ribotyping is a highly discriminatory and reproducible method for the typing of E. cloacae, but in most outbreaks it offers little increase in discrimination over traditional methods.
TI  - Factors affecting duration of in-vivo postantibiotic effect for aminoglycosides against gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - A murine thigh-infection model was used to determine the effect of certain host-  and drug-related factors on the duration of the in-vivo postantibiotic effect (PAE) observed with aminoglycosides against Gram-negative bacilli. The role of neutrophils (PMNs), pharmacokinetics and variation among species and strains were studied. PAEs were quantitated after a single injection of gentamicin or amikacin. PAEs were several hours longer in normal mice than in neutropenic mice, in mice with renal impairment than in those with normal renal function, and with strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae than with strains of Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae. Among the 15 strains of Enterobacteriaceae studied, the duration of the in-vivo PAE did not correlate with MIC, duration of in-vitro PAE, and extent of in-vivo bactericidal activity. We conclude that prolonged PAEs are consistently observed in vivo with aminoglycosides against Enterobacteriaceae, and that this duration is enhanced in the presence of PMNs and by pharmacokinetic properties simulating those observed in humans.
TI  - In vitro phagocytic interaction between Trichomonas vaginalis isolates and bacteria.
AB  - The phagocytic activity of 12 Trichomonas vaginalis isolates against both gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Lactobacillus spp.) and gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047, 5 strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) was studied. Results showed that all the isolates were able to ingest Staphylococcus aureus to a variable degree, and almost all of them showed phagocytic activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, experiments with a restricted number of isolates of Trichomonas vaginalis showed that they phagocytized, often very effectively, human vaginal lactobacilli. Only in some cases was the addition of serum essential for bacteria ingestion. Phagocytic uptake of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae was not detectable under the experimental conditions used. It is concluded that phagocytosis may be involved in changes in vaginal biocenosis during the early stages of trichomoniasis.
TI  - Oral mucosal soft tissue necrosis caused by superinfection. Report of three cases.
AB  - Three patients in whom flap necrosis developed after oral surgeries and antibiotic therapies were studied microbiologically by routine aerobic and anaerobic methods. In all cases the bacteria Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and coagulase-negative penicillinase-producing staphylococci were resistant to the antibiotics used. These bacteria are frequent microorganisms of superinfection and were not found after the necrotic tissues had repaired.
TI  - Formaldehyde-resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa: identification of resistance genes by DNA-hybridization.
AB  - A 4.1. Kb large DNA fragment of a E. coli plasmid pVU 3695, on which the genes for formaldehyde-resistance are located, was used as a DNA probe to identify bacteria that carry this segment among formaldehyde-resistant bacteria. It was shown by Southern Blot-, Dot Blot-, and Colony Blot- Hybridization studies that the DNA of all formaldehyde-resistant E. coli, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains tested hybridize with the DNA probe from E. coli. In contrast the E. coli DNA probe does not hybridize with the DNA from formaldehyde-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains.
TI  - [Combined antibacterial activity of aztreonam and clindamycin against clinically  isolated strains].
AB  - It has been reported in some studies that the combination of aztreonam (AZT) and  clindamycin (CLDM) have high clinical effectiveness in the treatment of intractable infections. We, therefore, studied combined in vitro antibacterial activity of these 2 compounds using many freshly isolated strains. 1. AZT and CLDM in combination had synergistic effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, which are sensitive or quasi-sensitive to CLDM, in the presence of CLDM at MIC or sub-MIC. 2. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are not sensitive to CLDM, the 2 drugs in combination showed synergistic effects on some species and additive or slightly additive effects on most species in the presence of CLDM at those concentrations which are usually maintained in blood. 3. The 2 drugs showed no antagonism.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antibacterial activity of sparfloxacin (AT-4140; RP 64206),  a new quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin (AT-4140; RP 64206), a new fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of 10 other agents against 1,222 clinical isolates. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were the most active quinolones against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli; sparfloxacin had superior activity against gram-positive cocci in comparison with the activities of ciprofloxacin and the other quinolones tested (norfloxacin, lomefloxacin, and pefloxacin). Among the inhibited strains, several were resistant to the tested beta-lactam antibiotics or to aminoglycosides. The activity of sparfloxacin was not influenced by the medium that was used; lowering of the pH to 5 had a marked effect on the MICs for two strains each of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain each of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus; the MBC of sparfloxacin was within 1 to 2 dilution steps of the MIC for the strains that were tested.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of oral cefixime therapy in common infectious diseases in children.
AB  - Twenty-nine children, including 20 boys and 9 girls, were enrolled in an open trial of oral cefixime therapy for common pediatric infectious diseases. Patients aged between 0.5 month and 12 years with a mean +/- standard deviation of 2.3 +/- 2.8 years. The diagnoses included 10 of acute otitis media, 2 of purulent rhinitis, 4 of acute enterocolitis, and 13 of urinary tract infection. Most children received 6-12 mg/kg/day of cefixime granules, orally twice daily for more than five days. All 10 cases (100%) of acute otitis media and 2 cases of purulent rhinitis were either cured, or improved by oral cefixime treatment. None of them was microbiologically evaluable. Four cases (100%) of acute enterocolitis, 3 due to Salmonella group B, one due to Shigella flexneri, were also successfully treated with bacteria eradication. However, the cure rate of 13 cases of urinary tract infection was only 85% (11/13). Seven Escherichia coli and 4 Proteus mirabilis infections were eradicated, whereas one each of Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae infections did not respond to treatment; these two cases had a complicated course. The overall cure and improvement rate was 93%. Although five patients had transient episodes of mild diarrhea, no significant adverse reaction was observed. In summary, oral cefixime given twice daily was effective and safe in the treatment of a variety of common infectious diseases in pediatric patients.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the gene for indolepyruvate decarboxylase from Enterobacter  cloacae.
AB  - Although indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is a well-known plant hormone, the main IAA biosynthetic pathway from L-tryptophan (Trp) via indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) has yet to be elucidated. Previous studies have suggested that IAA is produced by Enterobacter cloacae isolated from the rhizosphere of cucumbers and its biosynthetic pathway may possibly be the same as that in plants. To elucidate this pathway, the IAA biosynthetic gene was isolated from a genomic library of E. cloacae by assaying for the ability to convert Trp to IAA. DNA sequence analysis showed that this gene codes for only one enzyme and its predicted protein sequence has extensive homology with pyruvate decarboxylase in yeast and Zymomonas mobilis. Cell-free extracts prepared from Escherichia coli harboring this gene could convert IPyA to indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAAld). These results clearly show that this pathway is mediated only by indolepyruvate decarboxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of IPyA to IAAld.
TI  - Concomitant dissemination of three extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among different Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a French hospital.
AB  - From January 1988 to August 1989, 267 non-repetitive strains of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBla) derived from TEM (CTX-1/TEM-3, CAZ-6) or SHV (CAZ-5) were isolated from 219 colonized or infected patients. ESBlas were characterized by analytical isoelectric focusing. Biotypes, resistance phenotypes and plasmid patterns were determined in order to differentiate the isolates in each species. Among the 116 CTX-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae, 48 strains were differentiated: 27 from 74 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, seven from 22 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates, and 14 from a combined total of seven K. oxytoca, five Serratia marcescens, six Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter cloacae and 1 Citrobacter freundii. CAZ-5 has been isolated since January 1988 in 16 different strains among 101 K. pneumoniae isolates. CAZ-6 was first identified in K. pneumoniae (January 1988). Among the 48 Enterobacteriaceae producing CAZ-6, 12 strains were differentiated: four from 39 E. aerogenes isolates, three from four K. pneumoniae, and five from a combined total of two S. marcescens, two E. coli and one E. cloacae. During this outbreak, CTX-1 was found to be encoded by 85 kb (Inc 7/M) or greater than or equal to 150 kb (Inc 6/C) plasmids. CAZ-6 was always encoded by an 85 kb (Inc 7/M) plasmid and CAZ-5 by a greater than 150 kb plasmid. These results show that strain epidemics and plasmid dissemination occurred mainly in K. pneumoniae and E. aerogenes for CTX-1, in E. aerogenes for CAZ-6, and in K. pneumoniae for CAZ-5. They also suggest that the bla(tem) gene (CTX-1) has spread between different plasmids present in the same ecosystem.
TI  - Detection of Escherichia coli alpha-haemolysin genes and their expression in a human faecal strain of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Faecal samples of 200 infants were investigated for haemolytic Enterobacteriaceae. Forty infants were carrying alpha-haemolysin producing Escherichia coli, two carried haemolytic strains of Morganella morganii and one infant carried a haemolytic strain of Enterobacter cloacae. The M. morganii and E. cloacae strains were found to produce alpha-haemolysin which was tested with a specific monoclonal antibody and by DNA-hybridization with an alpha-haemolysin specific gene probe. To our knowledge this is the first report of alpha-haemolysin production found in a strain of E. cloacae.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequence, and expression of the nitroreductase gene from Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - The "classical" nitroreductases of enteric bacteria are flavoproteins which catalyze the reduction of a variety of nitroaromatic compounds to metabolites which are highly toxic, mutagenic, or carcinogenic. The gene for the nitroreductase Enterobacter cloacae has now been cloned using an antibody specific to this protein. The nucleotide sequence of the structural gene and flanking regions are reported. Sequence analysis indicates that this gene belongs to a gene family of flavoproteins which have not been previously described. Analysis of the 5'-untranslated region reveals the presence of putative regulatory elements which may be involved in the modulation of the expression of this enzyme. The cloned gene was placed under the control of a T7 promoter for overexpression of the protein in Escherichia coli. The expressed recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity and exhibited physical, spectral, and catalytic properties identical to the protein isolated from E. cloacae.
TI  - In vitro activity of an oxycephem OCP 9-176 compared with its sulfur analog and other beta-lactams.
AB  - OCP 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at C-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at C-3. OCP 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog ME 1228 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens. Activity against Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii was equivalent. OCP 9-176 was twofold less active than ME-1228 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. Activity of the two agents was similar against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although OCP 9-176 inhibited E. coli containing TEM-1 and TEM-2, it was less active than ME-1228. Klebsiella organisms with SHV-1 and K-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but TEM-3-containing isolates had MICs of 16 micrograms/ml. OCP 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by TEM-1, PSE-1, K-1, and P99, and it was a poor inhibitor of P99. Replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at C-3.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of CPFX against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. The clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. Interpreting MIC level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. When activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, CPFX expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of CPFX against Bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of OFLX, and CPFX had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus to OFLX. 2. In comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, CPFX was inferior to amoxicillin (AMPC) against E. faecalis and inferior to AMPC and cefaclor (CCL) against Peptostreptococcus spp. Against all other bacterial species, however, CPFX expressed superior antibacterial potency to AMPC and CCL. 3. Scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to CPFX were observed among the S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of E. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
TI  - Altered phenotypes associated with ampD mutations in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - A study was done to determine the genetic locus responsible for altered expression of AmpC beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E and several mutants derived from E. cloacae 029. These phenotypes were defined by units of enzyme activity found in sonic extracts of cells before and after induction with cefoxitin and included (units uninduced/units induced) the wild-type (7/219), high-level constitutive (10,911/10,862), temperature-sensitive (at 30 degrees C 82/706 and at 42 degrees C 5,031/6,020), and hyperinducible (19/1,688) phenotypes. When the ampD region of each E. cloacae strain was cloned and introduced into an ampD mutant Escherichia coli strain, the altered phenotypes were found to reside within this locus. Furthermore, transformants containing wild-type ampD were poorly inducible at 42 degrees C while those with high-level constitutive or hyperinducible ampD were unaffected by temperature. Since the source of ampD was the only variable in these E. coli transformants, these results suggested that ampD encodes a protein that is involved in sensing the inducer. To test this possibility, the responses to different inducers of E. coli transformants containing various ampD regions were assessed. In the presence of wild-type ampD, transformants responded equally to cefoxitin and cefotetan, regardless of temperature. In the presence of temperature-sensitive ampD, induction by cefotetan was similar to that by cefoxitin at 30 degrees C but greater than that by cefoxitin at 42 degrees C. These results suggest that ampD encodes a protein involved in induction of AmpC beta-lactamase in E. cloacae.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of GR69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (MIC90). It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.
TI  - Activity of human extravascular temocillin concentrations simulated in an in-vitro kinetic model against beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - An in-vitro kinetic model was used to demonstrate the bactericidal activity of concentrations of temocillin achieved in extravascular body fluids following a 1 g intravenous dosage in man. Concentrations of temocillin attainable in peripheral lymph were bactericidal for ampicillin-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca. Likewise, concentrations of temocillin achieved in human blister fluid following a 12-hourly dosage regimen were bactericidal for cultures of Ent. cloacae and K. oxytoca which were resistant, respectively, to simulated blister fluid concentrations of cefotaxime and aztreonam. The bactericidal activity of extravascular concentrations of temocillin against these multiresistant, Gram-negative bacteria was a reflection of the beta-lactamase-stability and good pharmacokinetic properties of temocillin.
TI  - Mobilization of the genetically engineered plasmid pHSV106 from Escherichia coli  HB101(pHSV106) to Enterobacter cloacae in drinking water.
AB  - We have used triparental matings to demonstrate transfer (mobilization) of the nonconjugative genetically engineered plasmid pHSV106, which contains the thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus cloned into pBR322, from Escherichia coli HB101 to an environmental isolate of Enterobacter cloacae in sterile drinking water. This is the first demonstration of a two-step mobilization of a genetically engineered plasmid in any type of fresh water, including drinking water. Transfer was mediated by R plasmid R100-1 of E. coli ED2149(R100-1). Matings in drinking water at 15, 25, and 35 degrees C yielded recombinants, the number of which increased with increasing temperature. Numbers of recombinants obtained were 2 orders of magnitude lower than those obtained from matings in Trypticase soy broth. High concentrations of parental organisms (2.6 x 10(8) to 2.0 x 10(9) CFU/ml) were required. During 1 week of incubation in drinking water, number of parental organisms and recombinants resulting from mobilization remained constant in the absence of indigenous organisms and declined in their presence. Using oligonucleotide probes for the cloned foreign DNA (thymidine kinase gene) and plasmid vector DNA (ampicillin resistance gene), we demonstrated that both genes were transferred to E. cloacae in the mobilization process. In one recombinant selected for detailed study, the plasmids containing these genes differed in size from all forms of pHSV106 present in E. coli HB101(pHSV106), indicating that DNA rearrangement had occurred. This recombinant maintained its plasmids in unchanged form for 15 days in drinking water. A second rearrangement occurred during serial passage of this recombinant on selective media.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
AB  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were compared for efficacy in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). Patients with nosocomial pneumonia were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin (as the lactate salt) 300 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime (with sodium carbonate) 2 g i.v. every eight hours. Patients with UTI were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime 1 g i.v. every eight hours. Sputum and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after therapy. For patients with pneumonia, the organisms most frequently isolated before treatment began were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Of the 17 pneumonia patients who completed ciprofloxacin treatment, 15 (88%) had resolution of signs and symptoms or improvement. Of the 15 ceftazidime-treated pneumonia patients, 13 (87%) had resolution or improvement. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Acinetobacter species, and K. pneumoniae infections persisted for the ciprofloxacin treatment failures. Infections by Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter species persisted for the ceftazidime treatment failures. For UTI patients, E. coli was the organism most frequently isolated before treatment. All 14 UTI patients who completed treatment showed resolution or improvement. In the ciprofloxacin group two patients were superinfected by Enterococcus species, and in the ceftazidime group there were two superinfections by Enterococcus species and one by Enterobacter cloacae. Intravenous ciprofloxacin was as effective as ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Caution should be exercised when treating serious infections by streptococci or staphylococci.
TI  - Production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody specific for enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli of serotypes O157:H7 and O26:H11.
AB  - A monoclonal antibody (MAb 4E8C12) specific for Escherichia coli O157:H7 and O26:H11 was produced by immunizing BALB/c mice with a rough strain of E. coli O157:H7. The antibody reacted strongly by a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with each of 36 strains of E. coli O157:H7. No cross-reactivity was observed with strains of Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella dysenteriae, Proteus spp., Escherichia hermanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, and all except five strains of E. coli other than serotype O157:H7 (including strains of serotype O157 but not H7). The E. coli strains (all of serotype O26:H11) that reacted with the antibody were enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) that were isolated from patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome or hemorrhagic colitis and produced verotoxin similar to that of E. coli O157:H7. MAb 4E8C12 belongs to the subclass immunoglobulin G2a and has a kappa light chain. Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins of E. coli of different serotypes followed by Western immunoblot analysis revealed that MAb 4E8C12 reacted specifically with two proteins of EHEC strains of serotypes O157:H7 and O26:H11 with apparent molecular weights of 5,000 to 6,000. These proteins appeared to be markers specific for EHEC strains of serotypes O157:H7 and O26:H11. This MAb, because of its specificity, may be a useful reagent of an immunoassay for the rapid detection of these types of EHEC isolates in clinical and food specimens.
TI  - Molecular characterization of an Enterobacter cloacae outer membrane protein (OmpX).
AB  - A chromosomal gene of Enterobacter cloacae encoding an outer membrane protein (OmpX) has been cloned. Overproduction of the OmpX protein decreased the quantity of porins in the outer membrane of the parental strain and of Escherichia coli HB101. The ompX gene was located by insertions of the gamma delta sequence into the recombinant plasmid. The polarity of the gene was determined by in vitro transcription and translation of the gamma delta-containing plasmids. The nucleotide sequence of the ompX gene was elucidated by using both inverted terminal repeats of the gamma delta sequence as starting points for M13 dideoxy sequencing. The gene was found to encode a precursor of the OmpX protein consisting of 172 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 18.6 kDa. The protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence of 23 amino acid residues. The exact cleavage point was established by sequencing the N-terminal part of the mature protein. The OmpX protein has several characteristics in common with outer membrane proteins of gram-negative bacteria. The protein is rather hydrophilic and is devoid of long hydrophobic stretches. On the basis of these results, we present a model for the OmpX protein folding in an outer membrane.
TI  - Fleroxacin combined with rifampin.
AB  - We determined the effect of the combination of rifampin and fleroxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and streptococcal species. None of the 65 isolates tested by checkerboard assay demonstrated synergy, 12% of isolates showed an additive effect; 86.7% were indifferent, and only 1 isolate showed antagonism. The mean FIC was 1.2. When using 2 and 8 micrograms/ml of rifampin, fleroxacin MICs of 285 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, staphylococci, streptococci, Bacteroides, and Clostridium were not increased, but synergy was not demonstrated. Time-kill studies against Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis failed to show increased killing when the two agents were present at one-half the MBC. The fleroxacin-rifampin interaction is one of indifference but provides coverage for species not adequately inhibited by fleroxacin.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of carbamate-linked dual-action antibacterial Ro 24-4383.
AB  - Ro 24-4383 contains desacetylcefotaxime linked by a carbamate bond at the 3' position to ciprofloxacin. Ro 24-4383 was active against 99% of the 363 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes tested in vitro, while the comparative agents cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin were active against 77 and 97%, respectively. The activities (ED50: mg/kg s.c.) of Ro 24-4383, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin in systemic murine infections were: Escherichia coli 257, 1.4, less than 0.5, less than 0.2; Klebsiella pneumoniae A, 11, 30, 0.7; Enterobacter cloacae 5699, 3.2, 35, less than 0.2; Citrobacter freundii BS16, 3, 41, less than 0.5; Serratia marcescens SM, 35, greater than 100, 1.6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5712, 67, 100, 10; P. aeruginosa 8780, 33, 193, 3; Staphylococcus aureus Smith (oxacillin-susceptible), 12, 3.7, 1; S. aureus 753 (oxacillin-resistant), 28, greater than 100, 2; Streptococcus pneumoniae 6301, 10, 15, greater than 50, and S. pyogenes 4, 3.3, 1.6, 54. Ro 24-4383, although inactive against the S.-pneumoniae-induced pneumonia following one administration of the agent, was highly active (ED50 = 1.5) when three treatments were given following infection. Ro 24-4383 was active against the K.-pneumoniae-induced pneumonia (ED50 = 37), as well as the meningitis induced by S. pneumoniae (ED50 = 158) or K. pneumoniae (ED50 = 100). The protective effect of Ro 24-4383 was demonstrated when administered 8 h before infection with E. coli (ED50 = 37) and 4 h before infection with S. pyogenes (ED50 = 199).
TI  - Induction of immunity by latex beads and by hemolymph transfer in Galleria mellonella.
AB  - Injection of sterile latex beads into the hemocoel of last instar larvae of Galleria mellonella provoked a strong defense reaction. Cellular defense by hemocytes was followed by enhanced antibacterial activity in hemolymph. Latex-injected insects showed increased survival rates after a challenge injection with high doses of bacteria. Factors which stimulate the production of antibacterial activity could be demonstrated soon after injection by transfer of hemolymph from preinjected to untreated larvae. A large induction capacity in donor hemolymph was accompanied by a strong decrease in the total hemocyte count of free floating hemocytes, resulting from a decrease in number of plasmatocytes and granular cells, the cell types involved in the cellular defense against the injected latex beads. The results presented support the hypothesis that during cellular defense reactions, factors are released from the hemocytes which stimulate the production of antibacterial substances.
TI  - Biological characterization of an Enterobacter cloacae outer membrane protein (OmpX).
AB  - We have described a gene coding for an Enterobacter cloacae protein, provisionally called OmpX (J. Stoorvogel, M. J. A. W. M. van Bussel, J. Tommassen, and J. A. M. van de Klundert, J. Bacteriol. 173:156-160, 1991). In the work reported here, OmpX was localized in the cell envelope by means of sucrose gradient fractionation of membrane vesicles. Overproduction of OmpX in Escherichia coli from a multicopy plasmid resulted in a reduction in the amount of OmpF. No accumulation of OmpF, of its uncleft precursor, or of its degradation products could be detected in various cell fractions by Western immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibodies produced in response to OmpF. A decrease in the rate of synthesis of ompF mRNA was indicated by a beta-galactosidase assay in an ompF-lacZ fusion strain containing the cloned ompX gene and by Northern (RNA) blot analysis. These results indicate that the inhibition is at the level of transcription. Colony hybridization, using an internal ompX fragment as a probe, showed a widespread distribution of the ompX gene among clinical isolates of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. To study the function of the OmpX protein and its role in the regulation of porin protein synthesis, the ompX gene was deleted from the Enterobacter cloacae chromosome and replaced by the aphA gene. The absence of the ompX gene had no apparent effect on cell growth or on the regulation of the porin proteins.
TI  - In vitro activity and stability against novel beta-lactamases of investigational  beta-lactams (cefepime, cefpirome, flomoxef, SCE2787 and piperacillin plus tazobactam) in comparison with established compounds (cefotaxime, latamoxef and piperacillin).
AB  - The therapeutic perspectives of flomoxef, SCE 2787, cefpirome, cefepime, latamoxef, cefotaxime and of piperacillin plus tazobactam were comparatively evaluated by their in vitro activity against 1119 clinical isolates of 83 bacterial species. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus spp. and Shigella spp. were about equally susceptible to the cephalosporins (MIC90: 0.06 to 0.5 mg/l), while the MIC90 for piperacillin plus tazobactam was between 2 and 16 mg/l. Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Serratia spp. were most susceptible to SCE 2787, cefpirome and cefepime (MIC90: 0.06 to 2 mg/l) followed by latamoxef, cefotaxime, flomoxef and piperacillin plus tazobactam. For Citrobacter spp., Providencia spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica MIC90 were between 0.06 and 0.5 mg/l. Flomoxef was between 2 to 4 log2 less active against these species but more active than piperacillin plus tazobactam (MIC90: 2 and 8 mg/l). Morganella morganii and Hafnia alvei were most susceptible to cefepime, cefpirome and latamoxef (MIC90: 0.13 to 0.5 mg/l) while cefotaxime (MIC90: 8 mg/l) and piperacillin plus tazobactam (MIC90: 8 and greater than 64 mg/l) were the least active compounds. SCE 2787, cefepime and cefpirome were the most potent beta-lactams against the majority of the 13 species of non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) investigated (MIC90: 0.5 to 16 mg/l). The oxacephems were the least active compounds against NFB. Cefepime was the most active of the compounds included against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90: 16 mg/l). Haemophilus spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Bordetella pertussis were most susceptible to cefotaxime (MIC90: 0.03 to 0.06 mg/l). Latamoxef had the lowest activity of all compounds against gram-positive cocci. Flomoxef was the most active compound against penicillinase producing Staphylococcus aureus and about equally active as the other betalactams against methicillin susceptible staphylococci of other staphylococcal species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - In vitro effect of chlorhexidine and amikacin on oral gram-negative bacilli from  bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  - Prophylactic use of chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthrinses has been shown to benefit the oral health status of bone marrow transplant recipients and other immunosuppressed persons and to reduce systemic complications of oral origin. However, a problem that often emerges with these patients is oropharyngeal and lower respiratory tract colonization by opportunistic aerobic or facultative gram-negative bacilli (GNB). Trends in four studies indicated that CHX rinses may predispose these persons to oral colonization by GNB such as the enterobacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. Since GNB are generally susceptible to broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotics such as amikacin, the in vitro sensitivities of K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli ATCC reference strains and K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae oral clinical isolates to combinations of CHX and amikacin were determined by means of a disk diffusion sensitivity assay on Mueller-Hinton agar. The amikacin minimum inhibitory concentrations for all GNB tested were much lower (less than or equal to 4.69 to less than or equal to 9.37 micrograms/ml) than those for CHX (less than or equal to 18.75 to less than or equal to 300 micrograms/ml), and combinations of CHX and amikacin gave larger growth inhibition zones than CHX alone. No antibacterial antagonism between CHX and amikacin was found, and their solubilities were compatible. Therefore use of topical amikacin in conjunction with CHX rinses may reduce oral colonization by GNB in severely immunocompromised patient populations.
TI  - A randomized prospective study of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with or without teicoplanin as an empiric antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients.
AB  - Febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a Hickman line-associated infection. At 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. Patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol violation or death due to other causes. A total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. Teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. The diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (34), Hodgkin's disease (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). Forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). Blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. Organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), Escherichia coli (13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), Klebsiella sp. (3), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Streptococcus faecalis (2), Ent. adenocarboxylata (1), Clostridium septicum (1). Strept. B (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and P. fluorescens (1), In-vitro testing showed that all Gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and Gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. There were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), Strep. sangius (1), Strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and P. maltophilia (1). Both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. There is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. In view of the very high incidence of Gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in all febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - Combination of ofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - We evaluated the combination of ofloxacin with piperacillin, gentamicin, vancomycin, rifampin, clindamycin, and metronidazole by the checkerboard agar dilution method against 165 isolates which included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Citrobacter perfringens. Synergy of piperacillin-ofloxacin was demonstrated for 50% and 40% respectively of E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa. Some ofloxacin and piperacillin-resistant isolates were susceptible with the combination. Ofloxacin-gentamicin was indifferent for aerobic gram-negative species. Ofloxacin and vancomycin or gentamicin was indifferent for S. aureus and E. faecalis, but rifampin-ofloxacin showed addition. Combination of ofloxacin and metronidazole or clindamycin or erythromycin was indifferent for aerobic and anaerobic species. Ofloxacin could be combined with piperacillin with benefit against P. aeruginosa, but combination with aminoglycosides is not of benefit.
TI  - [Survey on clinical isolates from 13 hospitals in Akita Prefecture--changes in frequency and susceptibility of isolates by scale of hospital. Survey Group for Clinical Isolates, Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture].
AB  - Isolates from various clinical materials in 13 hospitals in Akita prefecture and  their drug susceptibility were investigated by the Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture during the period from Dec., 1987 to Feb., 1988. The results were as follows: 1. The total number of isolates was 8,387, including Staphylococcus aureus (18.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%) and Enterococcus faecalis (6.6%). S, aureus and P. aeruginosa were detected more frequently in the larger hospitals. 2. The detection frequency of S. aureus from the sputum, throat swab and pus exudate was also very high. There was a diversity in isolates from the urine and the frequency of Escherichia coli was low. More than half of the isolates from the blood were S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Many kinds of bacteria were detected from pleural fluid and ascites, but the isolate showed no particular tendency. 3. The susceptibility of S. aureus to oxacillin were variable in hospitals, and the susceptibility to cefazolin were even lower. Low susceptibility were also seen with norfloxacin. S. aureus showed the highest susceptibility to minocycline. The susceptibility was lower for inpatients than for outpatients. P. aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to cefsulodin. The number of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae isolates tended to decrease. Enterobacter cloacae showed a low susceptibility for cephems. Serratia marcescens showed low susceptibility to many drugs. Based on the above results, we concluded that attention should be paid to S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter in clinical practice.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - [Clinical study of S 6472 in urinary tract infection].
AB  - Clinical studies on S 6472, a longer lasting preparation of cefaclor (CCL), were  performed and the following results were obtained. S 6472 was administered orally to 102 patients with urinary tract infections including 16 with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis, 32 with acute uncomplicated cystitis, 31 with complicated pyelonephritis and 23 with complicated cystitis. 95 patients were treated with 375 mg of S 6472 2 times daily and 7 patients were treated with 750 mg of S 6472 2 times daily. The overall clinical efficacy was evaluated on the basis of the criteria proposed by the Japanese UTI Committee. 1. Clinical efficacies in 11 cases of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis were excellent in 10 and moderate in 1, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. Bacteriologically, all 12 strains identified in the acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis cases were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 100%. 2. Clinical efficacies in 21 cases of acute uncomplicated cystitis were excellent in 17, moderate in 3 and poor in 1, with an overall efficacy rate of 95%. As to bacteriological responses, 22 strains identified in the acute uncomplicated cystitis cases (except 1 of Escherichia coli) were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 95%. 3. Clinical responses in 43 cases of complicated urinary tract infections were excellent in 20, moderate in 15 and poor in 8, with an overall efficacy rate of 81%. Bacteriologically, 39 strains, including only one strain of P. aeruginosa, in the complicated urinary tract infection cases (except 4 of E. coli, 1 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 of Enterococcus faecalis and 2 of Enterobacter cloacae) were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 83%. As side effects, slight stomatitis and gastric discomfort were noted in 1 patient each but we were able to continue the medication. Abnormal laboratory test values found were: 1 case of a slight and transient increase of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and 1 case of a slight and transient increase of serum creatinine level.
TI  - Intravenous ofloxacin in severe infections.
AB  - The efficacy and tolerance of intravenous ofloxacin was studied in 70 patients suffering from soft tissue infections (n = 33), intra-abdominal abscesses (n = 14), septicaemia (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 9) and brucellosis (n = 2). The average daily dose was 6 mg/kg divided into two doses. Pathogens treated included Enterobacter cloacae (n = 14), Escherichia coli (n = 12), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 8) and Streptococcus spp. (n = 5). Most patients had several underlying diseases. Most of the patients had received other antibiotic therapy without success. Clinically, 41% were considered cured, 19% improved and 30% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 52.5% and persisted in 22.5%. Adverse reactions included an anaphylactoid reaction, abnormal liver function (n = 13) and insomnia (n = 2). This study suggests that higher doses of ofloxacin may be needed in deep seated infections.
TI  - Cefotaxime and aminoglycoside treatment of meningitis caused by gram-negative enteric organisms.
AB  - We reviewed cases of Gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis in infants and children treated with cefotaxime at Texas Children's Hospital from January, 1984, through June, 1989. Seventeen of 20 children had an underlying condition predisposing to the development of meningitis. The etiologic organisms in these 20 children (2 days to 12 years old; median, 12 days old) were Klebsiella sp, 9; Escherichia coli, 4; Enterobacter cloacae, 3; Citrobacter diversus, 2; other, 2. With the exception of one isolate of Acinetobacter, all isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime. In addition to cefotaxime 17 children received an aminoglycoside intravenously. Children with meningitis caused by Klebsiella sp. or non-Klebsiella organisms received cefotaxime for 31 +/- 14 and 37 +/- 17 days, respectively. Aminoglycosides were administered for 16 +/- 10 days in both groups. Five children in each group also received intraventricular doses (1 to 25) of an aminoglycoside (9) or colistimethate (1). The mean durations of positive lumbar, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid or brain abscess cultures were 5.8 +/- 4.7 and 7.2 +/- 5.0 days after start of therapy in the Klebsiella and non-Klebsiella meningitis patients, respectively. Only three children were normal at the time of discharge or follow-up. Gram-negative enteric meningitis remains difficult to treat despite the excellent in vitro activity of cefotaxime against Gram-negative enterics, in part as a result of the predisposing conditions resulting in the development of this infection.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  - For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC50s and MIC90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: Escherichia coli 0.12 and 0.5, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, Proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. Klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. Enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, Citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, Serratia marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive Proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and Providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. The activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as N. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC50s and MIC90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC50 and MIC90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were generally resistant: Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (MIC50 and MIC90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium perfringens (MIC50 and MIC90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for Bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). These results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
TI  - Novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase (MIR-1) conferring resistance to oxyimino-  and alpha-methoxy beta-lactams in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from 11 patients at the Miriam Hospital were identified as resistant to cefoxitin and ceftibuten as well as to aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime. Resistance could be transferred by conjugation or transformation with plasmid DNA into Escherichia coli and was due to the production of a beta-lactamase with an isoelectric point of 8.4 named MIR-1. In E. coli, MIR-1 conferred resistance to aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftibuten, ceftriaxone, and such alpha-methoxy beta-lactams as cefmetazole, cefotetan, cefoxitin, and moxalactam. In vitro, MIR-1 hydrolyzed cephalothin and cephaloridine much more rapidly than it did penicillin G, ampicillin, or carbenicillin. Cefotaxime was hydrolyzed at 10% the rate of cephaloridine. Cefoxitin inactivation could only be detected by a microbiological test. The inhibition profile of MIR-1 was similar to that of chromosomally mediated class I beta-lactamases. Potassium clavulanate had little effect on cefoxitin or cefibuten resistance and was a poor inhibitor of MIR-1 activity. Cefoxitin or imipenem did not induce MIR-1. The gene determining MIR-1 was cloned on a 1.4-kb AccI-PstI fragment. Under stringent conditions, probes for TEM-1 and SHV-1 genes and the E. coli ampC gene failed to hybridize with the MIR-1 gene. However, a provisional sequence of 150 bp of the MIR-1 gene proved to be 90% identical to the sequence of ampC from Enterobacter cloacae but only 71% identical to that of E. coli, thus explaining the lack of hybridization to the E. coli ampC probe. Plasmid profiles of the 11 K. pneumoniae clinical isolates were not identical, but each contained a plasmid from 40 to 60 kb that hybridized with the cloned MIR-1 gene. Both transfer-proficient and transfer-deficient MIR-1 plasmids belonged to the N incompatibility group. Thus, the resistance of these K. pneumoniae strains was the result of plasmid acquisition of a class I beta-lactamase, a new resistance determinant that expands the kinds of beta-lactam resistance capable of spread by plasmid dissemination among clinical isolates.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Use of UV radiation for the disinfection of water. V. Microbiological studies of the behavior of bacterial cells from the logarithmic and from the stationary phase in cold and warm drinking water].
AB  - The u.v.-susceptibility of E. cloacae, E. coli and E. faecium was tested with a flow-through u.v. light treatment apparatus. Drinking water of three ranges of temperature (ca. 13 degrees C, ca. 33 degrees C, and ca. 48 degrees C) was used. The u.v.-susceptibility was tested with bacteria harvested in the exponential phase of growth as well as with bacteria harvested in the stationary phase. In all ranges of temperature and both phases of growth reductions of at least 99.9999% of E. cloacae and E. coli were obtained by a dosage of less than or equal to 25 mWs/cm2. For E. faecium harvested in the exponential phase of growth this could be confirmed in cold water of 13 degrees C, while in warm water of 48 degrees C a dosage of ca. 47 mWs/cm2 for a reduction of 99.9999% was necessary. To kill E. faecium-cells, which were harvested in the stationary phase, dosage between 39 and 45 mWs/cm2 were necessary in water of the three ranges of temperature.
TI  - [Fournier's gangrene: report of 3 cases].
AB  - Fournier's gangrene is defined classically as a fulminant, rapidly spreading infection of the scrotum that also involves the perineum, penis and abdominal wall. The pathologic findings are described as synergistic gangrene secondary to a polymicrobial flora with a poorly defined portal of entry. We report 3 cases of Fournier's gangrene. Case 1 was a 67 years old who was admitted with the chief complaint of scrotal swelling and necrosis. Case 2 was a 59 years old who was admitted with the problem of scrotal swelling and pain, he had sought other medical help without success, and was then transferred to our hospital. Case 3 was a 62 years old who was admitted with the chief complaint of scrotal swelling and pain for 2 days. These 3 patients were all found to have diabetes mellitus. All 3 patients required aggressive surgical debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics and adjunctive measures. Blood cultures were usually negative and pus cultures were typically aerobic gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria of various types, especially Bacteroids fragilis. Our pus cultures revealed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in Case 1, Enterobacter cloacae in Case 2 and E. coli, B. fragilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Case 3. This disease is no longer a disease of young men. After 1945, the average age in 119 reported cases was 51.3 years and the average age of our cases was 62.7 years. Before the era of antibiotics, scrotal gangrene was not a rarity. In these modern times, in spite of seeking medical attention early, patients still developed scrotal gangrene and the mortality rate is high.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antibacterial activity in the hemolymph of myriapods (Arthropoda).
AB  - The hemolymphs of two diplopod (Chicobolus sp. and Rhapidostreptus virgator) and  two chilopod species (Lithobius forficatus and Scolopendra cingulata) were tested for the presence of antibacterial substances using Petri dish tests. The native hemolymph of all species had substances acting on living Micrococcus luteus, whereas only Rhapidostreptus, Scolopendra, and Lithobius were effective against lyophilized Micrococcus. The antibacterial activity against living Micrococcus increased after inoculation with bacteria (Enterobacter cloacae beta-12) in Chicobolus and Rhapidostreptus and also against lyophilized Micrococcus in the latter. Thus, these effects appear to be inducible. None of the myriapods tested had any bacteriostatic effect on Escherichia coli D-31 whereas the growth of gram-negative E. cloacae was inhibited. The antibacterial substances in the diplopod species were unstable when heated but were resistant to freezing. At least two antibacterial substances (a lysozyme-like one and another substance) are considered to occur in Myriapoda.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (IV). Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - We determined the MICs of ampicillin, methicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against a total of 1,448 strains from 11 species: 464 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 306 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 114 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 37 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 329 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 66 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 26 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 20 strains of Serratia marcescens, 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 42 strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, isolated from the throat swab and the sputum of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections who visited 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against S. aureus, B. catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa and A. calcoaceticus than other antibiotics. Ampicillin and cefteram were more active against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes than other antibiotics. New-quinolones and cephems of new-generation were active against H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and S. marcescens. Of 30 strains of S. aureus which were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin, only one strain was resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to methicillin. Twenty strains (6.5%) of S. pneumoniae and 49 strains (14.9%) of H. influenzae were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin. Of 101 strains of H. influenzae of which their beta-lactamase activity was determined by Nitrocephin-method, 27 (26.7%) were beta-lactamase-positive strains. The above results indicated that MRSA is only rarely found in primary care clinics but the incidence of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae in primary care clinics is almost the same as that of the intensive care clinic, i.e. medical school-affiliated hospitals. Therefore caution should be exercised as regards antibiotic resistance of the causative organism even in primary care clinics.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of DQ-2556 and its stability to various beta-lactamases.
AB  - DQ-2556, a new cephalosporin, showed a broad antibacterial spectrum over Gram-positive and -negative organisms. The activity of DQ-2556 against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci and Enterobacteriaceae was comparable with that of cefpirome, and superior to that of ceftazidime. DQ-2556 was almost as active as cefpirome against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was less active than ceftazidime. With the exception of Ps. aeruginosa, DQ-2556 was bactericidal against various organisms at either the MIC or twice the MIC. DQ-2556 bound preferentially to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 2, 1 and 3 of Staphylococcus aureus, PBPs 3, 1A and 1B of Escherichia coli and PBPs 1A, 3 and 4 of Ps. aeruginosa. DQ-2556 was stable to various penicillinases and cephalosporinases, but was unstable to oxyiminocephalosporinases. The Km values of DQ-2556 for the cephalosporinases of Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were only two- or three-fold higher than those of ceftazidime, indicating that DQ-2556 had a relatively high affinity for these enzymes compared with other recently developed cephalosporins. The MIC of DQ-2556 for Esch. coli increased four-fold in an OmpF-deficient mutant, indicating that the OmpF porin was one of the major routes for penetration of DQ-2556 into Esch. coli cells.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a beta-lactamase-inhibitory protein from Streptomyces clavuligerus and cloning and analysis of the corresponding gene.
AB  - Culture filtrates of Streptomyces clavuligerus contain a proteinaceous beta-lactamase inhibitor (BLIP) in addition to a variety of beta-lactam compounds. BLIP was first detected by its ability to inhibit Bactopenase, a penicillinase derived from Bacillus cereus, but it has also been shown to inhibit the plasmid pUC- and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases of Escherichia coli. BLIP showed no inhibitory effect against Enterobacter cloacae beta-lactamase, and it also showed no activity against an alternative source of B. cereus penicillinase. BLIP was purified to homogeneity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave a size estimate for BLIP of 16,900 to 18,000. The interaction between purified BLIP and the E. coli(pUC) beta-lactamase was investigated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determined to be noncovalent, with an estimated 1:1 molar stoichiometry. The BLIP gene was isolated on a 13.5-kilobase fragment of S. clavuligerus chromosomal DNA which did not overlap a 40-kilobase region of DNA known to contain genes for beta-lactam antibiotic biosynthesis. The gene encoded a mature protein with a deduced amino acid sequence of 165 residues (calculated molecular weight of 17,523) and also encoded a 36-amino-acid signal sequence. No significant sequence similarity to BLIP was found by pairwise comparisons using various protein and nucleotide sequence data banks or by hybridization experiments, and no BLIP activity was detected in the culture supernatants of other Streptomyces spp.
TI  - [Identification and classification of 204 strains of gram negative organisms isolated from poultry eggs].
AB  - Results of identification and classification of 204 strains of Gram negative bacteria isolated from poultry eggs are reported. Among 106 strains of glucose nonfermenting bacteria 105 (99%) strains could be further identified as: pseudomonas (87 strains), including P. fluorescens (63), P. putida (9), P. maltophilia (12), P. putrefaciens (2), and P. stutzeri (1); 2 strains of Alcaligenes, both identified as A. denitrificans; 7 strains of Flavobacterium, including F. multovorum (3) and Flavobacterium sp. (4); and 9 strains of Acinetobacter, including A. lwoffi (7) and A. anitratus (2). Among 98 strains of fermentors, 73 strains (74.5%) could be identified as; Escherichia (9), E. coli (12), Enterobacter Liquefaciens (31), Ent. cloacae (7), Ent. halfnia (8), Ent. aerogenes (1) and proteus (5); while 25 strains (25.5%) which split glucose and lactose or sucrose fermentative with acid but no gaseouse formation remain to be ascertained.
TI  - [Piperacillin-amikacin combinations: killing curves].
AB  - Bactericidal activity as a function of time of piperacillin (PIP) and amikacin (AKN) alone and in combination was evaluated by killing curves technique on 23 clinical isolates: E. coli (6), K. pneumoniae (5), E. cloacae (6) and P. aeruginosa (6), for which the minimal inhibitory concentrations ranges of piperacillin were 0.25 to 64 mg/l and of amikacin 1 to 8 mg/l. For each species, the strains were chosen according to the most frequent phenotypes: beta-lactams susceptible, penicillinase (Pase), cephalosporinase (Case) and Pase + Case producers. Killing curves were carried out with the following concentrations (mg/l): piperacillin (2, 16, 64); amikacin (4, 8, 16); piperacillin (2) + amikacin (4); piperacillin (16) + amikacin (8); piperacillin (64) + amikacin (16). Antibiotic concentrations corresponded to pharmacokinetics and/or to critical values of piperacillin and amikacin. Bactericidal activity was defined as a 4 log 10 decrease in CFU/ml between 2 and 24 hours. When piperacillin (64) was combined with amikacin (16), the bactericidal effects were nearly the same as those with amikacin alone. But piperacillin (16) + amikacin (8) combination had bactericidal effect for the majority of strains (21/23) and it prevented for some of them the bacterial regrowth observed with amikacin alone at the same concentration. A bactericidal activity without regrowth (until the 24th hour) was obtained for 9 strains; 2 susceptible E. coli, 3 K. pneumoniae (chromosomal Pase producer) and 4 cefotaxime susceptible E. cloacae, with low dose combination piperacillin (2) + amikacin (4). Finally, only combinations piperacillin (64) + amikacin (16) or piperacillin (16) + amikacin (8) had bactericidal activity on 2 Ticarcillin-resistant P. aeruginosa, the two antibiotics being separatedly bacteriostatic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A prospective study of long-term use of amikacin in a paediatrics department. Indications, administration, side-effects, bacterial isolates and resistance.
AB  - Amikacin (Amikin; B-M) was used as the only aminoglycoside for 18 months in a paediatric department within a general hospital because of high levels of resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae isolates to tobramycin, gentamicin and netilmicin. Between 1 February 1987 and 31 July 1988, 816 children were treated with a slow intravenous injection at a standardised dose adjusted for weight and age. Respiratory disease was present in 35.8% of 537 neonates, 56.4% of 190 infants and 70.9% of 89 older children. Escherichia coli (65 isolates), Klebsiella species (59 isolates), Enterobacter species (26 isolates) and P. aeruginosa (22 isolates) constituted the most common Gram-negative pathogens. The positive blood culture yield was 7.8%. Satisfactory median peak and trough serum amikacin levels were achieved. No significant renal side-effects were noted. Severe bilateral hearing loss in 1 low-birthweight infant resulted from inadvertent overdosage. At the end of this 18-month surveillance period 97.7% of E. coli, 98.6% of K. pneumoniae, 96.3% of E. cloacae, and 98.0% of P. aeruginosa isolates remained sensitive to amikacin, while resistance of K. pneumoniae to tobramycin, netilmicin and gentamicin decreased significantly (P less than 0.003, P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.007 respectively; chi-square test).
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Serratia marcescens SR50 chromosomal ampC beta-lactamase gene.
AB  - The Serratia marcescens SR50 chromosomal beta-lactamase gene (ampC) was cloned and sequenced. It contains 1128 nucleotides encoding a protein of 355 amino acids preceded by 21 amino acids which probably constitutes the signal peptide. The mature protein has a predicted molecular mass of 38,901 Da. About 40% of the amino acid sequence was identical among AmpC beta-lactamases resided in S. marcescens, Citrobacter freundii OS60, Escherichia coli K12 and Enterobacter cloacae P99. All of these enzymes are highly similar around the active site serine at the position 59 of the mature enzyme.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of six new oral cephem antibiotics.
AB  - Six newly developed oral cephem antibiotics, which included 5 with an aminothiazolyl side chain, viz., cefixime, cefotiam hexetil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefteram pivoxil, ceftibuten, and one with a conventional side chain design, BMY 28100, were tested for their antimicrobial activities. Three traditional oral beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, were used as reference antibiotics. The 5 aminothiazolyl cephems were more active than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. All 6 new drugs showed poor activity against clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci. They were better than cephalexin and cefaclor, but slightly poorer than or the same as ampicillin in activities against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cefotiam hexetil, BMY 28100, and cefpodoxime proxetil were also more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus aureus. Although the 6 tested new oral cephems demonstrated little difference in their activities against different bacteria, they all showed greater antimicrobial activity than the traditional oral antibiotics now in clinical use.
TI  - Occurrence of aminoglycoside phosphotransferase subclass I and II structural genes among Enterobacteriaceae spp. isolated from meat samples.
AB  - 3'-Aminoglycoside phosphotransferase [APH(3')] enzymes are a group responsible for resistance to the antibiotics kanamycin (Km) and neomycin (Nm) in bacteria. Escherichia coli ECT24, originally isolated from a meat sample, harboured an 83-kb conjugative R-plasmid (pRPJ24) that carries transferable resistance to Km and Nm. Plasmid pRPJ24 was transferred by conjugation to Enterobacter cloacae 94R, which was used as the source of plasmid DNA in development of a probe for the Km-resistance determinant. Random cloning of BamHI and HindIII double-digest restriction fragments of pRPJ24 in the pUC18 vector plasmid produced clones resistant to both Nm and Km carrying a 1.9-kb DNA insert. Southern hybridization of pRPJ24 cloned chimeric plasmid DNA (pKPJ94) showed homology with the APH(3')II gene from transposon Tn5. A PstI digest of pKPJ94 produced a 920-bp fragment which hybridized with the APH(3')II structural gene, and was used as a DNA probe for the APH(3')II subclass gene. A 980-bp BamHI fragment from plasmid pGH54 carrying the APH(3')I gene from transposon Tn903 was used as a subclass I probe. Total DNA from 206 randomly screened Km-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates from raw ground beef and chicken meat samples were examined for the occurrence of APH(3') subclass I and II using non-radioactively-labelled DNA probes. Thirty-six percent and 60% of the isolates examined carried subclass I and II resistances, respectively, in the isolates from chicken meat samples. The corresponding values for bacterial strains from raw ground beef samples were 51% and 72%, respectively. Four percent of the resistant bacterial isolates from chicken samples did not display homology to either probe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Direct introduction of a formamido group into the 7 alpha (6 alpha)-position of cephalosporins (penicillins).
AB  - A novel direct introduction of a formamido group into the 7 alpha (6 alpha)-position of cephalosporins (penicillins) was achieved by treatment of 7 beta (6 beta)-[(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-oxo-2,5-cyclohexadien-1- ylidene)methylimino]cephem (penam) esters with N,N-bis(trimethylsilyl)formamide, followed by deblocking with Girard reagent T to give the corresponding 7 alpha (6 alpha)-formamido-7 beta (6 beta)-amino derivatives. Three 7 alpha-formamidocephalosporins were prepared by the conventional N-acylation of 7 alpha-formamidocephem. All of them were resistant to beta-lactamases, showing similar MIC values against both of a pair of a beta-lactamase-producing strain and the corresponding non or low-producing strain of the same species of bacteria, when tested on Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii.
TI  - Molecular characterization of an Enterobacter cloacae gene (romA) which pleiotropically inhibits the expression of Escherichia coli outer membrane proteins.
AB  - The introduction of a newly cloned Enterobacter cloacae chromosomal gene romA, into Escherichia coli and E. cloacae resulted in enhancement of resistance to quinolones, beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. The primary effect of romA on a multicopy vector in E. coli was almost complete inhibition of OmpF expression in the outer membrane. From the experiments with ompR and envZ mutants or with ompF-lacZ and ompC-lacZ fusion plasmids, it was concluded that this inhibition is posttranscriptional. The introduction of romA on a multicopy vector into strains with micF deletion elicited only a moderate decrease in OmpF protein expression. This indicates that reduction of OmpF expression by romA is partly mediated posttranscriptionally by the activation of micF. Moreover, the overexpression of RomA protein from an isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter resulted in nearly complete inhibition of expression of OmpC and OmpA, as well as OmpF. Taken together with an observation in a recent study that overexpressed OmpC inhibited the synthesis of OmpA and LamB, a possible inhibitory mechanism at the translational stage of the synthesis of outer membrane proteins should also be considered. By Southern hybridization, romA was generally detected in the chromosomes of all E. cloacae strains tested but not in the E. coli K-12 chromosome. Sequence data show that there is an open reading frame specifying 368 amino acids residues including a putative signal peptide. RomA appears to belong to the outer membrane protein family since it was extractable from an outer membrane preparation, but no sequence homology to other outer membrane proteins was detected.
TI  - Mechanism of action of lomefloxacin.
AB  - The inhibition of supercoiling activity of reconstituted Escherichia coli DNA gyrase by lomefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin was determined. The concentrations of quinolones needed to inhibit DNA synthesis in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were also measured. The kinetics of uptake of [14C]lomefloxacin and unlabeled lomefloxacin into whole cells of E. coli KL-16 and S. aureus NCTC 8532 and the induction of RecA in E. coli GC2241 were assayed. All strains had wild-type susceptibilities to quinolones. The concentration of quinolones needed to inhibit DNA synthesis by 50% correlated with the MIC for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. The concentration of quinolones needed to inhibit DNA synthesis by 50% for late-logarithmic-phase S. aureus also correlated with the MIC, unlike the data from early-logarithmic-phase cultures. E. coli and S. aureus showed a similar pattern of uptake kinetics of [14C]lomefloxacin and unlabeled lomefloxacin, indicating that the difference in the susceptibilities of the two species is probably due to different target site affinities. Essentially, lomefloxacin was less active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and had activity similar to those of norfloxacin and enoxacin.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1987). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Since 1979, Ikemoto et al. have been retrospectively surveying the sensitivity of major species of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infections to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. Their findings for the past year are reported below. A total of 825 clinical strains of bacteria was investigated. Of this total, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 28.0% (231 strains) and Gram-negative bacteria for 72.0% (594 strains). Taxonomically, Escherichia coli accounted for 34.7% (286 strains), Enterococcus faecalis for 14.3% (118), Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 11.0% (91), Klebsiella pneumoniae for 7.8% (64), and coagulase-negative staphylococci for 7.3% (60). Sensitivity spectra of these major bacteria to various drugs were as follows. 1. E. faecalis was sensitive to parenteral imipenem (IPM) and ampicillin and oral vancomycin. It was also sensitive to ofloxacin (OFLX) and ciprofloxacin (CPFX), which are new quinolones. Some strains were only slightly sensitive to second and third generation cephems cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefuzonam (CZON) aminoglycosides amikacin (AMK) and arbekacin (HBK), and erythromycin which is a macrolide. 2. Staphylococcus aureus was sensitive to dicloxacillin (MDIPC) which is a penicillin drug, cefotiam (CTM) which is a cephem, IPM, minocycline (MINO), and HBK. A fairly large number of strains were only slightly sensitive to cefazolin (CEZ), OFLX and CPFX. 3. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were sensitive to MDIPC which is a penicillin derivative, cephems CTM and CZON, IPM, HBK, clindamycin (CLDM) and MINO. Some strains, however, were only slightly sensitive to a majority of these drugs. 4. E. coli was sensitive to CTM, CMX, latamoxef (LMOX), ceftazidime (CAZ), CZON, and flomoxef (FMOX), all of which are second or third generation cephems. It was also sensitive to IPM, a carbapenem, carumonam (CRMN), a monobactam, and new quinolones, OFLX and CPFX. 5. K. pneumoniae was sensitive to cephems, viz. CTM, CAZ, CZON, FMOX and cefixime, CRMN which is a monobactam, IPM, a carbapenem and new quinolones, OFLX and CPFX. Some strains were only slightly sensitive to CTM, cefmetazole cefoperazone (CPZ), and FMOX. 6. Citrobacter freundii was sensitive to CRMN which is a monobactam, and new quinolones, OFLX and CPFX. Many strains were only slightly sensitive to cephems, viz. CEZ, CTM, CPZ and CAZ. 7. Enterobacter cloacae was sensitive to gentamicin and AMK which are aminoglycosides, but showed a bimodal pattern of sensitivity to CPZ, CAZ and CZON, all of which are cephems, and to quinolones, OFLX and CPFX.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new quinolone sparfloxacin (CI-978, AT-4140) against nosocomial gram-negative bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin (CI-978, AT-4140), a new quinolone which is active against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and nine other broad-spectrum antibiotics was tested against 128 gram-negative nosocomial bloodstream isolates from separate patients. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were among the most potent antibiotics against Escherichia coli (n = 40), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 18), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 13), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 19), with MIC90 values of less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. Ciprofloxacin was slightly more potent than sparfloxacin against Serratia marcescens (n = 14), the MIC90 values being 0.25 and 1.0 micrograms/ml respectively, although all strains were susceptible to both agents. Sparfloxacin was slightly less potent than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 24), the MIC90 values being 4.0 and 0.5 micrograms/ml respectively. Overall, the in vitro activity of sparfloxacin compared favorably with that of ciprofloxacin and the other broad spectrum agents tested against nosocomial gram-negative bloodstream isolates.
TI  - Determination of optimal dosage regimen for amikacin in healthy volunteers by study of pharmacokinetics and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and serum killing curves of amikacin, which was administered by a 30-minute intravenous infusion of single doses of 7.5 mg/kg and then 15 mg/kg, were investigated in six healthy volunteers who received the two doses in a crossover study with a washout period of 20 days. The serum killing curves were determined for four bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All strains were serum resistant, and the bactericidal activity was analyzed by separating the early phase (first 5 h) and the late phase (24 h) of the killing curve. For the early phase, the bactericidal activity was evaluated by correlating an index of surviving bacteria with amikacin concentrations. This methodology allowed determination of two parameters: the maximal effective concentration and the lowest effective concentration. For the late phase, the threshold values separating bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities were lower than 10 mg/liter for each strain. The concentration dependence of amikacin bactericidal activity was confirmed for Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae and, to a lesser extent, for Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Correlation of these data with amikacin pharmacokinetic data in volunteers indicated that a daily dose of 15 mg/kg may be effective in the treatment of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae infections. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, the partially time-dependent activity probably necessitates two daily administrations and combination with another antibiotic.
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam in neonates].
AB  - Clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam (AZT) were performed in neonates. The results are summarized as follows: A total of 6 cases consisting of 5 mature and 1 low-birth-weight infants was clinically evaluated. AZT 20 mg/kg was administered 2-3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 6-21 days. Concomitantly, vancomycin (VCM) 15 mg/kg was administered to 1 case 3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 days and ampicillin (ABPC) 20-50 mg/kg to 3 cases 3 time daily via 30 minutes intravenous drip infusion for 2-6 days. Of the 6 bacterial infection cases (1 with sepsis and purulent meningitis, 2 with sepsis, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with perirectal abscess), clinical effects of AZT were evaluated in 4 cases (2 each with sepsis and urinary tract infection) as "excellent" in all the cases. All of the causative organisms (Escherichia coli in 3 and Enterobacter cloacae in 1) were eradicated by the treatment with AZT. Neither clinical side effect nor abnormal laboratory test value caused by AZT was observed. MICs of AZT against 10 clinical isolates (Staphylococcus aureus 1, E. coli 4, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1, E. cloacae 1, Haemophilus influenzae 1 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. As results, AZT showed very good antibacterial activity comparable or even superior to cefoperazone, cefotaxime, latamoxef; however, the activity against P. aeruginosa was inferior to imipenem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Membrane-associated chromate reductase activity from Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Washed cells of Enterobacter cloacae HO1 reduced hexavalent chromium (chromate: CrO4(2-) anaerobically. Chromate reductase activity was preferentially associated with the membrane fraction of the cells. Right-side-out membrane vesicles prepared from E. cloacae cells showed high chromate reductase activities when ascorbate-reduced phenazine methosulfate was added as an electron donor.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of TEM-3 (CTX-1) beta-lactamase.
AB  - A total of 33 clinical isolates encoding TEM-3 (CTX-1) from four French hospitals were studied. The strains belonged to seven species, Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 24), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Serratia marcescens (n = 2), Citrobacter freundii (n = 1), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), and Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1). All the strains harbored an Inc7 or M self-transferable plasmid with a size of approximately 85 kilobases. The plasmids had closely related EcoRI, HincII, HindIII, and PvuII restriction endonuclease-generated patterns and conferred resistance to all beta-lactams, except cephamycins and imipenem; to tetracycline, because of the presence of the genes blatem-3 and tetC, respectively, as determined by hybridization with specific probes; and to sulfonamide. Depending on the presence or absence and level of expression of the genes aacA4, aadA, and dfrI and of insertion element IS15, four types of plasmids could be distinguished. Plasmid pCFF04, the prototype plasmid encoding TEM-3, was widespread and appeared, by Southern hybridization, as the progenitor of the other types of replicons. The plasmid epidemic responsible for dissemination of TEM-3 in clinical isolates of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae may have originated in S. marcescens since pCFF04 was first detected in this species.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action cephalosporin, compared with activities of other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, which is desacetyl-cefotaxime linked to fleroxacin, was compared with the activities of cefotaxime, desacetyl-cefotaxime, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. It inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, except for some Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae strains, at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml and had an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) of 8 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most group A, B, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. Ninety percent of the staphylococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, except for some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The MIC90S of Ro 23-9424 for Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Clostridium perfringens isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, whereas Bacteroides fragilis had an MIC90 of 32 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal inoculum size effect. The MICs and MBCs were either identical or within a twofold dilution. The MICs of Ro 23-9424 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus increased 16- to 128-fold after 2 weeks of transfer in the presence of Ro 23-9424, showing that the presence of two agents does not prevent resistance.
TI  - In vitro investigation of BK-218, a new oral and parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of BK-218 was similar to that of cefamandole when it was tested against several laboratory strains. The inhibiting effect of BK-218 was greater than that of cephalexin and cefoxitin on penicillin-binding proteins of Escherichia coli HB101. This result was in close correlation with the relative inhibition of radiolabeled glucosamine incorporation (greatest with BK-218) and with the lytic effect (most intensive with BK-218). BK-218 proved to be a good inhibitor for all five of the beta-lactamases that were investigated, although two enzymes (Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cilote) hydrolyzed it to some extent.
TI  - Outer membrane permeability and beta-lactamase stability of dipolar ionic cephalosporins containing methoxyimino substituents.
AB  - Some enteric bacteria, such as Enterobacter cloacae, can develop high-level resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins by overproducing their chromosomally encoded type I beta-lactamases. This is because these agents are hydrolyzed rapidly at pharmacologically relevant, low (0.1 to 1 microM), concentrations, owing to their high affinity for type I enzymes. In contrast, the more recently developed cephalosporins, with quaternary-nitrogen-containing substituents at the 3 position, show increased efficacy against beta-lactamase-overproducing strains and, indeed, have a much lower affinity for type I enzymes. However, the possible contribution of an improved outer membrane permeability in their increased efficacy has not been studied. We found by proteoliposome swelling assays that cefepime, cefpirome, and E-1040 all penetrated the porin channels of Escherichia coli and E. cloacae much more rapidly than did ceftazidime and at least as rapidly as did cefotaxime. Considering that the influx of anionic compounds such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime will be further retarded in intact cells, owing to the Donnan potential, we expect that the newer compounds will penetrate intact cells 2 to 10 times more rapidly than will cefotaxime and ceftazidime. The kinetic parameters of hydrolysis of these agents by E. cloacae beta-lactamase showed that at 0.1 microM, they were hydrolyzed much more slowly than was cefotaxime and at about the same rate as or a lower rate than was ceftazidime. The combination of these two effects explains nearly quantitatively why these newer agents are more effective against some of the beta-lactamase-overproducing gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the Ecal DNA methyltransferase.
AB  - The gene coding for the GGTNACC specific Ecal DNA methyltransferase (M.Ecal) has  been cloned in E. coli from Enterobacter cloacae and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. The ecalM gene codes for a protein of 452 amino acids (Mr: 51,111). It was determined that M.Ecal is an adenine methyltransferase. M.Ecal shows limited amino acid sequence similarity to other adenine methyltransferases. A clone that expresses Ecal methyltransferase at high level was constructed.
TI  - Hemolysin as a marker for Serratia.
AB  - All Serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. DNA fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal DNA of S. marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. kiliensis, S. grimesii, S. proteamaculans, S. plymutica, S. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. The restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. S. ficaria and S. marinorubra expressed a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the S. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. The DNA of the latter strains did not hybridize with the S. marcescens hemolysin DNA probes. Some S. marcescens strains, S. kiliensis and S. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. No hybridization was found with DNA of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella arerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosus, Listeria sp., Aeromonas sp., Legionella sp. and a Meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin DNA probes are specific for Serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than Serratia.
TI  - Therapeutic effects of cefpirome, a new cephalosporin, on various models of infections in mice and rats.
AB  - Cefpirome (HR 810) is a new cephalosporin with a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain. It was compared with other cephem antibiotics in protective and therapeutic effects on various experimental infections, systemic and local, in mice and rats. HR 810 had more potent protective effect than ceftazidime (CAZ), cefoperazone (CPZ), and cefotaxime (CTX) on systemic infections induced by Escherichia coli Ec-31, Staphylococcus aureus SMITH, and Serratia marcescens Sm-6 in mice. Against systemic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa HR 810 was as effective as CAZ. Mice with leukopenia induced by cyclophosphamide were systemically infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Enterococcus faecalis. HR 810 was superior to cefuzonam (CZON) and cefmetazole against MRSA and MSSA and was much more active than any other antibiotics tested against E. cloacae and A. calcoaceticus. In the activity against E. faecalis, HR 810 was inferior to ampicillin but superior to CZON. In mice with pyelonephritis caused by E. coli Ec-7, the rank order of activities was HR 810 greater than CAZ greater than CTX greater than CPZ. HR 810 was more effective than latamoxef, CAZ, CTX, and CPZ in improving lung infections induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae HL 438 and Klebsiella pneumoniae Kp-51 in mice. HR 810 was superior to CTX and CPZ and comparable to cefazolin in therapeutic effects on intrauterine infections with E. coli Ec-89 and S. aureus SMITH in rats.
TI  - Multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius, and Clostridium difficile obtained from laboratories at hospitals in St. Louis, in Memphis, and in Newark, New Jersey. Of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime, 81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam, and 51% to cefoxitin.
TI  - In vitro emergence of quinolone-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens.
AB  - Norfloxacin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants of several Enterobacter cloacae  and Serratia marcescens isolates occurred at frequencies of greater than or equal to 10(-7)/CFU, which were higher than those of Escherichia coli isolates, in accordance with the increasing emergence of less-susceptible or resistant strains in clinical isolates of E. cloacae and S. marcescens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of piperacillin and tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates.
AB  - The effectiveness of a combination of the recently developed penam sulphone tazobactam with piperacillin was studied in clinical isolates with defined beta-lactamase production. The combination was highly effective against piperacillin-resistant beta-lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1-producing Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris isolates. It was less effective against E. coli isolates producing the OXA-1 enzyme and marginally active against TEM-1-producing Klebsiella spp. isolates. The presence of tazobactam at a concentration of 10 mg/l markedly reduced the minimal inhibitory concentrations for piperacillin in most of the beta-lactamase-derepressed Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii isolates; however, this synergism was much less pronounced in beta-lactamase-derepressed Klebsiella spp. isolates. The selection frequency of resistant clones from clinical E. cloacae and C. freundii isolates could be markedly reduced by the addition of 10 mg/l tazobactam to the piperacillin-containing selective medium. Resistant clones could be obtained only from part of the wild-type strains at 2 or 4 times the MIC of piperacillin in the presence of tazobactam, whereas resistant clones could be selected up to 64 times the MIC of piperacillin without the addition of tazobactam. This aspect deserves attention with respect to the rapid selection of beta-lactamase-derepressed clones from nosocomial pathogens.
TI  - Interaction of beta-lactamase inhibitors with various beta-lactamases.
AB  - The interaction of the beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam with various plasmid and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases from clinical isolates was studied. In each case inhibition of enzyme activity was observed to be progressive, i.e. the balance of the equilibrium between active and inactivated enzyme required 5 min. As expected, the clavam compound exhibited high affinity to all penicillinases including the enzyme from Staphylococcus aureus, but the affinity was poor to cephalosporinases. The affinity of tazobactam-a new penam sulfone-was 20- to 100-fold higher than that of sulbactam; its KI values ranged from 1.1 x 10(-9) to 5.0 x 10(-8) mol/l for class III and V enzymes (Richmond's and Sykes' classification) and from 4.1 x 10(-6) to 3.5 x 10(-5) mol/l for class I enzymes. Moreover, the affinity of tazobactam to the Enterobacter cloacae 2240 enzyme did not decrease at lowered pH values, but increased at alkaline pH values probably due to its binding to SH groups in the active centre of the enzyme.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of beta-lactam antibiotics on gram-negative bacteria: initial killing, morphology and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacodynamics of beta-lactam antibiotics on Gram-negative bacteria by studying the in vitro postantibiotic effect (PAE), initial killing and morphology. The PAE of aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, imipenem, mecillinam and piperacillin on Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens was studied by use of bioluminescence assay of bacterial ATP. The strains were exposed for 2 h to the beta-lactam antibiotics which were then eliminated by 10(-4) dilution. With E. coli, spheroplasts were seen during incubation with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, imipenem and mecillinam and a long (greater than 1 h) PAE was noted. In contrast, aztreonam and piperacillin produced a short (less than or equal to 1 h) PAE. This was seen concomitantly with the production of filaments and weak initial killing.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of papain on facultative pathogens--short communication.
AB  - Papain, a proteolytic enzyme obtained from papaya was found inhibitory on few facultative pathogens. While Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus albus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited at concentration from 200 ppm on the cell density of Staphylococcus faecalis decreased only at higher concentration of papain (400-800 ppm).
TI  - Influence of the addition of mineral salts on the inhibitory activity of strains  of the Arthrinium genus.
AB  - The influence which the addition of certain mineral salts has on the inhibiting activity of strains belonging to the Arthrinium genus was studied. The salts employed were AgNO3, FeCl2, MnCl2 and CuSO4, in concentrations of 10, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg/l, in the presence of Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. For B. subtilis and S. aureus greater inhibition was observed after the addition of FeCl2 (200 mg/l) and MnCl2 (10 mg/l). E. coli showed a greater sensibility in the presence of AgNO3 (200 mg/l) and CuSO4 (150 mg/l). Inhibition before Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens was not increased by the addition of any of the salts. The addition of MnCl2 at 10 mg/l concentration to the basal medium showed a considerable increase of inhibitory activity over Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans. Activity for Aspergillus niger decreased when any of the salts were added to the medium.
TI  - A comparative evaluation of oral ofloxacin versus intravenous cefotaxime therapy  for serious skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - In a single-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial, 100 successive patients were enrolled with serious skin and soft-tissue infections, whose illnesses had precipitated an initial hospital admission or an extension of inpatient care. There were 93 evaluable patients who received either ofloxacin, 400 mg orally every 12 hours plus an intravenously administered placebo every eight hours, or cefotaxime, 2.0 g intravenously every eight hours plus an orally administered placebo every 12 hours. The average length of therapy was 12 days. Both patient groups had similar demographics and underlying conditions. Wound infection was the most common diagnosis, followed by abscess, cellulitis, and trophic ulcer. Multiple pathogens were commonly isolated from infected sites (1.4 pathogens/patient). The most common pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Proteus/Providencia spp., and Enterobacter spp. Persistence of the initial pathogen at the end of therapy was observed in 22.5 percent of the cefotaxime-treated group, but in only 10 percent of the ofloxacin-treated group. There was one clinical failure in the cefotaxime group, caused by a susceptible strain of Enterobacter cloacae, and there was one clinical failure in the ofloxacin group, in which the patient had an Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus wound infection and subsequently developed a P. aeruginosa superinfection. Adverse experiences, including rash, insomnia, and nausea, occurred in 16 percent of the patients in each group. It was concluded that oral ofloxacin is as safe and efficacious as parenteral cefotaxime in the treatment of serious skin and skin structure infections.
TI  - 3-Sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems.
AB  - The stability of the 1-carba-1-dethiacephalosporin framework has allowed the synthesis of a range of 3-sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems unavailable for a variety of reasons in the cephem arena. The known p-nitrobenzyl 7 beta-(phenoxyacetamido)-3-[[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]oxy]-1-carba -1- dethia-3-cephem-4-carboxylate served as a precursor to this series of compounds. Displacement of the enol triflate with various sulfinates in acetonitrile or DMF and deprotection of the intermediates led to 7 beta-[(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxyimino)acetyl]amino]- 3-[alkyl(aryl)sulfonyl]-1-carba-1-dethia-3-cephem-4-carboxyl ic acids. The 3-sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems display potent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The following MIC's (microgram/mL) for the 3-cyclopropyl sulfone are representative: Staphylococcus aureus = 4, Streptococcus pyogenes = 1, Haemophilus influenzae = 0.25, Escherichia coli = 0.03, Enterobacter cloacae = 0.25, Proteus rettgeri = 0.25. The excellent in vitro antibacterial activity of this series indicates the potential of the carbacephalosporin framework for exploring substituents which are unknown or which produce unstable cephems.
TI  - ampG is essential for high-level expression of AmpC beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Mutants of Enterobacter cloacae 55 were studied to delineate more completely the  genetics of inducible expression of AmpC beta-lactamase. E. cloacae 55M-L, derived by mutagenesis from a mutant with high-level cefotaxime resistance (MIC, greater than 64 micrograms/ml), E. cloacae 55M, demonstrated a novel phenotype by producing only low levels of AmpC constitutively. Neither the parental phenotype of E. cloacae 55M nor the wild-type phenotype of E. cloacae 55 could be restored in E. cloacae 55M-L by the introduction of functional ampR, ampC, or ampD genes. Cloning each of these genes from E. cloacae 55M-L confirmed the same genotype for this mutant as for its parental strain. Mutation of E. cloacae 55M-L to the E. cloacae 55M phenotype was found to occur spontaneously at a frequency of 10(-8). All such revertants demonstrated an inducible wild-type phenotype after introduction of a functional ampD. These results suggested that the E. cloacae 55M-L phenotype was due to a mutation in an as yet unrecognized gene, designated ampG. Verification of this gene was obtained by the restoration of the E. cloacae 55M phenotype in E. cloacae 55M-L by introduction of a cloned 2.9-kilobase BamHI fragment from the E. cloacae 55 chromosome. Transformation of both ampG and ampD into E. cloacae 55M-L reconstituted the inducible wild-type phenotype. These results indicate that ampG is required for the activation of ampC by AmpR. Without ampG, neither induction nor high-level expression of AmpC is possible. It is likely that the ampG gene product and AmpD together modulate the ability of AmpR to activate ampC expression.
TI  - Glutathione transferase in bacteria: subunit composition and antigenic characterization.
AB  - The presence of glutathione transferase (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) in Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 25422, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 8427, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Klebsiella oxytoca CIP 666, K. oxytoca AF 101, Enterobacter cloacae CIP 6085, Serratia marcescens CIP 6755, and Proteus mirabilis AF 2924 was investigated. Using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate, GST activity was found in the glutathione-(GSH-)affinity-purified fraction of all strains tested. SDS-PAGE analysis of GSH-affinity-purified enzyme indicated that the GSTs of all these bacteria are dimers of two identical subunits of Mr about 22,500. Rabbit antiserum directed against the major isoenzyme present in Proteus mirabilis AF 2924, Pm-GST-6.0, was used to investigate the antigenic properties of bacterial GSTs. Western blot analysis indicated that a GST antigenically identical to Pm-GST-6.0 is present in Enterobacter cloacae CIP 6085, Escherichia coli ATCC 25422 and Proteus vulgaris ATCC 8427, but absent in Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella oxytoca CIP 666, K. oxytoca AF 101 and Serratia marcescens CIP 6755. The presence of Pm-GST-6.0, but not mammalian GST, increased the MIC values of amikacin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, cephalothin and nalidixic acid for E. coli ATCC 25922. It is suggested that bacterial GST may represent a defense against the effects of antibiotics.
TI  - Purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  - Extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. By a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. They were named Bac-5 and Bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. Over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. The remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). Both Bac-5 and Bac-7 efficiently kill Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They also arrest the growth of Enterobacter cloacae (MICs, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). Finally, Bac-7 but not Bac-5 has MICs of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. From the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of Bac-5 and Bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1986). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Susceptibilities to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents of bacterial strains isolated from urinary tract infections at 8 hospitals in Japan from July to October in 1986 are summarized as follows. 1. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST) and imipenem (IPM) with MIC90s of 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml. Minocycline had the strongest activity against Staphylococcus aureus; the MICs for all strains tested were lower than 0.39 microgram/ml. The MIC80s of dicloxacillin, and arbekacin (HBK) were 0.20 and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. Among the cephems, the MIC80 of flomoxef was 25 micrograms/ml, whereas those of cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefotiam (CTM) were 50 micrograms/ml. 2. Escherichia coli was most susceptible to ofloxacin (OFLX) among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested. OFLX showed the minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% (MIC90) of the 274 strains of E. coli tested to be lower than 0.10 microgram/ml. The antibacterial activities of the third generation cephems such as CMX and latamoxef (LMOX) were the strongest among the injectable antibiotics tested. The MIC90s of CMX and LMOX were lower than 0.10 and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. CTM and cefmetazole, the second generation cephems, were also highly active against E. coli with MIC90s of 0.39 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested, OFLX was the most active against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Its MIC90 was 0.78 microgram/ml. Among the injectable antibiotics tested, CMX was the strongest with an MIC90 of 0.20 microgram/ml; MIC90 of CTM and LMOX were 0.39 microgram/ml. 4. The tested antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally less active against Citrobacter freundii than against other bacteria. The MIC80 of OFLX was 0.39 microgram/ml. Gentamicin (GM) and ST were slightly active against C. freundii. Among the cephems, CMX had the MIC80 of 25 micrograms/ml. 5. Enterobacter cloacae was less susceptible to the cephems tested. OFLX, GM, and mecillinam were active against this bacteria with MIC80s of 0.78, 0.78 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 6. Among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents and penicillins examined, piperacillin (PIPC) was the most active against Proteus mirabilis. Its MIC90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. Those of sulbenicillin, cefaclor, ampicillin, OFLX, and ST were 0.78, 0.78, 1.56, 3.13 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. CMX was highly active against P. mirabilis with an MIC90 of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml; LMOX followed with an MIC90 of 0.20 microgram/ml among the injectable antibiotics tested. CTM was also active against this bacterium; the MIC90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. 7. The antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally only slightly active against Proteus vulgaris.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Evaluation of numerical analysis of SDS-PAGE of protein patterns for typing Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Twenty cultures comprising 13 clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae from two  hospitals, the type and another reference stain of E. cloacae and the type strains of four other Enterobacter sp. and of Escherichia coli, were characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of whole-cell proteins. The protein patterns were highly reproducible and were used as the basis of a numerical analysis which divided the clinical isolates into nine clearly defined protein types. Comparison with established typing methods indicated that the discrimination of SDS-PAGE was similar to that achieved with conventional typing methods and all strain groups recognized by combined sero/phage typing were also found by SDS-PAGE. In addition, protein typing sub-divided a group of four serotype O3 isolates that were difficult to distinguish by phage typing. We conclude that high-resolution SDS-PAGE of proteins provides an effective method of typing isolates of E. cloacae.
TI  - Hygienic status of food handlers.
AB  - The study demonstrated bacterial species on hands and nails of food-handlers before and after hand-washing. Those were Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., Bacillus spp., Diphtheroid, Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp., Proteus mirabilis, Serratia spp., Citrobacter freundii. Before hand washing, each food-handler harboured one to eight bacterial species. After hand-washing (eight with water from plastic boxes, 97 from pipe water, 57 out of 97 (58.8%) used soap or detergent with water), disappearance of one to four bacterial strains from hands and nails were found in 47.6 per cent of food-handlers. Cultures of water used for washing from eight plastic boxes yielded Staph. spp., Strep. spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Kleb.pneumoniae, Acinetobacter anitratus, Enterobacter cloacae. From pipe water, Diphtheroid in 4, 4.1 per cent Micrococcus in 1, 1.03 per cent were shown. Comparing bacterial species found in food-handlers with long nails and short nails, 4-8 more species were revealed in the former than the latter for 35.7 per cent. After hand-washing, there was recontamination of bacterial species in 17 food-handlers. This was probably due to dirty napkins or dresses during hand-drying or from water in plastic boxes.
TI  - Diagnostic considerations and interpretation of microbiological findings for evaluation of chronic prostatitis.
AB  - Seventy-five patients attending a clinic for chronic prostatitis were evaluated by use of lower urinary tract localization cultures. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and diphtheroids were the most common isolates, but none of these organisms were pathogens, based on the absence of bacteriuria or evidence of an inflammatory response in prostatic secretions. Recognized uropathogens were isolated in 12 (16%) of the 75 cases and included Escherichia coli in 6 cases, Enterococcus spp. in 2 cases, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus in 1 case each. Laboratory evaluation of men with chronic prostatitis should concentrate on the isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacteria that have an established pathogenic potential in the genitourinary tract.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of meropenem and interactions with other antibiotics.
AB  - MICs of meropenem for selected clinical isolates of bacteria were determined. Killing curves were performed on strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staph, epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii and Acinetobacter spp. A reduction of greater than or equal to 3 x log10 in viable cells was observed at 4 and 6 h of exposure to 4 and 8 x MIC, and this was usually maintained at 24 h (with a few exceptions for methicillin-resistant Staph, epidermidis and Ent. cloacae). At the MIC and twice the MIC regrowth tended to occur at 24 h although this varied from strain to strain. The interaction with other antibiotics was determined by the chequerboard technique. Usually an additive or synergistic effect was observed when meropenem or imipenem was used in combination with an aminoglycoside against Gram-negative species, while in a few cases antagonism occurred in combination with beta-lactams. Against Staph, aureus, MRSA and Staph, epidermidis synergism was usually obtained with combinations with teicoplanin or vancomycin and either synergism or addition with combinations with rifampicin, co-trimoxazole or ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Cefotaxime pharmacokinetics and treatment of meningitis in neonates.
AB  - Pharmacokinetic studies on cefotaxime/desacetylcefotaxime were carried out in very low birth weight newborns (n = 18; 500-1500 g; 28.4 +/- 2.4 weeks gestational age) during the first week of life. We have previously reported that the elimination t 1/2 of cefotaxime (3.4-6.4 h) and desacetylcefotaxime (9.4 h) was longer than previously described in term infants and children. In very low birth weight neonates, a single 50 mg/kg daily dose of cefotaxime may produce accumulation of the metabolite desacetylcefotaxime in serum. In a non-comparative prospective clinical trail, 22 infants (one week - three months) were treated for gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis with cefotaxime at a dosage of 50 mg/kg/day. The predominant pathogen was Escherichia coli in 14 cases and Enterobacter cloacae in four cases. Cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid obtained 24-48 h after the initiation of treatment were sterile in all subjects. Survival and complication rates of 95% and 19%, respectively, were observed. This compared favorably to previously published experiences with alternative treatment regimens for neonatal gram-negative enteric meningitis. In both the pharmacokinetic and meningitis studies, the safety profile for cefotaxime was excellent with no adverse reactions.
TI  - In-vitro activity of FCE 22101 and other beta-lactam antibiotics against Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third generation cephalosporins.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of FCE 22101 was compared with those of imipenem, aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and latamoxef against 225 Enterobacteriaceae (209 clinical isolates and 16 derivatives of Escherichia coli K12) chosen for their resistance (MIC greater than or equal to 8 mg/l) to third-generation cephalosporins. The beta-lactamases produced by the strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Esch. coli were identified. The mean MICs of FCE 22101 were 2-8 mg/l for Ent. cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii. For Ent. cloacae, the MICs were slightly higher for the cephalosporinase non overproducing (5.5-8 mg/l) than for the cephalosporinase overproducing (4.5 mg/l) strains. The mean MIC was 9 mg/l for Serratia spp. but for half of the strains the MICs were greater than or equal to 16 mg/l. The MICs of FCE 22101 were 0.5-1 mg/l for the resistant clinical isolates or isogenic derivatives of K. pneumoniae and Esch. coli producing extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamases (SHV-2, SHV-3 or CTX-1), whether measured in the presence of clavulanate or not, and against the sensitive controls. This showed that the compound was not affected by these new beta-lactamases. The MICs of imipenem, on the average four to five times lower than those of FCE 22101, were found to be very similar for resistant and sensitive strains. The MICs of aztreonam were high (32-128 mg/l) for C. freundii, K. oxytoca and cephalosporinase overproducing strains of Ent. cloacae. There was cross-resistance between the third-generation cephalosporins, but the MICs of latamoxef remained low (1 mg/l) against M. morganii, Klebsiella spp. and Esch. coli.
TI  - Regulation of enterobacterial cephalosporinase production: the role of a membrane-bound sensory transducer.
AB  - In clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, resistance to the newer beta-lactam antibiotics often results from overproduction of a cephalosporinase encoded by the beta-lactam-inducible ampC gene. Regulation of ampC is controlled by the divergently expressed activator gene, ampR, and a second unlinked locus. In this presentation we show that although Escherichia coli has lost its ampR gene it has retained the second regulatory locus and that this comprises the bicistronic ampDE operon. Genetic and biochemical studies define the ampD gene as encoding a repressor for ampC transcription whereas the ampE gene product is a cytoplasmic membrane protein. Inactivation of the AmpD protein by mutation causes massive overproduction of cephalosporinase which, in E. cloacae, can terminate in therapeutic failure. In contrast, loss of AmpE results in a total block in induction, despite the presence of the activator, AmpR.
TI  - [Investigations on the etiology of sepsis by using an experimental mouse model with leukocytopenia. 2. The role of the reticuloendothelial system in the etiology of bacteremia].
AB  - It has been recognized by clinical data that most of sepsis occurring in the immunocompromised host are endogenous infection. In recent years, we have investigated the mechanism of these bacteremia and sepsis by experimental studies using neutropenic mice treated with cyclophosphamide. And we evidenced that most pathogens causing bacteremia originated in the intestinal flora of the host. It has been shown that bacteria causing bacteremia were divided into two main groups, causing systemic bacteremia and causing portal bacteremia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Morganella morganii belonged to the former, on the other hand, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and some other bacteria belonged to the latter. In this study, we studied the role of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) in the etiology of bacteremia or sepsis, using various kinds of bacteria isolated from bacteremic mice. As a result, the following facts were revealed. 1. It was suggested that the low blood clearance rate of the bacteria was one of the great risk factor of systemic bacteremia, since the blood clearance rate of bacteria causing systemic bacteremia was significantly lower than those of bacteria causing portal bacteremia. 2. Bacteria in the blood were eliminated by the RES, mainly by the liver, and the level of bacterial clearance by the liver was relative to the type of bacteremia which was systemic or portal. 3. It was suggested that the bacterial clearance by the liver mainly reflected the phagocytosis by Kupffer cells, and especially the adherence of these cells to bacteria as the first step of phagocytosis.

AB  - In bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpodoxime proxetil  (CPDX-PR, CS-807), the following results were obtained: 1. Antibacteriological activity Antibacteriological activity of R-3746 (Na-salt of cefpodoxime), cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin, cefroxadine (CXD), cefazolin (CEZ), cephalothin (CET) and amoxicillin (AMPC) were studied against clinical isolated bacteria following as: Staphylococcus aureus (resistant or sensitive of methicillin), Escherichia coli (resistant or sensitive to CEZ), Klebsiella pneumoniae (resistant or sensitive to CEZ), Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter cloacae. Antibacterial activities of CXD and CET, however, were not tested against methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or CEZ resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae. R-3746 showed stronger activities than any of the other oral antibiotics against these strains except S. aureus against which it showed slightly less activity than AMPC. Most frequent MIC values of R-3746 to S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis were 1.56, 0.39, less than or equal to 0.10 and less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. Against isolated strains of MRSA, MICs of R-3746 were higher than 25 micrograms/ml with 23 strains (77%), which were similar to MIC values of CCL and AMPC against these organisms. MIC values of R-3746 against CEZ resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae were superior to MICs of other antibiotics, and the MIC50 value was 0.20 micrograms/ml. Against many isolated strains of E. cloacae MIC values of R-3746 were relatively high ranging 0.78 to greater than 100 micrograms/ml. MIC50 of R-3746 against E. cloacae was 12.5 micrograms/ml. 2. Absorption and excretion Serum concentration and urinary excretion of CPDX (the active form of CPDX-PR) were studied upon single oral administration of CPDX-PR at 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg (dry syrup) or 100 mg (tablet). The peak of serum concentration of CPDX was attained in 1-6 hours 1-4 hours and 2-6 hours after administration of CPDX-PR at the 3 different dosage levels, and they were 0.99-2.99 micrograms/ml, 4.30-7.05 micrograms/ml and 1.65-2.93 micrograms/ml, respectively. At 8 hours after administration, mean concentrations of CPDX for the 3 groups were 0.31, 0.83 and 0.66 micrograms/ml, respectively. As the average AUC's for the 3 groups were 8.16, 25.97 and 10.79 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Urinary recovery rates of CPDX for the 3 groups were 20.9-56.2, 28.3-49.7 and 35.1-50.4%, respectively in the first 8 hours after administration.
TI  - Microbiological survey of selected imported spices and associated fecal pellet specimens.
AB  - A microbiological survey was performed on 4 selected imported spices: black peppercorns, white peppercorns, coriander, and fennel seed. Aerobic plate count values ranged from 10(4) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/g for black and white peppercorns and from 10(3) to 10(5) CFU/g for coriander and fennel seed. Combined results of the 3-tube most probable number procedure and the API 20E kit indicated the presence of Escherichia coli in 4 test samples of black peppercorns, 1 test sample of white peppercorns, and 1 test sample of coriander. Two test samples of black peppercorns were positive for Salmonella contamination. Among the various Enterobacteriaceae isolated from the spices, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were found most frequently in all spice types. Of 18 mammalian and avian fecal pellets removed from the spices and analyzed microbiologically, E. coli was found in only 2 pellet specimens. There was no apparent relationship between the enteric microflora found in spices and those found in the fecal pellets.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - [Antibacterial and bactericidal activities of Japanese green tea].
AB  - We found that extracts of Japanese green tea leaves inhibited the growth of various bacteria causing diarrheal diseases. All tea samples tested showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Vibrio cholerae O1, V. cholerae non O1. V. parahaemolyticus, V. mimicus, Campylobacter jejuni and Plesiomonas shigelloides. None of the tea samples had any effect on the growth of V. fluvialis, Aeromonas sobria, A. hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae or Yersinia enterocolitica. Salmonella and Shigella showed susceptibilities different depending on the kind of Japanese green tea. Japanese green tea showed also bactericidal activity over S. aureus, V. parahaemolyticus and even enteropathogenic E. coli which was not sensitive when tested by cup method. The bactericidal activity was shown even at the drinking concentration in daily life.
TI  - In vitro activity of sulbactam in combination with various beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - Forty-three strains (beta-lactamase positive and negative) from the species of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumanii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied for synergy between sulbactam and several beta-lactam antibiotics. Using a checkerboard method, synergy was observed with 10 to 55% of the beta-lactamase negative strains. Synergy was more frequent with the strains producing beta-lactamase. Using the killing curve method, synergy was also observed between sulbactam and beta-lactam antibiotics against some beta-lactamase negative strains. In addition, the regrowth of a resistant subpopulation was prevented by sulbactam.
TI  - Dactimicin, a new aminoglycoside: in vitro activity, post-antibiotic effect and interaction with other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new aminoglycoside dactimicin in comparison to amikacin was tested alone and in combination with piperacillin, mezlocillin and ceftazidime against freshly isolated clinical pathogens. Dactimicin was more active than amikacin against Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia rettgeri and Salmonella spp., and less active than amikacin against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter anitratus. Using the checkerboard technique, the combination of either dactimicin or amikacin with the other drugs was shown to result in synergistic interaction against most of the 23 strains tested. Dactimicin-ceftazidime and amikacin-ceftazidime were the most effective combinations, demonstrating synergism against 91% and 95% of the isolates respectively. Antagonism was not encountered. Using the time-kill method, synergism was seen in most cases, indifference rarely being seen; antagonism was not observed. Dactimicin induced a post-antibiotic effect which ranged from 1 h for Enterobacter cloacae to 2.4 h for Escherichia coli. An average post-antibiotic effect of 0.6 h was also seen when dactimicin was combined with piperacillin, mezlocillin and ceftazidime. The findings indicate that dactimicin compares favorably in vitro with amikacin and suggest that clinical trials with this drug alone or in combination are warranted.
TI  - The phototrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas capsulata sp108 encodes an indigenous class A beta-lactamase.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.37 kb DNA fragment derived from cloning a total DNA digest of Rhodopseudomonas capsulata sp108 was determined. The DNA codes for a beta-lactamase, a protein showing sequence similarity to the ampR protein of Enterobacter cloacae and an unidentified open reading frame. Hybridization experiments with a probe carrying DNA from within the beta-lactamase gene suggests a chromosomal location for the coding sequences in strain sp108 and in sp109, a penicillin-sensitive revertant of sp108 in which the enzyme is not inducible. A protein-sequence comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the Rps. capsulata beta-lactamase indicates that it is a Class A enzyme and that its sequence can be aligned with those of the characterized beta-lactamases from Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus licheniformis and the Escherichia coli plasmid (R-TEM enzyme), with only a few insertions or deletions. The corresponding DNA sequence is, however, characteristically rhodopseudomonad, suggesting that it is not a recently transposed gene.
TI  - "Spontaneous" pneumocephalus associated with aerobic bacteremia.
AB  - Three cases of "spontaneous" pneumocephalus suspected to have resulted from aerobic bacteremia caused by Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella aerogenes are reported. In two cases, the E. cloacae and K. aerogenes were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. These cases were characterized by a rapid accumulation of air, without niveau, in the subarachnoid space and ventricles.
TI  - [Detection of hyperproduction of chromosomal beta-lactamase in strains of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - In order to show up the hyperproduction of chromosomic beta-lactamases in strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa we have tested a variant of a technique proposed by Medeiros et al. It is a qualitative technique and, the modification introduced allows errors of interpretation to be avoided, when the strain is a producer of plasmidic beta-lactamase. It is based on evaluating the amount of beta-lactamase in a culture, measured in time taken for the hydrolysis of nitrocefin, with or without the addition of clavulanic acid. We present the results obtained in 526 selected strains: 271 E. coli, 116 E. cloacae and 139 P. aeruginosa. One hundred and twenty for strains hydrolyzed the nitrocefin in the absence of clavulanic acid within 60 seconds. Only 52 (41.94%) of these strains did it when clavulanic acid was present; all of them have been qualified as hyperproducers according to susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics and the study and identification of the beta-lactamases by analytic isoelectrofocusing. The hydrolysis was evident before the 15 seconds in the 80% of hyperproducer strains. No false positive results were observed.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of 9 antibiotics including aztreonam (AZT) against clinically isolated Gram-negative bacteria were determined using MIC-2000 plus system. Bacteria were isolated from clinical materials in Saga Medical School during a period from May 1987 to March 1988. Summarized results were as follows: 1. AZT showed excellent antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp. and Haemophilus influenzae, and MIC80 values of AZT against these organisms were lower than 0.20 microgram/ml. 2. Antibacterial activities of AZT were superior to cephem antibiotics compared against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. 3. The MIC50 and MIC80 of AZT against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 12.5 micrograms/ml and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. AZT did not show any antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter sp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Product of the Lactococcus lactis gene required for malolactic fermentation is homologous to a family of positive regulators.
AB  - Malolactic fermentation is a secondary fermentation that many lactic acid bacteria can carry out when L-malate is present in the medium. The activation of the malolactic system in Lactococcus lactis is mediated by a locus we call mleR. Induction of the genes necessary to perform malolactic fermentation occurs only in bacteria with a functional copy of mleR. The mleR gene consists of one open reading frame capable of coding for a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 33,813 daltons. The amino acid sequence of the predicted MleR gene product is homologous to that of positive activators in gram-negative bacteria: LysR, IlvY gene products of Escherichia coli, MetR, CysB of Salmonella typhimurium, AmpR of Enterobacter cloacae, NodD of Rhizobium sp., and TrpI of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of tigemonam, alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  - The in vitro bactericidal activity of tigemonam, alone and in combination with gentamicin, was evaluated against various strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris. Minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations were determined on three consecutive days with an inoculum of 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL or a culture in the logarithmic growth phase. The results found tigemonam to be rapidly bactericidal against most Enterobacteriaceae isolated. In addition, the killing curves indicated a synergism between tigemonam and subinhibitory concentrations of gentamicin.
TI  - Antibacterial activity in vitro of tigemonam, a new oral monobactam.
AB  - Using a broth microdilution method, the antibacterial activity of tigemonam, a novel oral monobactam, was evaluated against 217 gram-negative aerobes freshly isolated from clinical specimens. Reference antibiotics were amoxicillin, amoxicillin-sulbactam, cephalexin, cefaclor, norfloxacin, and co-trimoxazole. At a concentration of less than or equal to 8 mg/L, tigemonam inhibited 88% of the members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Its activity was poor against the nonfermenter pathogens. In comparison with the other drugs, tigemonam generally exhibited superior antibacterial activity (with the exception of norfloxacin, which showed similar potency against the strains tested). Minimum bactericidal concentrations and time-kill determinations indicated that tigemonam showed remarkable bactericidal activity, with a 9% reduction in colony-forming units after 2 h at a dose corresponding to fourfold its minimum inhibitory concentration. When tigemonam was used in combination with netilmicin and amikacin against susceptible representative isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli, a synergistic effect was obtained.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against multiresistant nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Tigemonam, an oral monobactam that exhibits beta-lactamase stability similar to that of aztreonam, was tested in vitro against 240 species of Enterobacteriaceae (50 Escherichia coli, 48 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 52 Enterobacter cloacae, 32 Proteus mirabilis, 22 Proteus indole-positive [Providencia sp.], 24 Serratia sp., and 12 Citrobacter sp. All strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins. In addition, 77.4% were resistant to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 46.8% to cefuroxime, 23.3% to ceftriaxone, 22.2% to aztreonam, 46.9% to cotrimoxazole, and 0.9% to norfloxacin. Tigemonam at a concentration of 4 micrograms/mL or less inhibited 72.7% of the strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.03 or less to more than 512 micrograms/mL. The highest intrinsic activity was observed against Proteus sp. Tigemonam proved to be a bactericidal antibiotic. Cross-resistance was chiefly observed with aztreonam and ceftriaxone. It is concluded that tigemonam should play an important role in the treatment of nosocomial infections that do not require parenteral therapy and in the treatment of multiresistant community-acquired infections.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonates].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) were performed in neonates. The results were as follow: 1. A total of 27 patients consisting of 17 mature and 10 immature infants were treated with IPM/CS. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, and it was administered 2 approximately 3 times daily, in a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 approximately 12 days. The clinical efficacy of IPM/CS in 10 patients with bacterial infections (2 with sepsis, 3 with suspected sepsis, 2 with pneumonia, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with acute omphalitis) was evaluated as excellent in all patients, with an efficacy rate of 100%. All 5 causative organisms found in 5 patients (Staphylococcus aureus in 1, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Escherichia coli in 2 and Flavobacterium meningosepticum in 1) were eradicated. Among 27 patients administered IPM/CS, adverse reactions were observed in 2 patients. These were rash and diarrhea. As for abnormal laboratory test values, elevations of GOT and GPT were observed. 2. MICs of IPM against 14 clinical isolates (S. epidermidis 1, S. aureus 6, Streptococcus agalactiae 4, E. coli 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1 and F. meningosepticum 1) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. IPM showed good antibacterial activity comparable to that of cefotaxime against S. agalactiae; however, the activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus was poor. 3. Serum levels of IPM and CS were investigated in a total of 22 patients consisting of 15 mature and 7 immature infants after 20 mg/20 mg/kg of IPM/CS was administered. IPM and CS produced peak serum levels at the end of the drip infusion. In mature infants, peak serum levels of IPM and CS were 31.8 micrograms/ml (17.1 approximately 59.0 micrograms/ml) and 59.9 micrograms/ml (35.6 approximately 99.0 micrograms/ml), respectively. In low birth weight infants, these were 25.0 micrograms/ml (16.8 approximately 41.8 micrograms/ml) and 55.2 micrograms/ml (33.8 approximately 82.4 micrograms/ml), respectively. Half-lives of IPM and CS were 1.0 approximately 2.7 hrs. and 0.9 approximately 7.4 hrs. in mature infants, and 1.6 approximately 3.0 hrs. and 1.3 approximately 9.7 hrs. in immature infants, respectively. Generally the longer half-lives were observed in the younger neonates. Serum levels of CS remained higher and half-lives of CS were longer than those of IPM. The pharmacokinetics in neonates were different from those in adults or children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

AB  - The in vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, BMY-28232 (7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyiminoacetamido]-3-[ (Z)-1- propenyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid), was compared with those of cefuroxime and BMY-28488, the 3-vinyl congener of BMY-28232, against 899 bacteria including strains resistant to newer cephalosporins. BMY-28232 displayed potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial activity with high stability to various types of beta-lactamase. Its acetoxyethyl ester (BMY-28271) and pivaloyloxymethyl ester (BMY-28257) were well absorbed after oral administration to mice and rats. Both esters were metabolized to BMY-28232 and mainly excreted in urine. Oral bioavailability of both prodrug esters (60 to 70%) was better than that of cefuroxime axetil (46%) and gave excellent therapeutic efficacy against gram-positive- and gram-negative-bacterial infections in mice. Oral 50% protective doses (in milligrams per kilogram of body weight) of 0.65 and 0.72 for Staphylococcus aureus Smith, 0.9 and 1.2 for Escherichia coli Juhl, 1.6 and 1.6 for Proteus vulgaris, and 18.9 and 14.3 for Enterobacter cloacae were obtained for BMY-28271 and BMY-28257, respectively.
TI  - In-vitro activity of FCE 22101 and synergy studies with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - FCE 22101 is a penem antibiotic with broad in-vitro activity similar to that of imipenem, although less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Combinations of FCE 22101 with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staph. epidermidis resulted in addition or indifference by the chequerboard method. The combination of FCE 22101 and gentamicin against Streptococcus faecalis was usually additive. Against Enterobacter cloacae FCE 22101 had MICs of 16 mg/l whilst in combination with gentamicin (0.25-0.12 mg/l) the MICs were reduced to less than 2 mg/l. Ciprofloxacin and FCE 22101 showed only addition against Enterobacter spp. similar results were obtained with the combinations of FCE 22101 and gentamicin or ciprofloxacin tested against Citrobacter freundii. With Serratia spp. FCE 22101 and gentamicin showed synergy, but FCE 22101 and ciprofloxacin showed indifference. Similar results were obtained with strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, Proteus, and Providencia spp. FCE 22101 plus gentamicin, or aztreonam, against Ps. aeruginosa usually showed indifference, but with ciprofloxacin addition was the rule. In general the combination of FCE 22101 with other agents resulted in an additive rather than a synergistic effect.
TI  - Activity of FCE 22101 and other beta-lactam antibiotics against experimental genital infections in the rat and mouse.
AB  - The therapeutic activities of the parenterally administered penem FCE 22101, cefuroxime and ampicillin were compared in an experimental model of genital infections in progesterone-treated virgin rats and normal female mice. Treatment with FCE 22101 significantly inhibited the proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 13709, Escherichia coli G and Enterobacter cloacae 1321 E, as compared with untreated controls. Against Staph. aureus ampicillin was slightly more active than cefuroxime, which showed equivalent activity to FCE 22101, while against Esch. coli and Ent. cloacae cefuroxime and ampicillin were less active than FCE 22101. The activity of the antibiotics against beta-lactamase-producing strains was also tested and here FCE 22101 exhibited the greatest inhibitory effect on bacterial growth.
TI  - Activity of FCE 22891 compared with cefuroxime axetil and cefixime in pulmonary and subcutaneous infections in mice.
AB  - The therapeutic activity of FCE 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against Streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. In experimental pneumonia FCE 22891 was the most active antibiotic. In aerobic abscesses FCE 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against Str. pyogenes. In abscesses caused by Gram-negative bacteria, FCE 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. Cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant Esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of Ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. Cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against Gram-negative bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of Ent. cloacae. FCE 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by Bacteroides fragilis 101. We conclude that FCE 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins characterized by longer half lives.
TI  - FCE 22101 and FCE 22891: in-vitro antibacterial activity at concentrations simulating human plasma levels following intravenous, intramuscular and oral administration.
AB  - The plasma concentrations of FCE 22101 observed following slow intravenous infusions (1 and 4 h), intramuscular injection and after oral administration of the prodrug FCE 22891 were simulated in a glass chamber containing bacterial cultures. The bacteria used were Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 13709, Staph. aureus 2101 (methicillin-resistant), Streptococcus faecium ATCC 8043, Escherichia coli ATCC 12407, Enterobacter cloacae 1321E and Ent. cloacae P99 (cefazolin-resistant). Addition of FCE 22101 was found to result in a reduction in number of all bacterial strains except Str. faecium, with which only bacteriostasis was observed.
TI  - A clinical evaluation of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - We have treated 42 episodes of pediatric infections with sulbactam/ampicillin since 1987. Included were 9 cellulitis, 9 urinary tract infections, 5 cervical lymphadenitis, 4 meningitis, 2 thoracic empyema, 2 osteomyelitis, 2 sepsis, 1 furuncle, 1 perianal abscess, 1 dental abscess, 1 peritonsillitis, 1 salmonellosis, 1 shigellosis, 1 peritonitis, 1 suppurative thyroiditis, 1 infective endocarditis. Responsible pathogens were Escherichia coli in 8, Staphylococcus aureus in 6, Hemophilus influenzae in 2, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3, Streptococcus viridans in 2, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Bacteroides fragilis in 1, Salmonella D1 in 1, Shigella sonnei in 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, Enterobacter agglomerans in 1, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 1, Enterobacter cloacae in 1, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus in 1, and polymicrobial infection in 4 cases. Thirty-nine out of 41 (95%) clinically evaluable patients cured and all (34/34) bacteriologically evaluable patients eradicated their pathogens after treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin. Side reactions were seen in five patients; one maculopapular skin rash, one hemolytic anemia, two diarrhea, and one liver function impairment plus leukopenia. All these reactions were transient and did not require interruption of therapy. These results indicate that sulbactam/ampicillin is safe and effective in the treatment of common pediatric infections beyond the neonatal period.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of the new semisynthetic cephalosporin cefpirome.
AB  - Cefpirome (HR 810), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative, was found to have a broad antibacterial spectrum against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Against Staphylococcus aureus, cefpirome was more active than not only cefotaxime and ceftazidime but also cefotiam. Against gram-negative bacteria, especially, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii, it was also more active than the other antibiotics tested, but against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it was less active than ceftazidime. Cefpirome was stable to hydrolysis by the common plasmid mediated beta-lactamases and was stable to the action of chromosomal cephalosporinases. But it was slightly hydrolyzed by both Rms 213 mediated penicillinase and oxyiminocephalosporinases produced by Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas cepacia. When cefpirome was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity and post-antibiotic effect of dactimicin, a new aminoglycoside, alone and in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of dactimicin, a novel aminoglycoside, has been tested  in vitro in combination with piperacillin, mezlocillin and ceftazidime against freshly isolated Gram-negative and Gram-positive aerobes and compared with that of amikacin. Using the checkerboard test, the combination of dactimicin and amikacin with the other drugs resulted in a synergistic interaction with the Enterobacteriaceae strains analysed in 36 out of 39 and 37 out of 39 cases, respectively. Antagonism was never encountered. With the Pseudomonas isolates, indifference prevailed with dactimicin, whereas synergism was observed with amikacin in combination with the other drugs. No case of antagonism was encountered. When the time-kill system was employed, synergism prevailed, indifference was a rare case, and antagonism was not observed. In experiments carried out with dactimicin-susceptible staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates, a synergistic outcome was obtained employing both methods. Dactimicin induced a post-antibiotic effect (PAE) which ranged from about 1 h with Enterobacter cloacae to 3 h with Escherichia coli after exposure of the bacteria for 1 h to 4 x MIC. The PAE was also evaluated employing several drug associations. An average of 0.6 h PAE was apparent when dactimicin was combined with piperacillin, mezlocillin and ceftazidime, and the bacteria were exposed for 1 h to drug concentrations corresponding to one-half their MICs.
TI  - Beta-lactamase stability and antibacterial activity of cefpirome alone and in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefpirome (HR810), a new cephalosporin, was compared with that of other "third-generation" cephalosporins, as well as cefuroxime, piperacillin and gentamicin. Cefpirome was the most active beta-lactam antibiotic against Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC90 for Enterobacteriaceae was always less than 0.5 ml/l except for Enterobacter species. The MIC90 against Pseudomonas species was 2 mg/l, which was equal to that of ceftazidime and gentamicin. Cefpirome was also more active than the other beta-lactam antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus. A relatively high frequency of synergy was observed when cefpirome was combined with aminoglycosides against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. No antagonism was detected. This antibiotic was very stable to both plasmid- and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases. It was more resistant to Enterobacter cloacae P99 enzyme than ceftazidime, cefotaxime and cefotetan. Its stability to the Klebsiella K1 beta-lactamase was more than that of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone but slightly less than that of ceftazidime and latamoxef. MBC90 values for cefpirome were generally less than twice the corresponding MIC values.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
TI  - Type 3 fimbriae among enterobacteria and the ability of spermidine to inhibit MR/K hemagglutination.
AB  - The distribution of the gene cluster encoding type 3 fimbriae among various isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae was investigated by using 112 clinical and nonclinical isolates. Closely related DNA sequences were detected in all Klebsiella strains, in most Enterobacter isolates, in a smaller number of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp., and in a single isolate each of Yersinia enterocolitica and Serratia liquefaciens but not in isolates of Morganella or Providencia species or Serratia marcescens. Except for E. coli and Salmonella strains, the presence of gene sequences was correlated with the phenotypic expression of either the MR/K hemagglutinin or fimbriae that reacted with specific antibodies. In one isolate of Y. enterocolitica the expression of type 3 fimbriae was plasmid determined. The polyamine spermidine was identified as an inhibitor of MR/K hemagglutinating activity, exhibiting an MIC of 1.2 mM. Spermidine inhibited the hemagglutination of 37 MR/K-positive clinical isolates from various genera. However, one clinical isolate of Enterobacter cloacae and most (four of five) nonclinical Klebsiella isolates were not completely inhibited.
TI  - Beta-lactamase evaluation of the amoxycillin-clavulanate association.
AB  - The capability of potassium clavulanate to protect amoxycillin from destruction by three partially purified beta-lactamases (from E. cloacae, B. cereus 569/H9 and E. coli R-TEM) was evaluated. The enzymatic inhibition was determined spectrophotometrically by assessing the ability of either amoxycillin or potassium clavulanate or their combination (at a 7:1 ratio by weight) to prevent the hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate (nitrocefin) after different pre-incubation times, thus determining the IC50 and Ki values. Potassium clavulanate significantly reduced the IC50 values of amoxycillin for B. cereus and TEM enzymes by a factor ranging from 500 to 1200, by inhibiting these beta-lactamases at concentrations ranging from 4 to 0.008 microM. However, clavulanic acid was quite ineffective against type I enzymes (from E. cloacae), while amoxycillin was found to be sufficiently stable (IC50 of 0.8-1.4 microM).
TI  - Sequence of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa trpI activator gene and relatedness of trpI to other procaryotic regulatory genes.
AB  - In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the trpI gene product regulates the expression of the  trpBA gene pair encoding tryptophan synthase. trpI and trpBA are transcribed divergently. The trpI DNA sequence and deduced amino acid sequence were determined. The trpI start codon was found to be 103 base pairs from that of trpB. trpI encodes a 293-residue protein and the size of the trpI gene product, measured on sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gels, was close to that calculated from the amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequence of trpI resembles that of Enterobacter cloacae ampR, the regulatory gene for the ampC cephalosporinase. The N-terminal portions of trpI and ampR resemble corresponding portions of ilvY, metR, and lysR in Escherichia coli and nodD in Rhizobium meliloti. This resemblance may help to define a trpI-related family of activator proteins sharing a common structural plan.
TI  - [Activity of cefpirome against bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients].
AB  - The activity of cefpirome (HR 810) was evaluated against 247 strains isolated from patients developing their infections while in a hospital in Buenos Aires. Its activity against Gram negative bacilli was compared with ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cephalotin, piperacillin, amikacin, gentamicin and norfloxacin. In terms of MIC50 and MIC90 (mg/l) it was as follows: Klebsiella pneumoniae: less than 0.125, less than 2.0; Pseudomonas aeruginosa: less than 8, less than 16; Escherichia coli: less than 0.016, less than 0.063; Serratia marcescens: less than 0.063, less than 1.0; Enterobacter cloacae: less than 0.125, less than 1.0. Cefpirome was more active than the other cephalosporins against P. aeruginosa: at 16 mg/l, this drug inhibited 95% of strains versus 60% for ceftazidime and 32% for ceftriaxone. Activity of norfloxacine against Gram negative bacilli was similar to cefpirome, while piperacillin and the aminoglycosides were less active. Cefpirome was more active than cepahallotin against Streptococcus faecalis (2.0, 32) although less active than ampicillin, piperacillin, rifampicin and vancomycin. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (less than 0.25, less than 1.0) it was more active than cephalotin and the other drugs evaluated (piperacillin, erythromycin, chloranphenicol, aminogycosides). Like cephalotin, the activity of cefpirome against methicillin-resistant strains was variable (1.0, 32).
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  - In vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. A microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). The following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: Staphylococcus aureus, S intermedius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Ent cloacae, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus sp, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Rhodococcus equi, Proteus vulgaris, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included S aureus, S intermedius, Ent aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Pasteurella multocida, B bronchiseptica, Pr mirabilis, and Serratia sp.
TI  - Survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  - The susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. Viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Tetrahymena pyriformis. Cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. Qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. Protozoa were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. Ingested coliforms Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella sonnei, Legionella gormanii, and Campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. Bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. All bacterial pathogens were greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by T. pyriformis. Escherichia coli ingested by a Cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. The mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within protozoan cells. This study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. This bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. We propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.
TI  - New aerobactin-mediated iron uptake system in a septicemia-causing strain of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Unlike the great majority of the aerobactin-producing enteric bacteria documented in the literature, Enterobacter cloacae EK33, isolated from a case of human neonatal meningitis, did not show any homology at the DNA level with the prototype aerobactin system encoded by the ColV-K30 plasmid. However, both the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum and fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the siderophore purified from EK33 confirmed its identity with aerobactin. Bioassay screening of a gene library of total DNA of EK33 led to the isolation of several aerobactin-positive clones. Under conditions of iron limitation, these clones expressed in Escherichia coli a protein of 72 kilodaltons that reacted with antiserum raised against the pColV-K30 74-kilodalton aerobactin receptor, while the original E. cloacae strain synthesized an 85-kilodalton protein which also cross-reacted with the antiserum. Restriction endonuclease analysis of the cloned DNA confirmed the structural differences between the two aerobactin genetic systems.
TI  - Value of surveillance cultures in the management of neutropenic patients.
AB  - To assess whether bacteriological surveillance cultures can be used to predict infection in neutropenic patients, cultures were performed during the period of neutropenia of nose, throat and urine specimens collected once weekly and faeces specimens collected twice weekly. Seventy-six consecutively observed patients undergoing chemotherapy for haematological or non-haematological diseases were investigated. Severe infection including septicaemia, lower respiratory tract infection, anorectal lesion and urinary tract infection occurred in 32 patients. Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the organisms most commonly involved. In the majority of cases of septicaemia the organisms were isolated from the faeces, often in pure culture, prior to the onset of septicaemia. Most of the isolates of Enterobacter cloacae were resistant to the empiric antibiotic therapy used in the unit and were able to colonise multiple sites, presumably increasing the risk of subsequent infection. Faecal culture is the most useful approach in bacteriological surveillance in neutropenic patients.
TI  - A selection cartridge for rapid detection and analysis of spontaneous mutations including insertions of transposable elements in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - We present a method that allows positive selection and rapid analysis of mutations in Enterobacteriaceae. Mutations are detected in a 2630 bp selection cartridge inserted in two different bacterial multicopy plasmid vectors. Spontaneous mutations in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii include insertions, deletions and point mutations. The small size of the target sequence facilitates rapid analysis of DNA rearrangements by cleavage with restriction enzymes and of any type of mutation by DNA sequence analysis. While in E. coli insertions of the mobile elements IS1, IS2 and IS5 were readily found, insertions of putative new transposable elements were detected in Enterobacter cloacae. The selection cartridge can thus serve as a tool for studying the spectrum of insertion mutations in Enterobacteriaceae and probably other Gram-negative bacteria, and the dependency of this spectrum on physiological and environmental factors and the host's genetic background can be investigated.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of monobactams against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of monobactam antibiotics (carumonam (CRMN) and aztreonam (AZT] against Gram-negative bacilli isolated from inpatients in the latter half of 1987 were investigated using penicillin (PC: piperacillin (PIPC], cephems (CEPs: ceftazidime (CAZ), cefotaxime (CTX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefsulodin (CFS], carbapenem (imipenem (IPM] and pyridonecarboxylic acids (norfloxacin (NFLX) and ofloxacin (OFLX] as reference antibiotics. A total of 400 strains of 13 species, i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, were used as test strains. 1. CRMN and AZT, both monobactam antibiotics, were roughly comparable in their activities and no resistant strain to these antibiotics were found among isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., M. morganii, P. rettgeri or H. influenzae and few resistant strains were observed among isolates of S. marcescens. On the other hand, isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa included rather numerous strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. Among these cases, whereas R strains, i.e. resistant strains showing MICs greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to PC and CEPs, I strains, i.e. intermediately resistant strains showing MICs between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. 2. Strains resistant to PIPC, a PC, were detected with high and more or less uniform frequencies over the entire spectrum of the isolates examined. 3. Antibacterial activities of CEPs varied against different bacterial species. While strains resistant to CTX, CAZ and LMOX were commonly detected with high frequencies among isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and S. marcescens, large percentages of LMOX-resistant strains of C. freundii and Enterobacter spp. were of the I type. CTX-resistant strains were also found among isolates of P. vulgaris and M. morganii. Proportions of CEP-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were 28% for CFS and 12% for CAZ. 4. No or few strains among the isolates of 13 species investigated were resistant to IPM, a carbapenem antibiotic, which showed the most stable antibacterial activity, but it was less active than monobactam antibiotics and CEPs against Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis and H. influenzae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated strains to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of aztreonam (AZT) and cephems against clinically isolated 334 strains were investigated. The results obtained in the study are summarized as follows: 1. AZT showed excellent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated 334 strains. 2. AZT showed potent activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Enterobacter aerogenes and Citrobacter freundii. 3. Antibacterial activities of AZT were superior against Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to those of cephems.
TI  - Clinical safety and efficacy of ofloxacin.
AB  - In this study we report about the efficacy and tolerability of ofloxacin in the treatment of 15 patients with severe and moderately severe infections including osteomyelitis (5), soft tissue infections (5), salmonellosis in AIDS patients (2), acute or chronic pulmonary infections (2) and mediastinitis (1). The following organisms were isolated in culture specimens: Staphylococcus aureus (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Serratia marcescens (1), Escherichia coli (1), Aeromonas hydrophila (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Salmonella cholerae-suis (1), Salmonella sp. (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1). All isolates were sensitive to the drug. Of 5 cases with osteomyelitis, 2 were cured and 3 improved clinically (with bacteriological eradication of the pathogens). The best results were obtained in patients with soft tissue infections: 4 patients were cured and 1 improved. Two patients with salmonella bacteremia and AIDS experienced a recurrence 1 month and 2 months respectively after stopping therapy. The patient with mediastinitis was successfully treated. Improvement was recorded for 2 patients with bronchiectasis and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. The drug was well tolerated, only one episode of mild nausea and vomiting was reported and did not require discontinuation of the therapy. The study indicates that ofloxacin is a safe and effective agent in the treatment of various infections.
TI  - A large family of bacterial activator proteins.
AB  - At least nine different bacterial proteins belong to the LysR family. The gene sequence for one of these proteins is presented here. Six others (Escherichia coli LysR, IlvY, CysB; Salmonella typhimurium MetR; Rhizobium NodD; and Enterobacter cloacae AmpR) are known to activate other genes. Based on sequence alignments, each member of this family is predicted to have a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif near its amino terminus. The combined evidence indicates that all nine proteins are related by common ancestry, are similarly folded, and are not detectably related to other known bacterial regulatory proteins. The DNA database searching procedure and other methods used in this study should be useful in detecting other groups of related proteins.
TI  - Bacteremia complicating acute leukemia with special reference to its incidence and changing etiological patterns.
AB  - Over the 15-yr period, 1972-1986, 194 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 132 patients with acute leukemia at the Third Department of Medicine, Kanazawa University Hospital, giving an incidence of 478 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. This incidence was at least twice as high as that in patients with chronic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma or aplastic anemia, and about 40-fold higher than that in patients with all other internal diseases. The rate of occurrence of bacteremia, whether unimicrobial or polymicrobial, remained almost unchanged throughout the study period. The frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of the total isolates for the first 10-yr period to 50% for the second 5-yr period. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in markedly decreasing frequency, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae in relatively constant frequency. The majority of P. aeruginosa isolates belonged to a limited number of O-antigen groups, suggesting the possibility of nosocomial infection. On the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9 to 36%. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species, and Staphylococcus aureus emerged as important pathogens. Such a change in the spectrum of organisms was considered to coincide with the common use of the so-called second- and third-generation cephalosporins and central venous catheters. It is thus suggested that vancomycin be added to empiric antibiotic therapy, especially when gram-positive infections are clinically or microbiologically suspected, and that reducing the acquisition of P. aeruginosa from the hospital environment remains a priority in infection prevention.
TI  - [Susceptibility of gram-negative bacterial isolates to six beta-lactam and two aminoglycoside antibiotics at our university hospital].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Gram-negative bacterial strains isolated at the University Hospital in 1987 to six beta-Lactam antibiotics (azthreonam cefmetazole, ceftizoxime, latamoxef, aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin) and two aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin and amikacin) were examined by agar dilution and the agar diffusion method. Results obtained from both methods correlated well in most of the strains. Most of the strains belonging to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were sensitive to the beta-lactam antibiotics except aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin. They were also sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Most strains of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens were sensitive to azthreonam, latamoxef and aminoglycosides, but were less sensitive to other beta-lactams. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was generally resistant to beta-lactams except ceftizoxime, but was sensitive to aminoglycosides. More than half of the strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to azthreonam, piperacillin and aminoglycoside antibiotics and only latamoxef was active in Pseudomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Monitoring beta-lactamase activity in vivo by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
AB  - A 13C-labeled cephalothin, 7 beta-(2-thienylacetamido)-3-[acetoxy-13C1]methyl-3-cephem-4- carboxylate (compound 1), has been prepared and used to monitor beta-lactamase activities by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Time-elapsed spectral analysis of the reaction of the labeled cephalothin with the TEM-2 beta-lactamase purified from Escherichia coli revealed the progressive loss of the cephalothin acetyl resonance at 176.8 ppm and accumulation of an acetate signal at 184.3 ppm. Spectral results identical to those observed in the in vitro experiment were obtained when compound 1 was incubated with cell suspensions of E. coli JSR-O (pBR322), which contains the plasmid-encoded TEM-2 beta-lactamase, and Enterobacter cloacae strains that contain a class I chromosomal beta-lactamase. Pseudo-first-order rate constants for the lactamase-catalyzed formation of acetate from cephalothin in vivo were obtained by integration of the 13C-acetyl resonances of compound 1 during timed incubations with cell preparations. These results constitute the first demonstration of the ability to monitor beta-lactamase activity in viable cells by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
TI  - Selection of resistance to gentamicin and netilmicin in the faecal flora following prophylaxis for colo-rectal surgery.
AB  - The selection of aminoglycoside-resistant bowel flora, following the administration of either gentamicin or netilmicin in combination with metronidazole for prophylaxis, during colo-rectal surgery in 88 patients has been examined. Both antibiotic regimens resulted in the selection of an aminoglycoside-resistant flora in a total of 57 (65%) of patients: in half of the patients there was a net gain in the aminoglycoside-resistant flora, and in 13 (15%) one aminoglycoside-resistant strain present prior to prophylaxis was displaced by another following operation. Three patients (3%) lost aminoglycoside-resistant strains after prophylaxis. Most of the resistant organisms selected were considered to be of little importance as potential pathogens, at least in the short term. In only a small minority (5%) of patients were aminoglycoside-resistant enterobacteria isolated. Aminoglycoside-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was not isolated. Of the resistant enterobacteria, only one strain, an isolate of Enterobacter cloacae selected in a patient receiving gentamicin, carried a resistance determinant which was self-transmissible to Escherichia coli.
TI  - Simple assay of beta-lactamase with agar medium containing a chromogenic cephalosporin, pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (PADAC).
AB  - A new beta-lactamase assay method with agar plates containing pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (PADAC) (50 microM), a beta-lactamase-labile, chromogenic cephalosporin, was examined. On the PADAC plates inoculated with beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (10(4) CFU per spot) and incubated at 37 degrees C, a yellow zone showing hydrolysis of PADAC by beta-lactamase was formed around the colony. The zone diameter increased with incubation time. Examination with Enterobacter cloacae GN7471 revealed that beta-lactamase activity was present in the agar around the colony, decreasing exponentially with increasing distance from the colonial margin; this suggests that the PADAC hydrolysis zone is formed by an extracellular enzyme. At 18 h, significant correlations were obtained between the zone diameters of the 10 species (clinical isolates) examined and their periplasmic beta-lactamase activities determined spectrophotometrically. The addition of clavulanic acid (0.5 to 10 micrograms/ml) inhibited zone formation on the PADAC plates inoculated with type IIIa, Va, Vb, PSE-1, and Ic beta-lactamase producers. When the clinical isolates were tested on plates with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/ml), inhibition was observed in 41 to 58% of the Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and in all isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus vulgaris. Thus, the use of the inhibitor made it possible to detect penicillinase or type Ic cephalosporinase producers. These results proved that the PADAC plate might be a useful tool permitting easy, semiquantitative determination of beta-lactamase activity.
TI  - Impact of the ampD gene and its product on beta-lactamase production in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - In an investigation of the influence of the ampD gene on beta-lactamase production and induction in Enterobacter cloacae, the ampR-ampC gene region cloned into a plasmid and the ampD gene cloned into another vector were transferred to a strain of Escherichia coli. The genetically manipulated E. coli strains served as a model for study of the inducibility of beta-lactamases in E. cloacae. In addition, beta-lactamase induction in E. cloacae bearing the previously mentioned plasmids was studied. After induction of the beta-lactamase with cefoxitin, the specific hydrolytic activity, the viable cell count, and the degradation of cefoxitin were determined. beta-Lactamase expression decreased with an increasing amount of the ampD gene product. The cefoxitin concentration decreased in proportion to the amount of enzyme, but the induction of beta-lactamase seemed not to be an important factor influencing the viable cell count of E. cloacae as long as cefoxitin concentrations exceeded the MIC. Despite different beta-lactamase concentrations, the decrease in the viable cell count was nearly identical in all experiments.
TI  - Heterogeneity in ampR-ampC gene interaction in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - The ampR gene and its regulation of AmpC beta-lactamase synthesis were investigated for Enterobacter cloacae 1194E, a wild-type strain producing a group A (pI 8.7) enzyme. Expression of the cloned E. cloacae 1194E ampR-ampC region was examined initially in Escherichia coli HB101. However, transformants showed only constitutive beta-lactamase expression. For study of enzyme expression in a more closely related host, the cloned E. cloacae 1194E ampR-ampC region was transformed into E. cloacae 55, a wild-type strain producing a group B (pI 7.8) enzyme. Results indicated a functional E. cloacae 1194E ampR gene that could not be transcomplemented by E. cloacae 55. A comparative analysis of ampR nucleotide and amino acid-sequence data from E. cloacae 1194E and E. cloacae MHN1 revealed related but divergent genes. Thermal induction studies of AmpC beta-lactamase also indicated a difference between E. cloacae 1194E and E. cloacae 55 in ampR-ampC interaction. Thus, it appears that, in at least some strains of Enterobacter, significant intraspecies divergence of ampR has occurred. This heterogeneity in ampR would not have been detected with beta-lactamase expression studies conducted exclusively in E. coli.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of (2,3)-alpha- and (2,3)-beta-methylene analogs of penicillin G.
AB  - The penam nucleus can assume two conformations; these are designated open and closed. The synthetic (2,3)-alpha- and (2,3)-beta-methylenepenams can be regarded as analogs of the open and closed conformations, respectively. It has been shown that the beta-methylenepenams are essentially inactive, suggesting that the closed conformation of penams is also inactive. In this study, we investigated a series of beta-lactams, all of which contained phenylacetamido side chains: penicillin G, the (2,3)-alpha- and (2,3)-beta-methylenepenams, and the 3-acetoxymethyl- and 3-methylcephalosporins. The alpha-methylenepenam and penicillin G were the most active compounds, while the beta-methylene isomer was only poorly active. Results with permeability mutants suggested that the alpha-methylene compound penetrated the outer membrane somewhat more readily than penicillin G did. The intrinsic potency of the alpha-methylenepenam appeared to be similar to that of penicillin G, on the basis of their affinities for penicillin-binding proteins and their abilities to inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis in ether-permeabilized Escherichia coli, while the beta-methylene analog had very poor intrinsic potency. The alpha-methylene analog was about 10-fold more efficient (Vmax/Km) than penicillin G as a substrate for the cephalosporinases from Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, but it was about 40-fold less efficient with penicillinase from Staphylococcus aureus. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the active conformation of penams is the open conformation and suggest that the position in space of the carboxyl group relative to the beta-lactam carbonyl is an important determinant of cephalosporinlike character, as distinct from penicillinlike character.
TI  - Mechanism of inhibition of chromosomal beta-lactamases by third-generation cephalosporins.
AB  - The kinetic interactions of the beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae 908 R with ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime have been examined in detail. With all of these cephalosporins, there is an initial rapid reaction involving opening of the beta-lactam that then decreases to a slower steady-state rate (kss) of beta-lactam hydrolysis (at 37 degrees C: ceftriaxone, kss = 0.044 s-1; cefotaxime, kss = 0.033 s-1; ceftazidime, kss = 0.011 s-1). More than stoichiometric quantities of beta-lactam are cleaved during the rapid phase, during which there is accumulation of a transiently stable cephalosporin-enzyme complex whose rate of breakdown is slower than the overall rate of hydrolysis. Qualitatively similar behavior is observed with the E. cloacae M6300 beta-lactamase. These observations eliminate the possibility that the reaction follows a simple linear kinetic scheme. A branched kinetic scheme in which an initially formed acyl intermediate partitions between deacylation and elimination of the 3' substituent is proposed to explain the data. Investigations of the interaction of ceftriaxone with the chromosomally encoded beta-lactamases from Citrobacter freundii, Providencia rettgeri, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli show that the partitioning behavior of E. cloacae beta-lactamases is atypical. All of the data, however, clearly demonstrate that it is a physical impossibility for cephalosporin trapping to contribute to bacterial resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Epidemiology of fecal strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae in 22 neonatal wards and influence of antibiotic policy.
AB  - The gram-negative fecal floras from 953 infants were studied upon discharge of the infants from 22 neonatal wards. More than 600 distinct phenotypes of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. were distinguished by high-resolution biotyping. The colonization patterns observed showed considerable local and temporal variation. The major (M) strains (phenotypes), which colonized more than 10% and up to 78% of the infants in a ward (median, 23%), were Klebsiella oxytoca (15 strains), E. coli (4 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1 strain), and Enterobacter cloacae (1 strain). Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was more pronounced among M strains than among strains of enteric bacteria colonizing few or single infants only. Local antibiotic policy influenced the colonization patterns. Despite the fact that M strains of Klebsiella spp. were usually resistant to ampicillin as well as to cephalexin and cefuroxime, their local dissemination was associated with the use of ampicillin with or without gentamicin but not with the use of cefuroxime. It thus appeared that in the neonatal setting, ampicillin posed a greater risk of local spread of certain drug-resistant bacterial clones than a newer cephalosporin, such as cefuroxime.
TI  - Significance of bacterial flora in abdominal irradiation-induced inhibition of lung metastases.
AB  - We have previously reported that abdominal irradiation prior to i.v. injection of syngeneic tumor cells reduced metastases in lung. Our report described an investigation of the significance of intestinal organisms in the radiation effect. We found that eliminating intestinal organisms with antibiotics totally abolished the radiation effect. Monoassociation of germ-free mice revealed that the radiation effect was observable only for Enterobacter cloacae, never for Streptococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium adlesentis, or Escherichia coli. After abdominal irradiation of regular mice, E. cloacae multiplied in cecal contents, adhered to mucous membranes, invaded the cecal wall, and translocated to mesenteric lymph nodes. Intravenous administration of E. cloacae in place of abdominal irradiation inhibited metastases. E. cloacae-monoassociated mice developed fewer metastases than germ-free mice, and the reduction was further enhanced by abdominal irradiation. We concluded that abdominal irradiation caused the invasion of E. cloacae from the mucous membrane of the intestine and inhibited formation of lung metastases.
TI  - Pore formation by pho-controlled outer-membrane proteins of various Enterobacteriaceae in lipid bilayers.
AB  - The structural genes of the PhoE porins of Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli C, cloned in multicopy plasmids, were transfered into a porin-deficient E. coli K-12 strain, which was constitutive for the pho regulon, and the PhoE porins were isolated and purified. PhoE of Salmonella typhimurium could not be cloned but was isolated from a pho-constitutive strain. Reconstitution experiments with artificial lipid bilayer membranes showed that the different PhoE proteins formed pores exhibiting a single-channel conductance of about 200 pS at 0.1 M KCl. All PhoE porins formed anion-selective channels in KCl at neutral pH. The degree of the selectivity was dependent on the PhoE species. The different PhoE porins formed general diffusion pores similar to the general porins but exhibited a considerable advantage for the permeation of phosphate through the outer membrane as compared to the constitutive OmpC and OmpF porins of E. coli K-12.
TI  - In vitro activity of an oral iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, R-3746.
AB  - The in vitro activity of R-3746, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a CH2OCH3 moiety at position 3, was compared with those of other antibiotics. R-3746 inhibited the majority of hemolytic streptococci (groups A, B, C, F, and G) and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than 0.06 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of amoxicillin, 2- to 8-fold more active than cefixime, and 16- to 64-fold more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. Ninety percent of beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited at a concentration 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it was less active against Branhamella spp. It did not inhibit (MIC, greater than 16 micrograms/ml) enterococci, viridans group streptococci, or methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The MICs of R-3746 for 90% of strains tested for Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Citrobacter diversus; Proteus mirabilis; and Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia spp. were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. It was two- to eightfold less active than cefixime but was markedly superior to cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. R-3746 inhibited 50% of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella spp., Providencia spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas spp. were resistant. Fifty percent of Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but MICs for Bacteroides spp. were greater than 128 micrograms/ml. R-3746 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by most chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of E1040, a new cephalosporin with potent antipseudomonal activity.
AB  - E1040 is a new parenteral cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum and potent antipseudomonal activity. The compound was four- to eightfold more active than ceftazidime and cefsulodin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC of E1040 for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 3.13 micrograms/ml). E1040 also showed a potent activity against other glucose-nonfermentative rods, including Acinetobacter species. The activities of E1040 against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae were roughly comparable to the activities of ceftazidime and cefmenoxime and exceeded that of cefotiam. Against Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 0.78 micrograms/ml), Enterobacter cloacae (MIC90, 3.13 micrograms/ml), and Enterobacter aerogenes (MIC90, 0.2 micrograms/ml), E1040 was 16- to 256-fold more active than ceftazidime and cefmenoxime. The activities of E1040 against gram-positive cocci and anaerobes were comparable to those of ceftazidime, but the compound was less active than cefmenoxime. E1040 was at least as resistant as ceftazidime and cefmenoxime to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases and showed high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Activity of 9 beta-lactam antibiotics combined with clavulanic acid or sulbactam against the strains of broad-spectrum beta-lactamase (CTX-1) producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated at the Henri Mondor Hospital].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of seven cephalosporins: cefotaxime (CTX), ceftriaxone (CRO), ceftazidime (CAZ), latamoxef (MOX), cefoxitin (FOX), cefotetan (CTT) and CM 40876 (CM), of aztreonam (ATM) and imipenem (IPM) were evaluated by agar dilution with and without 5 mg/l of clavulanic acid (AC) or sulbactam (SB) for 28 strains isolated in 1986 (15 K. pneumoniae, 3. K. oxytoca, 4 E. coli, 4 E. cloacae, 1 E. aerogenes and 1 C. freundii). Comparatively to MICs of sensitive strains and to those of cured variants, MICs of these strains were very increased for CTX, CRO, ATM (mode MIC: 1 mg/l), and CAZ (2); weakly increased for MOX and CTT (0.25), and identical for IMP (0.12-0.25), CM (0.06) and FOX (2-4), except for Enterobacter and Citrobacter (64). Association with AC or SB did not modify MICs of FOX, CM and IMP. For the other antibiotics, MICs were reduced by addition of AC: Klebsiella: 5 log2 for CTX and CRO, 4 for CAZ and ATM, 2 for MOX and CTT; E. coli: 4 log2 for CTX and ATM, 3 for CRO and CAZ, 1 for MOX and CTT; Enterobacter and Citrobacter 2 log2 for CTX, CRO, CAZ and ATM, 1 for MOX and CTT. With SB, decrease of MICs was two to for fold lesser than with AC. AC, and less efficiently SB, restored activity of CTX, CRO, CAZ and ATM on CTX-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Klebsiella and E. coli. It was the same for MOX and CTT, weakly affected by this resistance. AC and SB had not effect on FOX, CM and IPM which remained active on these strains.
TI  - Lipid A precursor from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is completely acylated prior to addition of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate.
AB  - Inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) caused accumulation of a lipid A precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid A of mature LPS. The enzyme CTP:CMP-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (CMP-KDO synthetase) from P. aeruginosa is inhibited by the KDO analog alpha-C-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-D-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (I), and I is effectively delivered to P. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. Intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (I) which then inhibits activation of KDO by CMP-KDO synthetase causing accumulation of lipid A precursor and subsequent growth stasis. The major lipid A precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, C12:O, 2OH-C12:O and 3OH-C10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3OH-C12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. Analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (M - H)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid A from P. aeruginosa. In contrast, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid A precursors which only contained 3-OH-C14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. This difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid A are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Sequence and comparative analysis of three Enterobacter cloacae ampC beta-lactamase genes and their products.
AB  - The sequences of three Enterobacter cloacae ampC beta-lactamase genes have been determined. The deduced amino acid sequences are very similar: out of a total of 361 residues, only eight positions were found to be variable, and several mutations yielded residues with very similar properties. The kinetic properties of two of the enzymes were not significantly different. The three enzymes also exhibited a high degree of homology (greater than 70%) with the ampC beta-lactamases of Escherichia coli K12 and Citrobacter freundii, confirming the homogeneity of class-C beta-lactamases.
TI  - In vitro analytical system for determining the ability of antibiotics at residue  levels to select for resistance in bacteria.
AB  - An analytical procedure, based on the concept that exposure of bacteria to antibiotics will result in the selection of a resistant population, was developed. Two strains of enteric bacteria, Escherichia coli CS-1 and Enterobacter cloacae B520, which are sensitive to a wide variety of antibiotics, were used as the test organisms. E. coli CS-1 were exposed to 1.00 micrograms antibiotic or antimicrobial/mL; E. cloacae B520 were exposed to 0.01, 0.10, 0.50, 1.00, and 5.00 micrograms/mL. Both organisms developed increased resistance to other antibiotics after exposure to chlortetracycline and oxytetracycline, as measured by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). E. cloacae B520 showed increased resistance to ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and chloramphenicol after exposure to levels as low as 0.10 microgram/mL. Exposure to streptomycin, sulfamethazine, tylosin, bacitracin, flavomycin, virginiamycin, and monensin at levels of 1.00 microgram/mL did not increase the MIC. Exposure to 5.00 micrograms streptomycin, sulfamethazine, tylosin, and monensin/mL increased the MIC of E. cloacae to one of the antibiotic markers. These increased MICs exceeded the 95% confidence limits of the MIC values of the unexposed organisms.
TI  - Enoxacin: in-vitro and animal evaluation as a parenteral and oral agent against hospital bacterial isolates.
AB  - Enoxacin was evaluated in in-vitro tests and in studies of effectiveness and blood concentrations in the mouse. Enoxacin was active against both susceptible and multiresistant hospital isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococci. Less susceptible were streptococci and anaerobes. Of nine quinolones tested, only norfloxacin was equivalent in vitro. The MBCs of enoxacin were one- to twofold greater than the MICs, and enoxacin was rapidly bactericidal. No single-step resistant mutants could be detected at 10 mg/l against large inocula and six to 11 steps were required for selection of resistant clones. In systemic mouse infections, enoxacin was effective in a single oral or subcutaneous dose against one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia rettgeri and Ps. aeruginosa, and two Staphylococcus aureus strains. Single oral and subcutaneous enoxacin doses (50 mg/kg) gave peak mouse blood levels of 4.9 and 9.5 mg/l and an elimination half-life of 1.8 h.
TI  - The humoral defense system in tsetse: differences in response due to age, sex and antigen types.
AB  - Inoculation of live Escherichia coli into tsetse flies, Glossina morsitans morsitans, stimulated a higher antibacterial immune response in females than in males. It increased with age in females from emergence to approximately 2 weeks and thereafter declined. In males, there was also a significant decrease in immune response with aging. Inoculation of killed bacteria failed to stimulate antibacterial activity but stimulated a lysozyme response which was weaker than that stimulated by live bacteria. No antibacterial activity was present in the hemolymph of larvae from immunized pregnant tsetse. Inoculation of live Trypanosoma brucei brucei and T. congolense failed to induce production of antibacterial activity and lysozyme. Furthermore, tsetse inoculated with or naturally infected with T. b. brucei and T. congolense failed to show any evidence of immunosuppression when challenged with live E. coli. Various species of live bacteria stimulated different levels of antibacterial factors, with Enterobacter cloacae stimulating the highest level of antibacterial activity and E. coli the highest level of lysozyme. Saline in which certain species of bacteria and T. b. brucei were incubated inactivated tsetse immune hemolymph.
TI  - Tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  - Tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. At less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus spp., Providencia spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. At less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited Haemophilus spp., Neisseria spp., and Branhamella catarrhalis. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas spp. or Acinetobacter spp. Tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family Enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. Some Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. The MIC for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, and C and for Streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for 90% of enterococci, Listeria spp., Bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. Tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as TEM-1 and SHV-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Enterobacter, Morganella, Pseudomonas, and Bacteroides spp. Tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of E. cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. The growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the MICs and MBCs.
TI  - Cephalosporinase interactions and antimicrobial activity of BMY-28142, ceftazidime and cefotaxime.
AB  - Cephalosporinases of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were responsible for resistance to newer cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime but not BMY-28142. Interaction of these cephalosporins including hydrolysis, binding, inhibition, and inactivation with cephalosporinases from E. cloacae GN7471 and C. freundii GN7391 were studied. BMY-28142 was much more stable against the both enzymes than cephalothin, but more hydrolyzable than cefotaxime and ceftazidime at higher concentration such as 100 microM. Because of low affinity for the enzymes, i.e. large Km and Ki, the calculated hydrolysis rate of BMY-28142 at 0.1 microM was smaller than those of cefotaxime and ceftazidime, that explained the difference in activity against cephalosporinase-producing strains between BMY-28142 and cefotaxime or ceftazidime. The effects of cephalosporinase production on susceptibility of Escherichia coli omp mutants were examined using a plasmid having cephalosporinase gene of C. freundii GN346. Decrease in susceptibility of E. coli by cephalosporinase production was larger in the strain lacking outer membrane proteins (Omp) F and C, and smaller in the strain producing OmpF constitutively.
TI  - Comparable evaluation of orally active beta-lactam compounds in ampicillin-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative rods: role of beta-lactamases on resistance.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the recently developed cephems cefixime and cefetamet-pivoxyl was evaluated in 408 gram-positive and gram-negative rods, all isolated recently from clinical specimens, and compared to that of other orally active agents such as ampicillin, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime-axetil and to ceftriaxone. With regard to ampicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ceftriaxone proved to be the most active agent, followed by cefixime and cefetamet, whereas cefuroxime was less active. Cefaclor and amoxycillin + claculanic acid were active against ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus ssp. isolates. All beta-lactam compounds exhibited poor activity against Acinetobacter anitratus isolates, but were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae with the exception of cefaclor. Both cefixime and cefetamet were poorly active against Staphylococcus aureus, but highly active against beta-hemolytic streptococci. Moreover, both compounds remained unaffected by the production of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as the TEM or OXA enzymes. Resistance to both agents was observed in Enterobacteriaceae that produced large amounts of chromosomally mediated enzymes; their affinity to the class I enzyme from Enterobacter cloacae was somewhat lower than that of other third-generation cephalosporins. However, in contrast with these agents breakdown of cefixime and cefetamet by a class IIIa enzyme form Proteus vulgaris was marginal. In methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates there was a complete cross-resistance between all beta-lactam compounds included in this study.
TI  - Activity of cefixime (FK 027) for resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Cefixime is an orally absorbable cephalosporin with an extended spectrum of in vitro activity for gram-negative bacteria especially members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Gram-negative rod isolates collected over a three month period were tested against cefixime. Greater than 99% of Escherichia coli isolates was susceptible to cefixime including those resistant to ampicillin. Similarly isolates of Klebsiella, Proteus and Providencia were also exquisitely susceptible to cefixime as were 91% of Enterobacter cloacae and 71% of Enterobacter aerogenes. Killing kinetics of cefixime did not differ from that of the intravenously administered third-generation cephalosporin, cefotaxime. The addition of magnesium and calcium divalent cations or the lowering of the pH to 5.0 did not affect the action of this antibiotic. The extended spectrum of this oral antibiotic may be useful in treatment of urinary tract and skin and soft tissue infections caused by the more resistant gram-negative rods.
TI  - Time-kill studies and synergy testing of broad-spectrum antibiotics against blood culture isolates.
AB  - Time-kill studies and synergy testing were performed with blood culture isolates  from 80 patients with septicemia. Ten isolates each of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were included. The isolates were tested against netilmicin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime, alone and in different combinations. Cefotaxime was the most active agent against Enterobacteriaceae, whereas netilmicin was the most active agent against P. aeruginosa and staphylococci. The most active antibiotic combinations were netilmicin-cefotaxime and netilmicin-piperacillin, where a synergistic activity was observed in 68 and 61%, respectively. The highest synergistic activity was against Enterobacteriaceae, but the netilmicin-cefotaxime combination also acted synergistically against more than half of the S. aureus isolates. A relatively low synergistic activity was noted against P. aeruginosa. No case of antagonism was observed. Subinhibitory concentrations of netilmicin, in combination with a greater than or equal to MIC concentration of one of the tested beta-lactam antibiotics, significantly improved the killing of the isolates. Netilmicin exerted a more rapid and pronounced bacterial reduction than the beta-lactam antibiotics tested.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - In vitro activity of desacetylcefotaxime and the interaction with its parent compound, cefotaxime.
AB  - Antibacterial activities of cefotaxime and its major metabolite, desacetylcefotaxime, against 178 strains (of 10 species) were assessed in terms of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC50 and MIC80), and were compared with those of cefoperazone and ceftazidime. The activity of desacetylcefotaxime was several times less than that of cefotaxime against almost all of the species tested. Against Staphylococcus aureus, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC80 values of desacetylcefotaxime were higher than those of cefoperazone and ceftazidime. The antibacterial potency of desacetylcefotaxime against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas cepacia was superior to that of cefoperazone and ceftazidime, and comparable with the activities of the latter compounds against the other 4 Gram-negative species. Partial synergy was demonstrated in the activity of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against most of the strains examined. Antagonism was observed in activity against 2 of 18 strains of M. morganii. In general, desacetylcefotaxime enhances the potency of its parent compound, cefotaxime, when they coexist. Intravenous infusion of cefotaxime 1 g over a period of 1 hour resulted in mean peak serum concentrations of 48.5 mg/L of cefotaxime and 6.5 mg/L of desacetylcefotaxime at the end of the infusion. The mean elimination half-life in beta-phase of cefotaxime was 0.8 hour and that of desacetylcefotaxime was 2 hours.
TI  - A regional survey of the resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of (facultative) aerobic micro-organisms.
AB  - From 1980 to 1986 a regional survey was performed to investigate the susceptibility of beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 6 hospitals located in the southern part of the Netherlands. Each year 300 to 400 strains were tested. The susceptibility to representatives of the older and the newer beta-lactam antibiotics was determined by a microbroth dilution assay using an inoculum size of 10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml in ISO-Sensitest broth (Oxoid). No significant differences in antibiotic sensitivity of the micro-organisms from the different hospitals were found. There was no evidence for an increase in antibiotic resistance of the strains during the sampling period. In contrast, there was a general tendency to an increase in antibiotic sensitivity.
TI  - [The use of UV rays for the disinfection of water. I. Microbiologic studies of drinking water].
AB  - As a physical disinfection method without chemicals required the ultraviolet irradiation was tested for disinfection of drinking water. The survival was measured as a function of exposure to radiation for S. enteritidis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, E. coli, K. pneumoniae und S. faecium. The bacteria were grown in trypton soya broth until they were well into the exponential phase. Two different UV-disinfection units were tested. Both consist of cylindrical shaped chambers with one low-pressure mercury-discharge lamp with their longitudinal axis parallel to the chambers. With 10(6) cfu/ml the experiments were done with three different rates of flow of 7,2 m3/h, 4,0 m3/h and 2,0 m3/h. The minimum exposures to radiation necessary to cause a 99.999% reduction were 10-86 mWs/cm2 depending on the test bacterium and on the UV-disinfection unit. The minimum doses ranged for S. enteritidis up to 13 mWs/cm2, for E. coli up to 21 mWs/cm2, for K. pneumoniae up to 39 mWs/cm2, for S. faecium up to 42 mWs/cm2, for E. cloacae up to 43 mWs/cm2, for C. freundii up to 72 mWs/cm2, and for S. marcescens up to 86 mWs/cm2.
TI  - Sterility testing of home and inpatient parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  - The microbial contamination rate was compared for parenteral nutrition solutions  prepared by patients for home use and by pharmacy personnel for inpatient use. Phase I validated the Ivex 0.22-micron inline filter as a tool for microbiological testing by inoculating small numbers of organisms in 5% dextrose injection and testing for recovery. Phase II validated the same method for determining microbial contamination of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions. Phase III compared inpatient and home TPN microbial contamination rates using the methodology validated in phase II. Test organism inocula used in phase I and II were Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. All contaminated solutions in phase I showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. All phase II-contaminated TPN solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. One hundred postinfusion TPN samples were collected randomly during phase III from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. Six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. None of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient TPN samples developed visible turbidity. Subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. This described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.
TI  - Bacterial lysis of fibrin seal in vitro.
AB  - We performed an in vitro study to determine whether certain bacteria may lyse a commercially available fibrin seal (Beriplast, Behringwerke, Marburg, FRG). Fibrinogen solution was mixed with actively growing bacterial cultures, and thrombin was added. During 20 days of incubation at 37 degrees C complete lysis was observed with a number of different bacteria, however, at different rates. Complete lysis within 1-5 days was observed for the following species (number of strains in parentheses): Streptococcus faecalis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Serratia marcescens (2), and Serratia liquefaciens (1). Lysis was observed after 6-10 days for Enterobacter cloacae (2), Morganella morganii (2), Escherichia coli (2), S. marcescens (1), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2). Lysis after 11-16 days was observed for Streptococcus pyogenes (2), S. faecalis (2), and Staphylococcus aureus (2). Rapid lysis was associated with the ability of the strain to liquefy gelatin, i.e. the production of a protease.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1985). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The results of determinations of sensitivities of bacterial strains to various antibiotics are summarized as follows: 1. Against Escherichia coli, ofloxacin (OFLX) showed the strongest activity among oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents. Its MIC90 was below 0.10 micrograms/ml. The next strongest activity was found in mecillinam (MPC), cefaclor (CCL) and pipemidic acid (PPA); MIC90's of these agents 3.13 micrograms/ml. Cefotiam (CTM), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX) and latamoxef (LMOX) had MIC90 below 0.39 micrograms/ml. MIC90's of cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefoperazone (CPZ) were 1.56 micrograms/ml. Aztreonam (AZT) and carumonam (CRMN) in the monobactam group showed strong activities with MIC90's at 0.20 micrograms/ml. 2. Although Klebsiella pneumoniae had a strong resistance to ampicillin (ABPC) and showed relatively low sensitivities to other oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents, OFLX maintained high activity against this species and showed MIC90 of 0.39 micrograms/ml. Among injectable antibiotics, third generation cephems showed the strongest activity to this species with MIC90 of CZX below 0.10 micrograms/ml, of CTX and CMX 0.20 micrograms/ml, and of LMOX 0.78 micrograms/ml. MIC90 of CPZ was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was the same as those of cefazolin (CEZ) and cefoxitin (CFX). CTM had similar MIC90 to LMOX, namely, 1.56 micrograms/ml. MIC90 of CMZ was 3.13 micrograms/ml. Monobactams AZT and CRMN showed strong activities to this species; their MIC90's were below 0.10 micrograms/ml and 0.20 micrograms/ml. 3. Although Citrobacter freundii generally exhibited low sensitivities to antibacterial and antibiotic agents examined, it showed high sensitivity to OFLX, at MIC80 of 0.78 micrograms/ml. This species showed low sensitivities to MPC, nalidixic acid (NA), PPA, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST). Among injectable antibiotics, LMOX and CMX had activities against this species; namely, MIC80's were 6.25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. Among monobactams, AZT showed MIC80 of 12.5 micrograms/ml, and CRMN had that of 6.25 micrograms/ml. 4. Against Enterobacter cloacae, the strongest antibacterial activity was found with OFLX which had MIC90 of 0.39 micrograms/ml. A relatively strong activity was seen with MPC. MIC80 of MPC was 1.56 micrograms/ml. Except to CTM, this species had poor sensitivities to injectable first and second generation cephems, and their MIC80's were over 200 micrograms/ml. MIC80 of CTM was 25 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Detection of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria from female patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis].
AB  - A total of 122 bacterial strains isolated from urine specimens of 113 female patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis were used for the study of beta-lactamase production and their susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents was determined. Beta-Lactamase activity was qualitatively determined by a paper strip acidimetric method with benzylpenicillin as substrate and by chromogenic cephalosporin methods using pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline cephalosporin or nitrocefin as substrate. Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, including ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, cephalothin, gentamicin, minocycline, fosfomycin, pipemidic acid and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was examined by a disc method. The beta-lactamase-producing strains detected by at least one of the three tests were found in 18 of 105 Escherichia coli isolates and in the single strain of Enterobacter cloacae dermidis, 3 Enterococcus faecalis and 1 Staphylococcus aureus produced beta-lactamase. The isolation rate of strains resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin in the beta-lactamase-producing strains was significantly higher than that in the non-beta-lactamase-producing strains (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that beta-lactamase plays an important role in developing resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection as well as complicated infection.
TI  - Leakage of beta-lactamase: a second mechanism for antibiotic potentiation by amdinocillin.
AB  - Discrepancies were observed between results of different beta-lactamase induction tests with amdinocillin, which appeared to be a strong inducer in whole-cell assays but a weak inducer in assays with cell-free sonic extracts. Results of a nitrocephin-disk test with constitutive beta-lactamase producers indicated that the positive results obtained in whole-cell assays were due to drug-produced leakage of enzyme from the cell and not to induction. Imipenem was also found to cause leakage of beta-lactamase from a similar number of constitutive enzyme producers, while cefoxitin was much less likely to cause leakage. A split-dose regimen was employed to treat mice infected with a strain of Enterobacter cloacae which appeared to leak enzyme on exposure to amdinocillin. Results indicated that prior treatment with amdinocillin significantly enhanced (P less than 0.025) the efficacy of azlocillin, an enzyme-labile drug, but did not affect the efficacy of cefotaxime, a relatively enzyme-stable drug. Conversely, prior treatment with amdinocillin did not potentiate the efficacy of either azlocillin or cefotaxime in the treatment of mice infected with an Escherichia coli strain that was highly susceptible to all three drugs. Thus, it appears that amdinocillin may potentiate the activity of other beta-lactam drugs not only by binding to a complementary penicillin-binding protein but also by causing leakage of beta-lactamase from the cell. This effect may be related to its ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein 2 and subsequently produce changes in outer membrane permeability.
TI  - Non-IgE-dependent bacteria-induced histamine release from human lung and tonsillar mast cells.
AB  - A wide spectrum of formalin-killed bacteria have been tested for their ability to release histamine from human dispersed lung and tonsillar mast cells. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella oxytoca and K. pneumoniae were the most effective histamine releasers. Further studies on tonsillar mast cells showed that E. coli-induced histamine release differed from IgE-dependent release with respect to its kinetics, temperature and pH profiles and its sensitivity to calcium deprivation and metabolic inhibitors. A lectin-mediated mechanism may operate, but other non-immunological mechanisms might also be involved in the release. Escherichia coli and anti-IgE did not synergize in inducing histamine release. The production of PGD2 and the failure to detect lactate dehydrogenase following incubation of mast cells with E. coli suggests that histamine release is not due to cytotoxicity.
TI  - Coagglutination and enzyme capture tests for detection of Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and glutamate decarboxylase.
AB  - Polyclonal antibodies to Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and glutamate decarboxylase were used in coagglutination tests for identification of these three enzymes in cell lysates. Enzyme capture assays were also developed for the detection of E. coli beta-galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase. The enzymes were released by using a gentle lysis procedure that did not interfere with antibody-enzyme interactions. All three enzymes were detected in 93% (51 of 55) of the E. coli strains tested by coagglutination; two of the three enzymes were identified in the remaining 7%. Of 42 non-E. coli tested by coagglutination, only four nonspecifically agglutinated either two or three of the anti-enzyme conjugates. Thirty-two (76%) non-E. coli isolates were negative by coagglutination for all three enzymes. The enzyme capture assay detected the presence of beta-galactosidase in seven of eight and beta-glucuronidase in all eight strains of E. coli tested. Some strains of beta-galactosidase-positive Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were also positive by the enzyme capture assay, indicating that the antibodies were not entirely specific for E. coli beta-galactosidase; however, five other gas-positive non-E. coli isolates were negative by the enzyme capture assay. The coagglutination tests and enzyme capture assays were rapid and sensitive methods for the detection of E. coli beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and glutamate decarboxylase.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. Current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. Since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. The in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMTC) were investigated. Both DDTC and DMTC were effective against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). By agar diffusion, DDTC at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to 34 mm against MRSA. The DMTC produced slightly greater zone sizes against MRSA of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for DMTC against MRSA was 6 micrograms per ml. Both DDTC and DMTC were also effective against enterococci, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella species, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. The MICs of DMTC for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the MICs for Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. In addition, DMTC was synergistic with gentamicin against MRSA and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additive and synergistic effects of DMTC were displayed with gentamicin against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Inactivation of the ampD gene causes semiconstitutive overproduction of the inducible Citrobacter freundii beta-lactamase.
AB  - In Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae, synthesis of AmpC beta-lactamase is inducible by the addition of beta-lactams to the growth medium. Spontaneous mutants that constitutively overproduce the enzyme occur at a high frequency. When the C. freundii ampC beta-lactamase gene is cloned into Escherichia coli together with the regulatory gene ampR, beta-lactamase expression from the clone is inducible. Spontaneous cefotaxime-resistant mutants were selected from an E. coli strain carrying the cloned C. freundii ampC and ampR genes on a plasmid. Virtually all isolates had chromosomal mutations leading to semiconstitutive overproduction of beta-lactamase. The mutation ampD2 in one such mutant was caused by an IS1 insertion into the hitherto unknown ampD gene, located between nadC and aroP at minute 2.4 on the E. coli chromosome. The wild-type ampD allele cloned on a plasmid could fully trans-complement beta-lactamase-overproducing mutants of both E. coli and C. freundii, restoring the wild-type phenotype of highly inducible enzyme synthesis. This indicates that these E. coli and C. freundii mutants have their lesions in ampD. We hypothesize that induction of beta-lactamase synthesis is caused by blocking of the AmpD function by the beta-lactam inducer and that this leads directly or indirectly to an AmpR-mediated stimulation of ampC expression.
TI  - Use of intravenous ciprofloxacin in difficult-to-treat infections.
AB  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin was administered to 54 patients who were either critically ill or in whom oral administration was not possible. The 31 males and 23 females ranged in age from 20 to 89 years (mean, 53.2 +/- 17.8 years). Patients had "difficult-to-treat" infections, i.e., respiratory infections (15), abscesses (four intraabdominal, three lung, two soft tissue, and one intrahepatic), deep soft tissue infections (10), chronic post-traumatic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (nine), upper urinary tract infection (five), malignant external otitis (two), catheter-related bacteremia (two), and infectious endocarditis (one). Thirty patients (56 percent) had serious associated medical problems. Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (38 isolates), Acinetobacter species (10 isolates), Enterobacter cloacae (eight isolates), Escherichia coli (two isolates), Proteus mirabilis (one isolate), Kingella kingae (one isolate), Bacteroides fragilis (eight isolates), and Peptostreptococcus species (five isolates). Minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin ranged from 0.003 to 2 micrograms/ml. In 39 patients, the isolated microorganisms were multi-resistant; resistance included ceftazidime and amikacin in 32 patients. In 24 patients, ciprofloxacin was given exclusively by the intravenous route at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours; in 30 patients, treatment was completed after discontinuation of the parenteral drug with the oral preparation of ciprofloxacin at a dose of 750 mg every 12 hours. The duration of parenteral treatment ranged from six to 40 days (mean, 14.9 days). A successful clinical response was observed in 49 patients (91 percent), while five (9 percent) failed to show a response. Bacteriologic outcomes were as follows: eradication of pathogen in 33 patients (61.1 percent), persistence in 18 (33.3 percent), and relapse in three (5.6 percent), with development of resistance to ciprofloxacin in nine patients (16.7 percent) and superinfection in two patients (3.7 percent). Side effects included vein irritation at the site of the infusion (three patients), abnormal elevation in liver enzyme levels (two patients), reversible renal failure (one patient), and nausea (one patient). Parenteral ciprofloxacin is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective therapy for the critically ill patient, and can be replaced with the oral form when clinically appropriate.
TI  - A comparative study on the phoE genes of three enterobacterial species. Implications for structure-function relationships in a pore-forming protein of the outer membrane.
AB  - The cloned phoE genes from Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae are normally expressed and regulated in Escherichia coli K-12, and their products are correctly assembled into the outer membrane. Differences between the three PhoE proteins were found with binding of two out of ten monoclonal antibodies directed against the cell-surface-exposed part and in pore characteristics, but not in phage receptor function. The DNA sequences of the E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae phoE genes were determined and used to predict the primary structures of the encoded proteins. In the upstream non-coding regions, which showed more variations among the three genes than the coding regions, conserved sequences were identified which might be involved in regulation of phoE gene expression. Comparison of the predicted PhoE primary structures revealed a high degree of homology, with 81% of the amino acid residues being identical in all three proteins. Four small variable regions were found where differences are the most pronounced, corresponding to regions which were previously predicted to be exposed at the cell surface. Implications of the sequence comparison for structure-function relationships in PhoE protein are discussed.
TI  - Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, faecal coliforms and salmonellas in raw ewes' milk.
AB  - Thirty-nine samples of freshly drawn ewes' milk collected at 13 farms, and 120 samples of raw ewes' milk collected on arrival at a dairy were examined. Farm samples had geometric mean counts of 4.4 X 10(2) Enterobacteriaceae/ml, 3.9 X 10(2) coliforms/ml and 2.0 X 10(2) faecal coliforms/ml, whereas the respective mean counts were 6.2 X 10(3)/ml, 5.4 X 10(3)/ml and 1.3 X 10(3)/ml for dairy samples. Salmonellas were not detected by enrichment procedures in any of the 159 samples examined. Escherichia coli (47.5% strains), Enterobacter cloacae (17.7%), Ent. agglomerans (11.3%), Hafnia alvei (6.5%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (6.0%) were the predominant species in 434 Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from farm samples. Levels and species of Enterobacteriaceae found in the present work in raw ewes' milk imply a considerable risk of early blowing in cheese-making from unpasteurized milk.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new monobactam, B0-1165.
AB  - B0-1165 is a 1-carboxy-1-cyclopropoxyamino,4-fluoromethyl monobactam. It inhibited the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella and Shigella species at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml. Overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the MICs for individual isolates. Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime had MICs that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. B0-1165 had activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. Pseudomonas maltophilia and other Pseudomonas species were resistant or had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, as did Acinetobacter species. B0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as Clostridium and Bacteroides species. B0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally Richmond-Sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. It inhibited the Enterobacter cloacae P99 and inducible Pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. B0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing E. cloacae and C. freundii to B0-1165 selected for resistant isolates. Overall, B0-1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of other monobactams currently available or under investigation.
TI  - [Etiology of corneal ulcers with special reference to bacterial genesis].
AB  - The authors report on 134 patients (141 eyes) seen between May 1982 and December  1985 with corneal ulcers with or without hypopyon. Eight patients (11 eyes) had a facial palsy, 7 (7 eyes) a varicella zoster infection, 1 (2 eyes) a marginal ulcer ("furrow keratitis") associated with collagenosis, 29 (29 eyes) an ulcerative keratitis with endophthalmitis, 1 (2 eyes) a pemphigoid-associated ulcer and 90 (92 eyes) a herpetic infection. Pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated from 20 patients: 10 coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus (4 coinfections), 3 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 coinfection), 2 Proteus mirabilis (1 coinfection), 2 Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and beta-hemolyzing streptococci as well as enterococci in one case each, and non-hemolyzing streptococci and alpha-hemolyzing streptococci in two cases each as coinfections. A comparison of the range of bacterial strains of postoperative endophthalmitis and kerato-/conjunctivitis with bacterial corneal ulcers revealed a high percentage of gram-negative organisms in the latter. Laboratory work-up should include microscopy, agar plating and differentiation as well as antibiotic sensitivity testing and modern immunofluorescent direct techniques. Management includes bactericidal topical and systemic antibiotic regimens as well as surgical procedures if necessary, e.g., perforating tectonic and mini-keratoplasty, and conjunctival flapping followed by lamellar keratoplasty.
TI  - Molecular genetic analysis of cephalosporinase production and its role in beta-lactam resistance in clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Two strains of Enterobacter cloacae were isolated from a patient before (strain MHN1) and during (strain MHN2) treatment with moxalactam and gentamicin. Strain MHN1 exhibited inducible ampC cephalosporinase production. In contrast, strain MHN2 expressed the enzyme constitutively at a 3,000-fold higher level. With the Escherichia coli ampC gene as a hybridization probe it was shown that the genomic arrangement of the ampC region was the same in both strains. To gain more insight into regulatory phenomena, the ampC genes were cloned, and their expression was studied in E. coli K-12. The ampC gene from MHN1 behaved normally and conferred inducible beta-lactam resistance. A regulatory region of at least 800 base pairs involved in controlling repression-induction was located immediately upstream of ampC. Surprisingly, when present in E. coli the ampC gene from MHN2 no longer overproduced the cephalosporinase, and inducible expression was observed. This indicates that in MHN2 stable cephalosporinase overproduction is controlled by another factor which is not linked to the ampC gene.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of carumonam (Ro 17-2301/AMA-1080), a new monobactam, and ceftriaxone against aerobic or facultative gram-negative isolates.
AB  - Carumonam (Ro 17-2301/AMA-1080) is a new monobactam antibiotic. A comparative in  vitro evaluation with ceftriaxone was undertaken against 153 gram-negative clinical aerobic or facultative bacteria, both producers and nonproducers of beta-lactamase. Results indicated that carumonam had an enhancement of activity for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae and parallelled that of ceftriaxone against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp. and Serratia marcescens. It can be concluded that carumonam could be an alternative of interest for the treatment of patients with infections due to gram-negative strains presumably or proven to be multiresistant.
TI  - Worldwide study of cefoperazone susceptibility.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility to cefoperazone of more than one million clinical aerobic bacterial isolates was evaluated in 369 hospitals in Japan, the United States, Canada, France, Austria, and Hungary. Standard versions of the disk diffusion method were used according to interpretive criteria approved in the respective countries, and comparisons were made among the countries and among various body sites. Susceptibility of organisms varied little within most species among the countries. Minor differences in methodology and in interpretive criteria may explain some of the variations observed among countries and hospitals. The susceptibility of key pathogens to cefoperazone among countries ranged from 91% to 98% for Escherichia coli, 73% to 91% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% to 95% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 73% to 92% for Enterobacter cloacae, 74% to 92% for Staphylococcus aureus, and 91% to 97% for Proteus mirabilis. Susceptibility of isolates from the urinary tract did not vary markedly from that in other body sites.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerance of oral ofloxacin in treating various infections.
AB  - 66 patients were given daily doses of ofloxacin between 400 and 800 mg for 10 days to 6 months. They were suffering from exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (15), soft tissue phlegmon (11), complicated urinary tract infections (7), bronchopneumonia (7), chronic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (8), chronic prostatitis in exacerbation (5), lower urinary tract infections (3), chronic otitis media (3), acute otitis (3), acute bronchitis (1), lung abscess (2) or liver abscess (1). Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24), Haemophilus influenzae (16), Proteus mirabilis (6), Escherichia coli (6), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Providencia stuartii (2), Serratia marcescens (2), Citrobacter diversus (1), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter anitratus (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). In 35 patients (53%), several aggravating factors coexisted. MICs of ofloxacin ranged from less than or equal to 0.06 to 2 mg/L. Clinically, 65% of the patients were considered as cured, 17% improved and 18% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 62%, persisted in 16% and relapsed in 22%. Adverse reactions included gastrointestinal disturbances (4), rash plus facial oedema (1), abnormal liver function (2) and leucopenia (1).
TI  - In vitro evaluation of Ro 23-6240, a new fluorinated 4-quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of Ro 23-6240 was assessed and compared with  those of ciprofloxacin and beta-lactam antibiotics including several oral compounds against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (n = 130) and Pseudomonas spp. (n = 31). In general, Ro 23-6240 was 2 dilution steps less active than ciprofloxacin. For the Pseudomonas spp. the MICs for 90% inhibition were 2 and 0.5 mg/1 for Ro 23-6240 and ciprofloxacin, respectively. For the other species tested, the MIC90 values for Ro 23-6240 ranged from 0.031 to 1 mg/1 and for ciprofloxacin from 0.016 to 0.25 mg/1. Spontaneous Ro 23-6240-resistant mutants were only isolated from Enterobacter cloacae with a frequency similar to that of ciprofloxacin (4.8 X 10(-8) and 2.4 X 10(-8), respectively). No resistant mutants were isolated from Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of 4 and 8 times the MIC of Ro 23-6240 or ciprofloxacin (frequency less than 10(-9).
TI  - Inducible cephalosporinase production in clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae is controlled by a regulatory gene that has been deleted from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Cephalosporin hyper-resistant Enterobacter cloacae strains are isolated with increasing frequency from hospital infections. Resistance is principally due to the chromosomal ampC gene encoding a cephalosporinase. In contrast to Escherichia coli which expresses ampC constitutively from a promoter located in the upstream frdD gene, E. cloacae displays inducible ampC expression. By cloning the ampC gene it was shown that a linked genetic locus, ampR, mediated the induction by beta-lactams. In the absence of the antibiotic the 30,500 dalton AmpR protein represses ampC expression. The ampR gene shows a highly compact arrangement and is situated between the divergently expressed ampC gene and the frd operon from which it is separated by a bifunctional transcription terminator. The promoters for ampR and ampC substantially overlap and mRNA analyses showed that on induction transcription from the ampC promoter increased greatly whereas that from ampR did not. Two regions of sequence homology flank the ampR gene and it is proposed that a homologous recombination event between these in an ancestral enteric bacterium may have led to the deletion of ampR from the E. coli genome.
TI  - [Bactericidal effect of piperacillin alone and combined].
AB  - The bactericidal activity of piperacillin was evaluated by the kill rate kinetics method. Piperacillin compared with amoxicillin, amdinocillin, mezlocillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and latamoxef. Against E. coli, piperacillin and antibiotics electively bound to penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 3 had the same, mainly time-dependent, bactericidal activity. Antibiotics bound to PBP 1 and 2 mainly have a dose-dependent activity. The bactericidal activity of piperacillin against E. coli was enhanced when the drug was combined with amoxicillin and amdinocillin; in contrast, the kill rate remained unmodified when piperacillin was combined with latamoxef. When the piperacillin-amikacin combination was tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens, early synergism (5th hour), was weak, but after 24 hours piperacillin reduced the regrowth observed with the aminoglycoside, and synergism was much more pronounced irrespective of the species investigated.
TI  - The effect of the combination of erythromycin with new beta-lactam antibiotics against gram-negative aerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The effect of erythromycin on the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftazidime, cefmenoxime, aztreonam, imipenem, piperacillin, and gentamicin against 89 bacteria isolated from sputum and tracheal aspirates of patients admitted to intensive care units was evaluated. There were 30 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 27 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Enterobacter cloacae, 5 Escherichia coli, 4 Enterobacter aerogenes, 3 each of Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, 2 each of Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter anitratus; 1 Proteus mirabilis. All isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Organisms were screened for synergy by fixed erythromycin concentration at 1, 8 and 16 micrograms/ml. There were 16 isolates that showed a greater than four-fold difference in MICs. These strains were analyzed by the checkerboard broth method. No antagonism was seen for any drug combination with erythromycin. One Enterobacter cloacae showed synergy of ceftizoxime and erythromycin, and 1 E. cloacae showed synergy with cefotaxime. Addition was found for 2 P. aeruginosa, 1 each E. aerogenes, E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens. At concentrations of erythromycin achievable in blood or pulmonary tissue, the activity of newer beta-lactams and gentamicin is not altered by erythromycin.
TI  - Evaluation of a commercial beta-glucuronidase test for the rapid and economical identification of Escherichia coli.
AB  - A commercial beta-glucuronidase (beta-GUR) test for the rapid and economical identification of Escherichia coli was evaluated. A total of 762 clinical strains and 228 environmental isolates were studied. More than 95% of the E. coli strains were found to be beta-GUR positive. Thirty-one clinical isolates of Shigella sonnei, 10 of Enterobacter cloacae, eight of Enterobacter aerogenes, nine of Citrobacter freundii and one of Salmonella enteritidis also gave positive results. The enzyme beta-GUR was also detected in two environmental strains of E. cloacae and one C. freundii. A comparative study between the beta-GUR test and the conventional identification system was carried out in 233 consecutive isolates of lactose positive enterobacteria. Agreement was observed in 223 cases and 190 E. coli strains were correctly identified using this test. Discrepancies were found in 10 cases: nine E. coli were beta-GUR negative and one C. freundii was beta-GUR positive. Escherichia coli was the only species positive for both beta-GUR and indole tests. This procedure permits a rapid, easy, precise and inexpensive identification of E. coli. beta-GUR positive Enterobacter strains have not previously been described.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of imipenem on gram-positive and gram-negative micro-organisms.
AB  - The bactericidal effect (BE) of an antibiotic reduces the infective population, and its postantibiotic effect (PAE) assures a persistent inhibition of bacterial cells after a short exposure to the antimicrobial agent. Both effects prevent the early regrowth of the infecting organisms when the antibiotic tissue levels decrease to below the MIC value. The BE and the PAE of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, gentamicin and ampicillin on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were investigated with viable counts and continuous impedance monitoring of broth cultures. Imipenem and gentamicin gave similar high BE and PAE values at low concentrations and with short drug exposures in most strains tested. PAE is low or non-existent for Gram-negative strains with other beta-lactam antibiotics. These results suggest the possibility of future clinical studies with new experimental dosage schedules for imipenem.
TI  - Beta-lactamase stability of imipenem.
AB  - The beta-lactamase stability and interactions of imipenem were analysed in comparison with those of cefazolin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, mezlocillin, piperacillin and penicillin G for a set of representative beta-lactamases. These enzymes included penicillinases such as those obtained from Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae (TEM-1 and similar enzymes) (group A); cephalosporinases produced by Esch. coli (Amp C type), Serratia liquefaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (group B); and beta-lactamases produced by Klebsiella spp., Proteus vulgaris and Bacteroides fragilis and with a high hydrolytic activity for the newer cephalosporins (group C). Enzymes of group A were demonstrated to be highly active against penicillins and also against the early cephalosporins; enzymes of group B showed hydrolytic activity for all other tested compounds, including the newer cephalosporins and cephamycins, but not imipenem, whereas enzymes of group C were highly active against the new cephalosporins but not against cephamycins and imipenem. In conclusion, imipenem shows a moderate affinity for all these enzymes but no detectable hydrolysis.
TI  - Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin against nosocomial infections and multiresistant pathogens.
AB  - Thirty-five patients suffering from soft tissue infections (12), upper UTIs (6),  bronchopneumonia (6), septicaemia (2), chronic osteomyelitis (2), intra-abdominal abscess (2), liver abscess (1), lung abscess (1), acute cholangitis (1), thoracic empyema (1) and chronic prostatitis (1) were given imipenem/cilastatin for 6-21 days. In 22 patients several aggravating factors coexisted, while infection in 16 patients was polymicrobial. The following pathogens were implicated: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21), Escherichia coli (15), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Proteus spp. (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae(3), Citrobacter freundii (1), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter spp. (4), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Bacteroides fragilis (1) and Peptococcus saccharolyticus (1) with MICs to imipenem ranging between 0.5 and 8 mg/l. A successful clinical response was observed in 91.4% of the patients, while pathogens were eradicated in 75.9%, persisted in 24.2% and recurred, in 9.1% of patients, with development of resistance to imipenem in two Ps. aeruginosa strains. Against 150 multiresistant strains of Ps. aeruginosa, 40% of which were resistant to amikacin, 86.4% and 88.9% were found sensitive to ceftazidime and imipenem respectively. It is concluded that imipenem provides the possibility of treating successfully multiresistant and polymicrobial infections with a single antimicrobial.
TI  - [Bacterial infection agents in hospitalized patients].
AB  - During six months the pattern of microbial isolates has been analysed from 1492 urinary tract infections, from 1445 wound infections, from 451 bronchial secretions, from 3067 blood cultures, from 116 peritoneal swabs and from 39 cerebrospinal fluids. All the specimens investigated were taken from patients of surgical, neurosurgical, internal wards and two intensive care units. In total, the most frequent isolates were grampositive microorganisms like Staphylococus aureus, Straphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus sp. of different serotypes. Out of the Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli and Klebisella pneumoniae predominated followed by Enterobacter cloacae and indolnegative and -positive Proteus species. The over all isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in nosocomial infections was about 10%. In the last time Pseudomonas maltophilia will be isolated more frequently as well as occasional Streptococcus faecium and Corynebacterium JK. Dependent from the site of infection anaerobic bacteria like Bacteroides sp., Peptococcus- and Peptostreptococcus sp. are really important in the infectious diseases. The epidemiological data should be always transmitted to the infection control board. From there preventive measures must be induced.
TI  - The effects on beta-lactam susceptibility of phenotypic induction and genotypic derepression of beta-lactamase synthesis.
AB  - We have compared the ability of beta-lactam antibiotics to induce beta-lactamase  synthesis and antagonize the in-vitro activity of other beta-lactams and also to select mutants with derepressed beta-lactamase synthesis amongst representative Gram-negative bacilli that produce inducible beta-lactamases. Both imipenem and cefoxitin were potent inducers of beta-lactamase and were able to antagonize the activity of other beta-lactams against isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when the two beta-lactams were present simultaneously. However, there was no antagonism for any compound against any of the organisms when the imipenem or cefoxitin was removed immediately before susceptibility to the other compounds was measured. Cefotaxime was a less potent inducer of beta-lactamase and failed to antagonize the activity of other compounds, even when present concurrently with them. Neither imipenem nor cefoxitin induced beta-lactamase synthesis in a strain of Escherichia coli, nor did they antagonize the activity of other beta-lactams against this strain. Imipenem was compared with cefotaxime and cefoxitin as an agent for the selection of beta-lactam-resistant variants. Resistant variants were obtained from isolates of Ent. cloacae, C. freundii and P. aeruginosa when cefotaxime or cefoxitin was used as the selective agent. Most of them synthesized beta-lactamase constitutively and showed reduced susceptibility to a wide range of beta-lactams, but not to imipenem. Variants with reduced susceptibility to imipenem were obtained only from the two isolates of P. aeruginosa. They did not show cross resistance to other beta-lactams and were not distinguishable from the parent strains in beta-lactamase production.
TI  - Beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome (HR 810), a new cephalosporin with a broad  antimicrobial spectrum.
AB  - Cefpirome was highly stable to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases, although it was hydrolyzed to some extent by R plasmid-mediated penicillinase of Richmond-Sykes type Va/b and by chromosomal cephalosporinases from Bacteroides species. The compound had a very low affinity for cephalosporinases from Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus vulgaris. Cefpirome showed strong antimicrobial activity against eight beta-lactamase (cephalosporinase)-producing strains which have become resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins; especially against E. cloacae and C. freundii, it had the highest activity among the cephalosporins used. Its activity against ampicillin-resistant R plasmid-containing transconjugant isolates of Escherichia coli was as high as that against the recipient strain E. coli chi 1037. The inducer activity of cefpirome in S. marcescens and P. vulgaris increased dose dependently, whereas cephamycin derivatives showed high inducer activity at low concentrations. A relatively low affinity of cefpirome for beta-lactamases is considered to be one of the reasons for its high antimicrobial activity against such enzyme-producing strains. In addition, other factors such as good penetration through the outer membrane and affinity for the target sites may also be involved in the high activity of cefpirome.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-S.
AB  - 6315-S, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. It inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-S did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Enterobacter cloacae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter species were resistant (MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml). MICs for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-S was highly active against anaerobic species of Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-S was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  - 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozanae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. maltophila, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, Lancefield group A, B and D streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and Bacillus species. In vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 819 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. Ninety-seven percent strains of P. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. All the 161 isolates of S. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. All gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of S. epidermidis and 5% isolates of S. agalactiae.
TI  - Phenotypic characteristics of coliform and noncoliform bacteria from a public water supply compared with regional and national clinical species.
AB  - During the summer and fall of 1984, elevated total coliform counts were observed  in the distribution system of a public water supply serving 350,000 people in south central Connecticut. As part of an investigation of possible health risks associated with the presence of bacteria in the water supply, bacterial isolates from the distribution system were compared with bacterial isolates of the same species obtained from a large regional teaching hospital and from a national compendium of clinical isolates. Characteristics analyzed included phenotypic metabolic activity, antimicrobial susceptibilities to clinically utilized antibiotics, temperature tolerance at 44.5 degrees C, and beta-glucuronidase activity in single-test form and on a selective medium. Environmental isolates lacked known plasmid-mediated characteristics, with the exception of one Escherichia coli isolate which showed some antibiotic resistance. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterobacter agglomerans from all sources were temperature tolerant and yielded positive fecal coliform tests. Only E. coli showed beta-glucuronidase activity (both in a single biochemical test and on a selective medium). No single characteristic analyzed was sufficient to establish an organism as either environmental or clinical in origin.
TI  - 7 alpha-formylamino substituent confers beta-lactamase-inactivating potency on 1-oxacephalosporins.
AB  - 7 alpha-Formylamino-1-oxacephalosporins 7 alpha-formylamino-7 beta-[2- (methylaminocarbonyl)amino-2-(2-thienyl)acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H -tetra zol-5-yl)thiomethyl]-1-oxa-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (F1) and 7 alpha-formylamino-7 beta-(2-[(4-ethyl-2,3-dioxopiperazine-1- yl)carbonylamino]-2-phenylacetamido)-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetr azol-5-yl) thiomethyl]-1-oxa-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (F2) were stable against penicillinases and, moreover, inactivated cephalosporinases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae. Extensive studies of the inactivation of cephalosporinase of P. aeruginosa showed that it resulted from the formation of a transiently stable enzyme-compound complex. The 7 alpha-formylamino substituent was involved in the enzyme inactivation, because 7 alpha-methoxy congeners did not inactivate the enzyme. The number of compound molecules required for inhibition of an enzyme molecule was found to be 36 for F1 and 5.5 for F2, which suggests that the pathway to the complex formation branched off the hydrolysis pathway. Half-lives of the complexes were 400 min for F1 and 260 min for F2. 7 alpha-Formylamino compounds F1 and F2 had antibacterial activities similar to those of 7 alpha-methoxy congeners against beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria, whereas they were less active against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The conclusion was that the 7 alpha-formylamino substituent conferred the ability to inactivate cephalosporinase on the 1-oxacephalosporins tested, without much impairment of their antibacterial activity.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074).
AB  - Ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. They did not inhibit S. faecalis, S. faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Citrobacter diversus, and Aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. A marked inoculum effect was noted for Enterobacteriaceae carrying the Richmond-Sykes type 1A chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. Both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. cloacae, P99.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of ceftazidime in the treatment of neonatal infections].
AB  - Ceftazidime (CAZ) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 newborns. Four  confirmed cases of bacterial infections were cured by the CAZ therapy (efficacy rate 100%). The CAZ was assessed as effective in sepsis (2) and urinary tract infections (2). Main pathogens which responded to CAZ were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter anitratum. As adverse effects, elevations of GOT and GPT (1 case) were found to be associated with the CAZ therapy. Half-lives of the serum levels in mature infants were 1.93-3.52 hours, and those in low birth weight infants were 2.92-4.17 hours. Penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid in 1 case of viral meningitis was satisfactory. The data suggest that CAZ is a safe and effective injectable antibiotic when used in newborn with infection caused by CAZ-susceptible bacteria.
TI  - Novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae from Ohio.
AB  - Epidemiologic studies of plasmid-mediated resistance at the Cleveland Veterans Administration Medical Center revealed that related plasmids had disseminated among members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. We studied the beta-lactamases encoded by these plasmids in Escherichia coli C600 transformants or transconjugants. Substrate and inhibition profiles of the enzymes determined by two of these plasmids suggested an activity resembling TEM-1; however, isoelectric focusing revealed a pI of 7.0. These two plasmids were originally found in a Serratia marcescens (pDS076) and an Enterobacter cloacae (pDS075) strain isolated from the same sink in the medical intensive care unit and later, in an Enterobacter cloacae (pDS142 identical to pDS076) isolate colonizing a patient in the same unit. The plasmids also carried the aminoglycoside resistance determinant, 2"-aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferase. A 2-kilobase AvaI restriction endonuclease digestion fragment of pSD075 known to carry the beta-lactamase determinant was used as a molecular probe. This probe did not recognize sequences of any plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase tested including the recently described determinants ROB-1, TLE-1, and OXA-4-7. A TEM-1 probe derived from the 0.7-kilobase PstI-EcoRI fragment of pBR322 failed to recognize the new beta-lactamase gene. Four additional Enterobacter cloacae and two Enterobacter aerogenes strains isolated in Columbus, Ohio, have been shown to produce a pI 7.0 beta-lactamase and to carry plasmids recognized by the 2-kilobase probe. These data suggest dissemination of a novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase among members of the family Enterobacteriaceae in Ohio and demonstrate the development and utility of a molecular probe for the new determinant. We suggest that the novel beta-lactamase be named OHIO-1.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in a general medicine department. Comments on cases collected over 3 years].
AB  - Urinary infections often complicate the clinical course of hospitalised patients  especially those with immunological diseases or under antibiotic treatment for other infectious pathologies. Urethral catheterisation is also a well known cause of such infections. The problem of urinary infections was examined in a general medical division. Over a three year period (1982-84), 384 urinary tract infections (UTI) with one infecting organism and 21 UTI with two bacterial species in urine cultures were found. UTI was more often found to be caused by gram negative than gram positive bacilli in both catheterised and non-catheterised patients and E. Coli accounted for most infections. Pseudomonas, Serratia and Acinetobacter were only found in catheterised patients and Enterobacter cloacae almost exclusively so. Among gram-positive bacilli, Enterococcus was the most common. Staphylococcus aureus was rare but created major pathogenetic and therapeutic problems. The results are discussed with particular reference to the high incidence of Escherichia coli and the significance of the different distribution of Pseudomonas, Serratia, Acinetobacter and Enterobacter cloacae between catheterised and non-catheterised patients. Finally the pathogenic and therapeutic problems of UTI caused by more than one germ are considered.
TI  - [Enterotoxigenic capacity of strains of Klebsiella and Enterobacter genera isolated in acute intestinal diseases in children].
AB  - 234 strains, including 104 K. pneumoniae strains, 28 K. oxytoxica strains, 64 E.  cloacae strains and 40 E. aerogenes strains, have been isolated from the intestine of 266 children with diarrhea, aged up to 1 year, and studied for enterotoxigenicity. By the coagglutination test, made with G. Kronvall's staphylococcal reagent prepared with the use of antiserum to Escherichia coli LT-enterotoxin, and the biological assay on suckling mice enterotoxigenic activity has been revealed in 119 strains, including 48 K. pneumoniae strains (12.6%), 33 E. cloacae strains (27.4%) and 23 E. aerogenes strains (19.7%). The strains producing only LT-enterotoxins, only ST-enterotoxins, and both LT- and ST-enterotoxins have been found. The determination of the enterotoxigenic activity of the clinical isolates of opportunistic enterobacteria makes it possible to improve the etiological interpretation of acute intestinal infections.
TI  - Dissemination of a gentamicin resistance plasmid in the microbial population of hospital patients.
AB  - The dissemination of a gentamicin resistant plasmid, originally found in strains  of Klebsiella and termed pk181, into the microbial population of patients of the Orvieto Hospital was studied during 1982. Five hundred and seventy-four strains of Gram-negative bacilli were examined, transferable gentamicin resistance being revealed in five different bacterial species. The resistance was shown to be encoded by 81-megadalton plasmids in Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae, and by 93-megadalton plasmids in Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas spp. Restriction endonuclease digestion of plasmid DNA showed that the fragment patterns of the 81-megadalton plasmids from E. coli and enterobacter cloacae were identical to one another and to the pattern of plasmid pk181. The fragment patterns of the 93-megadalton plasmids from Serratia and Pseudomonas, on the contrary, differed substantially from those of the 81-megadalton plasmids.
TI  - Combination therapy: a way to limit emergence of resistance?
AB  - The ability of antibiotic combinations to limit the emergence of resistance during therapy was evaluated in a murine model. Peritonitis was produced by injecting a mixture containing 10(8) colony-forming units of bacteria and sterilized talcum into the peritoneum. Two hours later, a single antibiotic dose was administered subcutaneously. The next day, peritoneal bacterial populations were analyzed on Szybalski's gradients. Acquired resistance was recorded when there was at least a fourfold increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations compared with untreated animals. No resistance emerged after amikacin monotherapy (15 mg/kg); however, resistance was frequently observed after monotherapy with ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg) or pefloxacin (25 mg/kg). Resistance to ceftriaxone and pefloxacin emerged, respectively, in 15 percent and 83 percent of animals with Klebsiella pneumoniae, 71 percent and 54 percent with Enterobacter cloacae, 0 percent and 83 percent with Serratia marcescens, 25 percent and 100 percent with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 0 percent with both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In mice with K. pneumoniae or E. cloacae infections, any dual combination of amikacin, pefloxacin, and ceftriaxone produced less acquired resistance than did monotherapy. In these animals, the combination of ceftriaxone and pefloxacin abolished all resistance, whereas the combinations of amikacin plus ceftriaxone or amikacin plus pefloxacin reduced the frequency of resistance by more than half. In animals with P. aeruginosa or S. marcescens infections, resistance to pefloxacin diminished or disappeared after treatment with the combinations of pefloxacin plus ceftriaxone or pefloxacin plus amikacin. However, combinations with ceftriaxone resulted in more frequent resistance to ceftriaxone than did ceftriaxone alone. This was the case in P. aeruginosa infections treated with ceftriaxone plus amikacin (p less than 0.01), and in S. marcescens infections treated with ceftriaxone plus pefloxacin (p less than 0.05). Despite these certain notable exceptions, our data confirm that in most cases combination therapy does limit the emergence of resistance.
TI  - Qualitative and quantitative aspects of beta-lactamase production as mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in a survey of clinical isolates from faecal samples.
AB  - A study has been conducted to identify the beta-lactamases most likely to contribute to beta-lactam resistance in clinical populations and to investigate their interactions with cefuroxime and newer cephalosporins. A total of 217 ampicillin-resistant, Gram-negative isolates from faecal samples of healthy volunteers in Germany, South America and Amman were investigated. Such strains represent the 'gene pool' from which infections might arise. Escherichia coli was the prevalent species (59.9%) followed by Klebsiella spp. (20.3%) and Enterobacter cloacae (12.0%). At least 56.7% and possibly as high as 64.5% of strains owed their principal beta-lactamase activity to enzymes mediated by R-plasmids. The most prevalent R-plasmid mediated beta-lactamase was TEM-1 which was produced by 109 strains. The beta-lactamase activity of strains producing only a chromosomal enzyme was often markedly higher than that of strains also producing an R-plasmid mediated enzyme. The qualitative and quantitative aspects of beta-lactamase production were investigated in cell free and whole cell tests and this confirmed the superior broad spectrum beta-lactamase resistance of ceftazidime over other new cephalosporins.
TI  - Sequence of the Citrobacter freundii OS60 chromosomal ampC beta-lactamase gene.
AB  - The Citrobacter freundii OS60 ampC beta-lactamase gene was sequenced and found to encode a 380-amino-acid-long precursor with a 19-residue signal peptide. The mature protein has a predicted molecular mass of 39781 Da. The first 60 residues of the purified enzyme, as determined by sequential Edman degradation, are identical to the amino acid sequence inferred from the gene sequence. Also, the amino acid composition determined for the purified beta-lactamase and that given by the gene sequence are in good agreement. 77% of the amino acid positions hold identical residues in the C. freundii and Escherichia coli K12 chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases. This clearly puts the C. freundii enzyme into the class C of beta-lactamases. Of the 68 amino-terminal residues determined for the Enterobacter cloacae P99 beta-lactamase, 44 are identical to the corresponding residues of the C. freundii enzyme. All three enzymes, as well as that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 18S/H are highly similar around the active-site serine at position 64 of the mature protein.
TI  - In vitro activity of CI-934, a new quinolone, compared with that of other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone, was determined against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The MICs for 90% of the isolates tested were 0.25 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.5 microgram/ml for Streptococcus faecalis, 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains, and less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella spp., Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., and Citrobacter spp. CI-934 had activity superior to that of other quinolones against streptococci by four- to eightfold. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, ciprofloxacin was 2- to 18-fold more active; ofloxacin and norfloxacin were twofold more active or similar to CI-934. CI-934 inhibited ampicillin-cephalothin-resistant urinary isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis and cefoxatime-resistant Acinetobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii. The medium, inoculum size, and oxygen concentration, as well as the addition of serum, had not major effect on the activity of CI-934. Magnesium at a concentration of 9 mM increased MICs and MBCs four- to eightfold, and testing at pH 6 increased MICs as much as 32- to 64-fold for some organisms in comparison with MICs at pH 7. The frequency of spontaneous mutation to resistance was comparable to that for other new quinolones, but resistant isolates could be selected by repeated subculture.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid was investigated against 285 freshly isolated clinical strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by the agar-dilution technique on Mueller-Hinton-agar. Clavulanic acid had an excellent or moderate potentiating effect on the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin against staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter spp., Acinetobacter, Haemophilus influenzae and Bacteroides spp. No effect was seen against enterococci, indole-positive Proteus spp., Ent. cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The effect of clavulanic acid was dose- and inoculum-dependent.
TI  - Affinity of cephalosporins for beta-lactamases as a factor in antibacterial efficacy.
AB  - Strains of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae that were resistant to ceftazidime (MIC greater than 16 micrograms/ml) but susceptible to BMY 28142 (MIC less than 4 micrograms/ml) were found to contain higher levels of beta-lactamase activity (50- to 3,340-fold) than control strains of the corresponding species. Ceftazidime was at least as resistant as BMY 28142 to hydrolysis by these enzymes. However, the apparent Ki of BMY 28142 for each enzyme was larger (8- to greater than 20-fold) than that of ceftazidime; i.e., the affinity of these enzymes for BMY 28142 appeared to be lower than that for ceftazidime. Thus, BMY 28142 was affected less than ceftazidime by a mechanism of resistance that depends, at least in part, on the relative affinities of cephalosporins for the beta-lactamases of these species. These results indicate that the affinity between a beta-lactamase and a cephalosporin may be a distinguishing factor in the evaluation of beta-lactamase-resistant cephalosporins and suggest that affinity can play a major role in susceptibility to highly beta-lactamase-resistant cephalosporins.
TI  - Transfer of amikacin resistance by closely related plasmids in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated in Chile.
AB  - During a 9-month period when amikacin was the sole aminoglycoside used clinically in a hospital in Santiago, Chile, resistance to amikacin and other antibiotics was encountered in 42 strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Serratia liquefaciens. Amikacin resistance was transferable by conjugation and carried by IncM plasmids ranging in size from ca. 48.4 to 58.1 kilobase pairs. The plasmids had ca. 70 to 80% of their structure in common, as judged after digestion with restriction endonucleases. The resistance was mediated by a 6' aminoglycoside acetyltransferase. We conclude that selective pressure has favored the dissemination of a wide-host-range amikacin resistance plasmid and its derivatives.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of chromosomally encoded cephalosporinase gene of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - The cephalosporinase gene, cpa, which codes for an inducible class I chromosomal  beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae was cloned on a fragment of 6.05 kilobase pairs inserted into plasmid pACYC184 and transferred into Escherichia coli HB101 recipient cells. The constructed hybrid plasmid, designated pGGQ101, carried a genomic fragment which retained its parental inducibility characteristics, although its expression level in transformed E. coli cells fell to 40-65% of its initial level in E. cloacae. The localization of the cpa gene on pGGQ101 plasmid was determined by Bal31 exonuclease deletion mapping and further confirmed by subcloning HindIII-AvaI restriction fragment on pMB9 plasmid vector. Labeling with [35S]methionine of pGGQ101 specified proteins in a minicell system showed that six or seven proteins are encoded by the insert. Two proteins with apparent molecular mass of 42 000 and 39 500 daltons, respectively, most probably represent the premature and mature cephalosporinase forms.
TI  - Studies on microbial quality of filtered water in households of a university community in Nigeria.
AB  - Water samples from home filters in nine residential areas of a Nigerian university community were studied. The membrane filter technique was used to determine the total coliform and faecal coliform counts/100 ml of water. Most of the 100 samples studied were grossly contaminated with total coliform counts/100 ml ranging from 0-442, faecal coliform counts/100 ml, 0-216 and the total aerobic plate count per millilitre ranged from 3.0 X 10(3) to 1.9 X 10(9) c.f.u. The source (dams) of water, fitness of filter candles, frequency of cleaning candles and pH of water did not significantly (P greater than 0.05; chi2) affect the microbial quality of either filtered boiled or unboiled tap water. Escherichia coli type I was isolated from 17.9% of the faecal coliforms tested but from only 2.3% of total coliforms. Enterobacter aerogenes was most predominant (38.5%) amongst faecal coliforms isolated while Enterobacter cloacae was the most frequent (37.2%) of the total coliform isolates. The gross contamination of filtered water from all households sampled calls for an enlightenment of residents on the proper use of home water filters.
TI  - In vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. The strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli (314), Enterobacter aerogenes (30), E. agglomerans (7), E. cloacae, (39), Citrobacter diversus (9), C. freundii (13), Hafnia alvei (3), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), K. ozaenae (5), K. pneumoniae (107), Morganella morganii (3), Moraxella sp. (10), Pasteurella multocida (1), Proteus mirabilis (66), P. vulgaris (4), Providencia rettgeri (12), P. stuartii (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), P. fluorescens (2), P. maltophila (7), Salmonella sp. (1) and Serratia marcescens (17). In vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. Over 99% of E. coli and Enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. All the 118 strains of Klebsiella, 87 strains of Proteus-Providencia and 17 strains of S. marcescens were also susceptible. Aztreonam also showed good activity against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. A comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (Escherichia coli, indole + Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (Klebsiella pneumoniae). Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 100 Staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). It was markedly less active against Streptococcus faecalis and Str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the MIC90 being 4 mg/l against both species. Overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus. Against E. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. A paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. An optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in blood of patients treated with this drug.
TI  - In vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. Of all strains tested, only three (1 Acinetobacter sp. and 2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin resistant. Ciprofloxacin was more active against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter sp., Proteus sp., Shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. It was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against P. aeruginosa. It was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. It was as active as cefotaxime against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC's). Ciprofloxacin's MIC was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced by anaerobic conditions. Decrease of the medium pH increased the MIC substantially. Ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. These favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.
TI  - Emergence of resistance after therapy with antibiotics used alone or combined in  a murine model.
AB  - A murine model of peritonitis allowing detection and quantification of in-vivo acquired resistance during short term therapy has been used in order to evaluate the capacity of antimicrobial combinations to limit emergence of resistance, as compared to individual components of the regimens. Mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 10(8) cfu of bacteria. Two hours later, a single antibiotic dose was injected subcutaneously: amikacin (15 mg/kg), ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg), pefloxacin (25 mg/kg), amikacin + ceftriaxone, amikacin + pefloxacin or ceftriaxone + pefloxacin. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus never became resistant. Single drug therapy yielded resistant mutants in Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as follows: 74% of ceftriaxone-treated animals, 57% of pefloxacin treated animals and 27% of amikacin treated animals. All the tested combinations reduced the frequency of in-vivo acquired resistance produced by single drugs, and no combination selected resistance when the separate agents of the combination did not. Combining antimicrobial agents limits the risk of emergence of resistance during antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Defence reactions of Glossina morsitans morsitans against different species of bacteria and Trypanosoma brucei brucei.
AB  - Tsetse flies, Glossina morsitans morsitans, fed on rats infected with Trypanosoma brucei brucei showed wide fluctuations in total and differential haemocyte counts. Similar fluctuations occurred in controls fed on non-infected rats and also between the two groups without showing any difference which could be attributed to the infection. Trypanosome infection of the tsetse haemocoel occurred in 16.25% of the flies, starting from the second day after feeding on the infected rats, but salivary glands and proboscis became infected only after the eleventh day. About 2% of bloodstream forms of T. b. brucei injected into tsetse haemocoels completed their developmental cycle successfully. Injection of tsetse homogenates into teneral G. m. morsitans prior to exposure to trypanosome-infected feed increased T. b. brucei infections in the flies significantly. Injection of live Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus into tsetse induced a remarkable increase in two pre-existing haemolymph proteins with molecular weights of about 70 and 17 kilodaltons, while live Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus induced a very weak response or sometimes none at all. T. b. brucei also failed to induce any increase in these proteins. Inoculation of G. m. morsitans with live E. coli und T. b. brucei prior to feeding on trypanosome-infected rats had no effect on the salivary gland and proboscis infection rates by T. b. brucei. Injection of live T. b. brucei into the haemocoels of tsetse caused no change in total haemocyte counts, but the trypanosomes disappeared from the haemolymph so rapidly that by 48 h post-injection, only about 1% were left.
TI  - Head-space gas-liquid chromatographic analysis for presumptive identification of  bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  - A total of 445 strains of common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were analyzed for their volatile microbial metabolites by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. The bacteria were incubated for 24 or 48 h in blood-containing Trypticase soy or Lombard-Dowell glucose broth before being analyzed by automatic head-space injection. From the chromatographic pattern obtained, the majority of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes could be characterized. The head-space technique developed provides a rapid, direct and easily-performed means for presumptive identification of bacteria found in blood culture.
TI  - [Molecular genetic analysis of the determinant of gentamicin resistance in Enterobacter cloned from a clinical strain].
AB  - Resistance of clinical strains of Enterobacteriaceae to aminoglycoside antibiotics and in particular to gentamicin was studied. The data on conjugation and plasmid DNA transformation of a clinical strain 10171 of E. cloacae, as well as the data on P1 transduction showed that its gentamicin resistance was due to plasmids. The gentamicin resistance determinant was cloned from the plasmid DNA with the use of the restriction sites of EcoR I, Hind III and Pst I into the vector plasmid pUC 19. Plasmids pAA1, pAA2, pAA3 and pAA4 carrying the gmr determinant were isolated. Their physical maps were constructed. The restriction analysis supplemented by the data on DNA-DNA hybridization was indicative of the identical 2.0 kb sequences in all the plasmids carrying the gmr determinant.
TI  - Opportunistic infections in hysterectomy-derived, barrier-maintained guinea pigs.
AB  - Guineapigs were rederived by hysterectomy and associated with a colonization-resistant enteric microflora (CRF) of mouse origin to establish a strict barrier-maintained breeding colony. Infections were suspected in 55 of 209 animals autopsied. From 65 of 67 tissue samples selected for bacteriological examination 167 isolates, belonging to 16 usually non-pathogenic bacterial species or groups, were isolated mostly from cases of mastitis, typhlitis, enteritis, otitis media and pneumonia. Faecal streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Citrobacter spp., C. freundii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterobacter cloacae accounted for 86.8% of all isolates. Variations in the recovery rate of these 8 species during the study and a gradual decline in the incidence of infections were observed. Elimination by rederivation of the autochthonous bacterial flora seemed to have predisposed to opportunistic infections by aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. Enteric colonization resistance to the growth of these bacteria was presumably insufficiently provided by the CRF of mouse origin and might be remedied by using a flora of guineapig origin.
TI  - Protective activity of habekacin and four other aminoglycosides in mouse septicaemia caused by Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The in vivo efficacy of habekacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic obtained by chemical derivation from dibekacin, was compared to that of gentamicin (GEN), tobramycin (TOB), kanamycin (KAN) and amikacin (AMI) in a protection test in mice. The 50% effective dose (ED50) was determined in groups of animals challenged with bacterial suspensions injected intraperitoneally together with mucin, and treated subcutaneously 1 h and 6 h later. The bacterial strains used were: Escherichia coli (three GEN sensitive strains and one GEN-KAN-TOB resistant strain), Enterobacter cloacae (one GEN-KAN resistant strain), Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella pneumoniae (one GEN sensitive strain and one GEN resistant strain). In this model, habekacin was found to be as active as GEN against GEN sensitive strains and more active than AMI on GEN, GEN-KAN and GEN-KAN-TOB resistant strains.
TI  - Impact of azlocillin on the colon microflora.
AB  - To evaluate the impact of parenteral azlocillin therapy on human colon microflora, faecal specimens were taken from 6 patients before, during and after therapy for analysis of the microflora. In 2 patients major changes took place. Thus the numbers of streptococci, Escherichia coli, anaerobic cocci, lactobacilli, clostridia and bacteroides decreased markedly during therapy. One of these patients was colonized with azlocillin-resistant Enterobacter cloacae. The other 4 patients had only minor changes in the microflora. Variations between patients seem to exist. Pronounced alterations in the colonic flora may have clinical implications.
TI  - Chromosomal beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteria.
AB  - Most enterobacterial species carry a chromosomal ampC beta-lactamase gene. In Escherichia coli and Shigella, expression from ampC is non-inducible and the beta-lactamase is synthesized at low levels. Mutations leading to increased beta-lactamase synthesis occur rather infrequently, making resistance to modern cephalosporins a rare event in these species. In other enterobacteria and Pseudomonas, ampC beta-lactamase synthesis is induced by beta-lactams. In Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and probably also in other species with inducible beta-lactamase expression, ampC is regulated by at least two genes, ampR and ampD. Mutations affecting ampR abolish beta-lactamase inducibility, and mutants devoid of ampR, produce ampC beta-lactamase at low constitutive levels. Mutations in ampD lead to constitutive overproduction of inducible beta-lactamase if an intact ampR protein is present in the cell. The latter type of mutations occur at a high frequency and result in clinical resistance to several third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin: a comparative evaluation of its bactericidal activity in human serum against four enterobacterial species.
AB  - Serum bactericidal titres following a 200 mg i.v. dose of ciprofloxacin were measured in healthy volunteers and compared with those achieved with standard doses of ceftazidime, piperacillin and gentamicin, given alone or in combination. Five strains of each of four enterobacterial species were included in the study. Bactericidal titres 1 h after infusion of ciprofloxacin exceeded 1:16 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter cloacae. While ceftazidime produced higher peak bactericidal titres against the Enterobacteriaceae, piperacillin was less effective than ciprofloxacin against three of the four enterobacterial species tested. Among the combinations, only piperacillin/gentamicin showed synergistic activity against some strains. Studies of bacterial killing kinetics again confirmed the high bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin for the Enterobacteriaceae. The combination of ciprofloxacin with gentamicin resulted in more rapid killing of some strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris.
TI  - Ferric ammonium citrate decomposition--a taxonomic tool for gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The iron uptake test of Szabo and Vandra has been modified and used for the differentiation of Gram-negative bacteria. Nutrient agar containing 20 g per litre of ferric ammonium citrate was distributed into narrow tubes and solidified so as to form butts and slants. Considering the localization of the rusty-brown coloration produced after seeding and incubation, 2367 strains were classified into four groups. (1) Unchanged medium: Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., Hafnia alvei and Morganella morganii 100% each, Klebsiella spp., 50%, Enterobacter cloacae 37%, Proteus vulgaris 59%, Acinetobacter spp. 42%, Pseudomonas fluorescens 19%, some other bacteria 2-12%. (2) Rusty-brown slant, unchanged butt: Salmonella subgenera II, III and IV 98%, Citrobacter freundii 65%, E. cloacae 55%, P. vulgaris 41%, Proteus mirabilis 98%, Providencia rettgeri 100%, urease-negative Providencia 96%, Acinetobacter spp. 58%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 100%, P. fluorescens 81%, UFP (unclassified fluorescent pseudomonads) 100%, other Pseudomonas spp. 55%. (3) Unchanged slant, brown butt: S. typhi 88%, Salmonella subgenus I 3%, Klebsiella spp. 31%, some other bacteria 2-3%. (4) Rusty-brown slant, brown butt: Salmonella subgenus I 75%, C. freundii 20%, Klebsiella spp. 12%, some other bacteria 1-5%. Colour reactions in ferric ammonium citrate agar are associated with the accumulation of ferric hydroxide: bacteria giving positive reactions on the slant took up as an average, 63 times more iron than those with negative test. The localization of colour reaction correlated partly with aerobic and anaerobic citrate utilization or decomposition in Simmons' minimal and in Kauffmann's peptone water medium.
TI  - pH-dependent bactericidal barrier to gram-negative aerobes: its relevance to airway colonisation and prophylaxis of acid aspiration and stress ulcer syndromes--study in vitro.
AB  - pH-Dependent bactericidal activity on four gram-negative bacilli that are mainly  responsible for gastric to airway colonisation has been investigated. Organisms studied were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens. At pH of the medium adjusted to 2.7 or lower all four organisms were killed in 1.5 h. At pH 3.1 or greater, no reduction in viable bacterial number was noted over 2 h. Even when pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.8, no increase in bacterial count was observed in 4 h. Relevance of these findings in relation to airway colonisation and prophylaxis of acid aspiration and stress ulcer syndromes is discussed. It is suggested to maintain pH of the gastric contents above 4.0 by H2 antagonists and prevent growth of gram-negative organisms in the stomach by keeping it empty.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships amongst beta-lactamase inhibitors.
AB  - Using a variety of beta-lactamases including those from Escherichia coli (TEM-1), Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Staphylococcus aureus the inhibition profiles (I50 values) were determined for various groups of compounds including penicillins, penicillanic acid derivatives (sulphone and beta-halo substitutions), olivanic acids and clavulanic acid derivatives including substituted ethers and amines. Some of the latter compounds had higher activity than clavulanic acid with and without preincubation of enzyme with inhibitor but they still had poor activity against the P99 enzyme. Improvements in activity against Class I cephalosporinases were obtained with some derivatives of clavulanic acid but this was usually achieved at the expense of activity against clavulanate susceptible beta-lactamases. The olivanic acids had the highest activity against the widest range of beta-lactamases.
TI  - The humoral antibacterial response of Drosophila adults.
AB  - Hemolymph from a normal adult Drosophila melanogaster lacks factors that block the growth of Escherichia coli, but hemolymph from a fly previously inoculated with Enterobacter cloacae inhibits bacterial growth. Antibacterial activity appears within two hours after inoculation, and is still detectable sixty days later. Activity is potent, and can be detected in as little as a quarter of the hemolymph from a single inoculated male fly. After inoculation, at least eight new polypeptides not of bacterial origin appear in hemolymph with a time course similar to the appearance of antibacterial activity; these are called Antibacterial Response Polypeptides, or ARs. The most prominent polypeptides are AR24, AR22, and AR19 with molecular weights of about 24, 22, and 19 kilodaltons (kd). Other bands with as much as 75 kd and as little as 5 kd were also found. Electrophoresis of active hemolymph under non-denaturing conditions, and isoelectric focusing separate several protein species that block bacterial growth (Antibacterial Proteins, or ABs); one AB is neutral (AB7.1) and three are basic (AB8.7, AB9.0 and AB9.2). Two dimensional gels show that AR24, AR22 and AR19 have pIs identical to the basic antibacterial proteins. Radiolabelling experiments proved that the ARs were synthesized de novo after bacterial inoculation. ARs in six species of Drosophila showed fundamentally similar electrophoretic patterns.
TI  - In vitro studies of the synergism of piperacillin and netilmicin against blood culture isolates.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro synergism between piperacillin and netilmicin against microorganisms isolated from Danish patients with septicemia and to examine the influence of inactivation of piperacillin among these bacteria on the synergy results. A total of 132 stains was examined: Escherichia coli 20, indole-positive Proteus 17, Klebsiella pneumoniae 18, Enterobacter cloacae 20, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 20, Staphylococcus aureus 20, and coagulase-negative staphylococci 17. Synergy testing was performed by checkerboard titration in microtiter trays. The ability of the strains to inactivate piperacillin was examined by the clover-leaf test. Synergism was found for 52% of the strains and partial synergism for 32%. Antagonism was not found. Of the piperacillin-resistant strains synergism could be demonstrated in 80% compared with 33% of the piperacillin-susceptible strains (p less than 0.001). No significant correlation was seen between the results of the synergy test and the results of the susceptibility test to netilmicin. The frequency of piperacillin inactivation according to the clover-leaf test was significantly higher among the strains with synergism than among all the others (p less than 0.02). The combination of piperacillin and netilmicin gave good results concerning the in vitro synergism. This synergism was probably sometimes caused by netilmicin disturbing the bacterial production of piperacillin-inactivating proteins.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to the synergistic bactericidal action of serum and polymyxin B nonapeptide.
AB  - Polymyxin B nonapeptide was able to sensitize Escherichia coli strains and strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae to the bactericidal action of fresh normal human serum. The degree of sensitization varied significantly within the strains. Strains of Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and N. meningitidis remained resistant.
TI  - The activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  - The activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. Ninety percent of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Salmonella, and Shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. Concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit Serratia marcescens and Providencia species, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae had MICs greater than 25 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most Enterobacteriaceae. Cefbuperazone did not inhibit Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas species. Hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis with MIC90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the P99 E. cloacae beta-lactamase with an I50 of 1 microgram/ml. It was a less effective inhibitor of the K. oxytoca K1 and E. coli TEM-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. Cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa and resistant E. cloacae. A permeability barrier in E. cloacae, C. freundii and P. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of cefbuperazone's activity by EDTA.
TI  - [Therapeutic efficacies of suppository of ceftizoxime against experimental infections in mice].
AB  - In experimental infections in mice, the therapeutic efficacies of rectal administration of ceftizoxime (CZX) were compared with those of subcutaneous administration. The efficacies of rectal administration were equivalent to those of subcutaneous administration against intraperitoneal infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii and Serratia marcescens, the efficacies of rectal administration were inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Against urinary tract and respiratory tract infections, the efficacies of rectal administration were slightly inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Serum concentrations of CZX for rectal administration were less than those of subcutaneous administration.
TI  - Selective detection and enumeration of fecal coliforms in water by potentiometric measurement of lipoic acid reduction.
AB  - Water samples of various origins were inoculated into a specific coliform-selective lactose broth provided with lipoic (thioctic) acid, and the time evolution of the redox potential of the cultures was monitored during incubation at 41 degrees C by use of gold versus reference electrodes. Positive potential-time responses, i.e., 100-mV potential shifts recorded within 20 h of inoculation, were related to the initial number of fecal coliforms in the broth determined by control enumeration techniques, and the organisms responsible were isolated and identified by conventional procedures. A total of 30 samples of wastewater, 38 of surface water, 553 of groundwater, and 110 of drinking water were tested successively. A total of 240 natural water samples, including 172 groundwater samples, and 1 drinking water sample were found to be positive in the potentiometric test. The majority (i.e., 92.5%) of the relevant potentiometric detection times were shorter than 15 h, and 96% of these could be attributed to Escherichia coli. Fifteen hours corresponded to the limit for detecting 1 E. coli cell per 100 ml of water. About 78% of the potentiometric responses occurring after 15 h were induced by fecal coliforms other than E. coli (Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Citrobacter freundii). Calibration curves relating detection times shorter than 15 h to fecal coliform (i.e., E. coli) concentrations were constructed for the natural water samples tested. There were minor variations in the average growth rate of the organisms in the relation to the contamination level of the water tested. The number of false-positive samples in the potentiometric test was equivalent to that of false-negative samples (groundwater or drinking water).
TI  - The pharmacokinetic and bactericidal characteristics of oral cefixime.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of cefixime (FK 027), a broad-spectrum cephalosporin, were assessed in 12 normal subjects after single oral doses of 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg. Mean peak serum concentrations were 1.02, 1.46, 2.63, and 3.85 micrograms/ml after the four respective doses. Respective mean serum levels at 12 hours were 0.16, 0.33, 0.72, and 1.13 micrograms/ml. Volumes of distribution averaged 0.1 L/kg body weight, and the elimination t1/2 was 3 hours for all doses. The AUC was 7.01, 11.4, 22.5, and 36.4 micrograms X hr/ml for the four doses, respectively. Serum clearance averaged 0.4 mg/min/kg and mean 24-hour urinary recovery was 21%, 19%, 20%, and 16% for the four respective doses. Serum bactericidal titers at 4 hours exceeded 1:16 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Hemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. Urine bactericidal titers exceeded 1:8 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae resistant to the available oral cephalosporins.
TI  - Population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime (CTX) in eight species of Enterobacteriaceae was carried out. One strain of each species was examined. The strains represented their individual species as regards natural susceptibility to ampicillin (A) and carbenicillin (Ca). Cephalothinase activity of the parental strains and strains selected on the plates with the highest concentration that allowed growth was determined by an ultraviolet assay. The populations of the A-susceptible/Ca-susceptible (A-s/Ca-s) species, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were homogeneous as regards susceptibility to CTX. The A-resistant/Ca-resistant (A-r/Ca-r) species, Klebsiella oxytoca and Citrobacter koseri, were less homogeneous, but in all four mentioned species no increase in cephalothinase activity was observed between the parental strains and the strains selected in the population analysis. The four A-r/Ca-s species, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii, were heterogeneous. The frequency of CTX-r mutants was approx. 10(-6.5). The IC50 for CTX was 2(7.5)-2(8.5) times higher for the mutants than for the parental strains. The CTX resistance was maintained in subcultures of the strains. All four species had a very high increase in cephalothinase activity from parental strains to the strains selected in the population analysis. Only the enzyme of Proteus vulgaris was able to hydrolyze CTX.
TI  - In vitro activities of the quinolone antimicrobial agents A-56619 and A-56620.
AB  - The in vitro activities of two new quinolone antimicrobial agents, A-56619 and A-56620, were compared with those of norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and other antimicrobial agents. The activity of A-56620 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Aeromonas hydrophila (MICs for 90% of the strains were less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml); Acinetobacter anitratus and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC for 90% of the strains was 0.5 micrograms/ml); and most streptococci. Against other gram-negative strains, A-56620 demonstrated activity comparable to that of norfloxacin, but the new drug was two to eight times more active than norfloxacin against gram-positive isolates. A-56620 was more active than A-56619 against most gram-negative organisms tested. Of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae examined, 88% were inhibited by A-56619 and 99% by A-56620 at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. By time-kill methods, the new quinolones were bactericidal against gram-negative bacilli during the first 6 h of incubation, but against S. aureus and enterococci the drugs were primarily bacteriostatic during this period. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to 10 micrograms of these drugs per ml was less than 10(-8) for all species tested except E. cloacae, but by serial passage through incremental concentrations of the antimicrobial agents, colonies many-fold more resistant than the initial isolate could be selected. However, resistance to concentrations of the drug greater than 100 micrograms/ml remained stable after passage on antibiotic-free media in only 1 of 35 strains tested.
TI  - Transferable resistance to 2nd and 3rd generation cephalosporins in a strain of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  
TI  - [Carbenicillin resistance of gram-negative bacteria: incidence, biochemical and genetic determinism].
AB  - Of nine hundred ampicillin resistant (Amp-R) enterobacteria strains, isolated in  hospital between July and December 1981, 73,7% are also carbenicillin-resistant (Carb-R). This particular double resistance varies depending upon the species considered: indole positive Proteus (23%), Enterobacter cloacae (64%), Citrobacter freundii (67%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (73%), Proteus mirabilis (75%), Serratia marcescens (90%), Escherichia coli (91%), Providencia stuartii (96%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (100%). The biochemical and genetic basis of resistance to beta-lactamines was studied in 27 strains belonging to these 9 species. A constitutive beta-lactamase was found in all the strains. These enzymes were identified by determination of the isoelectric point on crude sonic extracts, the enzymic activity profile, the inhibition by clavulanic acid and cloxacillin of enzyme activity. Two types of enzymes were predominant: TEM-1 (20 strains) and TEM-2 (7 strains); two strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae produced both SHV-1 and TEM-1. The transfer by conjugation to E. coli K12 of ampicillin and carbenicillin resistance was obtained with 14 strains: (E. coli: 9, C. freundii: 1, K. pneumoniae: 1, E. cloacae: 2, P. stuartii: 1). In all strains but one E. coli we noted the co-transfer of other antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Molecular analysis of multiple-resistance plasmids transferred from gram-negative bacteria isolated in a urological unit.
AB  - Forty-one isolates of multiply resistant gram-negative bacteria causing infection in a urological unit of a Dublin hospital were collected during a 6-month period. Twenty-one isolates transferred multiple resistance to an Escherichia coli K-12 recipient in liquid matings. Serratia marcescens, Proteus morganii, Proteus vulgaris, and E. coli isolates harbored similar 120-megadalton IncC plasmids, whereas Enterobacter cloacae strains transferred a 160-megadalton plasmid of a different Inc group. Southern hybridization experiments were performed with purified fragments cloned from one IncC plasmid as probes. They were hybridized to plasmid sequences in total cellular DNA extracts, showing that the IncC plasmids were very closely related. This suggests that the same plasmid has transferred to different bacterial species in the hospital environment.
TI  - Cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  - Sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. Plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. Values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. In a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. Plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. The data were unsuitable for determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. Ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. All strains of Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of Actinobacillus suis were highly susceptible to the drug (MIC less than 4 micrograms/ml). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (MIC 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be highly resistant to cefadroxil (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Growth of bacteria in enteral feeding solutions.
AB  - Solutions of Clinifeed ISO, Triosorbon, Vivonex Standard (full- and half-strength) and Vivonex HN were experimentally contaminated with two strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella aerogenes, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae at concentrations of 10(2)-10(3) organisms/ml. Samples were incubated at 4, 25 or 37 degrees C and viable counts were made at 0, 4, 8 and 24 h. No increase in numbers of any of the organisms was observed in any of the feeds during 24 h at 4 degrees C. All organisms multiplied rapidly in Clinifeed ISO and in Triosorbon at 25 and 37 degrees C. There was less rapid growth in half-strength Vivonex Standard at 25 degrees C, although at 37 degrees C all strains multiplied rapidly except for the two S. aureus strains, the growth of which was inhibited in half-strength Vivonex Standard at both 25 and 37 degrees C. In full-strength Vivonex Standard at 25 degrees C, only P. aeruginosa showed any increase in numbers during 24 h, whereas P. aeruginosa, K. aerogenes and E. cloacae all multiplied at 37 degrees C. None of the test organisms multiplied in full strength Vivonex HN at any of the temperatures studied. The results of the study show that bacteria survive and may multiply even in feeds with low pH and high osmolarity, and emphasise the importance of strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feeds.
TI  - Influence of imipenem on the serum resistance of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Following growth in a subinhibitory concentration of imipenem and additional incubation in a 20% dilution of normal human serum (NHS) for 90 minutes, five of 12 serum-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae showed a decrease in colony-forming units of two or more logs of growth compared with the control. Two strains (of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes) showed this phenomenon even with incubation in 5% NHS. Treatment with imipenem did not change the serum resistance of the other seven strains (two strains each of Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Serratia marcescens, and one strain of Proteus morganii). The phenomenon of induced serum susceptibility is dose dependent and reversible. Other beta-lactam antibiotics either caused only a slight decrease of resistance (cefsulodin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefodizime-HR221) or did not influence the serum resistance at all (cefotaxime, mecillinam). Killing of the induced serum-sensitive strains appeared to be antibody dependent.
TI  - In vitro comparative antimicrobial activity of cefpimizole against clinical isolates from five medical centers.
AB  - Cefpimizole was compared with cefoperazone and cefotaxime against 6,599 clinical  bacterial isolates from five medical centers. Cefoperazone and cefotaxime were both more active and provided a greater spectrum of antimicrobial coverage than cefpimizole. Some of the cefpimizole minimum concentrations inhibiting 50% of tested strains were as follows: Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae, 16 micrograms/ml; Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.0 micrograms/ml; Proteus mirabilis, 1.0 microgram/ml; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus spp., 32 micrograms/ml; and the enterococci, greater than 32 micrograms/ml.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination in severe infections in adults].
AB  - Timentin (ticarcillin (TCR) + clavulanic acid (AC)) was given for severe bacterial infections to sixteen hospitalized patients (10 male and 6 female; 16 to 75 years of age; normal renal function in 12). Infections included 8 septicemias (of which 4 were secondary to pyelonephritis), 6 pyelonephritis (in addition to the four above-mentioned cases), and 3 suppurated cellulitis of the lower limbs (with septicemia in one case). The following bacteria were recovered: 10 Escherichia coli, 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Providencia stuartii, 1 Salmonella typhi, 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 Staphylococcus aureus. The sixteen strains were all susceptible to timentin (MICs determined by agar dilution: TCR + AC 4 mg/l: 0.5-16 mg/l; TCR + AC 8 mg/l: 0.2-16 mg/l). Thirteen strains were susceptible to TCR (MIC less than or equal to 16 mg/l), and three (1 E. coli, 1 K. pneumoniae, and 1 S. aureus) were resistant to TCR (MIC greater than or equal to 256 mg/l). 14 patients received timentin alone, while two were also given dibekacin. Timentin was given in one-hour IV infusions in a dosage of 9.6 g/24 h (3.2 g X 3) in 10 patients and 6.4 g/24 h (3.2 g X 2) in 6. Duration of therapy was 14 to 16 days in half of cases (range 5 to 21 days). At termination of the infusion, serum concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (determined in ten patients) were greater than 50 mg/l and 3-7.4 mg/l respectively, and serum bactericidal activity (evaluated in ten cases) was consistently less than 1/2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - beta-Lactamase susceptibility and comparative activity of Sch 34343 and other beta-lactams for non-fermenters, Neisseria spp. and beta-lactamase-positive Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - By means of a micro-dilution technique (10(5) cfu/cup) 30 strains of Pseudomonas  spp. were found resistant to Sch 34343. The susceptibility of Acinetobacter spp. (20 strains) was greatest for imipenem, followed by Sch 34343 (MIC approximately 0.7 mg/l), ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. Ten Moraxella strains were very susceptible to Sch 34343, imipenem and ceftazidime. For 35 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (ten beta-lactamase-positive) and ten strains of N. meningitidis we noted no resistance to Sch 34343 (MIC 0.015-0.06 mg/l), or to any of the other drugs tested. Sixty-two strains of Enterobacteriaceae producing various beta-lactamases were tested for their sensitivity to Sch 34343 and seven other beta-lactams. To an even greater extent than imipenem and Sch 34343, latamoxef and ceftazidime proved very active against all these strains. A PSE-4-producing Escherichia coli strain was resistant to Sch 34343. The inoculum effect (10(6) vs 10(4) cfu/ml) on Sch 34343 activity was usually small (1-4). Tests for the beta-lactamase susceptibility of Sch 34343 showed that only one PSE-3, one PSE-4 and one chromosomal beta-lactamase from a strain of Enterobacter cloacae were slightly active.
TI  - Sch 34343: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the penem Sch 34343 was assessed in comparison with third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and imipenem. Sch 34343 was active, with MICs generally 2 mg/1 or less, against a broad spectrum of organisms amongst which were staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), streptococci (though enterococci were less susceptible with Sch 34343 MICs mostly 4-8 mg/1), anaerobes (including the Bacteroides fragilis group), Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It was also active against the Enterobacteriaceae though Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia spp. were somewhat less susceptible than other members of this group. Sch 34343 lacked useful activity against most species of Pseudomonas (including Ps. aeruginosa) but was active against Ps. acidovorans and some isolates of Ps. cepacia. Sch 34343 showed a high degree of resistance to plasmid-determined and most chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases; however, it was hydrolysed rapidly by enzymes from some isolates of Aeromonas hydrophila and more slowly by enzymes from Ps. maltophilia and Bact. melaninogenicus subspecies intermedius. We did not observe any reduction in sensitivity to Sch 34343 for most beta-lactamase-producing organisms, including strains of Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii that were resistant to most other beta-lactams.
TI  - Sch 34343 activity against streptococci and beta-lactam-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Sch 34343 was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, latamoxef (moxalactam), aztreonam and ampicillin. Against pneumococci, Sch 34343 was as active as ampicillin, whereas against the other streptococci it was less active than ampicillin but significantly better than the other antibiotics against enterococci. With clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to cefotaxime, Sch 34343 had MICs generally less than 2 mg/l. After introduction of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases into Escherichia coli Cla. there were no significant changes in the MICs of Sch 34343. Mutants of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii with derepressed cephalosporinases had susceptibilities equal to or less than 1 mg/l, which were generally lower than those of the other compounds tested. Comparison of parental strains and permeability mutants of E. coli, Ent. cloacae, and Serratia marcescens showed that the increase in MICs of Sch 34343 were lower than those found for the other antibiotics.
TI  - The beta-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae P99. Chemical properties, N-terminal sequence and interaction with 6 beta-halogenopenicillanates.
AB  - The beta-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae P99 consists of one polypeptide chain  of Mr 39000 devoid of disulphide bridges and free thiol groups. It contains an unusually high proportion of tyrosine and tryptophan. The N-terminal sequence exhibits overlaps with the tryptic peptide obtained after labelling the active site with 6 beta-iodopenicillanate. The active-site serine residue is at position 64. The homology with the chromosomal beta-lactamase of Escherichia coli K 12 (ampC gene) is lower within the 25 residues of the N-terminal portion than around the active-site serine residue. The P99 beta-lactamase is inactivated by 6 beta-bromo- and 6 beta-iodo-penicillanate, with a second-order rate constant of 110-140M-1 X s-1 at 30 degrees C and pH 7.0, a value that is much lower than that observed with class-A beta-lactamases.
TI  - Construction and comparison of recombinant plasmids encoding type 1 fimbriae of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The genes encoding type 1 fimbriae of Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens were cloned in Escherichia coli. All transformants possessing recombinant plasmids were shown to be fimbriate and demonstrated mannose-sensitive hemagglutinating activity. A comparison of the physical maps of these plasmids revealed little similarity among them, although plasmids encoding type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae appeared similar with respect to restriction enzyme sites. The fimbrial gene cluster ranged in size from 5.5 to 9.0 kilobase pairs as determined by transposon mutagenesis. Plasmid-containing E. coli strains were shown to produce species-specific fimbrial antigens with little or no cross-reactivity between genera. Therefore, it was presumed that each plasmid contained the gene encoding the fimbrial subunit. Complementation was not detected between nonfimbriate insertion mutants of different species but was seen with mutants of the same species.
TI  - Aztreonam in the therapy of nosocomial infections in patients with impaired host  defenses.
AB  - A clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with  aztreonam in hospital-acquired infections. Twenty patients (13 men and 7 women) with impaired host defenses and nosocomial infections were treated with aztreonam at a dosage ranging 4 and 6 g/day I.V. at 8 or 12-hour intervals. Average length of therapy was 10.35 +/- 4.61 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Escherichia coli (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3), Enterobacter cloacae (1), Proteus mirabilis (2), Proteus vulgaris (1), Acinetobacter anitratus (1), Serratia marcescens (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Bacteroides fragilis (3), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (1). In 5 patients (25%) a mixed infection was observed. Sixteen patients (80%) were completely cured from infection and 24 isolated organisms (88.8%) were eradicated. No adverse reactions were observed. Aztreonam has undoubtedly high clinical and bacteriological efficacy in the therapy of nosocomial infections in patients with impaired host defenses.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of DN-9550, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - DN-9550 [(6R, 7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl) methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-pyridinio)methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia -1-azabicyclo methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate hydrochloride] is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The activity of DN-9550 against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of ceftazidime, slightly lower than that of cefotaxime, and far exceeded that of cefoperazone. Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens, DN-9550 was more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime. DN-9550 and ceftazidime were significantly more active than cefotaxime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but DN-9550 and cefotaxime were clearly more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci and streptococci. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to DN-9550, but Bacteroides fragilis was generally not susceptible to the compound. DN-9550 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases and had high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. When DN-9550 was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.
TI  - Determination of mercury and organomercurial resistance in obligate anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A methodology for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration of inorganic and organomercurial compounds for obligate anaerobic bacteria is described. A wide variation in the susceptibility of anaerobic clinical and sewage isolates was observed. Isolates of Bacteroides ruminicola and Clostridium perfringens resistant to mercury were examined for their plasmid content and ability to demonstrate inducible resistance. None of the resistant anaerobes contained any plasmids, while resistant facultative isolates from the same source contained several plasmids. In 24 h, resistant strains of clostridia and Bacteroides volatilized 20 and 43% of the 203Hg2+ added to cultures, while Escherichia coli R100 and a sewage isolate of Enterobacter cloacae volatilized 63 and 27%, respectively, of the added 203Hg2+. Attempts to induce mercury resistance in the aerobic isolates were successful, but no induction was seen in the anaerobes. Thus, mercury resistance in these anaerobic isolates was neither inducible nor plasmid mediated.
TI  - Role of beta-lactam hydrolysis in the mechanism of resistance of a beta-lactamase-constitutive Enterobacter cloacae strain to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae strains producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase constitutively show high degrees of resistance to most of the third-generation beta-lactams. It has been proposed that this resistance is due to the nonhydrolytic binding or trapping of beta-lactams by the enzyme. We found that the outer membrane of E. cloacae strain 55M indeed had permeability to cefazolin about 14-fold lower than that of Escherichia coli, and that the number of beta-lactamase molecules produced by this constitutive mutant was exceptionally large (2 X 10(5) per cell). These conditions are expected to produce a low degree of resistance, but could not explain the high resistance level of the mutant. We showed that the beta-lactamase of this strain hydrolyzed third-generation beta-lactams at measurable rates. Although the V max for these compounds was less than 0.01% of that for cefazolin, the enzyme could hydrolyze them at rates comparable to the rate for cefazolin when the substrate concentration was near 0.1 microM, a concentration thought to be physiologically relevant for the inhibition of cell growth, because of the exceptionally high affinity of the enzyme to many third-generation compounds. Calculations based on kinetic parameters of the enzyme, outer membrane permeability, and affinity toward penicillin-binding proteins succeeded in predicting the MICs for several third-generation beta-lactams. The data suggest that hydrolysis may be more important than nonhydrolytic binding for the expression of the resistant phenotype, and that studies on the susceptibility of beta-lactams to beta-lactamases should be carried out at physiologically relevant, very low concentrations of the drug, rather than the customary very high concentrations, such as 100 microM.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Susceptibility of equine bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobic susceptibility patterns of commonly isolated aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens of equine origin were determined, using the agar-plate dilution method. All organisms were recent clinical isolates and included Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, (coagulase positive) Staphylococcus sp, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Actinobacillus sp, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella. In vitro susceptibility levels were outlined for 14 antimicrobics as follows: amikacin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, ampicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, amoxicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, cefadroxil less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, chloramphenicol less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, erythromycin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, gentamicin less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml, kanamycin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, penicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, tetracycline less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, ormetoprim/sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml, sulfadiazine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, and trimethoprim/sulfadiazine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Comparison of the exoproducts of gram-negative bacteria by SDS-Page.
AB  - The protein exoproducts released during exponential growth of Gram-negative bacteria were analysed and compared by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-Page). The following bacterial strains were tested: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia rubidaea, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella minnesota, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens. It is demonstrated by SDS-Page that members of one species show identical protein pattern, whereas different species show besides comparable protein bands a species characteristic pattern. All members of Enterobacteriaceae were shown to release proteins whose molecular weights fell into the following size regions: Each strain was shown to synthesize a polypeptide of molecular weight 34,000 and one or more polypeptides within the molecular weight range 25,000-29,000. This profile was shown to be clearly different from that of Pseudomonas strains where 20 or more distinct polypeptides ranging from 12,500 to 160,000 Mr were detectable.
TI  - Plasmid-determined cloacin DF13-susceptibility in Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella edwardsii; identification of the cloacin DF13/aerobactin outer membrane receptor proteins.
AB  - Both Enterobacter cloacae H478 and Klebsiella edwardsii S15 were shown to harbour a relatively large conjugative plasmid that coded for cloacin DF13-susceptibility and the production and uptake of a hydroxamate iron chelator, most probably aerobactin. Protein-blotting experiments with antiserum raised against the purified cloacin DF13/aerobactin receptor protein from Escherichia coli (Co1V-K30) revealed that the corresponding outer membrane receptor proteins of Ent. cloacae H478 and K. edwardsii S15 had apparent mol wts of 85 000 and 76 000, respectively. E. coli transconjugants harbouring either the plasmid from Ent. cloacae H478 or K. edwardsii S15 expressed a cloacin DF13/aerobactin outer membrane receptor protein with a mol wt of 74 000. The receptor protein encoded by the Ent. cloacae and K. edwardsii plasmids were immunologically more related to each other than to the pCo1V-K30-encoded receptor protein.
TI  - Escherichia fergusonii and Enterobacter taylorae, two new species of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  - Escherichia fergusonii (formerly known as Enteric Group 10) and Enterobacter taylorae (formerly known as Enteric Group 19) are proposed as new species in the family Enterobacteriaceae. By DNA hybridization (32P, 60 degrees C, hydroxyapatite), strains of E. fergusonii were 90 to 97% related to the type strain (holotype) ATCC 35469. They were most closely related to Escherichia coli and more distantly related to species in other genera. E. fergusonii strains are positive for indole production, methyl red, lysine decarboxylase, ornithine decarboxylase, and motility. They ferment D-glucose with gas production and also ferment adonitol, L-arabinose, L-rhamnose, maltose, D-xylose, trehalose, cellobiose, and D-arabitol. They are negative for Voges-Proskauer, citrate utilization (17% positive), urea hydrolysis, phenylalanine deamination, arginine dihydrolase, growth in KCN, and fermentation of lactose, sucrose, myo-inositol, D-sorbitol, raffinose, and alpha-methyl-D-glucoside. By DNA hybridization (32P, 60 degrees C, hydroxyapatite), strains of E. taylorae were 84 to 95% related to the type strain (holotype) ATCC 35317. Their nearest relative was E. cloacae, to which they were 61% related. Other named species were more distantly related. Strains of E. taylorae are positive for Voges-Proskauer, citrate utilization, arginine dihydrolase, ornithine decarboxylase, motility, growth in KCN medium, and malonate utilization. They ferment D-glucose with gas production and also ferment D-mannitol, L-arabinose, L-rhamnose, maltose, D-xylose, trehalose, and cellobiose. They are negative for indole production, methyl red, H2S production on triple sugar-iron agar, urea hydrolysis, phenylalanine deamination, lysine decarboxylase, gelatin hydrolysis, and fermentation of adonitol, i-inositol, D-sorbitol, and raffinose. Both new species occur in human clinical specimens. Two strains of E. fergusonii were isolated from blood. Five stains of E. taylorae were isolated from blood, and one was from spinal fluid. These blood and spinal fluid isolates suggest possible clinical significance, but this point requires further study.
TI  - Affinity of carumonam for penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Direct labeling experiments with [14C]-carumonam as well as competition binding assays with [14C]-benzylpenicillin and [14C]-ceftriaxone have demonstrated that penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 3 of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the highest affinity for carumonam (Ro 17-2301, AMA-1080). PBP 1a is inhibited only at significantly higher concentration whereas other PBPs display poor affinity. The IC50 values for binding to PBP 3 in E. coli and E. cloacae are in the range of the MIC-values (0.1-0.4 micrograms/ml), whereas those for P. aeruginosa are much lower than the MIC obtained in vitro. In accordance with the PBP affinity pattern observed for carumonam, filament formation resulted after exposure to concentrations greater than 1/2 MIC. Although PBP 1 and 2 of Staphylococcus aureus could be titrated with radioactive carumonam, very high concentrations were required and in line with the poor affinity for all four PBPs in S. aureus, this organism is resistant to carumonam.
TI  - Temocillin treatment of serious infections due to gram-negative bacilli in an intensive care unit.
AB  - In a group of 27 severely ill patients in an intensive care unit, 40 infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli were treated with temocillin 2g twice daily by the direct intravenous route. The patients (17 men and 10 women) were aged from 35 to 93 years (mean 65.7 years) and 22 had severe underlying diseases. In addition, 10 of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit following surgery; 6 had acute renal insufficiency, 5 had acute respiratory insufficiency, and 12 were suffering from infectious shock. The infections included septicaemia (19), urinary tract infection (10), respiratory tract infection (4) and biliary tract infection (4). The most frequent bacterial isolate was Escherichia coli (14), followed by Enterobacter cloacae (5), Proteus spp. (5) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4). The initial pathogens were eliminated in 34/40 infections (85%) and the corresponding clinical cure rate was 60%, with a further 27.5% of patients being improved. In the septicaemic patients, 17/19 pathogens were eradicated from the blood, while clinically, 12 patients were cured and 5 were improved. Eight of the 10 urinary tract pathogens were eliminated, with 6 patients being clinically cured and a further 3 being improved. All of the initial pathogens in both biliary tract and respiratory tract infections were eradicated, accompanied by clinical success in 3 and 2 patients, respectively; the remaining patients were improved. Superinfection with streptococcus group D, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was seen in 3 patients. The emergence of resistance to temocillin occurred in an isolate of E. coli, and also possibly in an isolate of K. pneumoniae. No adverse reactions nor abnormal laboratory values related to temocillin administration were observed and, although 7 patients died, none of the deaths were attributable to uncontrolled Gram-negative infection.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of cefpiramide on beta-lactamase.
AB  - The beta-lactamase stability and inhibitory activity of cefpiramide were investigated. Cefpiramide was found to be stable to hydrolysis and inhibited beta-lactamase produced by Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, and Escherichia coli. Kinetic studies showed that cefpiramide is a competitive inhibitor of cephaloridine hydrolysis by E. cloacae beta-lactamase.
TI  - Pathogenesis of Escherichia coli cystitis and pyelonephritis: apparent lack of significance of bacterial motility and chemotaxis towards human urine.
AB  - All 45 microscopically motile urinary isolates tested here (37 Escherichia coli,  two Enterobacter cloacae, two Citrobacter freundii, three Proteus mirabilis and one Proteus morganii) were strongly attracted to fresh human urine in a capillary chemotaxis assay. This observation suggested that urine taxis of gram-negative bacteria promotes their invasion of the human lower urinary tract and their ascension to the kidney(s). However, the incidence of motile isolates and their activity in urine taxis assays were similar for fecal E. coli isolates, for isolates from patients with recurrent cystitis and from patients with presumed pyelonephritis (E. coli blood isolates with concomitant E. coli bacteriuria). Thus, the present study of E. coli did not support the hypothesis that bacterial motility is a virulence factor in urinary tract infection.
TI  - Application of in-vitro models: development of resistance.
AB  - The development of chromosomal beta-lactam resistance of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii was observed by following the bacterial kill-kinetics in an in-vitro model simulating human serum antibiotic concentrations. From sensitive Escherichia coli cells mutants arose resistant to aminopenicillins, and to first and second generation cephalosporins, whereas with the Ent. cloacae and Citro. freundii mutants were also resistant to cefotaxime. Resistant mutants from all three species could also be selected on antibiotic-containing agar plates. With E. coli they occurred in two steps, the first mutation being stable but the second mutation reverting spontaneously. In Ent. cloacae, and apparently also in Citro. freundii, the mutation changes the cephalosporinase production from an inducible to a constitutive one. The different mutation rates, and the rate was extremely high for some Ent. cloacae strains, were correlated with a corresponding reduction of viable cell count and with the time of re-growth observed in the model.
TI  - Versatile Escherichia coli-Bacillus shuttle vectors derived from runaway replication plasmids related to CloDF13.
AB  - Versatile cloning vectors were constructed employing a runaway replication mutant of the bacteriocinogenic plasmid CloDF13. These vectors can, under conditions where protein synthesis is not inhibited, be amplified in Escherichia coli to high levels by elevating the temperature and are therefore useful for the production of large quantities of DNA and protein. Since the constructed shuttle vectors, which harbour at least six unique restriction endonucleases sites, replicate in E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus and a variety of Bacilli, they are applicable for the genetic engineering of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli K-12 of the structural gene for outer  membrane PhoE protein from Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - In Escherichia coli K-12, the phoE gene encodes an outer membrane pore protein, which is induced by phosphate starvation. The corresponding gene of Enterobacter cloacae was transferred to E. coli K-12 by using RP4::mini Mu plasmid pULB113 and selecting for R-prime plasmids that carry the genes proA and proB, which are closely linked to phoE in E. coli K-12. The phoE gene was subcloned into the multicopy vector pACYC184, and the location of the gene was determined by analysis of in vitro constructed deletion plasmids and mutant plasmids generated by gamma delta insertions. The E. cloacae phoE gene is normally expressed in E. coli K-12, and the regulation of the expression is similar to that of the E. coli phoE gene. Functionally, the products of the phoE genes of E. coli K-12 and E. cloacae behave very similarly since they form pores in the outer membrane with a recognition site for negatively charged compounds and they serve as (part of) the receptor for phage TC45.
TI  - Reproducibility of the MS-2 system for identification of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae: a collaborative study with blindly assigned reference stains.
AB  - The reproducibility of identification and biochemical reactions for five different reference organisms of Enterobacteriaceae; Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Enterobacter cloacae, were evaluated using the updated MS-2 system software (Abbott Laboratories, Diagnostic Division, Irving, Tex.) in a collaborative study involving 11 laboratories. When a total of 220 randomly coded test organisms were blindly examined, the MS-2 system correctly identified 92.7 and 86.8% for over 80 and 90% probability identification, respectively. Four organisms, P. vulgaris, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and S. marcescens, were correctly identified in all laboratories with high probability, but 9 of 44 tests of Enterobacter cloacae resulted in misidentifications or low-likelihood (less than 80%) identifications. Accuracy was directly related to level of experience and familiarity with the MS-2 system in the individual laboratories. Biochemical reactions varied among the identification trials, especially in the identification of S. marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae. Among a total of 44 subcultures for each organism, 10 different biochemical patterns for P. vulgaris, 6 for K. pneumoniae, 9 for E. coli, 15 for S. marcescens, and 14 for Enterobacter cloacae were obtained. The results indicate that the MS-2 system performs with high accuracy and reproducibility in identifying Enterobacteriaceae, except for Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - An evaluation of the bacteriolytic and biochemical properties of ceftiolene (42980RP).
AB  - Ceftiolene (42980RP) is a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum similar to cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The characteristics of ceftiolene have been tested in a variety of assays involving various biochemical aspects of the mode of action of beta-lactam antibiotics. The affinities of ceftiolene for penicillin-binding proteins were very comparable with those of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime for Escherichia coli, and generally greater than those of latamoxef (moxalactam) for the higher molecular weight PBPs of E. coli. Enterobacter cloacae. Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The affinity of ceftiolene for PBP1 of Staphylococcus aureus was greater than those of cefotaxime or latamoxef, but comparable with these antibiotics for PBP3. The bacteriolytic activity of ceftiolene at defined concentrations against Gram-negative organisms was similar to that of ceftriaxone, and significantly better than that of the other third-generation cephalosporins tested. Introduction of plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases into E. coli reduced the wide variation in bacteriolytic effect of the different cephalosporins, and a significant inoculum effect was observed for the bacteriolysis. Chloramphenicol was less antagonistic against ceftiolene- or ceftriaxone-induced lysis than was observed for cefotaxime or latamoxef. Growth of Staph. aureus at low concentrations of ceftiolene caused the bacteria to become more sensitive to lysis by lysostaphin than organisms grown with cefotaxime or latamoxef under the same conditions. These observations confirm the necessity to use techniques other than routine MIC determinations to distinguish between antibiotics which would otherwise appear very similar.
TI  - Synergism of PS-5 with penicillins and cephalosporins in antimicrobial activity against beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative microorganisms.
AB  - The in vitro synergism of PS-5 combined with various penicillins and cephalosporins in antimicrobial activity was examined in detail against beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. PS-5 showed a highly significant synergism in antimicrobial action against Escherichia coli RGN238 in combination with penicillins; and against Proteus vulgaris GN76 and Serratia marcescens T55 in combination with cephalosporins. It was moderately synergistic against Citrobacter freundii GN346, Enterobacter cloacae 45, Proteus morganii 111 and Enterobacter aerogenes E19, whereas no synergism was observed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa E2 and Klebsiella pneumoniae 130.
TI  - In vitro activity of WIN 49375 compared with those of other antibiotics in isolates from cancer patients.
AB  - The activity of WIN 49375 [6-fluoro-1, 4-dihydro-1-(methylamino)-7-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxo-3- quinolinecarboxylic acid], a new synthetic quinolone, was tested in vitro against 587 clinical isolates. The MICs for 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae were 0.20, 1.56, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. The MICs for 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens were both 3.12 micrograms/ml. WIN 49375 was minimally active against gram-positive cocci. Its in vitro activity suggests that it may be useful for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections.
TI  - Effect of pH, application technique, and chlorine-to-nitrogen ratio on disinfectant activity of inorganic chloramines with pure culture bacteria.
AB  - The influence of pH, application technique, and chlorine-to-nitrogen weight ratio on the bactericidal activity of inorganic chloramine compounds was determined with stock and environmental strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae. The rate of inactivation increased from 1.5 to 2 times as the chlorine-to-nitrogen weight ratio was adjusted from 2:1 to 5:1, 5 to 6 times as the pH was decreased from 8 to 6, and 5 to 6 times as the concentration was increased from 1 to 5 mg/liter. Separate additions of free chlorine and ammonia (concurrent addition and preammoniation) into seeded water at or below pH 7.5 resulted in killing comparable to that observed with free chlorine (99% inactivation in less than 20 s). At pH 8, inactivation by separate additions was considerably slower and was comparable to that by prereacted chloramine compounds (99% inactivation in 25 to 26 min). Determination of the effectiveness of inorganic chloramine compounds as primary disinfectants for drinking water must consider the method of application, pH and concentrations of chlorine and ammonia.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - In vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to that of quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new methyl-4-piperazinyl quinolone. It had MIC90 values of less than 0.01 to 0.8 micrograms/ml for the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, oxytoca, Citrobacter, Providencia, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Morganella and Proteus mirabilis. It inhibited ampicillin, cephalexin and nalidixic acid resistant isolates of these species. Against Pseudomonas the pefloxacin MIC90 was 3.1 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus aureus had a MIC50 of 0.4 micrograms/ml and a MIC90 of 0.8 micrograms/ml and S. faecalis had a MIC90 of 3.1 micrograms/ml. Pefloxacin inhibited Salmonella spp., Salmonella typhi, Shigella spp., Yersinia, Aeromonas, toxigenic E. coli at concentrations of less than 0.05 to 1.6 micrograms/ml, including ampicillin and trimethoprim resistant strains. There was a minimal difference in MIC and MBC values in broth or serum, but major changes in MIC and MBC values occurred in acid urine. Increase in MIC values occurred with repeated transfer in broth or urine.
TI  - Mechanism of action of the new orally active cephalosporin FK027.
AB  - The mechanism of action of a new orally active cephalosporin, FK027, was compared to that of cephalexin and cefaclor to elucidate its excellent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. FK027 showed very high affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 3, 1a and 1bs of Escherichia coli whereas cephalexin showed fairly high affinity for PBPs 1a, 4 and 3. The ability of FK027 to penetrate the outer membranes of E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae was less than that of cephalexin and cefaclor. However, FK027 was extremely stable to both plasmid-mediated penicillinases and chromosomal beta-lactamases except the Bacteroides fragilis enzyme and its stability was superior to that of cephalexin and cefaclor. These results indicate that the potent antibacterial activity of FK027 is based on its enhanced affinity for the target enzymes and its high stability to beta-lactamases.
TI  - Use of the Becton-Dickinson urine culture tube with the Abbott MS-2 urine screening system.
AB  - Urine specimens were obtained from 312 obstetric outpatients by sterile midstream technique and aliquots placed in both Becton-Dickinson urine culture tubes and sterile conventional tubes. Quantitative cultures were made from each tube, and each tube was screened for bacteria with the Abbott MS-2 urine screening system. The time required to detect bacteriuria was recorded for both specimens. Isolates from specimens containing greater than or equal to 50,000/ml gram-positive cocci or greater than or equal to 100,000/ml gram-negative bacilli were identified and antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed. Delayed (24 hr) quantitative cultures were done from Becton-Dickinson tubes. By these criteria, 124 urine specimens were positive in both conventional and Becton-Dickinson tubes. Escherichia coli (n = 72), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 8), Proteus mirabilis (n = 4), group B streptococcus (n = 12), and enterococcus (n = 8) were isolated. Time for detection of positive urine samples was similar in both types of tubes. Delayed cultures had significant numbers of false-positive results. Antimicrobial susceptibility results did not appear to be influenced greatly by Becton-Dickinson tube transport. The MS-2 cannot adequately discriminate cultures containing less than 50,000 colony-forming units/ml of urine. The Becton-Dickinson tube appears to be compatible for use with the MS-2 for purposes of screening for bacteriuria.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to polymyxin B nonapeptide.
AB  - Subinhibitory concentrations of polymyxin B nonapeptide sensitized all 21 polymyxin-susceptible gram-negative bacterial strains studied to hydrophobic antibiotics such as fusidic acid, novobiocin, and erythromycin. The susceptibility increases were usually 30- to 300-fold. The strains included representatives of Escherichia coli with different O- and K-antigens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Salmonella typhimurium, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas maltophilia. In contrast, polymyxin-resistant strains (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens) were resistant to the action of polymyxin B nonapeptide.
TI  - Novel method for studying the public health significance of macroinvertebrates occurring in potable water.
AB  - An experimental procedure was developed to study the association of selected bacteria and macroinvertebrates and their response to free available chlorine disinfection. The organisms selected for study were Escherichia coli ( LacZ545 ), Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 23355), and the amphipod Hyalella azteca . E. coli was shown to bind tightly (1.6 X 10(4) CFU per amphipod ) to this macroinvertebrate and to resist repeated attempts to wash it off. E. cloacae was shown to bind much less tightly (1.4 X 10(3) CFU per amphipod ) to H. azteca and was less resistant to removal by washing. The extent of association is a function of macroinvertebrate size (surface area), but the procedure produces repeatable results usable for controlled experimentation. This method, together with the dual bacterial identification criteria (morphology and antibiotic resistance), was used to study the response of unassociated and associated E. coli and E. cloacae to disinfection with free available chlorine at 1.0 mg/liter. Unassociated E. coli populations decreased to less than 1% of their zero time controls within 1 min of contact time, whereas more than 2% of the associated E. coli populations remained viable after 60 min of contact at 1.0 mg of free available chlorine per liter. Unassociated E. cloacae populations decreased to less than 1% of their zero time controls within 1 min of contact time, whereas ca. 15% of the associated E. cloacae populations remained viable after 60 min of contact at 1.0 mg of free available chlorine per liter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Inhibitory activity and resistance to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases of some (D,L)-7-(alpha-fluoroacylamino)cephalosporins.
AB  - The synthesis of a series of (D,L)-7-(alpha-fluoroacylamino)-cephalosporanic acids are described. In vitro antimicrobial activity was determined in comparison with the corresponding non-fluorinated compounds. None of them were found to be better than clinically used cephalosporins. Resistance to and inhibition of beta-lactamases from gram-negative organisms were also determined. All the fluorinated derivatives were found to be as resistant to hydrolysis by Escherichia coli R+TEM beta-lactamase as the corresponding non-fluorinated compounds, but resulted more resistant (from 2.3 to 61.2 times) to Enterobacter cloacae 214 beta-lactamase. Title compounds were also found to be better inhibitors of E. cloacae 53 and E. cloacae 214 beta-lactamases than the related non-fluorinated cephalosporins.
TI  - Resistance types in Citrobacter freundii. Occurrence and resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin and mecillinam. Transfer of ampicillin resistance.
AB  - The resistance types of Citrobacter freundii were investigated. The strains were  divided into three groups according to susceptibility to penicillin derivatives. Group 1, comprising the ampicillin-carbenicillin sensitive strains (A-s/Ca-s), constituted 22%. Group 2 (ampicillin-resistant (A-r)/Ca-s) constituted 45% and group 3 (A-r/Ca-r) 32%. Two strains (1%) were recorded as A-s/Ca-r. Group 3 contained a higher proportion of multi-resistant strains than groups 1 and 2. The log2IC50 with ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin and mecillinam in the tube-dilution method were determined for 32 strains. Groups 1 and 2 differed only as regards cephalothin resistance. The strains of group 3 were more A-r than the group 2 ones. The mecillinam susceptibility did not differ between the three groups. No strains in group 2 could transfer A-resistance. In group 3 ten out of 16 strains were able to transfer A-resistance. Resistance to sulphonamide, tetracycline, and streptomycin was also transferred, but with low frequency. The A-r/Ca-r strains could be divided into two subgroups, probably reflecting different modes of developing beta-lactam resistance. One group was very A- and Ca-r, less cephalothin-r, more mecillinam-r and could transfer A-resistance. The other group had very high cephalothin-resistance and could not transfer A-resistance. Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae are very similar as regards resistance conditions.
TI  - Carbohydrate-binding sites of the mannose-specific fimbrial lectins of enterobacteria.
AB  - The combining sites of type 1 fimbrial lectins of various species of enterobacteria were studied by measuring the inhibitory activity of linear and branched oligosaccharides and several glycosides of D-mannose on the agglutination of yeast cells by the organisms. The results showed that all five strains of Escherichia coli tested possessed an elongated combining site best fitting a trisaccharide and including a hydrophobic region. Similar results were obtained with Klebsiella pneumoniae. Within the Salmonella genus, the combining sites of the six species tested were similar, but all differed significantly from those of the E. coli strains. The combining sites of Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter agglomerans were different from each other and from those of Salmonella sp. and E. coli. The results suggest that although classified under the general term "mannose-specific," bacterial lectins in the form of type 1 fimbriae on different genera exhibit differences in sugar specificities.
TI  - Detection of PSE-2 beta-lactamase in enterobacteria.
AB  - PSE-2, a plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase which was previously considered pseudomonas specific, was observed in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia stuartii, and Enterobacter cloacae. All four isolates transferred PSE-2 production, together with resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and sulfamethoxazole, into Escherichia coli J62-1 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PU21. Transfer correlated with acquisition by the transconjugants of a 65-megadalton plasmid, and this element was considered to encode PSE-2 expression. The PSE-2 enzyme conferred high-level carbenicillin resistance on both J62-1 and PU21 transconjugants, although the PSE-2-producing Providencia stuartii isolate was susceptible to carbenicillin.
TI  - Bacterial interference with coliform colony sheen production on membrane filters.
AB  - The membrane filter (MF) method for detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in drinking water requires that the coliforms both grow and produce a green metallic sheen when the filter is incubated on modified Endo medium at 35 degrees C for 22 h. Large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, which are enumerated by the standard plate count (SPC) technique, can interfere with the detection of coliforms on MF. This paper presents quantitative evidence from laboratory experiments on the interference of specific SPC bacteria on coliform colony sheen production on MF. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas hydrophila caused significant reductions in Escherichia coli sheen colony counts when present at 3,000 and 220 per filter, respectively. The Flavobacterium sp. and Bacillus sp. selected for this study from SPC did not interfere with coliform colony sheen production. Excessive crowding of E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae colonies on MF also caused a reduction in the number of colonies that produced sheen. Even when there was no crowding (14 colonies per filter), only a fraction of the E. cloacae colonies produced sheen colonies on modified Endo medium.
TI  - In vitro combination effects of cefotetan with four aminoglycosides, piperacillin and mezlocillin on gram-positive and gram-negative nosocomial bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro efficacy of cefotetan in combination with gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, netilmicin against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter cloacae and with piperacillin and mezlocillin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae was compared by use of the checkerboard agar dilution technique. On average, 60% of the gram-negative and 46% of the gram-positive strains were inhibited by additive, but only 22% of the gram-negative and 2% of the gram-positive bacteria were inhibited by synergistic cefotetan-aminoglycoside combinations. Netilmicin combinations were least active. On gram-negative bacteria, 63% of the cefotetan-penicillin combinations were additive and 11% synergistic. No antagonism occurred with any of the combinations.
TI  - Transfer of the chromosomal bla gene from Enterobacter cloacae to Escherichia coli by RP4::mini-Mu.
AB  - The resistance gene for beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporins from Enterobacter cloacae was transferred to Escherichia coli by the aid of RP4::mini-Mu. The R-prime plasmids generated carried 60 to 80 kilobases (kb) of E. cloacae DNA and coded for the chromosomal E. cloacae beta-lactamase. The gene was fully expressed in the recipient. Restriction endonuclease EcoRI fragments of the R-prime plasmid pBP100 were cloned into the vector pBP328, yielding the plasmid pBP102 with a size of 14 kb. A restriction map of this plasmid was constructed. By digesting pBP102 into seven PstI fragments, ligating the fragments, and looking for the smallest plasmid generated, pBP103 was isolated. It consisted of three PstI fragments, two of them (together 4.2 kb) necessary for resistance. During the experiment (performed in a recA+ background) the largest PstI fragment had undergone a substitution of a 0.3-kb segment of pBP102 by a 0.7-kb segment in pBP103 (as deduced by heteroduplex analysis). The bla gene of resistant E. cloacae strains was dominant over the gene of susceptible organisms.
TI  - Influence of methoxy-substitution of beta-lactam compounds on the interaction with various beta-lactamases.
AB  - The interaction of 6 alpha-(temocillin) and 7 alpha-methoxy substituted (cefoxitin) beta-lactam compounds with various beta-lactamases was studied employing enzyme kinetics and compared to that of unsubstituted compounds. Both chromosomally mediated enzymes from Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were competitively inhibited by the methoxy-substituted compounds. Higher concentrations of cefoxitin caused a competitive inhibition of the plasmid-mediated Tem-1 enzyme, whereas temocillin led to a non-competitive inhibition of the Tem-1 enzyme. These results indicate that the discrepancies in the interaction on the above mentioned compounds have to be attributed to the different molecular structure of the beta-lactam nucleus. Moreover, no predictions can be made on the basis of an analogy between 6 alpha-methoxy-penams and 7 alpha-methoxy cephems.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of E-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of E-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. E-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (MIC50) of 25 micrograms for Staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with Streptococcus faecalis resistant. E-0702 had MIC50s against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but MIC90S were higher than those of the other agents. It was as active as the other agents against Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia spp., Morganella spp., and Proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. E-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. There was an inoculum effect for E. cloacae, Serratia spp., Morganella spp., and Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - Synthesis of plasmid-coded heat-labile enterotoxin in wild-type and hypertoxinogenic strains of Escherichia coli and in other genera of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The effect of host determinants on expression of plasmid-coded heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) was examined. A collection of LT plasmids was introduced into isogenic strains of Escherichia coli K-12 strains containing the wild type or hypertoxinogenic (htx-2) allele. For each plasmid tested, production of LT increased by approximately 1.5- to 3-fold in the host containing htx-2, indicating that the htx-2 allele affects a regulatory function for LT production that is common to many different enterotoxin plasmids. LT plasmids from E. coli were also introduced into strains of Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhimurium. The plasmids were stably maintained and determined production of LT in those genera, although the amounts of LT produced varied by more than 50-fold. These observations demonstrate that host factors have an important role in determining the level of expression of plasmid-coded LT genes and support the hypothesis that interspecific, conjugal transfer of enterotoxin plasmids may confer enterotoxigenicity to a wide variety of potentially pathogenic enteric bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of the updated MS-2 Bacterial Identification system in comparison with the API 20E system.
AB  - The recently updated MS-2 Bacterial Identification system software (Abbott Laboratories, Diagnostic Division, Irving, Tex.) was compared with the original MS-2 Bacterial Identification software and the API 20E, using 968 strains of Enterobacteriaceae. The updated MS-2 software correctly identified 94.4% of the isolates tested. API 20E and the original MS-2 software correctly identified 91 and 85.3% of the strains, respectively. MS-2 responses were considered to be equivocal (needing additional tests for verification) if the percent likelihood values were less than 80%. The percentage of equivocal responses was reduced from 6.5% with the original software to 2.2% with the updated software, and the percentage of incorrect identifications was reduced from 8.2 to 3.4% with the original and updated software, respectively. Organisms belonging to 25 taxonomic groups were tested. Direct comparison of the two MS-2 programs showed that the updated MS-2 software increased the identification accuracy of Salmonella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia stuartii, Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. A decrease in accuracy was seen with Citrobacter freundii, Hafnia alvei, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis when the updated software was used. The remaining 12 taxonomic groups were not affected by the software changes. The updated MS-2 software appears to significantly improve the identification accuracy of the MS-2 Bacterial Identification system.
TI  - Comparative study of fosfomycin activity in Mueller-Hinton media and in tissues.
AB  - Fosfomycin utilizes two uptake systems as ways of entry into microorganisms: the  L-a-glycerophosphate and the hexose phosphate transport system. The latter is inducible by glucose-6-phosphate. The relationship between glucose-6-phosphate (concentration range 0-100 mg/l) and the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus was studied in Mueller-Hinton broth. An almost maximal enhancement of fosfomycin activity was found at 25 mg/l glucose-6-phosphate. Fosfomycin activity against Staph. aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied by use of the broth and the agar dilution method, in the presence and absence of glucose-6-phosphate (25 mg/l). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of fosfomycin against Staph. aureus Streptococcus faecalis, E. coli, Ent. cloacae, Pr. mirabilis, and Ps. aeruginosa were estimated in particle free supernatants of 25% tissue homogenates (liver, kidney, lung, heart) and in parallel in Mueller-Hinton broth. With few exceptions the MICs in Mueller-Hinton broth (with glucose-6-phosphate) were similar to those found in tissues (no glucose-6-phosphate added).
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the BACTEC resin-containing blood culture bottle.
AB  - The BACTEC resin-containing blood culture bottle (16B; Johnston Laboratories) was designed to bind antibiotics and to support bacterial growth. However, only modest increases in the recovery rates of pathogens have been found in clinical studies. This in vitro study evaluated the ability of the 16B to recover organisms from human serum containing clinically achievable concentrations of antibiotics. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and a viridans streptococcus were added to serum containing antibiotic(s), and at various time intervals of antibiotic exposure, portions were removed and inoculated into both the 16B and the 6B (conventional aerobic) bottles. The studies of the kinetics of killing of the bacterial strains by the various antibiotics showed a good correlation between those combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which produced slow killing and the combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which were recovered preferentially in the 16B bottles. Low recovery rates were noted when the antibiotics killed the organisms rapidly. The indications for use of the resin-containing blood culture bottle should be limited to those situations in which the patient is receiving antibiotics and the bacteremia is suspected to involve a pathogen which is killed slowly by the administered drug(s) or when the bacteremia is continuous. The failure of the BACTEC 16B blood culture bottle to recover organisms may in part reflect the bactericidal activity of the antibiotics administered.
TI  - Chromosomal beta-lactamases of Enterobacter cloacae are responsible for resistance to third-generation cephalosporins.
AB  - About 70% of all Enterobacter cloacae strains tested possessed one of two species-specific beta-lactamases. These enzymes, E. cloacae beta-lactamase A and E. cloacae beta-lactamase B, with isoelectric points of 8.8 and 7.8, respectively, had the same pH and temperature optima. Both showed similar enzyme kinetics and were inhibited by cloxacillin but not by p-chloromercuribenzoate. E. cloacae beta-lactamase B appeared to be identical with the enzyme of E. cloacae P99. By a mutation in a regulatory gene, inducible enzyme production could be converted into constitutive expression. In E. cloacae, both enzymes did not hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins, but they were solely responsible for resistance toward these drugs. This was demonstrated by the characterization of Escherichia coli strains expressing an identical resistance pattern after transfer of the corresponding Enterobacter gene.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefodizime, an aminothiazolyl iminomethoxy cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefodizime, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin similar to moxalactam and ceftazidime, was less active (minimal inhibitory concentration, 1.6 to 12 micrograms) than cefazolin or cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. It inhibited Haemophilus and Neisseria spp. at less than 0.5 microgram/ml. It did not inhibit methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, or Listeria spp. and was 8- to 32-fold less active than cefotaxime, moxalactam, or ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia spp., and Serratia spp. Cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus vulgaris were resistant to cefodizime. Cefodizime was less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis. Cefodizime was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases, and it inhibited type I beta-lactamases.
TI  - Norfloxacin versus cotrimoxazole in the treatment of lower urinary tract infections.
AB  - In a randomised prospective study 61 patients with lower urinary tract infection  received either 200 mg norfloxacin (33 patients) or 480 mg cotrimoxazole (28 patients) twice daily for ten days. Pathogens included Escherichia coli in 48 patients, Proteus mirabilis in ten patients, and Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Staphylococcus saprophyticus in one patient each. The MICs of norfloxacin and cotrimoxazole were less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l and less than or equal to 1 mg/l respectively. On the tenth day of treatment 94% of the patients receiving norfloxacin and 89% of the patients receiving cotrimoxazole were clinically cured, and the pathogens were eradicated in 94% and 96% of the patients respectively. At six week follow-up one patient given cotrimoxazole and two given norfloxacin had a reinfection. No side-effects or toxicity were observed with the exception of a diffuse rash in one patient receiving cotrimoxazole in whom treatment was discontinued. It is concluded that norfloxacin is safe and as effective as cotrimoxazole in the treatment of lower UTI and should have an important role to play whenever multiresistant organisms are implicated.
TI  - Investigations on beta-lactamase stability of recently developed beta-lactam compounds: study of enzyme kinetics.
AB  - The plasmid-mediated TEM-1 enzyme (E. coli K12 R6K) and chromosomally mediated enzymes from Enterobacter cloacae (IEP 8.5) and Citrobacter freundii (IEP 9.5) were highly purified. Enzyme kinetics were studied with various therapeutic compounds as substrates and lamoxactam, azthreonam, and N-formimidoyl thienamycin as inhibitors. Lamoxactam and azthreonam failed to inhibit the TEM-1 enzyme, whereas N-formimidoyl thienamycin was a competitive inhibitor. KI was 5 mumol/l--thus corresponding to KM--and independent of the substrate. With respect to chromosomally mediated enzymes, there was a time-dependent inhibition of beta-lactam hydrolysis. KI ranged from 0.06 to 0.2 mumol/l in dependence of the inhibitor. Enzyme kinetics suggested a non-competitive type of inhibition thus indicating that binding of these compounds to both chromosomally mediated enzymes must be followed by a further reaction step. It is evident that the stability against beta-lactamases of recently developed compounds is based on different mechanisms--characteristic for the enzyme being considered.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - Synthesis and beta-lactamase inhibitory activities of some clavulanic acid analogues.
AB  - Clavulanic acid analogs lacking the C-3 carboxyl group are potent inhibitors of both plasmid and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases. They exhibit only low intrinsic anti-bacterial activity, but potentiate the activity of ampicillin and cephaloridine against beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae in vitro. No synergism was observed in beta-lactamase negative strains. The E. coli TEM 1 and the E. cloacae P99 enzymes are inhibited in a progressive and irreversible manner by these compounds.
TI  - Transferable antibiotic resistance in a general hospital: a two year survey.
AB  - For two years transferable antibiotic resistance (TAR) was studied by replicator  methods in strains of Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a 900-bed hospital. Transfer to an Escherichia coli recipient was demonstrated in 21% of 7,800 Enterobacteriaceae. It was most common in Klebsiella (37% of isolates) and least in Acinetobacter (6%). The mean number of phenotypic resistance markers (RMs) transferred was higher from Klebsiella pneumoniae or Enterobacter cloacae than from E. coli or P. mirabilis. K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae especially transferred 7 or more RMs much more often than other species. Some RMs were associated with a particular species, e.g. streptomycin with E. coli, kanamycin or gentamicin with E. cloacae and kanamycin with P. mirabilis. The same was true of certain patterns of resistance transfer, e.g. Ap-Km and P. mirabilis, Ap-Sm and E. coli, Ap-Km-Gm-Tm-Cm and K. pneumoniae. However, many of the commonest resistance phenotypes were transferred from several species and from several biotypes within any given species. Resistance patterns transferred from E. coli were detected sporadically throughout, whereas many of those transferred from Klebsiella, Enterobacter or Proteus were found only for a limited time.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of O-demethylfortimicin.
AB  - The activity of O-demethylfortimicin against ampicillin, cefazolin and carbenicillin resistant bacteria was determined. O-Demethylfortimicin showed excellent in-vitro activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Ent. agglomerans, Ent. aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella, and Providencia inhibiting these organisms at less than or equal to 3.1 mg/l. It was particularly effective against Ent. cloacae and Serratia marcescens that were resistant to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam. O-Demethylfortimicin did not show particularly good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Acinetobacter or other Pseudomonas species, MIC90 values were 100 mg/l. Combination of O-demethylfortimicin and ticarcillin or cefsulodin tested against Ps. aeruginosa were primarily indifferent. Combination of O-demethylfortimicin and ticarcillin showed partial synergy for 65% of Enterobacter isolates.
TI  - Cefotetan: profile of in-vitro activity.
AB  - Cefotetan, a novel 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin, was shown to be comparable to other third-generation cephalosporins when tested in vitro against 1063 Gram-negative clinical isolates of 11 species. Ninety per cent of all isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii were inhibited by concentrations of cefotetan between 0.07 and 3.2 mg/l. Activity against Gram-positive cocci was about equal to that of moxalactam. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter were resistant. Cefotetan inhibited about two-thirds of Enterobacter strains at 16 mg/l. beta-Lactamases of Enterobacter cloacae highly resistant to cefotetan inactivated this cephamycin. These strains were resistant to most other beta-lactams as well. Synergism between cefotetan and aminoglycosides was found in 8 out of 16 Gram-negatives.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefotetan and other cephalosporins against multiresistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The activity of cefotetan against multiresistant strains of Escherichia coli and  Klebsiella aerogenes was comparable with that of cefotaxime and ceftazidime, the mean MICs being 0.11 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively. Multiresistant strains of Enterobacter cloacae showed a high level of resistance to cefotetan in common with other cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefamandole and cefoxitin, but were sensitive to ceftazidime and cefotaxime.
TI  - Characterization of beta-lactamase induction in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - The induction of beta-lactamase was studied in a strain of Enterobacter cloacae.  A wide variety of beta-lactam compounds were found to induce beta-lactamase in this organism, and the degree of induction was directly related to the stability of the inducer to degradation by the enzyme. The kinetics of the induction process were consistent with a system normally under repressor control, suggesting a direct interaction of the beta-lactam compound with a repressor protein in the E. cloacae cells. Although these characteristics are common to many inducible systems in gram-negative organisms, the induction of beta-lactamase in this strain was not subject to catabolite repression with glucose and remained unaffected by exogenous cyclic AMP in the culture medium. This suggests that the organization and function of the beta-lactamase regulatory genes in E. cloacae are unlike those of other inducible gene systems, such as those composing the well-characterized lactose operon in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Nif-hybrids of Enterobacter: selection for nif gene integration with chlorate.
AB  - The nif gene group from Klebsiella can be transferred into Enterobacter cloacae by conjugation using Escherichia coli donor cells carrying the composite self-transmissible nif-plasmid pRD1. A small fraction of the hybrids obtained is stable upon prolonged passaging without selection. Their stability is due to integration of pRD1 into the chromosome. Such integration hybrids were chlorate resistant, and nitrate reductase negative, which indicated that integration preferentially occurred within one of the genes for the production or functioning of this enzyme. Chlorate resistance could, therefore, be used to select for additional nitrate reductase-negative sublines with pRD1 in their chromosome. Such sublines have been analyzed further for the presence of nif genes, other pRD1 markers, and for stability. In all except one the complete plasmid seems to have been integrated. Some tend to revert to nitrate utilisation (chlorate sensitivity).
TI  - [The antibiotic agent azthreonam: studies on plasmid-dependent resistance formation].
AB  - Two mechanisms can be assumed that are responsible for the stability of azthreonam against the attack of beta-lactamases: first, azthreonam lacks binding to the enzyme protein and second, rate of hydrolysis is extremely low, resulting even in inhibition of enzyme activity. Enzyme kinetics were studied from highly purified enzymes: azthreonam did not bind to the TEM-1 enzyme, whereas the compound revealed a time-dependent inhibition of the chromosomally mediated Enterobacter cloacae enzyme. With various cephalosporins as substrates marked discrepancies in the mode of inhibition were observed: cefacedone revealed merely noncompetitive inhibition, cefazolin and cefoperazone demonstrated mixed-inhibition kinetics, and with cephalothin as the substrate enzyme kinetics strongly suggested binding of a second azthreonam molecule. With cefacedone as the substrate KI was ascertained to be 0.8 X 10(-7) mol/l. Conjugative transfer of the TEM-mediating plasmids R6K and RP1 resulted in 20 to 50-fold increase of the MIC's for the Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii recipients, in spite of the fact that azthreonam does not serve as a substrate for the TEM-1 enzyme. These findings have likely to be attributed to an impaired penetration of the compound through the "outer membrane" of the recipient strains.
TI  - IS15, a new insertion sequence widely spread in R plasmids of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - We have shown that the IS15 element, first detected in Salmonella ordonez and previously designated IS1522 (Labigne-Roussel et al. 1981), could transpose, with an approximate frequency of 5 X 10(-5), to various sites of different replicons in an Escherichia coli host deficient for general homologous recombination. Physical mapping with restriction endonucleases of this 1,500 base pairs (bp) transposable module indicated the presence of two, possibly contiguous, directly repeated internal sequences, at least 480 bp in size. IS15 could generate in vivo, by intramolecular recombination between the two direct repeats, IS15-delta, which is 830 bp in size. The reverse transition, IS15-delta to IS15, was not observed. The two related structural forms of IS15 were detected, by Southern hybridization, on plasmids belonging to various incompatibility groups (Inc6-C, I1, 7-M, and Y) isolated from phylogenetically remote pathogenic bacterial genera (Escherichia coli, Salmonella panama, Enterobacter cloacae, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus). Whereas IS15 could promote its own transposition and transposition of DNA fragments it flanked, IS15-delta resulting from the 670 bp 'clean' deletion and representing the most common natural deletion derivative could only induce replicon fusion. It appears, therefore, that the two structural configurations of IS15 have evolved to play, by transposition, distinct and complementary roles in bacterial evolution.
TI  - [Microbiological studies with the new penicillin BRL 17421 (temocillin)].
AB  - In vitro Evaluation of BRL 17421 (Temocillin), a New Penicillin. The in vitro antibacterial activity of BRL 17421 (temocillin), a new penicillin, was determined in quantitative serial broth dilution tests and was compared to that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefazolin and cefotaxime against 751 clinical isolates of the Enterobacteriaceae family. In addition, the sensitivity of 211 mezlocillin-resistant gram-negative rods to BRL 17421 was also determined. Temocillin exhibited a high level of antibacterial activity against various bacterial species of the Enterobacteriaceae family, including isolates resistant to mezlocillin. The 90% MICs against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Yersinia spp. and indole-negative and indole-positive Proteus strains ranged from 0.5 mg/l to 16 mg/l. Concentrations of 16 mg/l were required to inhibit 80% of the Serratia marcescens strains; some isolates were resistant. No significant difference between MIC and MBC values was observed.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxalactam against pathogenic bacteria and its comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - 843 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against moxalactam by disc agar  diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group B and group D Streptococci. In vitro activity of moxalactam was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 471 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 466 (98.9%) were susceptible to moxalactam. Except for penicillin G, the gram-positive cocci were generally more resistant to moxalactam than the other beta-lactam antibiotics. Moxalactam was comparable to gentamicin, as far as its activity against P. aeruginosa was concerned, but was less effective than amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin or colistin.
TI  - Antibacterial and antimycotic effect of a newly discovered secretion from larvae  of an endoparasitic insect, Pimpla turionellae L. (hym.).
AB  - The larvae of Pimpla turionellae, that develop in pupae of various Lepidoptera, discharged through their anus up to 8 microliters/h of a hyaline liquid, which is termed "anal secretion". It exerted a strong bacteriostatic effect on Enterobacter cloacae, a highly virulent intestinal microorganism isolated from the midgut of the host pupa, Pieris brassicae. Growth inhibition of Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus and Pseudomonas phaseolicola was also evident, but less pronounced. Inhibition depended upon the concentration of the anal secretion. This was also true regarding the effect on growth of Beauveria bassiana, a fungus pathogenic on insects. The antimycotic action of the anal secretion was less effective against Chaetomium pululiferum, a soil-inhabiting fungus. Growing hyphae of B. bassiana were malformed, exhibiting the so-called "curling effect", when treated with anal secretion. Parenteral injection of a low dose of Enterobacter cloacae resulted in 100% mortality of non parasitized pupae of Pieris brassicae; however, simultaneous injection of 3 microliters of anal secretion resulted in higher survival.
TI  - [N-formimidoyl-thienamycin: in vitro activity in bacteria with resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics or gentamicin].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of N-formimidoyl-thienamycin were determined for 25 strains each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa which were resistant to gentamicin and/or acylureido penicillins or cefotaxime, cefoperazone or moxalactam, and for 38 strains of the group D streptococci. The drug was very active against the most frequently encountered gram-negative resistant causative organisms of nosocomial infections. The MIC ranged from 0.25-1 mg/l for multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae, and from 0.5-4 mg/l for multiresistant P. aeruginosa. The group D streptococci (enterococci) showed a low MIC (median: 0.75 mg/l); the median of the MBC was greater than 64 mg/l, however.
TI  - 6-Acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (Ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. II. Antibacterial properties.
AB  - The beta-lactamase inhibitor Ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) of Escherichia coli. When used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. Some synergy between Ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against Bacteroides fragilis. In keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination Ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus sp. but not against those with Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and E. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type I or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type TEM.
TI  - Outer membrane permeation of beta-lactam antibiotics in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Mutant strains lacking outer membrane protein(s) were isolated from Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae. The outer membrane protein(s) of P. mirabilis and E. cloacae corresponding to E. coli porin were identified on the basis of their function, namely, their ability to allow the permeation of glucose as demonstrated by [14C]glucose uptake by intact cells. P. mirabilis has only one outer membrane pore protein (molecular weight, 40,000), but E. cloacae has at least two such proteins (molecular weights, 37,000 and 39,000 to 40,000). When the bacteria lost these proteins or porin, the outer membrane permeation of cefazolin was found to be greatly reduced in these three species. Such a change in the outer membrane permeation closely correlated with a significant decrease in the bacterial susceptibility to cephalosporins, including cefoxitin. These results suggested that the main pathway for cephalosporin permeation is the pore made up of these proteins. The 39,000- to 40,000-molecular-weight protein in E. cloacae was also assumed to play an important role in the outer membrane permeation of tetracycline and chloramphenicol. On the other hand, the permeation route of penicillins was obscure. The susceptibility to penicillins, except in some cases, was little influenced by the absence of the proteins. Ampicillin was found to pass through the outer membrane via the same route as the cephalosporins, but the possibility that ampicillin and other penicillins possess another unknown route for outer membrane permeation could not be ruled out.
TI  - Insect immunity: isolation and structure of cecropins B and D from pupae of the Chinese oak silk moth, Antheraea pernyi.
AB  - The immune system in the Chinese oak silk moth, Antheraea pernyi, has been compared with that of the Cecropia moth which has been characterized earlier. Antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli was induced in diapausing pupae by injection of viable E. coli or Enterobacter cloacae. The activity reached a maximum on day 7-8 after which the response gradually declined. The pupae produced a set of immune proteins with P4 and P5 as major labelled components similar to that earlier found in Cecropia. The major antibacterial factor in A. pernyi was cecropin D. A procedure is described for the isolation of cecropin B and D, which is in principle similar to the one used for the isolation of the corresponding cecropins from Cecropia pupae. Amino acid sequence analyses of the A. pernyi cecropins show the D form to contain 36 amino acid residues and that both cecropins have blocked C-termini. The general structure of cecropins having a charged N-terminal region (residues 1-21) followed by a long hydrophobic stretch (residues 22-32) is well conserved. Cecropin B and D from A. pernyi differ from the corresponding proteins in Cecropia by four and three conservative amino acid replacements, respectively. The homology between the cecropins from the two insects suggests that they orginate from a single ancestral gene. The antibacterial activity was tested against nine different bacterial species. Evolutionary aspects of the cecropins are discussed.
TI  - Comparative activity of cefotaxime and selected beta-lactam antibiotics against Haemophilus influenzae and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The activity of cefotaxime was compared with that of ampicillin, moxalactam, and  cefoperozone against 50 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and with that of ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefazolin, and several other established and investigational beta-lactam antibiotics against several hundred isolates of gram-negative aerobic enteric bacilli. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution technique for H. influenzae and by the microtiter broth dilution technique for the other pathogens. Cefotaxime was the most active agent against H. influenzae; it was 20 times more active than ampicillin. It was also the most active agent against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, nontyphoid Salmonella species, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Cefotaxime was among the most active agents against Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter species, Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. None of the new cephalosporins or penicillin inhibited greater than 90% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml; these drugs were, however, more active than carbenicillin.
TI  - Properties and proteolysis of ferric enterobactin outer membrane receptor in Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - A protein with a relative subunit molecular weight of 81000 (81K) has been isolated in virtually pure form from the outer membrane of low iron grown cells of Escherichia coli K12. The 81K protein, which is part of the receptor complex for translocation of the siderophore ferric enterobactin, displays activity in vitro for binding both ferric enterobactin and colicin B. The dissociation constant for the 81K-ferric enterobactin compound at 4 degrees C in 2% Triton-0.1 M Tris, pH 7, was determined to be 10 nM. The N-terminal amino acid was identified as phenylalanine, and the amino acid composition was shown to be similar to that published for the ferric aerobactin-cloacin receptor of Enterobacter cloacae. A plasmid-bearing strain of E. coli was employed to confirm that degradation of 81K to a slightly smaller, inactive form (81K) is performed by a second outer membrane component, protein a. The endoproteolytic action of protein a was verified by the finding of alanine as the N-terminal residue of 81K. A survey of enteric species suggests that the 81K-protein a interaction is confined to the K12 strain of E. coli.
TI  - Broviac catheter-related bacteremia in oncology patients.
AB  - In 27 pediatric oncology patients (median age, 2 years) undergoing chemotherapy for malignant tumours, Silastic Broviac catheters were placed to provide vascular access. The catheters were in place for a total of 174 patient-months. There were 14 episodes of Broviac catheter-related bacteremia or fungemia that occurred in six patients: one patient had six bacteremic episodes, one patient had four episodes, and four patients each had one bacteremic episode. Cultures of blood drawn from Broviac catheter were positive in all instances, and in 12 of 14 samples drawn from the peripheral vein. The most common initial symptoms were fever and chills. The species causing the infections were Enterobacter cloacae (three cases), Staphylococcus epidermidis (three cases), Staphylococcus aureus (three cases), Klebsiella pneumoniae (two cases), Escherichia coli (two cases), Pseudomonas dentrificans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida tropicalis. Antimicrobials administered through the catheter cured the infection in ten of the 11 cases in which they were used.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefmenoxime.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was studied against 650 bacteria. It was slightly less active than cefotaxime and more active than moxalactam against staphylococci. It had activity similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime against group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria spp. Cefmenoxime had activity similar to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, and Shigella. It inhibited beta-lactamase-positive and -negative isolates at less than or equal to 0.4 microgram/ml. Cefmenoxime was somewhat less active than moxalactam or ceftizoxime against Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter agglomerans, but was more active than cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, or ceftazidime against Morganella (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates, 0.1 microgram/ml.), Proteus vulgaris and Providencia spp. It was as active as ceftizoxime was against Serratia. Pseudomonas spp. and Bacteroides spp. were relatively resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates, greater than 100 micrograms/ml). The compound was stable to the common plasmid beta-lactamases, such as that of TEM. It was stable to most chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, which act primarily as cephalosporinases, but was hydrolyzed by Bacteroides and Acinetobacter.
TI  - [Treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid of urinary tract infections in patients with spinal injuries].
AB  - Augmentin, a formulation of amoxycillin trihydrate 250 mg and sodium clavulanate  125 mg per tablet (A-CS) (Augmentin; Beecham), was used in treating 29 episodes of urinary tract infection occurring in 26 patients admitted to the Spinal Unit of the H. F. Verwoerd Hospital, Pretoria. Patients who had a urinary bacterial cell count of more than 105 of the same amoxycillin-resistant organism before and after the oral administration of amoxycillin 500 mg 3 times a day for 48 hours, received 2 A-CS 375 mg tablets orally, 3 times a day at the start if a meal for 5 days. The 29 strains of amoxycillin-resistant organisms treated in this study were: Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11), Proteus mirabilis (4), Enterobacter cloacae (2), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1). The bacteriological success rate 24 hours after therapy was 100% and 8 days after therapy 69%, dependent on patient management. In patients on free drainage and managed with condoms a bacteriological success rate of 55,5% was recorded and in patients managed by intermittent catheterization a bacteriological success rate of 75% was recorded. Side-effects were minimal; 1 patient complained of dizziness and no instances of nausea or vomiting were reported. Haematological, renal and hepatic monitoring before and after A-CS-therapy revealed no drug-related toxicity.
TI  - Resistance to cefamandole: derepression of beta-lactamases by cefoxitin and mutation in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Studies were performed to characterize resistance to cefamandole in two strains of Enterobacter cloacae. Susceptible wild-type cells were exposed either to cefamandole to select stably resistant mutants or to cefoxitin to induce unstable resistance. The two types of resistant cells inactivated cefamandole, and their beta-lactamases had identical isoelectric focusing patterns and substrate profiles. Studies of the beta-lactamases of these resistant cells indicated that the enzymes belonged to the Richmond and Sykes Group I and suggested that their production in wild-type cells is under repressor control. The resistant mutants appeared to be stably derepressed at the locus for beta-lactamase expression, whereas cefoxitin-induced cells were reversibly derepressed wild-type cells. Transfer of plasmids from one mutant colony to recipient Escherichia coli cells did not transfer resistance. These two types of resistance to cefamandole may explain the widely discrepant results obtained during in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as the rapid emergence of resistance that has been observed during clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - In vitro activity of apalcillin compared with that of other new penicillins and anti-Pseudomonas cephalosporins.
AB  - Apalcillin, a naphthydridine derivative of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimal concentrations of apalcillin at which 50 and 90% of hospital isolates of Escherichia coli were inhibited were similar to those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1.6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). Apalcillin had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter diversus. Against Klebsiella, apalcillin inhibited 50% of organisms at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. The activity of apalcillin against Enterobacter (E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, and E. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. The activity of apalcillin against Proteus mirabilis was similar to that of the other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive Proteus and Providencia. Only 40% of Serratia were inhibited at an apalcillin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. Apalcillin was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis. It was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against P. aeruginosa (apalcillin inhibited 90% of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). There was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. Apalcillin was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases.
TI  - Population analysis of sensitivity to ampicillin and carbenicillin in Eschericia  coli and Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Population analysis of sensitivity to ampicillin (A) and carbenicillin (Ca) was carried out with four strains of E. coli and five strains of Enterobacter cloacae. The two A-sensitive/Ca-sensitive (A-s/Ca-s) E. coli strains were homogeneous as regards A-sensitivity. From the A-resistant/Ca-s (A-r/Ca-s) E. coli strains, it was possible to select A-r/Ca-r mutants. Mutation frequency approx. 10-7.5. When the inoculum of A-s/Ca-s E. coli was raised, it was possible to select A-r/Ca-s/cephalothin-r variants with a frequency of approx. 10-9.7. In this laboratory 5% (10-1.3) of the received E. coli strains are A-r/Ca-s. These strains might consequently be mutants of the usual A-s/Ca-s E. coli, selected in an ampicillin environment. The two A-s/Ca-s E. cloacae strains developed mutants highly resistant to A, thereby differing from the A-s/Ca-s E. coli strains. The mutation frequency was approx. 10-7.2. Likewise it was possible to select A-r/Ca-r E. cloacae strains from the usual A-r/Ca-s ones. Mutation rate approx. 10-6.8.
TI  - [Gram negative bacilli endocarditis ].
AB  - Gram negative bacilli endocarditis are unfrequent. Nevertheless we encountered 28 cases of them (8.8%) among 320 endocarditis of which 10 were primitive and 7 cases (10.9%) among 65 prosthetic endocarditis. Bacterial species were 12 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 Ps, stutzeri, 1 Ps. maltophilia, 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Escherichia coli, 3 Serratia marcescans, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Brucella, 1 Hemophilus aphrophilus, 1 Fusobacterium funduliformis, 18 cases were hospital acquired infections related to cardiac surgery (4 cases), intracardiac catheterization (5 cases), intravenous catheter (4 cases). Uncontrolled infection or cardiac insufficiency underwent respectively in 14 and 18 cases. The overall mortality was 50 p. cent. The death occurred more frequently in primitive endocarditis (70%) than in secondary native endocarditis (45%) or prosthetic endocarditis (29%). It was also more frequent in Pseudomonas endocarditis (59%) than with other species (36%) and more frequent when cardiac sufficiency was present (50%). 15 patients underwent surgical procedure of which 6 died (40%). The results were better if the infection was cured before surgical procedures: 5 deaths occurred when the culture of the valves remained positive (9 cases) but none when it was negative. The 5 most recent cases of prosthetic endocarditis were cured. Since 1979, no death occurred among treated patients. we concluded that surgery is usually necessary but after an effective antibiotic therapy over a 4 or 6 week period.
TI  - [Use of moxalactam in intensive care units: clinical and bacteriological results  related to serum and bronchial concentrations ].
AB  - Twenty-patients (14 with mechanical ventilation) received moxalactam in an intensive care unit for pneumonia (3 cases), empyema (5 cases), bronchopneumonia (8 cases), bronchopneumonia with bacteremia (4 cases), 23 organism were isolated and 16 were hospital-acquired: Staphylococcus (3), Escherichia coli (1), Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia (5), Proteus (3), Aeruginosa (2), Acinetobacter (2), These patients received moxalactam at the dosage of 500 mg/8H, 5 at 1 g/12H and 13 at 1 g/8H. Daily dosage ranged between 25 and 50 mg/kg; mode of administration was IM (16) or IV infusion pump (5) and mean duration of treatment was 12 days (range 6-21). Serum and bronchial secretion samples were assayed by the agar diffusion technique utilizing a susceptible strain of enterobacter cloacae (0.06 microgram/ml) as assay organism. At 1 h, mean serum concentrations were 31.5 micrograms/ml after 1 g IM every 12H, 54.9 micrograms/ml after 1 g IM every 8H and at 30 mn after the end of the infusion, serum concentrations were 54.2 micrograms/ml. At the same time, bronchial secretion concentrations were respectively 2.1 micrograms/ml, 5 micrograms/ml and 3.7 micrograms/ml. Clinical cures were obtained in 16 (80%) and bacteriological cures occurred in 14 (70%); of the 12 hospital - acquired infections patients, 8 experienced clinical cures (66%) and the emergence of the following organisms was observed during moxalactam treatment: Staphylococcus (1), Enterococcus (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Acinetobacter (3), For the 20 patients, we noted 4 adverse effects: pruritic morbilliform eruption (1), thrombocytosis (1), eosinophilia (2), To avoid failures, the usefulness of routine combinations with amyglycosides is discussed for the cases of hospital - acquired infections.
TI  - Mode of action of azthreonam.
AB  - Azthreonam (SQ 26,776) is a member of a new class of monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics. In Escherichia coli, azthreonam caused filamentation at its lowest effective concentration (0.2 microgram/ml), a morphological effect identical to that observed with cephalothin. The penicillin-binding protein (PBP) profile indicated a very high affinity for PBP3 (complete binding at 0.1 microgram/ml), a moderate affinity for PBP1a (complete binding at 10 micrograms/ml), and poor affinities for PBP1b, PBP2, PBP4, and PBP5/6 (complete binding at greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml). Accordingly, azthreonam had poor activity against Streptomyces R61 DD-carboxypeptidase (50% inhibition, greater than 100 micrograms/ml) and E. coli peptidoglycan transpeptidase (50% inhibition, 100 micrograms/ml). Azthreonam also showed very high affinity for PBP3 (complete binding at 0.1 microgram/ml) in Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In all four organisms, its PBP profile was similar to that observed in E. coli. It is concluded that azthreonam, although of novel structure, has a mode of action similar to that of cephalosporins, affecting specifically septation in E. coli and most likely other gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Rapid differentiation of bacterial meningitides by direct gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - Rapid identification of Haemophilus influenzae and other bacillary meningitides was attempted by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) of the metabolic by-products in broth cultures and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from experimental meningitis produced in New Zealand White male rabbits. These results were correlated with the GLC of CSF of meningitis patients. A major peak with retention time of succinic acid was found in the broth cultures of all bacilli tested including H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes. Succinic acid was also found in the CSF of experimental meningitis and in the CSF of all patients with H. influenzae and Esch. coli meningitis. This peak was not detected in the blood samples of experimental animals. It was also absent in the broth cultures of all of the gram-positive and gram-negative cocci tested, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Succinic acid, which appears to be a by product of fermentation, persisted as a clear cut marker in H. influenzae meningitis for at least 3 d after the initiation of treatment. In one patient, the succinic acid peak disappeared during treatment and reappeared with a clinical relapse. Clearly, the presence of succinic acid that can be rapidly detected by GLC in the CSF excludes pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis and strongly suggests H. influenzae or other bacillary meningitides.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - SQ 26,180, a novel monobactam. I Taxonomy, fermentation and biological properties.
AB  - Strains of Chromobacterium violaceum, isolated from various environments, were found to produce a novel monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic. The antibiotic, SQ 26,180 was weakly active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with the exception of mutants hypersensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics. The compound was highly stable to beta-lactamases and acted as an inhibitor of the P99 enzyme from Enterobacter cloacae. SQ 26,180 showed affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1a, 4 and 5/6 of Escherichia coli and inhibited R61 DD-carboxypeptidases.
TI  - In vitro activity of N-formimidoyl-thienamycin in comparison to that of moxalactam and cefotaxime against gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The inhibitory and bactericidal activity of N-formimidoyl-thienamycin in vitro against 131 clinical isolates selected for their gentamicin resistance was compared with that of cefotaxime and moxalactam. All strains were inhibited by N-formimidoyl-thienamycin concentrations within a range of 0.12-4 mg/l. N-formimidoyl-thienamycin was less active than cefotaxime and moxalactam against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., and more active than all other antibiotics tested against Serratia spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. In contrast to the other antibiotics N-formimidoyl-thienamycin showed a narrow margin of difference between minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations. N-formimidoyl-thienamycin is a promising antibiotic for the treatment of hospital infections with multi-resistant organisms.
TI  - Influence of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris on the  mortality pattern of mice after lethal irradiation with gamma rays.
AB  - The mortality patterns and the LD50/30 for mice free from Enterobacteriaceae, mice contaminated with Enterobacter cloacae, and mice inoculated with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Proteus vulgaris were examined after whole-body irradiation with gamma rays. no clear differences were observed among the infected groups, but there were clear differences between then and those negative for Enterobacteriaceae. The LD50/30 of Enterobacteriaceae-positive mice was similar to that for conventional mice. All 4 nonpathogenic Enterobacteriaceae had very similar detrimental effects on mice after lethal irradiation.
TI  - In vitro comparison of cefotetan with five other cephalosporins against nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefotetan against Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacterial strains including nonfermenting species has been compared with that of cefoxitin, cefotaxim, moxalactam, cefoperazone and ceftazidime by use of an agar dilution method. Cefotetan was found to be inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species and only moderately active against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Enterobacter cloacae. It was more active than cefoxitin and cefoperazone against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and indole-positive Proteus strains.
TI  - Clinical efficacy of cefotaxime in serious infections.
AB  - Thirty-five patients underwent 38 treatment courses with cefotaxime. Documented infections included 11 bacteremias, 7 cases of nosocomial pneumonia, 6 surgical wound infections, 3 bone infections, 1 biliary infection, and 1 urinary tract infection. Granulocytopenic patients with fever received 15 courses of empiric cefotaxime therapy alone; in 8 courses, no definite site of infection or pathogen was isolated. Broad-spectrum antibiotics had been administered to 23 patients before cefotaxime. Thirty-seven bacterial pathogens were isolated from 25 patients. Three such pathogens were resistant to cefotaxime and required alternative therapies. Pathogenic isolates included 13 Serratia marcescens, 12 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 Escherichia coli, 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Providencia stuartii, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Haemophilus influenzae, 1 Enterococcus, and 1 Staphylococcus aureus. Of the treatment courses, 25 of 38 resulted in a favorable response to cefotaxime, including 9 of 15 in granulocytopenic patients. Superinfection was seen in one patient. The emergence of resistance was documented in another patient. Of 15 patients with multiply resistant pathogens, 12 improved with cefotaxime. Of 12 patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 favorably responded. Possible complications of cefotaxime were observed in 14 of 42 treatment courses. Cefotaxime is most useful in treatment of infections due to multiply resistant, gram-negative pathogens other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Complementary activity of mezlocillin and the combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid on Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The MICs of amoxicillin, mezlocillin and BRL 25,000, a combination of two parts amoxicillin and one part clavulanic acid (2AM + 1CA), were measured for 331 Enterobacteriaceae strains which produced beta-lactamases as demonstrated by nitrocefin. The MIC values for mezlocillin and the combination 2AM + 1CA were very similar for the total number of the strains investigated. When investigated separately according to the bacterial species, three different sensitivity groups were established for the above-mentioned preparations: 1) species with the same or similar sensitivity to mezlocillin and 2AM + 1CA (Escherichia coli and Shigella spp., amoxicillin-resistant strains); 2) species which were more sensitive to mezlocillin than to the combination 2AM + 1CA (Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia spp. and indole-positive Proteus as well as strains of E. coli and Shigella spp. which produce a cephalosporinase and are sensitive to amoxicillin); 3) species which are more sensitive to 2AM + 1CA than to mezlocillin (amoxicillin-resistant Salmonella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae). This complementary activity of mezlocillin and 2AM + 1CA against Enterobacteriaceae depended on the beta-lactamases produced.
TI  - Effect of clindamycin prophylaxis on the colonic microflora in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.
AB  - Clindamycin was given intravenously to 15 patients undergoing colorectal surgery  in an initial dose of 600 mg, given at induction of anesthesia followed by 6 doses of 600 mg at 8-h intervals. Series of serum samples and fecal specimens were taken for analysis of clindamycin concentrations. Tissue samples from the gut wall were taken at surgery. The highest serum concentrations observed occurred 30 min after administration of clindamycin and varied between 6.8 and 37.9 microgram/ml (mean, 14.8 +/- 2.0 [standard error] microgram/ml). The clindamycin concentrations in the tissue samples were between 1.8 and 13.0 microgram/g. Clindamycin concentration in the fecal samples varied between 2.1 and 460 microgram/g. Fecal samples were also collected during the investigation period for cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Among the aerobic bacteria, enterococci and streptococci decreased during the prophylaxis period. Anaerobic bacteria also decreased significantly during the same period. After the clindamycin administration period, enterococci, streptococci and anaerobic bacteria proliferated. No anaerobic strains resistant to clindamycin were isolated. Postoperative infections due to Streptococcus faecalis and different enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Klebsiella occurred in five patients.
TI  - The inhibition of beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria by clavulanic acid.
AB  - The beta-lactamase from Klebsiella pneumoniae E70 behaved in a similar fashion to the TEM-2 plasmid mediated enzyme on reaction with clavulanic acid. Both enzymes produced two types of enzyme-clavulanate complex, a transiently stable species (t((1/2))=4min at pH7.3 and 37 degrees C) and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. In the initial rapid reaction (2.5min) the enzymes partitioned between the transient and irreversible complexes in the ratios 3:1 for TEM-2 beta-lactamase and 1:1 for Klebsiella beta-lactamase. Biphasic inactivation was observed for both enzymes and the slower second phase was rate limited by the decay of the transiently stable complex. This decay released free enzyme for further reaction with fresh clavulanic acid, the products again partitioning between transiently stable and irreversibly inhibited enzyme. This cycle continued until all the enzyme had been irreversibly inhibited. A 115 molar excess of inhibitor was required to achieve complete inactivation of TEM-2 beta-lactamase. Hydrolysis of clavulanic acid with product release appeared to occur with the inhibition reaction, which explained this degree of clavulanic acid turnover. The stoichiometry of the interaction with Klebsiella beta-lactamase was not examined. The penicillinase from Proteus mirabilis C889 was rapidly inhibited by low concentrations of clavulanic acid. The major product was a moderately stable complex (t((1/2))=40min at pH7.3 and 37 degrees C); the proportion of the enzyme that was irreversibly inactivated was small. The cephalosporinase from Enterobacter cloacae P99 had low affinity for the inhibitor and only reacted with high concentrations of clavulanic acid (k=4.0m(-1).s(-1)) to produce a relatively stable complex (t((1/2))=180min at pH7.3 and 37 degrees C). No irreversible inactivation of this enzyme was detected. The rates of decay of the clavulanate-enzyme complexes produced in reactions with Proteus and Enterobacter enzymes were markedly increased at acid pH.
TI  - Clinical laboratory evaluation of the automicrobic system Enterobacteriaceae biochemical card.
AB  - The AutoMicrobic System Enterobacteriaceae Biochemical Card (AMS-EBC; Vitek Systems, Inc.) was evaluated in two clinical microbiology laboratories. A total of 502 consecutive clinical isolates representing members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were tested in parallel with the AMS-EBC, API 20E, and Enterotube II systems. Discrepancies between systems were resolved with the conventional methods of Edwards and Ewing (P. R. Edwards and W. H. Ewing [ed.], Identification of Enterobacteriaceae, 1972) and Ewing and Martin (W. H. Ewing and W. J. Martin, in Manual of Clinical Microbiology, 1974) AMS-EBC correctly identified 96.6% and incorrectly identified 3.4% of the isolates. When 12 or more isolates of a species were evaluated, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae posed the greatest challenge to the systems, with 92.6, 95.2, and 95.3%, respectively, being correctly identified. To confirm the accuracy of identification when all systems agreed, 93 randomly selected isolates were identified by conventional methods. The percent agreement was 100%. The reproducibility of triplicate determinations on 93 randomly selected isolates with the AMS-EBC was 99.6%. The AMS-EBC was found to be an easy, rapid, and accurate method for identification of Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Behaviour of ceftazidime towards beta-lactamases.
AB  - from Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the geometric mean of the inhibition constant Ki used to measure this interaction was 120 and almost 700 times higher with ceftazidime than with cefotaxime and cefuroxime, respectively. Two other beta-lactamases isolated from Pr. vulgaris and Klebsiella oxytoca also showed little or no interaction with ceftazidime. A complementary microbiological technique, the "double-disc" technique, indicated that ceftazidime was more stable than cefotaxime to all beta-lactamases tested. Moxalactam, however, appeared to have slightly greater stability.
TI  - The in-vivo antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (Gr 20263)--a comparison with other new beta-lactam antibiotics and gentamicin.
AB  - Ceftazidime was compared with cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime, cefotiam, cefoperazone, moxalactam, piperacillin, carbenicillin, mezlocillin, cefsulodin and the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin in a series of mouse protection tests. Ceftazidime, together with the other cephalosporin antibiotics and moxalactam were equally effective against infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus with ED50 values ranging from 3.5 to 25 mg/kg. Gentamicin was the most active antibiotic with ED50 values of 0.4 and 1.6 mg/kg. Ceftazidime showed excellent activity against Enterobacteriaceae with ED50 values ranging from 0.2-0.9 mg/kg for Escherichia coli strains, 1.1-13.8 mg/kg for indole positive and negative Proteus spp, and 0.1-25 for Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia spp. Similar activity against many of the test strains of Enterobacteriaceae was found for gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime and moxalactam, although cefotiam and cefoperazone were significantly less active than ceftazidime. Ceftazidime was significantly more active than the other beta-lactam antibiotics tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections with ED50 values ranging from 02-108 mg/kg. Only the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin, with ED(50,S) 0.6-6.3 mg/kg, was as effective as ceftazidime. Very poor activity was found for moxalactam, cefoperazone, piperacillin, carbenicillin and mezlocillin against the majority of the test strains of Pseudomonas. The results of these in-vivo indicate that ceftazidime is a promising potential alternative to aminoglycoside antibiotics.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (GR 20263) against routine hospital isolates and highly resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Ceftazidime was found to be highly active against routine hospital isolates of strains of Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis, with the mean MICs varying between 0.11 and 0.75 mg/l. It had marked activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a mean MIC of 1.8 mg/l which was comparable to tobramycin (11 mg/l) and superior to other aminoglycosides, penicillins and cefotaxime. Although ceftazidime was considerably more active than cefuroxime and cefamandole against E. coli, K. aerogenes and Ent. cloacae, its activity against strains with multi-antibiotic resistance and marked beta-lactamase production was much diminished, with mean MICs between 5 and 21 mg/l. These results with ceftazidime suggest it will be a valuable parenteral compound in the treatment of severe bacterial infections due to strains of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Successful treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis with moxalactam.
AB  - Meningitis caused by enteric gram-negative bacilli is relatively uncommon but is  very difficult to treat despite susceptibility in vitro to many antimicrobics. A major problem appears to be poor entry of many drugs into the central nervous system. Moxalactam is an investigational cephalosporin that attains concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid that are 15% to 30% of contemporaneous serum concentrations; moreover, it is quite active against many of the enteric gram-negative bacilli. We used moxalactam to treat meningitis caused by Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli in four adults and one child, giving up to 100 mg/kg body weight per day by intravenous injection. The concentrations of moxalactam in serum, lumbar, and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid exceeded the minimal lethal concentrations of all causative bacteria. The patients were cured. In this small series, moxalactam, when administered intravenously as the sole agent of therapy, was effective in the treatment of meningitis caused by susceptible gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of FR-31564, a phosphonic acid antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activity of FR-31564 [sodium hydrogen 3-(N-hydroxyformamido)propylphosphate] against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was investigated and compared with that of fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The in vitro activity of FR-31564 was markedly enhanced when combined with glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate, but not when combined with ribose phosphate, adenosine monophosphate, or glycerol phosphate. In vitro activity of FR-31564 also was enhanced by human or horse blood, but not by human serum. The type of medium had a great effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations achieved on nutrient agar, 8- to 16-fold less than with Mueller-Hinton, heart infusion, or Trypticase soy agars. FR-31564 was more active than fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes, and Citrobacter. It was less active than fosfomycin against Serratia marcescens and Proteus mirabilis and did not inhibit gram-positive cocci or anaerobic species. FR-31564 inhibited a number of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and some Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to the other agents. In the presence and absence of human blood FR-31564 showed bactericidal activity, and P. aeruginosa exposed to FR-31564 for 3 h showed a 6-h lag in regrowth. FR-31564 administered by the subcutaneous route was more active in protecting mice challenged with P. aeruginosa than was fosfomycin, carbenicillin, or cefoperazone. It was as active by the oral route in protecting mice challenged with E. coli as was fosfomycin, ampicillin, cephalexin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.
TI  - Effect of combination of cefsulodin and mecillinam.
AB  - The effect of cefsulodin in combination with mecillinam was examined against a wide range of bacterial species. The antibacterial spectrum was widened by the combination of cefsulodin and mecillinam in the ratio of 5:1 and 10:1. In overall observations, in the in vitro test, a synergistic effect against clinical isolates was found on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, and an additive effect was found on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus inconstans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In in vivo tests, a synergistic effect was observed on S. marcescens TN 66 and K. pneumoniae DT infections and an additive effect was observed on S. aureus 308 A-1, E. coli O-111 and T-7, C. freundii TN 518, E. cloacae TN 603, P. vulgaris GN 4712, P. morganii Tn 373 and P. aeruginosa U 31 infections.
TI  - Differences between ceftizoxime and its stereoisomer in antibacterial activity and affinity for penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - A new cephalosporin derivative, ceftizoxime (syn FK 749), and its anti isomer, FR 14060, were compared in antibacterial activity, outer membrane permeability, stability to beta-lactamases, and affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), using Escherichia coli NIHJ JC-2 and Enterobacter cloacae 58-5 as the test organisms. Although ceftizoxime was superior in antibacterial activity to FR 14060, no marked differences between the two agents were found in outer membrane permeability and stability to cephalosporinase. However, the affinity for PBPs and stability to penicillinase of ceftizoxime and FR 14060 differed significantly. Concentrations of ceftizoxime required to reduce [14C]penicillin G binding by 50% were below 1 microgram/ml for PBPs 1a and 1bs of E. cloacae 58-5 and below 3.2 microgram/ml for PBPs 1a and 1bs of E. coli NIHJ JC-2. A more than 10-fold-higher concentration of FR 14060 was required for 50% reduction of (14C]penicillin G binding to PBP 1bs of strains tested. Ceftizoxime was severalfold more stable than FR 14060 to penicillinase, but the antibacterial activity of both drugs against penicillinase-producing E. coli was as strong as against non-penicillinase-producing E. coli. These results indicate that the difference between the two compounds in antibacterial activity is likely to be due to differences in their abilities to inhibit peptidoglycan polymerization.
TI  - Biochemical characteristics and identification of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from meats.
AB  - The isolation and identification of 2,220 Enterobacteriaceae from meats indicated that Escherichia coli biotype I, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Serratia liquefaciens were the principal types to be differentiated in meats. Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterobacter hafniae were also commonly identified. Identification of isolates by the Encise II (Roche Diagnostics Inc., Nutley, N.J.) and Minitek (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) coding systems gave similar results with only 255 (11.5%) discrepancies in identity, but both systems required large numbers of supplementary tests for identification of the isolates. Not only the distribution of Enterobacteriaceae types isolated from meats but also some of the biochemical reactions of the isolates differed from those of clinical isolates. The Minitek technique is recommended because of its versatility. However, with the addition of cellobiose and salicin disks and the inclusion of methyl red to the Minitek test and the use of the Voges-Proskauer test and gas production in EC medium at elevated temperature as standard tests, the identification of these Enterobacteriaceae from meats would be greatly facilitated. The inclusion of the motility test, for example, using nitrate motility agar, would also be of value to Enterobacteriaceae identification.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365).
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. Cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for S. aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. Cefmenoxime was very active against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis with MIC(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. Cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., respectively. MICs for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. In addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. The combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the Enterobacteriaceae and 100% of P. aeruginosa strains tested. Development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial MICs but more rapid for those with higher initial MICs. Cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or S. aureus but was less effective against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Cefotaxime CSF levels in children with purulent meningitis (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefotaxime concentrations obtained in the C.S.F. of twelve children suffering from bacterial meningitis and undergoing monotherapy with this antibiotic are reported. Among these 12 patients, 4 infants (aged 3 to 28 days) had neonatal meningitis (due to Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli); one infant (2 months old) had meningitis due to Salmonella panama; 5 children (aged 5 to 11 months) had meningitis due to Haemophilus; and 2 children had belated superinfection caused by a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt due to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefotaxime concentration reached a high level as early as one hour after the injection (3 to 19 mcg/ml), remained at this level until the fifth hour (1,8 to 14,3 mcg/ml) and decreased without significant proportionality with the disappearance of the inflammatory symptoms. Compared to the M.I.C. of the bacteria which caused the twelve cases of meningitis, these results show that the concentrations in the C.S.F. are much higher than the M.I.C.'s. These results are comparable to those of previous studies. Cefotaxime diffuses in the C.S.F. and gives concentrations which ensures an antibacterial activity that ampicillin could not reach: in particular against Haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Cefonicid: a stable beta-lactamase inhibitor.
AB  - The stability of cefonicid (SK&F 75073) towards representatives of six major classes of beta-lactamases was determined using a spectrophotometric assay. Cefonicid was stable to hydrolysis by the Type I enzyme from Enterobacter cloacae and by the enzyme from the anaerobe, Bacteroides fragilis. It was 6 to 7 times more stable than cefamandole to the Type IIIA and B enzymes from Escherichia coli, a little less stable than this antibiotic to the Type V enzyme from E. coli, and of equal stability to the Type IV enzyme from Klebsiella aerogenes. Cefonicid was a non-competitive inhibitor (Ki of 0.8 x 10(-6)M) of cephalothin hydrolysis by the Type I enzyme.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of fluorinated analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol.
AB  - We evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial activity of Sch 24893, Sch 25298, and Sch 25393, three novel analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. All of the analogs had minimal inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 10 micrograms/ml for 18 chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant strains of Shigella dysenteriae and 21 strains of resistant Salmonella typhi. The analogs were also more active than were chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol against chloramphenicol-resistant enteric bacteria, including six strains of Escherichia coli, seven strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and two strains of Enterobacter cloacae. Fifty-three strains of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae were uniformly susceptible to chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and the three analogs. Sch 25298 was the most active compound tested (minimal inhibitory concentration, 0.5 microgram/ml for all strains). Four of seven chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant Haemophilus strains were susceptible to the fluorinated analogs. Of the three Haemophilus strains which were resistant to chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and the analogs, two contained less than 10% of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity of the strains which were resistant to only chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. We conclude that fluorinated analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol have considerable in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant, gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - A comparison of cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone:  an in vitro test on a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of 9 species and 1 genus of bacteria.
AB  - The sensitivity of a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens to cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone was determined in vitro. All bacterial cultures were examined for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic cephalosporin compound 87/312. All strains were typed by means of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic sensitivities. Only non-identical strains were used. A tray method was used to determine the quantity of antimicrobial product necessary for a complete growth inhibition at various culture dilutions. The results showed that all strains of H. influenzae, especially in the dilution 2.10(6), were sensitive to the five cephalosporins. The other species and genus of bacteria had a varying sensitivity to the five cephalosporins. Cefoperazone had potent activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Differences between the five cephalosporins with regard to the effect of culture dilution were only small.
TI  - Cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. Cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. Variation in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. In Escherichia coli cefmenoxime showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP-3), followed by PBP-1 (1A and 1B). This affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. The high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Evaluation of the four-hour Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, Gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  - A 4-h Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by API 20E and Micro-ID, using standardized inocula. A total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. Isolates included 96 Escherichia coli, 46 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Klebsiella oxytoca, 8 Enterobacter aerogenes, 17 Enterobacter cloacae, 19 Serratia marcescens, 2 Serratia liquefaciens, 8 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Salmonella species, 1 Morganella morganii, 6 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 Bacteroides fragilis, 3 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 Pseudomonas maltophilia. In 90% of the cultures, identification by Micro-ID was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. Enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct Micro-ID were three S. marcescens (two identified as S. liquefaciens, one as Hafnia alvei), two S. liquefaciens (both identified as E. cloacae), and two K. pneumoniae (one identified as Klebsiella ozaenae, the other as Serratia rubidaea). None of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by Micro-ID (non-identifiable, or classified as Providencia/Yersinia/Klebsiella species). Although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final Micro-ID tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. Direct species identification of Enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct Micro-ID is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct Micro-ID technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.
TI  - [Quantitative and qualitative characteristics of representatives of the enterobacteriaceae family in postradiation intestinal dysbacteriosis].
AB  - The irradiation of CBA mice with gamma quanta in a dose of 700 C/kg resulted in the development of postradiation intestinal dysbacteriosis in the animals. The dysbacteriosis was characterized by a considerable increase in the number of Escherichia and Proteus mirabilis in the large intestine and by the insemination of the small intestine with these microbial associations. Pr. vulgaris, Pr. morganii, Ent. aerogenes, Ent. cloacae, Citrobacter appeared in great numbers in the intestinal tract of the irradiated mice, while none of these organisms were found in the intact mice.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefotaxime, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative, showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against clinically isolated strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. This cephalosporin was slightly less active than cefazolin against Staphylococcus aureus but 4 to 300 times as active as carbenicillin against gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens. Cefotaxime was the most active compound against members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 20- to 100-fold more active than cefoxitin against the indole-positive Proteus group. The minimal bactericidal concentrations of the compound were identical to, or two times higher than, the minimal inhibitory concentrations against Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa and four times higher against S. marcescens. A reduction of inoculum size decreased greatly the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of cefotaxime against E. coli P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens. The antibiotic was very stable to penicillinase and cephalosporinase produced by gram-negative bacteria, including Proteus vulgaris.
TI  - Relation of antibody-coated urine bacteria to the site(s) of infection in experimental dogs.
AB  - Antibody-coated bacteria tests, using fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-canine immunoglobulin (Ig)G and anti-IgA, were conducted on 77 specimens of bladder urine obtained by antepubic cystocentesis from 25 dogs with urinary tract infections. Urine specimens from 3 dogs infected with Staphylococcus aureus were tested a total of 27 times, specimens from 10 dogs infected with Escherichia coli were tested 25 times, urine from 6 dogs infected with Proteus mirabilis was sampled and tested 18 times, urine from 3 dogs with Klebsiella pneumoniae was sampled and tested 4 times, and specimens from 3 dogs infected with P rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, or Streptococcus faecalis were tested once each. Specimens of urine from the renal pelves of each dogs were obtained by percutaneous nephropyelocentesis at the same time as the specimens of bladder urine. The results of bacterial cultures of these specimens were compared with the results of the corresponding antibody-coated bacteria tests. False-positive results (ie, evidence of antibody coating of bladder urine bacteria but no bacterial growth from corresponding renal pelvis urine specimens) were obtained in 13 of 22 (59%) tests of dogs infected with S aureus, 12 of 13 (92%) tests in dogs infected with P mirabiis, 5 of 18(28%) tests in dogs infected with E coli, and 1 of 4 (25%) tests in dogs infected with K pneumoniae. False-negative results (ie, bacterial growth from renal pelvis urine specimens but no evidence of antibody coating of bacteria in the corresponding specimen of bladder urine) occurred in 5 of 7 (71%) specimens infected with E coli, in 4 of 5 (80%) specimens infected with P mirabilis, and in 5 of 5 (100%) specimens infected with S aureus. It was concluded that the antibody-coated bacteria test does not provide accurate information to support the diagnosis of pyelonephritis in the dog.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftizoxime, a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftizoxime was compared with that of other beta-lactam  antibiotics against 538 isolates. Ceftizoxime was the most active agent tested against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, inhibiting 80% at 0.025 microgram/ml. It was more active than cefotaxime against Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes. Ceftizoxime was more active than cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, and carbenicillin against Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus. It inhibited 97% of multiresistant Serratia isolates at 12.5 microgram/ml, whereas cefotaxime inhibited only 19%. Ceftizoxime was less active than cefotaxime and cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was more active than carbenicillin. It was more active than cefotaxime and cefoxitin against Bacteroides. It was not appreciably destroyed by beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, or Pseudomonas.
TI  - Effect of contamination levels on antimicrobial susceptibilities tested by Autobac I.
AB  - Two gram-positive and five gram-negative species of bacteria commonly isolated from clinical specimens were used in 704 different inoculum ratios against 11 antimicrobial agents to study the effect of contamination levels on the susceptibility patterns of mixed cultures. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae were used in 12 combinations of two each. The pure culture inoculum tubes were prepared according to Autobac I (Pfizer Inc.) instructions. Various amounts from 0.01 to 2.0 ml of one bacterial inoculum were mixed with various amounts of the other bacterial inoculum to form 16 mixtures to low-thymidine eugonic broth. In the majority of cases, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents started to change at 12.5% contamination level. Of 1,936 mixtures with 5% contamination levels, 98.5 to 99.2% exhibited the same susceptibilities as did the pure cultures. These results suggest that generally contamination levels of more than 5% or 70,000 to 150,000 bacteria per ml, are responsible for a significant change in apparent drug susceptibility.
TI  - [Interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "Enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  - Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (gammaGT) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-L-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. The following species produced gamma GT: Citrobacter freundii, Levinea malonatica, L. amalonatica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, Hafnia alvei, Erwinia carotovora, Serratia marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, S. marinorubra, S. odorifera, S. ficaria, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, P. rettgeri, Providencia alcalifaciens, P. stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Most strains of Escherichia coli and Alkalescens Dispar group are gamma GT+. The following species did not produce gammaGT: Shigella sonnei, Edwardsiella tarda, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and Yersinia pestis. Within the Salmonella, most strains of subgenus I, II and IV, and diphasic strains of subgenus III (S. arizonae) produced gamma GT, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus III did not produce gammaGT. Salmonella enteritidis (gammaGT+) and S. dublin (gammaGT-) can readily be distinguished. This test (gammaGT) could also serve as a biochemical marker for S. typhi-murium strains. Shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammaGT+ whereas other serotypes were gammaGT-. Within S. flexneri serotype 6, varieties Boyd 88 and Newcastle were found gammaGT+; and varieties Sussex and Manchester were gammaGT-. The use of gammaGT test as an epidemiological marker for other Shigella serotypes is suggested.
TI  - [Diagnosis of fecal coliforms in dairy products by the temperature tests].
AB  - The study concerned the formation of gas and acid in broth with lactose and glucose and brilliant green at 30,37 and 44 degrees C and of indole in peptone water at 30, 37 and 44 degrees C by 842 coliform strains isolated from 386 samples of dairy products (E. coli I--496, E. coli--51, Citrob. freundi--87, Citrob. intermedium--46, Enterobacter aerogenes--98, Enterobacter cloacae -- 32 and K1. aerogenes 32). It was found that Eijkman's test (formation of gas and acid from lactose in broth with brilliant green at 44 degrees C) yields no real results and cannot be used for rapid differentiation of the fecal coliforms. The test of McKenzie, Taylor and Gilbert (formation of gas and acid from lactose in broth with brilliant green at 44 degrees C and indole at 44 degrees C) gives satisfactory results for quick determination of the expected E. coli I amount. E. coli I amount should be determined solely on the basis of IMVIC tests.
TI  - Association of human enteric pathogenicity and mouse lung toxicity of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Mouse lung toxicity of 439 strains (431 Escherichia coli, 1 Shigella dysenteriae  1, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 5 Vibrio sp., 1 Klebsiella) was compared to other pathogenicity tests (mouse virulence, enterotoxicity, guinea pig eye test), to serogroup distribution, loss of virulence on storage, origin and haemolytic activity. Mouse lethality was highest in serogroup O4 (p < 0.001), O18a,c (p < 0.001); serogroups O6, O20, O75, O115, O147 were next in order. E. coli serogroups O19, O26, O28a,b, O32, O51, O53, O55, O73, O78, O79, O83, O105, O111, O112, O114, O117, O119, O124, O129, O136, O142 failed to show lung toxicity. Strains O4 and O18 isolated at different periods of time did not differ significantly in the lung test (p = 0.05, p = 0.01, p > 0.1, p = 0.05, p > 0.1). There was no significant difference between strains isolated from the stools of patients with enteritis and of healthy individuals (p = 0.1, p > 0.99) and between those isolated from all faecal specimens and from extraintestinal samples (p = 0.05, p > 0.3). There was no correlation between lung toxicity and other pathogenicity tests. Since strains isolated from healthy individuals were also toxic for mice, a positive lung test cannot be considered a criterion of the aetiological role of the agent.
TI  - Nature of streptomycin resistance in enterobacteria from faeces of streptomycin-treated patients in Egypt.
AB  - Streptomycin-resistant enterobacteria were isolated from the faeces of 31 out of  35 patients under streptomycin therapy, in the University Hospital of Alexandria. The isolated bacteria were 26 Escherichia coli, 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 2 Enterobacter cloacae. Their resistance patterns have shown that 80% had multiple antibiotic resistance. The MIC of streptomycin for all strains was higher than 312 microgram/ml. Nearly 90% of these strains carried resistance plasmids. However, 3 strains possessed no plasmids and were assumed to be mutants. 60% of the plasmid-carrying strains have been able to transfer the resistance by conjugation. The rest have shown small plasmids, some of them were characterized by streptomycin and sulphonamide resistance and a molecular weight of 4.1 mega-daltons.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of heparin.
AB  - Single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. At heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 U/ml, the effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter spp. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. All 10 isolates of S. aureus and all 10 of S. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 U/ml. Three E. coli, four P. aeruginosa, and nine C. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 U of heparin per ml. None of the K. pneumoniae, E. aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 U/ml. Heparin inhibition of S. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 U of heparin per ml could be quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. These data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of cefoperazone (T-1551), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefoperazone, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin, has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It is as active as cefazolin and cefamandole against gram-positive bacteria and is more active than cefazolin and cefamandole against such gram-negative bacilli as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens. The superiority of cefoperazone over cefazolin and cefamandole with respect to activity against P. aeruginosa by more than 200-fold was especially remarkable. As with other beta-lactam antibiotics, there was only a small spread between the minimum inhibitory concentrations and the minimum bactericidal concentrations of cefoperazone and a significant decrease in activity with an increase in inoculum size. Activity was not altered significantly by the addition of human serum to the test medium. Cefoperazone is relatively stable to hydrolysis to beta-lactamases produced by gram-negative bacteria. Relative rates of hydrolysis of cefoperazone by cephalosporinases are 7.0 to 0.01, with reference to cephaloridine hydrolysis (base, 100). Cefoperazone is also more stable than penicillin G and cephaloridine to various types of penicillinases.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo laboratory studies on three hydroxyiminophenylacetyl cephalosporins with particular reference to SK&F 80303, an unusually long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - Three cephalosporins with 7-(2-hydroxyiminophenylacetamido) side chains (SK&F 79433, 80000 and 80303), differing in their 3-substituents, exhibited similar broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and various Gram-negative bacilli. All three were active in vivo (s.c., mouse) against S. aureus, Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae, but they differed significantly in serum pharmacokinetic profiles. SK&F 80303 produced high and extremely prolonged serum levels and protected mice when administered up to 24 hours prior to challenge with beta-lactamase-producing S. aureus or K. pneumoniae. It was resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases from S. aureus, and variably so to beta-lactamases from E. coli strains. SK&F 80303 was bacteriolytic to logarithmically growing S. aureus, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae (partially). SK&F 80303 illustrates further the effect of the 3-sulfoalkyltetrazole substituent on the pharmacokinetic properties of cephalosporins. Its combined biological properties make it a possible candidate for therapeutic and long-term prophylactic use.
TI  - Competition of beta-lactam antibiotics for the penicillin-binding proteins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus rettgeri, and Escherichia coli: comparison with antibacterial activity and effects upon bacterial morphology.
AB  - The competition of a number of beta-lactam morphogenic probes for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus rettgeri, and Escherichia coli has been studied. The results indicate that the various gram-negative bacteria have similar, but not identical, PBP patterns and that the individual proteins probably perform similar morphogenic functions as in E. coli K-12. Comparison of the 50% binding concentrations of the compounds for the various PBPs of the five strains with their antibacterial activity indicates that the different antibiotics are excluded to a greater or lesser degree by the outer membrane permeability barrier and that the exclusion is most pronounced in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Silver-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from hospital patients.
AB  - The inclusion of agar medium containing 0.5 mM AgNO3 in the hospital laboratory replicating system for routine antibiotic-susceptibility determinations resulted in identification of species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Citrobacter freundii) with silver resistance. Since the study began in October, 1975, 11 in-hospital patients receiving silver sulfadiazine for burn wound prophylaxis have yielded silver-resistant bacteria from their infected burns. During this treatment routine burn-site cultures from these patients yielded 230 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, including 211 which were sulfonamide-resistant, 97 of which were also silver-resistant, and 38 of which were untested for silver resistance. Seven silver-resistant but sulfonamide-sensitive isolates were incidentally recovered from respiratory specimens from four nonburn patients with silver tracheostomy tubes, one silver-resistant sulfonamide-sensitive isolate was recovered from a small infected burn on the foot of an Emergency Room patient. Previous treatment of this burn was unknown. Representative AgNO3-resistant E. coli isolates from four patients were serologically untypable. Serotyping of representative isolates of K. pneumoniae showed a diversity of types except from two patients who had been in the same ward at the same time.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal effect of ceforanide (BL-S 786) and five other cephalosporins in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of ceforanide was compared, in an in vitro kinetic model, with that of five other cephalosproins: cephalothin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin. Cultures of various pathogens in 95% human serum were incubated for 12 hours in the presence of the cephalosporins whose concentrations were modified periodically-by addition of a concentrated solution of drug or dilution with unmedicated serum-in order to simulate the variation of antibiotic concentration in human blood after one-gram intramuscular dose. One Gram-positive strain and six Gram-negative strains were used. Bactericidal activity was assessed by monitoring changes in the number of colony-forming units. Tests showed that against Klebsiella pneumoniae, ceforanide was the most active of the six cephalosporins. Proteus mirabilis was more susceptible to ceforanide and cefuroxime than to the other compounds; Enterobacter cloacae to ceforanide, cefuroxime, and cefamandole; Escherichia coli to ceforanide, cefuroxime, cefamandole, and cefazolin. The number of viable cells of Staphylococcus aureus was reduced below detectable levels by all cephalosporins except cefoxitin. On the other hand, Providencia stuartii was virtually unaffected by all of the cephalosporins except cefoxitin.
TI  - Comparison of assay of coliform enterotoxins by conventional techniques versus in vivo intestinal perfusion.
AB  - Thirty-six strains of coliform bacteria were tested for enterotoxigenicity both by conventional assays, including the Y-1 adrenal and Chinese hamster ovary cell assays for heat-labile toxin and the suckling mouse assay for heat-stable toxin, and by determining the ability of graded concentrations of ultrafiltrate high- or low-molecular-weight toxin preparations to induce water secretion during in vivo perfusion in the rat jejunum. The ultrafiltrates of all 18 strains isolated from persons with infectious diarrheal disease, including seven of Escherichia coli, seven of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and four of Enterobacter cloacae, contained one (nine strains) or two (nine strains) potent toxin fractions (resembling either heat-labile or heat-stable toxin in terms of apparent molecular weight and heat lability characteristics) that induced water secretion at perfusion concentrations of 10 ng/ml or less. Unconcentrated broth filtrates of five of the E. coli strains and two of Klebsiella reacted positively in one or more of the conventional assay systems. Concentrated ultrafiltrates from two strains that were negative in the in vitro assays for heat-labile toxin were tested and also proved to be inactive in these test systems. None of 18 strains isolated from control sources produced, in the ultrafiltrates, enterotoxins capable of inducing water secretion at low concentrations, and none reacted positively in the conventional assays. These results indicate that some strains of coliform bacteria elaborate potent toxin materials that are capable of inducing water secretion and can be detected by perfusion of concentrated ultrafiltrates but not by conventional assay systems for enterotoxigenicity. Whether this represents quantitative or qualitative differences between the toxin materials that stimulate these different test systems remains to be established.
TI  - Physical characterization of ten R plasmids obtained from an outbreak of nosocomial Klebsiella pneumoniae infections.
AB  - Gentamicin resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae involved in an outbreak at the Minneapolis Veterans Administration Hospital was due to a transmissible R plasmid. In addition to gentamicin, this plasmid conferred resistance to tobramycin, kanamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and sulfathiazole. R plasmids which transferred this complex antibiogram were identified in several clinical isolates, including four different serotypes of K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus morganii. The covalently closed circular form of all R plasmids isolated had a sedimentation coefficient of 76S to 77S, corresponding to a molecular weight of 58 x 10(6). The possibility that a single R plasmid was responsible for the dissemination of multiple drug resistance among all of these different clinical strains was examined by characterizing the plasmids by using EcoRI restriction endonuclease. The same 15 fragments were obtained from each of the 10 plasmids analyzed. Their molecular weights ranged from 4 x 10(5) to 11 x 10(6). Thus, we conclude that each of the 10 plasmids present in the various clinical strains isolated from the hospital over a 7-month period originated from a common source and that R plasmid transfer was important in their spread.
TI  - [On the contamination of the citric acid fermentation. I. The contamination by representatives of Enterobacteriaceae (author's transl)].
AB  - Among the most dangerous bacterial contaminations of the citric acid fermentation is the so-called brown contamination, which is called forth by non pathogenic representatives of Enterobacteriaceae like Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, while other bacteria do not produce the mentioned contamination. There is given a comprehensive characterization of the brown contamination. Enterobacteriaceae interrupt the growth of the mycelium of the mold Aspergillus niger and stop the production of citric acid, produce a characteristic repugnant smell and reduce nitrate to nitrite. In a case of weak contamination the phenomena of the brown contamination do not appear, but the yield of citric acid is rather low. The contamination may be transferred successfully within the first 24 hrs. of incubation. The effect of the bacteria is determined by their virulence and some other factors.
TI  - [Numerical taxonomic studies on enterobacteria of surface-water (author's transl)].
AB  - 435 enterobacterial strains of surface-water were tested in 35 physiological characters and classified numerically by a single-linkage procedure. The relations of similarity are shown in a "Vernetzungsdiagramm" (connected graph, Fig. 1). Tab. 1 specifies the characters of the taxa, which were formed graphically. The following facts are the result of this taxonomic classification: 1. 32% of the Escherichia group are KCN-positive. In addition it was found that 60% of the E. coli isolated from the faeces of wild ducks were KCN-positive. 2. The type strains of the species Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella aerogenes show a far reaching conformity in their physiological character. The splitting into two genera does not seem to be of significance any longer. 3. By reason of the "Vernetzungsdiagramm" and the table of characters (Tab. 1) we propose to regroup the genera Enterobacter and Erwinia. The genus Erwinia represented here by bacteria of the Herbicola-Lathyri-group is clearly divided into two groups. In the discussion we propose for Erwinia I the name of Enterobacter agglomerans and for Erwinia II the name of Enterobacter herbicola. 4. The taxa Kluyvera and Levinea are placed in the vicinity of Enterobacter cloacae and Erwinia II (Enterobacter herbicola), respectively.
TI  - Gas liquid chromatography for detection of bacteriuria: examination for volatile  acidic and neutral compounds.
AB  - Direct injection of clinically infected urines on porous-polymer columns was investigated to determine which microbial metabolites were consistently detectable, and whether their presence could be used as a reliable index of infection. Chromosorb 101 was found to be the most suitable porous polymer for the detection of microbial metabolites; greater sensitivity of detection was achieved by partial purification of the urine before injection. Acetic acid was the only compound found consistently and it enabled 10(6) microorganisms per ml to be detected in urine. However, as urinary tract infection is diagnosed by the presence of 10(5) organisms or more per ml, our method is insufficiently sensitive for the detection of bacteriuria. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp, Proteus spp, Stapyhlococcus albus, and Streptocococcus faecalis were detectable by our method but Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were not.
TI  - Enterotoxigenicity of colonising coliform bacteria in tropical sprue and blind-loop syndrome.
AB  - The enterotoxigenicity of strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli, which represented the predominant coliform species isolated from the jejunum of 12 patients with tropical sprue and 5 with the blind-loop syndrome, was quantitatively assessed in terms of the ability of toxin preparations to induce water secretion as assayed by in-vivo perfusion in the rat jejunum. All 12 patients with sprue harboured 1 or more highly toxigenic strains--14 of the 16 strains isolated from this group produced heat-labile and/or heat-stable toxins which were as potent as toxins derived from strains isolated from persons with acute diarrhoea and documented as toxigenic. None of the 9 strains isolated from patients with the blind-loop syndrome produced potent toxins. This difference between the coliform bacteria in sprue and the blind-loop syndrome probably accounts, at least partly, for the different intestinal response in these two disorders to contamination by these organisms.
TI  - Differentiation of Serratia marcescens and Serratia liquefaciens by tests for lipase and phospholipase production.
AB  - The production of lipase and phospolipase by certain members of the Enterobacteriaceae was examined by thin-layer chromatography of resting-cell suspensions incubated with triolein or lecithin. Most strains of Serratia marcescens produced both enzymes while most strains of Serratia liquefaciens exhibited strong lipase but only a minor phospholipase activity. Enterobacter spp. (25 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (20 strains), Escherichia coli (15 strains), Citrobacter freundii (7 strains) and Proteus spp. (20 strains) lacked both types of enzymic activity except for the following: three strains of Enterobacter cloacae, two of Proteus mirabilis and three of Proteus vulgaris possessed slight lipase activity; about one-half of the Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter hafniae strains examined produced slight phospholipase activity. It is suggested that tests for lipase and phospholipase should be used in conjunction with those for DNAase production and sugar fermentation for the differentiation of S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens.
TI  - Reversal of jejunal water secretion by glucose in rats exposed to coliform enterotoxins.
AB  - Glucose absorption and glucose-facilitated water transport were assessed in rats  exposed to semipurified preparations of the heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae by in vivo jejunal perfusion of these toxins alone and with varying amounts of glucose. Progressive increases in the glucose concentration of from 12 to 56 mM resulted in incremental rises in water absorption from perfusates containing each of these toxins, with similar delta water values to those for the electrolyte perfusion solution without toxins. Water secretion was reversed to absorption by the addition of 12 mM glucose when secretion was mild, but 24 mM was required to achieve this in the presence of severe secretion; absolute values for water transport did not return to normal in any instance. Glucose absorption from solutions containing 24 and 56 mM glucose was severely reduced by all of the ST toxins and marginally reduced by some of the LT toxins; the effect of LT was not attributable to the toxin itself, however, but to another unidentified factor present in LT, but not ST, preparations from both toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains. These observations indicate that glucose-facilitated water transport remains intact in intestinal tissue exposed to various coliform enterotoxins and that this occurs despite the presence of impaired glucose absorption in some instances. They provide a rational basis for treatment with oral glucose-electrolyte solutions of persons whose diarrhea is caused by toxigenic coliform bacteria.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo studies with BL-S786, cefoxitin, and cefamandole.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of BL-S786, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against 90 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes, were studied by using an agar dilution procedure. Comparison of geometric mean minimal inhibitory concentrations showed that BL-S786 was half as active as cefamandole against Enterobacter species, 2 to 4 times more active than cefamandole against all other species, and 4 to 25 times more active than cefoxitin against all species. In vivo experiments employed acute protection tests in infected mice, using five isolates each of the five genera. Drugs were administered intramuscularly in two doses 3 h apart at dosages of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg per mouse. In most instances, BL-S786 was the most efficacious drug, being some 1.3 to 9.1 times more active than cefoxitin in all experiments and 1.5 to 8.7 times more active than cefamandole in most experiments. BL-S786 and cefamandole were comparable in activity in experiments with E. aerogenes, whereas BL-S786 was superior in experiments with E. cloacae.
TI  - Common plasmid specifying tobramycin resistance found in two enteric bacteria isolated from burn patients.
AB  - Tobramycin-resistant burn wound isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae, together with Escherichia coli K-12 transconjugants from these two strains, were examined for plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). All the resistant strains contained a common, high-molecular-weight, covalently closed circular DNA plasmid that was absent in the tobramycin-susceptible E. coli recipient strain. The common plasmid residing in E. cloacae was designated pIE098, and that residing in K. pneumoniae was designated pIE099. Both plasmid species were found to have a molecular mass of approximately 60 x 10(6) daltons and a guanine-plus-cytosine content of 50 mol%. The DNA that was extracted from all of the tobramycin-resistant strains tested was able to hybridize to 86 to 100% with pIE098 and pIE099 [(3)H]DNA generated by EcoRI to produce fragments of a size similar to those generated by BamHI. This study illustrates the usefulness of simple screening methods for antibiotic resistance plasmids in a hospital epidemiological situation.
TI  - Rapid enumeration of Fecal Coliforms in water by a colorimetric beta-galactosidase assay.
AB  - The colorimetric beta-galactosidase assay is based upon the enzymatic hydrolysis  of the substrate o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside (ONPG) by fecal coliforms. This technique provides an estimate of the fecal coliform concentration within 8 to 20 h. A 100-ml portion of test sample was passed through a 0.45 micrometer membrane filter. This filter was then incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 h in EC medium followed by the addition of filter-sterilized ONPG. The incubation was continued at 44.5 degrees C until a half-maximum absorbance (at 420 nm) was reached. The time between the start of incubation and the half-maximum absorbance was proportional to the concentration of fecal coliforms present. Escherichia coli (K-12) was used to measure the kinetics of substrate hydrolysis and the response time of different cell concentrations. High cell densities produced an immediate response, whereas 1 cell/ml will produce a response in less than 20 h. In field studies in which samples were taken from a range of grossly polluted streams to relatively clean lake water, a linear correlation between ONPG hydrolysis times and fecal coliform most-probable-number values was established. A total of 302 isolates randomly selected from positive ONPG-EC media, which were derived from 11 different habitats, were identified as E. coli (96.69 percent), Enterobacter cloacae (2.32 percent), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.66 percent), and Citrobacter freundii (0.33 percent).
TI  - Lytic activity of a new cephalosporin, cefuroxime, against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Cefuroxime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was inhibitory at low concentrations  to several types of gram-negative bacteria. It was considerably more stable than cephaloridine or cephalothin to the beta-lactamases produced by Escherichia coli (RP1), Klebsiella aerogenes K1 and Enterobacter cloacae P99. Concentrations of cefuroxime much greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were usually necessary to induce lysis of beta-lactamase and non-beta-lactamase producers. In contrast, cephaloridine, cephalothin and ampicillin were rapidly bacteriolytic at, or near, the respective MIC against non-beta-lactamase producers, whereas the activity of these three antibiotics was considerably reduced against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
TI  - Enterotoxin-producing bacteria stools from Swedish United Nations soldiers in Cyprus.
AB  - A study was designed to establish the role of heat-labile enterotoxin producing Escherichia coli and other intestinal pathogens in diarrhoeal disease in Swedish soldiers of the United Nations' Force in Cyprus. Before leaving Sweden for Cyprus, no enteropathogens were isolated from the soldiers. The study was performed from October 1975 through January 1976 and in August 1976. Enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the intestinal pathogens most frequently isolated from the cases of diarrhoea. Such strains were found in 14 of 79 diarrhoeal cases (18%) but also in 6 of 66 (9%) of next-bed-fellow controls and in 7 of 139 (5%) of healthy Cypriotic civilians. Few other pathogens were identified in the soldiers, but 9 of 139 (6%) of the Cypriots were carriers of cysts of Giardia lamblia. The results indicate that enterotoxigenic bacteria were probably the most important cause of diarrhoea of those agents identified among the Swedish UN soldiers on Cyprus. Several soldiers were colonized with these strains without contracting diarrhoea.
TI  - Host-dependent, thermosensitive replication of an R plasmid, pJY5, isolated from  Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - The thermosensitive replication of an R plasmid, pJY5, isolated from Enterobacter cloacae, was studied. pJY5 consisted of 61 million daltons of covalently closed circular (CCC) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) with a buoyant density of 1.714 g/cm3 (55 mol % guanine plus cytosine). In Escherichia coli, this plasmid replicated stringently at 32 degrees C, but ceased its CCC DNA replication after a short incubation at 42 degrees C, resulting in production of R- segregants. The thermosensitive replication of pJY5 was not overcome by the coexistence of non-thermosensitive R plasmids. The plasmid manifested an inhibitory effect on host bacterial cell growth at 42 degrees C, although the effect was less prominent than that of R plasmids belonging to the T-incompatibility group, Rts1, R401, and R402. When the pJY5 plasmid was transferred into E. cloacae, however, no R- segregants were detected at any culture temperature, even 42 degrees C. Alkaline sucrose gradient analysis revealed that a significant amount of pJY5 CCC DNA was synthesized in E. cloacae at the high temperature but not in E. coli. Furthermore, the growth-inhibitory effect of pJY5 on hosts at 42 degrees C was not observed in E. cloacae. On the other hand, Rts1 and R401 were found to be thermosensitive in E. cloacae as well as in E. coli.
TI  - In vitro activities of five oral cephalosporins against aerobic pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Cefaclor (Lilly 99638) and cefatrizine (BL-S640, SK&F 70771) are orally absorbed, broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporins. They were compared in vitro with cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cepharadine against a variety of aerobic pathogenic bacteria by an agar dilution procedure. Cefaclor and cefatrizine were found to be similar or superior to cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cephradine in terms of activity against gram-positive cocci other than enterococci. Only cefatrizine demonstrated any potentially useful activity against some susceptible isolates of enterococci. Cefaclor and cefatrizine also were highly active, equally or more so than the other oral cephalosporins, against several gram-negative species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. None of the cephalosporins were particularly active against Enterobacter cloacae. Both cefaclor and cefatrizine were active against Proteus mirabilis; cefatrizine was uniquely active against indolepositive Proteus species.
TI  - The growth and respiration of bacterial colonies.
AB  - Young colonies of two swarming organisms, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus vulgaris, grew about as quickly on solid media as in liquid culture whilst four non-swarming organisms, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus albus, all grew slower on solid than in liquid media. Oxygen uptake by young colonies of B. subtilis, followed manometrically, increased exponentially at about the same rate as unrestricted aerobic growth. All other colonies demonstrated accelerating respiration which was either not strictly exponential or, in the case of S. albus, definitely biphasic, with a fast then a slow exponential rate of increase. Actual and potential respiration was determined for each species by measuring oxygen uptake before and after resuspending the colony in liquid medium. The ratio of actual to potential respiration was largest in the flat, spreading B. subtilis and smallest in the small, hemispherical S. albus. Calculations suggest that oxygen penetrates between 31 and 41 micron into colonies of B. cereus, Ent. cloacae and E. coli and only 9 micron into colonies of S. albus.
TI  - Clinical study of the use of the new aminoglycoside tobramycin for therapy of infections due to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Tobramycin, a new aminoglycoside antimicrobial, was evaluated as therapy for infections due to Gram-negative bacilli in 15 seriously ill patients with underlying diseases. Three of 10 patients with Gram-negative bacteraemia also had a urinary tract infection. Two patients had a respiratory tract infection, one had cellulitis, one had a urinary tract infection, and another had septic phlebitis. Twelve patients were cured of their infections. Eosinophilia was observed in one patient, and another developed superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus after 6 days of tobramycin therapy. There were five isolates of Escherichia coli, five of Klebsiella sp., two of Pseudomonas sp., and one each of Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae. The average serum concentration of tobramycin 2 hr after a parenteral dose of 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg was 5.1 microgram/ml; higher concentrations of tobramycin were present in urine. Tobramycin proved to be an effective antimicrobial in these patients.
TI  - Immunological interrelationships between cholera toxin and the heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins of coliform bacteria.
AB  - Cholera toxin (CT) and the heat-labile (LT) toxin of Escherichia coli are known to share antigenic properties. The present study examined the immunological relationship of CT and the LT and heat-stable (ST) toxins of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae. The neutralizing capacity of equine CT antiserum and of antiserum raised in rabbits to the LT toxin of the three species of coliform bacteria was evaluated by determining their capacity to inhibit the action of purified CT and semipurified ultrafiltration preparations of the coliform LT and ST toxins in inducing water secretion as assayed by the in vivo marker perfusion technique in the rat jejunum. One milliliter of antiserum to CT and to E. coli and Klebsiella LT completely neutralized the secretory action of each of these three toxins; effective serial dilutions of CT antiserum extended to 1 to 4, whereas those of the antisera to LT were limited to 1 to 2 in most instances. One milliliter of antiserum to E. cloacae LT partially neutralized each of the three coliform LT toxins; serial dilutions were inactive. Antiserum to E. cloacae LT did not neutralize CT. Antiserum to CT and to each of the three coliform LT toxins also had a weak neutralizing effect on the ST toxins of E. coli and Klebsiella, but they did not affect E. cloacae ST. Adsorption of the antiserum to CT and to each of the three LT toxins by incubation with a heat-inactivated preparation of either the homologous or a heterologous LT toxin completely abolished the neutralizing capacity of the antisera towards both LT and ST. These observations indicate that the immunological interrelationship of CT and E. coli LT extends to the LT toxins of Klebsiella and E. cloacae and, further, that these immunological properties are shared to a lesser extent by the ST toxins of E. coli and Klebsiella.
TI  - Relative enterotoxigenicity of coliform bacteria.
AB  - The enterotoxigenicity of 12 strains of coliform bacteria (Enterobacter cloacae,  Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli) isolated from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of persons with either acute diarrhea or tropical sprue and of 13 strains of the same species isolated from urine (GU) cultures was determined. Fractions of heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) toxins of each strain were separated by ultrafiltration, and the effect of graded concentrations (range, 100 microgram-10 pg/ml) on water transport was assessed by in vivo perfusion in the rat jejunum. Enterotoxigenic activity was defined as inducement of net secretion of water. All 12 of the GI strains and six of 13 GU strains elaborated enterotoxins, but there was a millionfold quantitative difference in the potency of the toxins produced. All of the GI strains produced one or both forms of toxin, which had a minimal effective concentration of as low as 0.1-10 ng/ml, whereas the GU strains produced toxins of weak or, rarely, of intermediate potency.
TI  - A polyvalent human gamma-globulin immune to Pseudomonas aeruginosa: passive protection of mice against lethal infection.
AB  - As a means to development of guidelines for therapeutic application to human disease, preparations of human polyvalent gamma-globulin immune to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PG) were studied in acute infections in mice. PG was highly effective in controlling lethal infections induced in mice by the major immunotypes of P. aeruginosa; greater than or equal to 10 microgram of of gamma-globulin per mouse protected against challenge with less than or equal to 10(6) 50% lethal doses of P. aeruginosa. PG was less than or equal to 57 times more effective than normal human gamma-globulin. The active antibody component is specific for each immunotype; it is of the IgG type and undoubltedly is directed against the O-antigen. PG was was not protective against challenge with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae; a low degree of cross-protection was seen against Serratia marcescens. In a model infection involving mice in a terminal stage of advanced P. aeruginosa infection, human plasma immune to P. aeruginosa proved ineffective, but the gamma-globulin component showed moderate activity. The apparent irreversibility of this late-stage infection is not clearly ascribable to a toxin. It is postulated that the successful treatment of advanced P. aeruginosa infections in humans would require multiple therapeutic approaches, including passive immunization with a high-potency, specifically immune globulin.
TI  - Synergy between ticarcillin and tobramycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of ticarcillin, carbenicillin, tobramycin, and gentamicin and of combinations of these antibiotics were measured against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli in vitro and in experimental mouse infections. Synergistic effects were produced by the penicillin/aminoglycoside combinations in growth inhibition tests and in bactericidal tests against many of the bacteria tested. Combinations of ticarcillin + tobramycin were more active in vitro than carbenicillin + gentamicin against P. aeruginosa but were no more active than the latter against other gram-negative bacilli. Ticarcillin + tobramycin and carbenicillin + gentamicin also demonstrated synergistic activities against P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae in experimental mouse infection models. Thus, the penicillin/aminoglycoside combinations produced greater protective effects than the individual antibiotics against lethal intraperitoneal infections and also were more effective in reducing kidney counts of viable bacteria and kidney abscess formation in experimental pyelonephritis infections. As was the case in vitro, ticarcillin + tobramycin was more effective than carbenicillin + gentamicin against the experimental P. aeruginosa infections. The results of these in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that combined therapy with ticarcillin and tobramycin may be warranted in the treatment of serious infections due to P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - A microbiological investigation of acute summer gastroenteritis in black South African infants.
AB  - A microbiological investigation of Black infants suffering from severe acute summer gastroenteritis revealed enteropathogenic agents in 30 out of 37 patients (81%). Enterotoxigenic bacteria were isolated from 15 patients (41%). A total of 16 enterotoxigenic strains were isolated, comprising 9 enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains secreting labile and stable toxin on their own and in combination, and labile-toxin secreting strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae (4), Enterobacter cloacae (2) and Proteus vulgaris (1). In the case of the latter three species, however, 6 out of the 7 strains were isolated from patients who were excreting other enteric pathogens, whereas only 2 out of 9 enterotoxigenic E. coli patients had concomitant infections with other pathogens. No invasive bacteria were isolated except for 2 shigella strains. Salmonella and shigella strains were found in four patients. No correlation was found between the enteropathogenicity of E. coli and its serotype. Rotavirus was observed by negative staining electron microscopy in only two patients (6%) but using a reverse complement fixation test rotavirus antigen was detected in the stool of 17 out of 35 patients (49%). The low EM detection rate may well be due to the patients being admitted for treatment late in the course of their illness when the degree of viral shedding has decreased below EM detectability. No significant difference in clinical presentation was noted between the various aetiological agents. Only one patient was being solely breast-fed compared to 16% of control non-diarrhoeic infants. Evidence of malnutrition was noted in over half of our patients.
TI  - Clavulanic acid: a beta-lactamase-inhiting beta-lactam from Streptomyces clavuligerus.
AB  - A novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. Conditions for the cultivation of the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. This compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. Clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in Escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. The cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae P99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. coli are less well inhibited. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus, K. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and E. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.
TI  - Limax amoebae in public swimming pools of albany, schenectady, and rensselaer counties, new york: their concentration, correlations, and significance.
AB  - A survey was conducted on 30 halogenated public swimming pools, located in Albany, Schenectady, and Rensselaer counties, to determine their open-water limax amoeba densities. Six were outdoor pools. Other variables measured were the standard plate count, total seston, free residual chlorine or bromine, total alkalinity, total hardness, orthophosphate, total soluble phosphorus, specific conductance, pH, temperature, and several engineering parameters including the rate and type of filtration as well as a saturation index. Amoebae were isolated on agar plates at 37 degrees C using heat-killed bacterial suspensions of Enterobacter cloacae or Escherichia coli. Most probable number estimates of amoebic densities ranged from not detectable (<0.01) to 110 amoebae per liter. The median concentration of amoebae was 0.9/liter. Eighty percent of the pools examined had less than 5 amoebae per liter. Significant correlations (P < 0.05) were found between amoebic densities and the log(10) of the standard plate count, orthophosphate, and total soluble phosphorus. No significant difference was found between amoebic densities in outdoor and indoor pools. Preliminary tests for the presence of the human pathogen Naegleria fowleri were inconclusive.
TI  - Intracellular crystalline deposits by bacteria grown in urine from a stone former.
AB  - Several species of bacteria were found to form an intracellular crystalline material when grown in urine obtained from a subject with a history of infrequent renal calculi formation. The following species: Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans formed crystals of hydroxyapatite. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris produced crystals of calcite -II. Several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with renal caculi indicationg that microorganisms may be involved in the nucleation process during calculogenesis.
TI  - Specific gonadotropin binding to Pseudomonas maltophilia.
AB  - Binding of 125I-labeled human chorionic gonadotropin to Pseudomonas maltophilia is dependent on time, temperature, and pH and the binding to this procaryotic species is hormone-specific and saturable. The equilibrium dissociation constant is 2.3 X 10(-9) M. There are no cooperative interactions between binding sites (Hill coefficient, 1.05). The number of sites is estimaated as 240 fmol/100 mug of protein. NaCl and KCl, at concentrations from 1 to 10 mM, have no effect on binding. Divalent cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+) and 1 mM EDTA inhibit hormone binding. Binding is destroyed by heat or by treatment with Pronase of alpha-chymotrypsin and is increased by phospholipase C. Binding of the labeled gonadotropin is not observed with other gram-negative organisms--e.g., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas testosteroni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - [Coliform bacteria in raw and pasteurized milk].
AB  - Studied were 360 samples of raw and 1404 samples of pasteurized milk, collected from three milk centers, for the presence of coliform bacteria. It was found that the coli titer of the raw milk varied from 10(-5) up to 10(-7), depending on the season. The regimes of pasteurization applied kill 100 per cent of the present coli organisms. After the thermic treatment the milk was additionally contaminated with coli forms from the containers and the equipment in dependence on the conditions of washing and disinfection. The coli titer of the pasteurized milk varied from 1 to 10(-3). A total of 602 strains of coliform bacteria were isolated from the pasteurized and the raw milk; the bacteria were differentiated by the scheme of Kauffmann. Most commonly encountered were the coli forms of the following genera:Citrobacter (35 per cent), Enterobacter (29.8 per cent), Klebsiella (23.9 per cent), and Escherichia (11.3 per cent). The following species were prevailing in raw milk: Kl. aerogenes, Ent. aerogenes, Ent. cloacae, C. freundi, and C. intermedium. In pasteurized milk dominating were Kl. aerogenes, C. freundi. Ent. aerogenes, and Ent. cloacae.
TI  - Coliforms from hides and meat.
AB  - Coliform tests were performed on 85 hide and 75 meat samples. IMViC reactions were determined on isolates from positive confirmed and fecal tests, and strains other than Escherichia coli were identified. Strains typed as Aerobacter aerogenes types I and II were identified as Enterobacter cloacae (51.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (21.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (15%), and Enterobacter liquefaciens, Serratia, and unidentified coliforms (12.1%). K. pneumoniae appeared to be responsible for less than 1% positive fecal tests.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.
TI  - Interference by Neisseria gonorrhoeae growth by other bacterial species.
AB  - Growth of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from clinical specimens has been enhanced by the  use of selective media that inhibit the simultaneous growth of other microorganisms. One explanation for this enhancement could be that certain other bacteria inhibit gonococcal growth. This hypothesis was examined by testing 167 bacterial isolates for in vitro gonococcal inhibition; 34.1% of the isolates failed to inhibit the gonococcus, but 12.0% produced weak inhibition and 53.9% strongly inhibited N. gonorrhoeae. The pattern of in vitro gonococcal inhibition was consistently the same for all the individual isolates within some species, but individual isolates within other bacterial species varied in their ability to inhibit the gonococcus. Consistently strong in vitro N. gonorrhoeae inhibitors were Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas. The in vivo significance of gonococcal interference was demonstrated in the subcutaneous chamber model of N. gonorrhoeae infection.
TI  - Acetylene reduction (nitrogen fixation) by enterobacteriaceae isolated from paper mill process waters.
AB  - Using selective media containing galactitol, over 130 Enterobacteriaceae have been isolated from paper mill process waters collected from different localities. These bacteria were extensively characterized and tested for acetylene-reducing (nitrogen-fixing) activity under anaerobic conditions. High activity was found in representatives of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Erwinia herbicola, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter intermedius, and Escherichia coli. Under argon, nitrogenase synthesis was generally not repressed by 5 mM l-glutamate, l-aspartate, l-leucine or Casamino Acids (0.5 g/liter). In many strains, both the specific activities (nanomoles of C(2)H(4) per minute per milligram of protein) and the activities (nanomoles of C(2)H(4) per minute) had considerably declined after 24 h. In three selected strains, activity in intact cells grown under nitrogen was unaffected by the presence during assay of 10 mM l-amino acids or ammonium acetate. All of the strains examined were tolerant towards inactivation of nitrogen-fixing activity by 1.8% (vol/vol) oxygen during assay, and inactivation by up to 10% oxygen was partly reversible. Representatives of the six taxa synthesized nitrogenase in stirred aerobic cultures, though the protein concentrations attained were lower than under anaerobic conditions. It seems reasonable to suggest that under natural conditions, nitrogen fixation is able to contribute significantly to the nitrogen economy of the cells.
TI  - Susceptibility of clinically important gram-negative bacilli to 15 antibiotics. Comparison of patterns in Poland and Federal Republic of Germany.
AB  - Three hundred and sixty strains of Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia, indole-positive and indole-negative Proteus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens), were isolated by random in Poland and Germany, and tested by agar dilution method for susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents, including six cephalosporin derivatives, colistin, gentamycin and tobramycin, three newer tetracyclines, ampicillin and carbenicillin, and a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. This investigation revealed existence of growing antibiotic-resistance of Gram-negative bacilli to all antimicrobial agents. A detailed analysis of this problem is described and a list of agents effective in vitro is presented. Some evidence has been found concerning possible existence of geographical differences in antibiotic-susceptibility patterns of strains of Gram-negative bacilli, isolated in Poland and Federal Republic of Germany.
TI  - Kinetic properties of Serratia marcescens adenosine 5'-diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase.
AB  - The regulatory properties of partially purified adenosine 5'-diphosphate-(ADP) glucose pyrophosphorylase from two Serratia marcescens strains (ATCC 274 and ATCC 15365) have been studied. Slight or negligible activation by fructose-P2, pyridoxal-phosphate, or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) was observed. These compounds were previously shown to be potent activators of the ADPglucose pyrophosphorylases from the enterics, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia aurescens, Shigella dysenteriae, and Escherichia coli. Phosphoenolpyruvate stimulated the rate of ADPglucose synthesis catalyzed by Serratia ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase about 1.5- to 2-fold but did not affect the S0.5 values (concentration of substrate required for 50% maximal stimulation) of the substrates, alpha-glucose-1-phosphate, and adenosine 5'-triphosphate. Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), a potent inhibitor of the enteric ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase, is an effective inhibitor of the S. marcescens enzyme. ADP also inhibits but is not as effective as AMP. Activators of the enteric enzyme counteract the inhibition caused by AMP. This is in contrast to what is observed for the S. marcescens enzyme. Neither phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose-diphosphate, pyridoxal-phosphate, NADPH, 3-phosphoglycerate, fructose-6-phosphate, nor pyruvate effect the inhibition caused by AMP. The properties of the S. marcescens HY strain and Serratia liquefaciens ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase were found to be similar to the above two S. marcescens enzymes with respect to activation and inhibition. These observations provide another example where the properties of an enzyme found in the genus Serratia have been found to be different from the properties of the same enzyme present in the enteric genera Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, Citrobacter, and Enterobacter.
TI  - Transferable gentamicin resistance in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  
TI  - Reevaluation of kanamycin dosage in infants and children.
AB  - It was recently reported that the dosage of kanamycin formerly recommended for neonates of 7.5 mg/kg every 12 h did not produce therapeutic serum concentrations of 15 to 25 mug/ml, but a larger dosage of 10 mg/kg every 12 h was required. Reevaluation of the pharmacokinetics of kanamycin in infants and children was therefore undertaken. Sixteen time-concentration curves after a dose of 5 mg/kg were obtained from patients 2 months to 12 years of age; the mean peak serum kanamycin concentration was 10.9 (range, 3.6 to 17.9) mug/ml at 0.5 h. Ten time-concentration curves were obtained after a dose of 10 mg/kg; the mean peak serum concentration was 17.6 (range, 8.4 to 30) mug/ml. Eight patients were studied on successive days, and there was doubling of the 1-h peak serum concentration when the dose of kanamycin was increased from 5 to 10 mg/kg. Standard serum bactericidal tests were done against Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae strains, each with a minimal bactericidal concentration of 5 mug of kanamycin per ml. All 3 sera containing 21 mug or more of kanamycin per ml demonstrated a bactericidal titer, whereas only 2 of 23 sera containing less than 21 mug of kanamycin per ml did so. The currently recommended dosage of kanamycin for infants and children fails to produce serum concentrations in the therapeutic range, and preliminary data suggest that the dosage should be increased to 10 mg/kg per dose every 8 h.
TI  - The fate of bacteria in frozen red cells.
AB  - Units of blood were intentionally contaiminated with suspensions of either Aerobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Sarcina lutea, Seratia marcesens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Paracolabacterum aerogenoides (Enterobacter hafriae), Mima polymorpha or Acinetobacter- calcoaceticus. When inoculation was made prior to glycerolization, the subsequent glycerolization, freezing, thawing, and deglycerolization resulted in roughly a two log reduction in the number of bacteria. When inoculation was made with a final concentration of between 10(1) and 10(5) organisms per milliliter, immediately following deglycerolization or following washing without glycerolization and freezing, no increase in the number of bacteria was seen after 72 hours storage at 4 C. Three of the 12 organisms studied decreased in number during 72 hours of storage. These data suggest that the current 24-hour limit on the post-thaw storage of frozen red blood cells may be unnecessarily restrictive.
TI  - Partial purification and properties of Enterobacter cloacae heat-stable enterotoxin.
AB  - Cell free preparations of the whole-cell lysate and ultrafiltration (UF) fractions of broth cultures of a strain of Enterobacter cloacae, isolated from a Puerto Rican with tropical sprue, were assayed for their ability to induce in vivo net water secretion in the rat jejunum. The whole-cell lysate and UM-10 retentate of broth cultures were inactive. The UM-2 retentate and filtrate were active at a concentration of 100 mug/ml or more; the toxigenic activity was entirely retained, and increased to 1 mug/ml, by a UM-05 membrane; washing this retentate yielded a fraction with an activity of 10 ng/ml. Stationary aerobic culture conditions yielded the most active UF fractions when ammonium sulfate was used as the precipitating agent, whereas anaerobic culture conditions produced the most active fractions in broth cultures precipitated by acetone. Passage of the active acetone-precipitated UF fractions through a Sephadex G-25 column yielded eluate pools with enhanced toxigenic activity in, or adjacent to, the void volume, but maximum activity of the ammonium sulfate-precipitated UM-05 retentate eluated at a Kav of 0.38 to 0.52. Neither of the most active gel filtration elution fractions of the UM-05 retentates contained detectable carbohydrate, suggesting that the toxin is not associated with endotoxin. Toxigenic activity was unaltered by exposure to a temperature of 100C for 30 min, lowering the pH to 1, or incubation with either Pronase or trypsin. These observations indicate that the strain of E. cloacae under study elaborates a heat-stable enterotoxin htat has approximately the same molecular weight and shares many of the characteristics of the heat-stable enterotoxin produced by some strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Insect immunity. 11. Simultaneous induction of antibacterial activity and selection synthesis of some hemolymph proteins in diapausing pupae of Hyalophora cecropia and Samia cynthia.
AB  - We have previously shown that pupae of the giant silkmoth Samia cynthia have a humoral antibacterial activity, which was induced by viable, nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria (H.G. Boman et al., 1974). We show here that this activity was formed simultaneously with a selective incorporation of amino acids into eight polypeptide chains characterized by their electrophoretic behavior. If actinomycin D or cycloheximide were given at an early time, no antibacterial activity was found. If the inhibitors were given at the time of maximum activity, there was no effect with actinomycin D but a rapid decrease of the activity in the case of cycloheximide. The results imply that the messenger ribonucleic acid was stable, but that at least one protein component was turning over. Hemolymph from immunized pupae of another giant silkmoth, Hyalophora cecropia, was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. This procedure, together with the isotope distribution after co-electrophoresis in polyarylamide gels, was used for comparing the response to injury and to different infections. Almost identical polypeptide patterns were obtained as a response to an infection with either viable Enterobacter cloacae or Bacillus subtilis. These patterns differed both qualitatively and quantitatively from the injury effect created by an injection as such. There was only a low antibacterial activity in each of the four fractions obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation. However, a combination of three fractions restored a high killing activity. Fractionation of hemolymph from untreated pupae provided evidence for at least one preexisting factor which stimulated the killing of Escherichia coli. The osmotic pressure of the bacteria contributed to the antibacterial activity towards E. coli, but not towards B. subtitlis. The killing of E. coli was inhibited by liped A and, to a lesser extent, by an inhibitor of proteolytic enzymes. The similarities and differences with the mammalian complement system are discussed.
TI  - Antibodies against enteric bacteria in brown bullhead catfish (Ictalurus nebulosus, LeSueur) inhabiting contaminated waters.
AB  - Brown bullhead catfish were collected from sewage- and acid mine waste-polluted waters in an attempt to detect antibodies against human enteric bacteria in their sera and to investigate the association of antibody response with environmental conditions. Agglutination antigens prepared from isolates obtained from water collected at the same locations as the fish habitats were used to demonstrate such antibodies. The results showed large percentages of reactive sera for common isolates such as Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae as well as lesser incidences of antibodies to other, less common isolates. In general, fish with the highest titres were collected from habitats with higher coliform counts. Acid mine drainage reduced the total coliform counts, but did not appear to affect the titers of sera from fish collected from water so affected. It was concluded that the bottom-feeding catfish might be a better subject for the study of fish as an ecological indicator of fecal pollution in acid-polluted waters.
TI  - Laboratory studies with cefatrizine (SK + F 60771), a new broad-spectrum orally-active cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefatrizine (SK&F 60771), a new orally-active semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, was compared with cephalexin and cefazolin for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic behavior in laboratory animals. The average MIC values obtained with cefatrizine against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were superior to those obtained with cephalexin and somewhat poorer than those of cefazolin. In addition, a large percentage of the enterobacter and enterococcus isolates were found to be susceptible. Cefatrizine had a longer biological half-life and a higher peak serum level than either cefazolin or cephalexin when administered parenterally or orally to mice at 20 mg/kg. It had striking in vivo protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Hemophilus influenzae, Proteus morganii or Staphylococcus aureus reflecting its superior pharmacokinetic profile in this animal species. A variable pharmacokinetic response between animal species was observed when cefatrizine was administered either orally or parenterally to dogs, squirrel monkeys or rabbits.
TI  - Massive empyema due to Citrobacter diversus.
AB  - Citrobacter diversus is a gram-negative rod member of the Enterobacteriacease family. A patient is described from whom this organism was isolated twice in pure culture from empyema fluid. Our isolates of Citrobacter diversus were resistant to ampicillin and carbenicillin and sensitive to cephalothin. Citrobacter diversus should be distinguished from Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This organism joins Streptococcus pyogenes, bacteroids species, anaerobic streptococci and Escherichia coli as a cause of slight pneumonia with extensive empyema.
TI  - Membrane filter procedure for enumerating the component genera of the coliform group in seawater.
AB  - A facile, quantitative, membrane filter procedure (mC) for defining the distribution of coliform populations in seawater according to the component genera was developed. The procedure, which utilizes a series of in situ substrate tests to obviate the picking of colonies for identification, also provides an estimate of the total coliform density. When pure cultures of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae were suspended in seawater and held at 4 C for 24 h, between 56 and 100% of the cells which grew on nutrient agar spread plates at 35 C could be recovered by the mC procedure. Confirmation as coliforms of typical colonies from natural samples was about 95%. Assay variability was found to be insignificant. The recovery of coliforms from marine waters by the mC procedure was comparable to those obtainable by current methods. Klebsiella was differentiated by the urease reaction and E. coli by its ability to form indole. The confirmation frequencies for colonies designated as Klebsiella and E. coli by the in situ tests approached 95% for the former and 98% for the latter.
TI  - Mode of action of the cloacin DF13-immunity protein.
AB  - 1. Cells of Enterobacter cloacae harbouring the bacteriocinogenic factor Clo DF13 produce an immunity protein which inbhbits the in vitro activity of cloacin DF13. The amino acid composition of purified immunity protein was determined. 2. Experiments about the protection of ribosomes against cloacin DF13 in the presence of the immunity protein show that one molecule of immunity protein neutralized the activity of one molecule cloacin. 3. Direct and specific interaction of cloacin DF13 with the immunity protein has been demonstrated by the analysis of mixtures of both proteins on polyacrylamide gels and by changes in the fluorescence response of cloacin DF13-bound 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate in the presence of immunity protein.
TI  - Effects of chemotherapeutics on bacterial ecology in the water of ponds and the intestinal tracts of cultured fish, ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis).
AB  - Drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli conferred with R factors were isolated with  high frequencies from the intestinal tracts of ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) cultured in ponds, in which chemotherapeutics had often been used, and with relatively low frequencies from ayu which received no administration of chemotherapeutics. Drug-resistant bacteria were also isolated at low frequencies from the intestinal tracts of wild ayu in rivers, as well as from the water of ayu-culturing ponds and some of them carried R factors. The drug-resistant bacteria carrying R factors were Aeromonas liquefaciens, Citrobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Hafnia and unidentified strains. All the R factors were classified as the Fi-(F) type, except the two R factors detected in an E. coli strain and in an unidentified strain.
TI  - R factor in Enterobacter cloacae resistant to silver sulfadiazine.
AB  - A strain of Enterobacter cloacae resistant to silver sulfadiazine was recovered from a unit in which this antimicrobial agent was in use. This strain was found to harbor an R factor responsible for resistance to carbenicillin, kanamycin and ampicillin. These antibiotic resistances were transferable to Escherichia coli by mating. Resistance to silver sulfadiazine was not, however, transmissible.
TI  - In-use contamination of intravenous infusion fluid.
AB  - During the 1970 to 1971 nationwide epidemic of septicemias caused by Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter agglomerans traced to intrinsic contamination of Abbott intravenous infusion products, 94 infusion systems manufactured by Baxter Laboratories were studied microbiologically and epidemiologically during hospital use. Intravenous fluid from 10 systems (11%) contained microorganisms, usually Staphylococcus or Bacillus species; one infusion was heavily contaminated with Klebsiella pneumoniae. No national epidemic organisms, E. cloacae or E. agglomerans (formerly Erwinia), were recovered, suggesting that during this period frequent contamination with these organisms was unique to Abbott's infusion products. Contamination in this study appeared to be extrinsic in origin (introduced during clinical use) and related to the duration of continuous intravenous therapy. Nine of 61 systems (15%) that had been used longer than 48 h were contaminated, whereas only 1 of 33 used less than 48 h (3%) contained microorganisms. This study and the recent national outbreak indicate that contamination of infusion fluid, both from intrinsic and extrinsic sources, must be recognized as an additional risk of intravenous therapy; however, a once-daily replacement of the delivery apparatus can significantly diminish this hazard.
TI  - Transferrable resistance to tobramycin in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter  cloacae associated with enzymatic acetylation of tobramycin.
AB  - Among gram-negative bacilli isolated from burn wound cultures, some strains of Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to tobramycin (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC]>/= 20 mug/ml) but susceptible to gentamicin (MIC </= 5 mug/ml). One Klebsiella pneumoniae and two Enterobacter cloacae strains were selected for studies on their mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Resistance to high concentrations of tobramycin (MICs of 25 to 50 mug/ml) was conjugally transferred to a susceptible Escherichia coli strain at rates of 1.2 x 10(-4) to 2.8 to 10(-4) per donor cell, suggesting that resistance is controlled by R factors. Resistances to tobramycin, kanamycin, and neomycin were cotransferred. Enzymatic activities were present that acetylated tobramycin, gentamicin, and kanamycin in osmotic lysates from the donor and transcipient strains. Enzymatic adenylylation of these aminoglycosides was not observed. The aminoglycoside-acetylating activities from K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae resembled kanamycin acetyltransferase (KAT) in their specificity for aminoglycoside substrates. Not all isolates of bacteria that produce KAT are resistant to tobramycin, but the factors that determine susceptibility or resistance to tobramycin in KAT-producing bacteria have not yet been established.
TI  - Biochemical and antibiotic susceptibility studies of H2S-negative Citrobacter.
AB  - Ninety-four strains of H(2)S-negative Citrobacter were biochemically characterized and their antibiograms were determined. The antibiograms demonstrated not only a difference from Enterobacter cloacae but also a difference within the Citrobacter group between the indole-negative and indole-positive strains. These differences were statistically significant and emphasize the importance of the indole reaction as an aid to speciation of the H(2)S-negative Citrobacter.
TI  - Insect immunity. I. Characteristics of an inducible cell-free antibacterial reaction in hemolymph of Samia cynthia pupae.
AB  - Pupae of the silk moth, Samia cynthia, were found to contain an inducible antibacterial activity in their hemolymph. This immunity response was provoked by primary infections with either Escherichia coli K-12 or Enterobacter cloacae. In both cases the antibacterial activity was directed chiefly towards E. coli. During standard conditions, 1% of hemolymph could kill 10(3) to 10(4) viable E. coli, strain D31, within 5 min. A lower level of antibacterial activity was induced by injections of a sterile salt solution. The killing of strain D31 followed single-hit kinetics, and increasing rate constants were obtained for increasing amounts of hemolymph. The reaction was sensitive to pretreatment with trypsin and it was protected by reducing agents. The activity was inhibited by microgram quantities of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) prepared from certain LPS mutants of E. coli K-12. A comparison of the susceptibility showed that "heptose-less" LPS mutants were more sensitive to killing than other strains. During standard conditions hemolymph will lyse both E. coli and Micrococcus lysodeikticus. Lysis of E. coli followed a multi-hit kinetics and it was inhibited by LPS, whereas lysis of M. lysodeikticus was unaffected by LPS. Hemolymph was fractionated on Sephadex G-200, and the lytic activities were recovered in partly overlapping peaks. Reconstitution with pooled fractions gave synergistic effects with the killing assay.
TI  - Clinical study of the use of the new aminoglycoside tobramycin for therapy of infections due to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Tobramycin, a new aminoglycoside antimicrobial, was evaluated as therapy for infections due to gram-negative bacilli in 15 seriously ill patients with underlying diseases. Three of 10 patients with gram-negative bacteremias also had urinary tract infections. Two patients had respiratory tract infections, one had cellulitis, one had a urinary tract infection, and another had septic phlebitis. Twelve patients were cured of their infections. Eosinophilia was observed in one patient and another developed superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus after 6 days of tobramycin therapy. There were five isolates of Escherichia coli, five of Klebsiella sp., two of Pseudomonas sp., and one each of Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia marcescens, and Enterobacter cloacae. The average serum concentration of tobramycin 2 h after a parenteral dose of 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg was 5.1 mug/ml; higher concentrations of tobramycin were present in urine. Tobramycin proved to be an effective antimicrobial in these patients.
TI  - Cefoxitin, a semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic: resistance to beta-lactamase inactivation.
AB  - Cefoxitin is a new, cephalosporin-like antibiotic which is highly resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase. Ninety-one cultures were selected either for their general resistance to cephalosporin antibiotics or for their ability to produce beta-lactamase. Some of these cultures were resistant to cefoxitin. The capacity of each of the 91 strains to hydrolyze cefoxitin with beta-lactamase was determined. Only seven of the cultures degraded the antibiotic as determined by a general assay for beta-lactamase. Several others were able to hydrolyze cefoxitin after enzyme was induced by low concentrations of the antibiotic. The role of the constitutive and inducible enzyme in bacterial resistance to the antibiotic was investigated. Enzymatic destruction of cefoxitin was found to be an important factor contributing to bacterial resistance. However, the complete and rapid degradation of cefoxitin is not essential to resistance since one strain, Enterobacter cloacae 1316, hydrolyzed the antibiotic very slowly but was able to grow unaffected in the presence of cefoxitin. The presence of the enzyme is not necessarily sufficient to confer resistance since another culture, Klebsiella D535, readily hydrolyzed the antibiotic but was susceptible to it.
TI  - Comparison of the chemotherapeutic and pharmacodynamic activities of cephradine,  cephalothin, and cephaloridine in mice.
AB  - Cephradine, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative, is 7[d(-)-2-amino-2-(1,4-cyclohexadien-1-yl) acetamido]-3-methyl-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid hydrate. The compound has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro. When given subcutaneously to mice, cephradine was appreciably more effective than cephalothin against infections induced by penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Enterobacter cloacae strains. Cephradine and cephaloridine possessed equivalent activity in treating infections caused by these same three gram-negative bacteria. The mean total bioactivity of cephradine in the serum of mice peaked within 30 min (59 mug/ml) after parenteral administration and was approximately threefold that of cephalothin (20 mug/ml), but less than that of cephaloridine (83 mug/ml). Nearly all of the administered cephradine (84%) and cephaloridine (70%) were excreted in the urine as the parent compounds. In contrast, only 47% (total bioactivity) of administered cephalothin was recovered, an amount that represented only 15 to 20% of the parent substance.
TI  - Enterobacteria in feedlot waste and runoff.
AB  - Samples of beef cattle feedlot waste (FLW), runoff from the pens, and water from  a large drainage ditch at the feedlot were examined for Enterobacteriaceae. The drainage ditch receives the runoff but contains primarily subsurface drainage from fields on which FLW is spread for disposal. Planting and enrichment techniques with seven different media were used to isolate 553 cultures of enterobacteria. FLW contains about 50 million enterobacteria/g dry weight. More than 90% of these were Escherichia coli, none of which were enteropathogenic types as determined with multivalent sera. Citrobacter and Enterobacter cloacae were other organisms present in moderate numbers. Application of enrichment techniques broadened the spectrum of enterobacteria isolates to include the four Proteus spp., both Providencia spp., Klebsiella, Enterobacter aerogenes, Arizona, and a single isolate of Salmonella (serological group C(2)). Shigella was not isolated. The wide spectrum of enterobacteria in FLW may be a hazard if unsterilized waste is refed. Fewer enterobacteria occurred in the runoff and in the drainage ditch; the most numerous species in FLW also were most numerous at these sites. However, neither Salmonella nor Arizona was isolated from runoff or drainage-ditch waters.
TI  - Effect of catecholamines on the bactericidal activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dihydroxyphenylalanine at 8 mm concentrations prevented iodination of zymosan by intact neutrophils and decarboxylation of l-alanine by leukocyte sonic extracts. The same concentration of epinephrine also reduced bactericidal activity of the leukocyte against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus rettgeri without decreasing phagocytosis of bacteria. Spectral studies indicated that epinephrine interferes with the myeloperoxidase-mediated reactions by competing for available H(2)O(2) via its enzymatic oxidation to adrenochrome. These findings support a mechanism in which H(2)O(2) plays an important role in the bactericidal activity of the leukocyte.
TI  - Mapping and fi character determination of R factors of Enterobacter cloacae Df13.
AB  
TI  - Some relationships between R-factor and chromosomal -lactamase in Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - 1. The beta-lactamases specified by Klebsiella aerogenes 418 and the R-factor R-7268 have been partially purified. 2. The molecular weights of the K. aerogenes strains 418 and 373, Aerobacter cloacae 53, R-7268 and R-TEM beta-lactamases were all about 20000; that of the enzymes from Escherichia coli strains 419 and 214T was about 31000. 3. These enzymes were also compared by means of their K(m) values for benzylpenicillin and ampicillin, and their behaviour on starch-gel electrophoresis. 4. The beta-lactamases specified by the two Klebsiella strains, the Aerobacter strain, and the R-factors R-TEM and R-7268 were found to comprise a broadly similar group. However, within this group, only two enzymes seemed to be identical, namely those specified by the two R-factors. The two E. coli strains produce identical beta-lactamases which are very different from the ;Klebsiella/Aerobacter-type' enzymes.
TI  - Comparative structural studies on the M-antigen from Salmonella typhimurium. Escherichia coli and Aerobacter cloacae.
AB  
TI  - Control of colanic acid synthesis.
AB  - The nucleotide pools of certain mucoid, colanic acid-synthesizing strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Aerobacter cloacae were examined, and in all cases the nucleotide sugars uridine-5'-diphosphate glucose (UDPG), uridine-5'-diphosphate galactose (UDPGal), guanosine-5'-diphosphate fucose (GDPF), and uridine-5'-diphosphate glucuronic acid (UDPGA) were detected. It is postulated that these nucleotide sugars are precursors in the synthesis of colanic acid. The levels of these nucleotide sugars and of the enzymes involved in their synthesis were examined in a number of mucoid strains and compared with the levels found in certain strains which were repressed in the synthesis of colanic acid, only becoming mucoid when grown in the presence of p-fluorophenylalanine (PFA). The levels of UDPG and UDPGal and the enzymes involved in their synthesis were substantially the same in both mucoid and repressed types, but the levels of UDPGA and GDPF and of some of the enzymes involved in their synthesis were much higher in mucoid strains. When repressed strains were grown in the presence of PFA, the levels of UDPGA and GDPF approached those found in mucoid strains. The existence of an operon, containing genes coding for certain key enzymes involved in colanic acid synthesis has been suggested.
TI  - Isoenzymes of bacterial beta-galactosidases: purification and characterization of a nonisoenzyme forming beta-galactosidase of Aerobacter cloacae.
AB  
TI  - Pathways of anaerobic acetate utilization in Escherichia coli and Aerobacter cloacae.
AB  - Acetate-1-(14)C was added to anaerobic glucose-fermenting cultures of Escherichia coli and Aerobacter cloacae. In the E. coli culture, lactate formation occurred late in the fermentation, when the rate of production of formate and acetate had decreased. The occurrence of acetate label in the lactate indicated formation of pyruvate from acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and formate. In the A. cloacae cultures, substantial amounts of acetate label were found in the 2,3-butanediol formed. Evidence is presented that the label could have entered the diol only by conversion of formate and acetyl-CoA into pyruvate. The observed levels of radioactivity in the diol indicated that during diol formation the reaction yielding formate and acetyl-CoA from pyruvate CoA was operating close to equilibrium. The shift in metabolism from formation of acetate, ethyl alcohol, and formate to the formation of butanediol or lactate appears to be due basically to an approach to equilibrium of the pyruvate-splitting reaction, whatever the induction mechanism by which the shift is implemented.
TI  - Gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  - In a period of two years, 865 strains of Gram-negative bacilli other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from burns were identified by a range of tests. The commonest species were Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae. Many strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Bacterium anitratum were also found.A large proportion of the strains were tested for sensitivity to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and carbenicillin, and smaller numbers of strains were tested for sensitivity to cephaloridine, polymyxin, streptomycin, sulphadiazine, sulfamylon, and trimethoprim. The proportion of strains sensitive and resistant to different antibacterial agents varied widely with species of bacteria. A large proportion of the strains of E. coli and P. mirabilis were resistant to ampicillin, which was much used in treatment; resistance appeared least often towards nalidixic acid, kanamycin, trimethoprim, and gentamicin. Multiple resistance occurred less often among strains of E. coli than among Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp, and P. mirabilis. Phage and serological typing of Ps. aeruginosa showed that most infections of burns with this organism were due to strains previously found in other patients in the same ward. Taken with other evidence, this supported the view that most infections with Ps. aeruginosa were not acquired from the patient's own flora but from sources in the hospital environment.

TI  - Purification and genetic determination of bacteriocin production in Enterobacter  cloacae.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae (strain DF13) was found to produce a bacteriocin which could be induced by mitomycin C. In the supernatant fluid of the induced culture phagelike particles were found. The bacteriocin was partially purified from induced cultures by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel-filtration on Sephadex G-150. Ultraviolet-absorbing material was eluted from the Sephadex column in three fractions. The biological activity was mainly present in the second fraction and is associated with a protein with a molecular weight of about 61,000. The phagelike particles were found in the first fraction and show no biological activity. Upon conjugation of E. cloacae strain DF13 with another strain of the same species and with Escherichia coli K-12S, the ability to produce bacteriocin was transferred. The new bacteriocinogenic strain produced bacteriocin, which could not be distinguished from that produced by E. cloacae strain DF13. Although transfer of the bacteriocinogenic factor often occurred together with transfer of the ability to produce phagelike particles, it was shown that these two factors are two separate genetic entities. In addition to a bacteriocinogenic factor, E. cloacae strain DF13 was found to carry two other transferable plasmids: one determining resistance against streptomycin and sulfanilamide and another determining resistance against penicillin.
TI  - Occurrence of chloramphenicol-acetylating enzymes in various gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The occurrence of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme, similar to that found in  Escherichia coli, carrying an R factor was investigated in various gram-negative bacilli. The acetylated products of chloramphenicol were identified by chromatography and quantitatively assayed after benzene extraction. The investigated strains were of the Salmonella-Arizona group, the Klebsiella-Aerobacter group, Serratia marcescens, the Proteus group, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most of which were isolated from 1947 to 1957. Both chloramphenicol-sensitive and -resistant strains were included, but none of them was able to transfer chloramphenicol resistance by conjugation. In the Proteus group, a significant level of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme was found in most strains, whether they were sensitive or resistant to chloramphenicol; the resistant strains showed higher levels of the enzyme. Some chloramphenicol-sensitive strains lacked this enzyme. Only the sensitive strains containing the enzyme could easily produce chloramphenicol-resistant mutants with higher enzyme activity. Thus, the chloramphenicol resistance of this group can be reasonably explained on the basis of the chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme. All of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to chloramphenicol, and most strains showed low levels of the enzyme (which, however, did not appear sufficient to explain their resistance). All of the strains of the other groups (except one strain of Enterobacter cloacae) lacked the enzyme, although most strains of the Klebsiella-Aerobacter group and of S. marcescens were resistant to chloramphenicol. With respect to the origin of the resistance gene of the R factor, it is noteworthy that the strains of Proteus mirabilis isolated in 1947 possessed this enzyme before the discovery of chloramphenicol.
TI  - Anaerobic growth yields of Aerobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Aerobacter cloacae UW-C83 and Escherichia coli K-12 were grown under various anaerobic environments. Y(atp) values were calculated by determination of cell weights and analyses for fermentation products. These Y(atp) values are compared with others reported in the literature. Limitation of growth by factors other than adenosine triphosphate supply is discussed.
TI  - Energy supply and cell yield in aerobically growth microorganisms.
AB  - Cell yields of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Aerobacter cloacae UW-C83, Escherichia coli K-12, Candida utilis UW-3, and Saccharomyces carlsbergensis UW-110 grown aerobically on several carbon sources are reported. The Y(atp) concept is discussed in relation to the yields on oxygen and to assumed P to O ratios for bacteria and reported P to O ratios for yeast.
TI  - Effect of coliform and Proteus bacteria on growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Cultures of coliform and Proteus bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on growth of Staphylococcus aureus in Trypticase Soy Broth. Inhibition of the staphylococcus by these competitors increased with increasing proportions of inhibiting (effector) bacteria in the inoculum and decreasing incubation temperatures (37 to 10 C). Time required for 2 x 10(4) staphylococci to increase to 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter, the minimal number assumed to be necessary for food poisoning, varied with the species of effector, the original ratio of effector bacteria to staphylococci in the medium, and the incubation temperature. When the original ratio was 100:1, the staphylococci did not reach 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter at 10, 15, 22, or 30 C (with one exception), when growing with cultures representing six species of coliform bacteria and two of Proteus. When the ratio was 1:1, all effectors either greatly delayed the staphylococcus or prevented it from reaching hazardous numbers at 15 C, six of the eight caused a delay of 2 to 3 hr at 22 C, and only Escherichia coli delayed the coccus at 30 C. All effectors were ineffective at 22 and 30 C when original numbers of effectors and staphylococci were in the ratio 1:100. Greatest overall inhibition was by E. coli, E. freundii, and Proteus vulgaris, and these species were more effective than the others at 22 and 30 C. Aerobacter cloacae and Paracolobactrum aerogenoides were more effective at 15 C. In general, results were similar with different strains of a species. Except for Aerobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., and P. aerogenoides, which apparently did not compete for nutrients, inhibition of the staphylococcus was by a combination of antibiotic substances and competition for nutrients.
TI  - EFFECT OF NATURALLY OCCURRING XANTHINES ON BACTERIA. I. ANTIMICROBIAL ACTION AND  POTENTIATING EFFECT ON ANTIBIOTIC SPECTRA.
AB  - The effect of xanthines on various microorganisms was studied. The antibacterial  effect was not high; most of the test organisms could easily withstand a concentration of 2,500 mug/ml. Caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. Caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. The effect was both bacteriostatic and bactericidal against susceptible organisms. The susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. The morphology of Aerobacter aerogenes and A. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. Potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. This potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.
TI  - COLIFORMS ASSOCIATED WITH SUGARCANE PLANTS AND JUICES.
AB  - A study of the coliforms found on sugarcane plants throughout the growing season  indicated that members of the genus Aerobacter comprise a part of the epiphytic microflora. When quantitative determinations were made of the coliforms by means of the most probable number technique, no completed tests were obtained on young sugarcane plants during the test period of February through May; however, Paracolobactrum aerogenoides was isolated frequently. Nine different IMViC types of coliforms were identified among the 198 isolates chosen for study. The predominating coliform found at the top, middle, and bottom portions of the sugarcane plants was A. cloacae, but the type predominating in leaf-sheath water was A. aerogenes. Only once was Escherichia coli found associated with the plants at the high dilutions necessary for determining most probable numbers. The numbers of different coliforms occurring in sugarcane juice were generally divided equally among A. aerogenes, A. cloacae, and E. coli. More variety among the IMViC types seemed to occur on the cane plants than in the leaf-sheath water or the cane juice in the mill.
