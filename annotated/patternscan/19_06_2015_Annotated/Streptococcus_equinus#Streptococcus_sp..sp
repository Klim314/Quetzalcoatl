TI  == late-onset streptococcus pasteurianus sepsis in a preterm baby in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == apnea, cyanosis, lethargy and prolongation in capillary filling time developed on the postnatal 37(th) day in a preterm baby who was born at the 30(th) gestational week with a birth weight of 1 300 g. acute phase reactants and immature/total neutrophil count ratio were found to be high. the patient who was diagnosed with  sepsis was successfully treated with meropenem which was started empirically. in  his blood culture streptococcus pasteurianus grew. s. pasteurianus is in the subgroup of streptococcus bovis which is one of the d group streptococci and its  previous name is s. bovis type ii/2. in the literature, there are very few cases  of neonatal infection related with this bacterium. as far as we know, this is first case of neonatal sepsis caused by s. pasteurianus in turkey. in addition, we tried to determine the clinical properties of neonatal infections arising from s. pasteurianus by reviewing the literature.

TI  == differences between endocarditis caused by streptococcus bovis and enterococcus spp. and their association with colorectal cancer.
AB  == streptococcus bovis group and enterococcus spp. share phenotypic characteristics  and intestinal habitat. both have been associated with endocarditis and colorectal neoplasm (crn). we studied all cases of endocarditis diagnosed between 1988 and 2014 in our centre and caused by s. bovis (109, 48.8 % of the bacteremia) and by enterococcus spp. (36, 3.4 % of the bacteremia). patients were seen until death or during a long-term follow-up, in order to rule out a concomitant crn. the 109 cases of s. bovis endocarditis (sbie) compared with the  36 caused by enterococci showed: a higher proportion of males (91 % vs. 72 %, p=0.005), more multivalvular involvement (28 % vs. 6 %, p=0.004), embolic complications (44 vs. 22 %, p=0.02) and colorectal neoplasm (64 % vs. 25 %, p=0.001). sbie showed fewer co-morbidities (32 vs. 58 %, p=0.005), and less frequently urinary infection source (0 vs. 25 %, p=0.001) and healthcare-related  infection (2 vs. 44 %, p=0.001). a total of 123 patients were followed up for an  extended period (mean: 65.9 +/- 57.5 months). during the follow-up, 6 of 28 (21 %) cases with enterococcal endocarditis and 43 of 95 (45.2 %, p=0.01) cases with  sbie developed a new crn. these neoplasiae appeared a mean of 60.4 months later (range 12-181 months). among the 43 cases with sbie and crn, 12 had had a previously normal colonoscopy and 31 had had a previous crn and developed a second neoplasm. cases of sbie present important differences with those caused by enterococcus spp. colonoscopy must be mandatory both in the initial evaluation of sbie, as during the follow-up period.

TI  == association of streptococcus bovis presence in colonic content with advanced colonic lesion.
AB  == aim: to prospectively examine the association between presence of streptococcus bovis (s. bovis) in colonic suction fluid and the endoscopic findings on colonoscopy. methods: from may 2012 to march 2013, 203 consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy for any reason were enrolled in the study. exclusion criteria included: antibiotic use in the previous month, age younger than 18 years, and inadequate preparation for colonoscopy. the colonoscopy was performed  for the total length of the colon or to the occluding tumor. the endoscopic findings were registered. samples were obtained proximal to the colonoscopic part of the suction tube from each patient and sent to the clinical microbiology laboratory for isolation and identification of s. bovis. samples were incubated in enrichment media with addition of antibiotic disks for inhibition of growth of gram-negative rods. the samples were seeded on differential growth media; suspected positive colonies were isolated and identified with gram staining, catalase, and pyrrolidonyl arylamidase tests, and further identified using a vitek2 system. statistical analyses were performed using the student's t and chi(2) tests. results: of the 203 patients recruited, 49 (24%) patients were found to be s. bovis carriers; of them, the endoscopic findings included: 17 (34.7%) cases with malignant tumors, 11 (22.4%) with large polyps, 5 (10.2%) with medium-sized polyps, 6 (12.2%) with small polyps, 4 (8.1%) with colitis, and 6 (12.2%) normal colonoscopies. of 154 patients found negative for s. bovis, the endoscopic findings included: none with malignant tumors, 9 (5.8%) cases with large polyps, 11 (7.1%) with medium-sized polyps, 26 (16.9%) with small polyps, 7 (4.5%) with colitis, and 101 (65.6%) normal colonoscopies. s. bovis (gram-positive coccus) is considered part of the normal intestinal flora. there is an association between s. bovis bacteremia and colonic neoplasia. it is not well understood whether the bacterium has a pathogenetic role in the development  of neoplasia or constitutes an epiphenomenon of colorectal neoplasms. there was a clear relationship between positivity for s. bovis in colonic suction fluid and findings of malignant tumors and large polyps in the colon. conclusion: there is  an association between s. bovis bacteremia and malignant colonic lesions; this should prompt for development of a reliable screening method for advanced colonic lesions.

TI  == the clinical epidemiology and malignancies associated with streptococcus bovis biotypes in 506 cases of bloodstream infections.
AB  == objectives: to determine the incidence of streptococcus bovis (sb) biotypes causing bacteraemia and associated malignancies. methods: this is a retrospective analysis of patients with sb bacteraemia, pulled out from a prospective surveillance protocol of bacteraemia cases, in three areas of spain (1990-2013):  a cattle area (lugo), a fishing area (ferrol) and an urban area (barcelona). colonoscopy and sb biotypes (sb-i and sb-ii) were determined in most cases. results: 506 patients with sb bacteraemia; mean age 68.1 (+/-14.1) years, and 66.2% were males. the cattle area, compared with the fishing and urban areas, had higher incidence of bacteraemia by sbi (40.29 vs 9.38 vs 6.15 cases/106 person-years, p < 0.001) and bacteraemia by sb-ii (29.07 vs 9.84 vs 13.37 cases/106 person-years, p < 0.001). the sb-i cases (n = 224), compared with sb-ii cases (n = 270), had greater rates of endocarditis (77.6% vs 9.6%, p < 0.001) and colorectal neoplasm (crn) (50.9% vs 16.6%, p < 0.001), and smaller rates of biliary tract infection (2.2% vs 29.6%, p < 0.001) and non-colorectal malignancy  (8.9% vs 31.4%, p < 0.001). conclusion: there was a link between the cattle area  and higher incidence of sb bacteraemia. sb-i differed from sb-ii cases in clinical findings and associated malignancies. colonoscopy is mandatory in cases  of endocarditis or bacteraemia caused by sb-i.

TI  == pulmonary endarterectomy for pulmonary hypertension from septic emboli.
AB  == pulmonary endarterectomy (pea) can significantly increase long-term survival in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; however, the role of pea for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary valve endocarditis is controversial. a critically ill 61-year-old man with intractable  right ventricular heart failure was found to have chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension due to streptococcus bovis pulmonary valve endocarditis and underwent successful pulmonary valve replacement and pea. the successful outcome in this case suggests that pea should be considered in patients with this condition.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of chicken beta-defensin (4 and 10) peptides against pathogenic bacteria and fungi.
AB  == host defense peptides (hdps) are small cationic peptides found in several organisms. they play a vital role in innate immunity response and immunomodulatory stimulation. this investigation was designed to study the antimicrobial activities of beta-defensin peptide-4 (savbd-4) and 10 (savbd-4) derived from chickens against pathogenic organisms including bacteria and fungi.  ten bacterial strains and three fungal species were used in investigation. the results showed that the savbd-10 displayed a higher bactericidal potency against  all the tested bacterial strains than that of savbd-4. the exhibited bactericidal activity was significant against almost the different bacterial strains at different peptide concentrations except for that of pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) and streptococcus bovis (str. bovis) strains where a moderate effect  was noted. both peptides were effective in the inactivation of fungal species tested yielding a killing rate of up to 95%. the results revealed that the synthetic peptides were resistant to salt at a concentration of 50 mm nacl. however, they lost antimicrobial potency when applied in the presence of high salt concentrations. based on blood hemolysis studies, a little hemolytic effect  was showed in the case of both peptides even when applied at high concentrations. the data obtained from this study indicated that synthetic avian peptides exhibit strong antibacterial and antifungal activity. in conclusion, future work and research should be tailored to a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of those peptides and their potential use in the pharmaceutical industry to help  reduce the incidence and impact of infectious agent and be marketed as a naturally occurring antibiotic.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == [infection due to mycobacterium bovis in common variable immunodeficiency].
AB  == common variable immunodeficiency (cvid) is an heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by impaired antibody production. it shows a wide spectrum of manifestations including severe and recurrent respiratory infections (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus) and gastrointestinal (campylobacter jejuni, rotavirus and giardia lamblia). viral infections caused by herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus (cmv) and hepatitis c are rare. the opportunistic agents such as  cmv, pneumocystis jirovecii, cryptococcus and atypical mycobacteria have been reported as isolated cases. this paper reports the case of a 38-year-old female patient, who began six years before with weight loss of 7 kg in six months, fatigue, weakness, sweating, fever and abdominal pain. furthermore, patient had intestinal obstruction and abdominal ct showed mesenteric lymph growth. the mesenteric lymph node biopsy revealed positives mycobacterium pcr, ziehl-neelsen  staining and culture for m. bovis. in the laparotomy postoperative period was complicated with nosocomial pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. two years later, she developed right renal abscess that required surgical drainage, once again with a positive culture for mycobacterium bovis. she was referred to highly specialized hospital and we documented panhypogammaglobulinemia and lymphopenia. secondary causes of hypogammaglobulinemia were ruled out and common variable immunodeficiency (cvid)  was confirmed, we started ivig replacement. four years later she developed mixed  cellularity hodgkin's lymphoma. until today she continues with ivig and chemotherapy. this report of a patient with cvid and mycobacterium bovis infection, a unusual association, shows the cellular immunity susceptibility in this immunodeficiency, additional to the humoral defect.

TI  == neonatal invasive streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus infection with delayed central nervous system complications.
AB  == group d streptococci are known to cause newborn septicemia and meningitis, but the streptococcus bovis group strains rarely cause serious neonatal infections in korea. central nervous system (cns) complications of neonatal s. bovis group infection have rarely been reported. in adults, s. bovis group strains cause bacteremia and endocarditis, and are associated with gastrointestinal malignancy. however, only a few studies have reported meningitis and septicemia in infants. here, we describe a case of bacteremia and meningitis due to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus with a delayed cns complication in an infant. a  28-day-old male infant was admitted to the hospital with a 1-day history of fever. cultures of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine showed the presence of s. bovis group strain-s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. he was discharged after 21 days of intravenous ampicillin and cefotaxime administration. two weeks  later, he was readmitted with a fever and short episodes of tonic-clonic movements. brain magnetic resonance imaging showed marked bilateral frontal subdural effusion. he was discharged after 31 days of antibiotic therapy, and no  neurological sequelae were observed at the 9-month follow-up. in conclusion, we present a rare case of neonatal s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus infection causing urinary tract infection, septicemia, meningitis, and delayed cns complications. this case emphasizes the need for physicians to be aware of s. bovis infection in infants.

TI  == suicin 3908, a new lantibiotic produced by a strain of streptococcus suis serotype 2 isolated from a healthy carrier pig.
AB  == while streptococcus suis serotype 2 is known to cause severe infections in pigs,  it can also be isolated from the tonsils of healthy animals that do not develop infections. we hypothesized that s. suis strains in healthy carrier pigs may have the ability to produce bacteriocins, which may contribute to preventing infections by pathogenic s. suis strains. two of ten s. suis serotype 2 strains isolated from healthy carrier pigs exhibited antibacterial activity against pathogenic s. suis isolates. the bacteriocin produced by s. suis 3908 was purified to homogeneity using a three-step procedure: ammonium sulfate precipitation, cationic exchange hplc, and reversed-phase hplc. the bacteriocin,  called suicin 3908, had a low molecular mass; was resistant to heat, ph, and protease treatments; and possessed membrane permeabilization activity. additive effects were obtained when suicin 3908 was used in combination with penicillin g  or amoxicillin. the amino acid sequence of suicin 3908 suggested that it is lantibiotic-related and made it possible to identify a bacteriocin locus in the genome of s. suis d12. the putative gene cluster involved in suicin production by s. suis 3908 was amplified by pcr, and the sequence analysis revealed the presence of nine open reading frames (orfs), including the structural gene and those required for the modification of amino acids, export, regulation, and immunity. suicin 3908, which is encoded by the suia gene, exhibited approximately 50% identity with bovicin hj50 (streptococcus bovis), thermophilin 1277 (streptococcus thermophilus), and macedovicin (streptococcus macedonicus). given  that s. suis 3908 cannot cause infections in animal models, that it is susceptible to conventional antibiotics, and that it produces a bacteriocin with  antibacterial activity against all pathogenic s. suis strains tested, it could potentially be used to prevent infections and to reduce antibiotic use by the swine industry.

TI  == comparison of species identification of endocarditis associated viridans streptococci using rnpb genotyping and 2 maldi-tof systems.
AB  == streptococcus spp. are important causes of infective endocarditis but challenging in species identification. this study compared identification based on sequence determination of the rnpb gene with 2 systems of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, maldi biotyper (bruker) and vitek ms ivd (biomerieux). blood culture isolates of viridans streptococci from 63 patients with infective endocarditis were tested. the 3 methods showed full agreement for all 36 isolates identified in the anginosus, bovis, and mutans groups or identified as streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, or streptococcus sanguinis. none of the methods could reliably identify the 23 isolates to the species level when designated as streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, or streptococcus tigurinus. in 7 isolates classified to the mitis group, the rnpb sequences deviated strikingly from all reference sequences, and additional analysis of soda and groel genes indicated the occurrence of yet unidentified streptococcus spp.

TI  == acquisition through horizontal gene transfer of plasmid psma198 by streptococcus  macedonicus aca-dc 198 points towards the dairy origin of the species.
AB  == background: streptococcus macedonicus is an intriguing streptococcal species whose most frequent source of isolation is fermented foods similarly to streptococcus thermophilus. however, s. macedonicus is closely related to commensal opportunistic pathogens of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex. methodology/principal findings: we analyzed the psma198 plasmid  isolated from the dairy strain streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 in order to provide novel clues about the main ecological niche of this bacterium. psma198 belongs to the narrow host range pci305/pwv02 family found primarily in lactococci and to the best of our knowledge it is the first such plasmid to be reported in streptococci. comparative analysis of the psma198 sequence revealed a high degree of similarity with plasmids isolated from lactococcus lactis strains  deriving from milk or its products. phylogenetic analysis of the psma198 rep showed that the vast majority of closely related proteins derive from lactococcal dairy isolates. additionally, cloning of the psma198 ori in l. lactis revealed a  100% stability of replication over 100 generations. both psma198 and the chromosome of s. macedonicus exhibit a high percentage of potential pseudogenes,  indicating that they have co-evolved under the same gene decay processes. we identified chromosomal regions in s. macedonicus that may have originated from psma198, also supporting a long co-existence of the two replicons. psma198 was also found in divergent biotypes of s. macedonicus and in strains isolated from dispersed geographic locations (e.g. greece and switzerland) showing that psma198's acquisition is not a recent event. conclusions/significance: here we propose that s. macedonicus acquired plasmid psma198 from l. lactis via an ancestral genetic exchange event that took place most probably in milk or dairy products. we provide important evidence that point towards the dairy origin of this species.

TI  == five cases of recurrent meningitis associated with chronic strongyloidiasis.
AB  == although meningitis secondary to chronic strongyloidiasis is a rare complication, it is associated with a high mortality rate. recurrent meningitis can occur if the underlying parasitic infection is left untreated. we report five cases of recurrent meningitis related to chronic strongyloidiasis that were associated with human t-lymphotropic virus type 1 (htlv-1) infection. common causative organisms are escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, and klebsiella pneumonia. one patient died during the second episode of meningitis. three patients showed significant gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms before developing headache  and fever. in four cases, patients developed multiple recurrences even with the treatment of thiabendazol. ivermectin seems to be a better agent compared with thiabendazol to achieve eradication of strongyloidiasis.

TI  == failure of early diagnosis of infective endocarditis in japan--a retrospective descriptive analysis.
AB  == infective endocarditis (ie) is a severe disease with high morbidity and mortality, and these can be exacerbated by delay in diagnosis. we investigated ie diagnosis in japan with the emphasis on the delay in diagnosis and its cause and  implications. we conducted a retrospective study on 82 definite ie patients at kobe university hospital from april 1, 2008, through march 31, 2013. we reviewed  charts of the patients for data such as causative pathogens, prescription of inappropriate antibiotic use prior to the diagnosis, existence of risk factors of ie, previous doctor's subspecialty, or duration until the diagnosis, with the primary outcome of 180-day mortality. we also qualitatively, as well as quantitatively, analyzed those cases with delay in diagnosis, and hypothesized its causes and implications. eighty-two patients were reviewed for this analysis. the average age was 61 +/- 14.5-year-old. fifty percent of patients had known underlying risk factors for ies, such as prosthetic heart valve (10), valvular heart disease (21), congenital heart disease (3), or cardiomyopathy (2). the median days until the diagnosis was 14 days (range 2 days to 1 year). sixty-five  percent of patients received inappropriate antibiotic before the diagnosis (53).  forty percent of causative organisms were staphylococcus aureus (mssa 20, mrsa 13), 32% were viridans streptococci and streptococcus bovis, 28% were others or unknown (cns 5, corynebacterium 3, cardiobacterium 1, candida 1). subspecialties  such as general internal medicine (15), and orthopedics (13) were associated with delay in diagnosis. ten patients (12%) died during follow up, and 8 of them had been received prior inappropriate antibiotics. significant delay in the diagnosis of ie was observed in japan. inappropriate antibiotics were prescribed frequently and may be associated with poor prognosis. further improvement for earlier diagnosis of ie is needed.

TI  == reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  == the purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. in experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip a: 1% h2o2; dip b: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip c: 1% iodophor; and dip d: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. in experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, klebsiella species, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip a; dip d;  and dip e: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, and streptococcus uberis. species differences were also found where mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were  equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips d and e and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. no differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip a. it can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for h2o2 dips may be optimal in reducing  pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. a reduction in premilking teat dip  contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.

TI  == immunomodulatory properties of streptococcus and veillonella isolates from the human small intestine microbiota.
AB  == the human small intestine is a key site for interactions between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system. here we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of representative species of commonly dominant small-intestinal microbial communities, including six streptococcal strains (four streptococcus salivarius, one s. equinus, one s. parasanguinis) one veillonella parvula strain, one enterococcus gallinarum strain, and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 as a bench mark strain on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. the different streptococci induced varying levels of the cytokines il-8, tnf-alpha, and il-12p70, while the v. parvula strain showed a strong capacity to induce il-6. e. gallinarum strain was a potent inducer of cytokines and tlr2/6 signalling. as streptococcus and veillonella can potentially interact metabolically and frequently co-occur in ecosystems, immunomodulation by pair-wise combinations of strains were also tested for their combined immunomodulatory properties. strain combinations induced cytokine responses in dendritic cells that differed from what might be expected on the basis of the results obtained with the individual strains. a combination of (some) streptococci with veillonella appeared to negate il-12p70 production, while augmenting il-8, il-6, il-10, and tnf-alpha responses. this suggests that immunomodulation data obtained in vitro with individual strains are unlikely to adequately represent immune responses to mixtures of gut microbiota communities in vivo. nevertheless, analysing the immune responses of strains representing the dominant species in the intestine may help to identify immunomodulatory mechanisms that influence immune homeostasis.

TI  == production of itaconic acid in escherichia coli expressing recombinant alpha-amylase using starch as substrate.
AB  == several studies on fermentative production of a vinyl monomer itaconic acid from  hydrolyzed starch using aspergillus terreus have been reported. herein, we report itaconic acid production by escherichia coli expressing recombinant alpha-amylase, using soluble starch as its sole carbon source. to express alpha-amylase in e. coli, we first constructed recombinant plasmids expressing alpha-amylases by using cell surface display technology derived from two amylolytic bacteria, bacillus amyloliquefaciens nbrc 15535(t) and streptococcus bovis nric 1535. the recombinant alpha-amylase from s. bovis (sba) showed activity at 28 degrees c, which is the optimal temperature for production of itaconic acid, while alpha-amylase from b. amyloliquefaciens displayed no noticeable activity. e. coli cells expressing sba produced 0.15 g/l itaconic acid after 69 h cultivation under ph-stat conditions, using 1% starch as the sole carbon source. in fact, e. coli cells expressing sba had similar growth rates when grown in the presence of 1% glucose or starch, thereby highlighting the expression of an active alpha-amylase that enabled utilization of starch to produce itaconic acid in e. coli.

TI  == effects of nitrate addition to a diet on fermentation and microbial populations in the rumen of goats, with special reference to selenomonas ruminantium having the ability to reduce nitrate and nitrite.
AB  == this study investigated the effects of dietary nitrate addition on ruminal fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in goats. the involvement  of selenomonas ruminantium in nitrate and nitrite reduction in the rumen was also examined. as the result of nitrate feeding, the total concentration of ruminal volatile fatty acids decreased, whereas the acetate : propionate ratio and the concentrations of ammonia and lactate increased. populations of methanogens, protozoa and fungi, as estimated by real-time pcr, were greatly decreased as a result of nitrate inclusion in the diet. there was modest or little impact of nitrate on the populations of prevailing species or genus of bacteria in the rumen, whereas streptococcus bovis and s. ruminantium significantly increased. both the activities of nitrate reductase (nar) and nitrite reductase (nir) per total mass of ruminal bacteria were increased by nitrate feeding. quantification  of the genes encoding nar and nir by real-time pcr with primers specific for s. ruminantium showed that these genes were increased by feeding nitrate, suggesting that the growth of nitrate- and nitrite-reducing s. ruminantium is stimulated by  nitrate addition. thus, s. ruminantium is likely to play a major role in nitrate  and nitrite reduction in the rumen.

TI  == cloning, expression, and purification of a new antibacterial substance gene from  larvae of musca domestica (diptera: muscidae).
AB  == musca domestica l. (diptera: muscidae), the housefly, exhibits unique immune defenses and can produce antibacterial substances upon stimulation with bacteria. on the basis of the cdna library constructed using the suppression subtractive hybridization method, a 1188-bp antibacterial substance gene, which we named as566, was amplified by rapid amplification of cdna ends from m. domestica larva  stimulated with salmonella pullorum (enterobacteriaceae: salmonella). in this study, the full-length as566 gene was cloned and inserted into a his-tagged escherichia coli (enterobacteriaceae: escherichia) prokaryotic expression system  to enable production of the recombinant protein. the recombinant as566 protein was purified in denatured form from inclusion bodies and renatured to obtain functionally active as566 protein. the bacteriostatic activity of the recombinant purified as566 protein was assessed using the oxford plate assay system and the results indicated that as566 had antibacterial activity against six bacteria, including an e. coli clinical isolate, s. pullorum, streptococcus bovis (streptococcaceae: streptococcus), streptococcus suis, and staphylococcus aureus  (staphylococcaceae: staphylococcus) in vitro. the antibacterial activity of as566 toward gram- bacteria was two times greater than that against gram+ bacteria. the sequencing results and blast analysis showed that the antibacterial substance gene as566 was not homologous to any other antibacterial substance genes in genbank. the antibacterial mechanisms of the newly discovered as566 protein warrant further study.

TI  == efficient co-displaying and artificial ratio control of alpha-amylase and glucoamylase on the yeast cell surface by using combinations of different anchoring domains.
AB  == recombinant yeast strains that display heterologous amylolytic enzymes on their cell surface via the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchoring system are considered as promising biocatalysts for direct ethanol production from starchy materials. for the effective hydrolysis of these materials, the ratio optimization of multienzyme activity displayed on the cell surface is important.  in this study, we have presented a ratio control system of multienzymes displayed on the yeast cell surface by using different gpi-anchoring domains. the novel gene cassettes for the cell-surface display of streptococcus bovis alpha-amylase  and rhizopus oryzae glucoamylase were constructed using the saccharomyces cerevisiae sed1 promoter and two different gpi-anchoring regions derived from saccharomyces cerevisiae sed1 or sag1. these gene cassettes were integrated into  the saccharomyces cerevisiae genome in different combinations. then, the cell-surface alpha-amylase and glucoamylase activities and ethanol productivity of these recombinant strains were evaluated. the combinations of the gene cassettes of these enzymes affected the ratio of cell-surface alpha-amylase and glucoamylase activities and ethanol productivity of the recombinant strains. the  highest ethanol productivity from raw starch was achieved by the strain harboring one alpha-amylase gene cassette carrying the sed1-anchoring region and two glucoamylase gene cassettes carrying the sed1-anchoring region (by-aass/gass/gass). this strain yielded 22.5 +/- 0.6 g/l of ethanol from 100 g/l of raw starch in 120 h of fermentation.

TI  == is streptococcus bovis a urinary pathogen?
AB  == the streptococcus bovis group (sbg) comprises several microorganisms associated with human infections. they have been associated with bacteremia, endocarditis, biliary tract infection, meningitis, and colorectal cancer, but their role as urinary pathogens is not well known. the objective of this investigation was to discover the incidence and clinical significance of the bacteriuria associated with this complex. a retrospective analysis of all adult patients with bacteriuria caused by sbg during the period 1995-2012 was carried out. during the study period, sbg was isolated in 153 adult patients, who had a mean age of 67 years, most of them being women (80%). most of our patients (65%) had some underlying disease, with urologic disease being the most common (37%), followed by diabetes mellitus (27%) and neurologic disease (25%). among the 88 patients in whom we were able to correctly assess symptoms, 45% had asymptomatic bacteriuria, 35% had lower urinary tract infection, and 20% had upper urinary tract infection. in 14 cases (9%), sbg was also isolated in blood cultures. most of the isolates of sbg (72%) were s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus. all isolates were susceptible to penicillin, 98% to nitrofurantoin, and 77% to fosfomycin. although sbg bacteriuria is uncommon, it should not always be taken as a contaminant, mainly when s. pasteurianus is isolated, because it may cause urinary tract infections and, occasionally, sepsis, whereas when s. gallolyticus is isolated from urine, it may be a marker of underlying endocarditis and colorectal cancer.

TI  == effect of fiber digestibility and conservation method on feed intake and the ruminal ecosystem of growing steers.
AB  == fiber digestibility is an important factor regulating dmi in ruminants. additionally, the ensiling process can also affect digestibility and chemical composition of the forage. the objective of this study was to investigate effects of sugarcane ndf digestibility (ndfd) and conservation method on intake, rumen kinetics, and the ruminal ecosystem of steers. eight ruminally cannulated nellore steers (275+/-22 kg bw) were used in a replicated 4x4 latin square design with a  2x2 factorial arrangement of treatments. two sugarcane genotypes divergent for stalk ndfd were used: iac86-2480 with high ndfd and sp91-1049 with low ndfd. experimental diets were formulated with 40% sugarcane, either freshly cut or as silage, and 60% concentrate on a dm basis. each experimental period lasted for 14 d, with the last 4 d used for determination of intake, ruminal evacuation, and ruminal fluid collection. the effect of fiber digestibility on dm and ndf intake  was dependent on the forage conservation method (p=0.01). high ndfd increased (p<0.01) dmi only when sugarcane was offered as silage, having no effect (p=0.41) on dmi when offered as freshly cut. conservation method had no effect on total ruminal mass, with only a tendency (p<0.10) for greater ndf and indigestible ndf  ruminal mass in steers fed the low-ndfd genotype. the ndf turnover and passage rates were greater (p<0.05) for the genotype with high ndfd but only when offered as silage. liquid turnover rate in the rumen was greater (p=0.02) for diets containing silage, with no effect of genotype (p=0.87). there was no effect of ndfd genotype on ruminal ph (p=0.77); however, diets containing sugarcane as silage increased (p<0.01) ruminal ph. total concentration of short chain fatty acids (p=0.05) and proportions of propionate (p=0.01) were greater for diets containing fresh sugarcane. diets with fresh sugarcane increased the ruminal population of streptococcus bovis (p<0.01) and ruminococcus albus (p=0.03). the relative population of r. albus was also greater (p=0.04) for diets containing the sugarcane genotype with high ndfd. feeding diets containing the sugarcane genotype with high ndfd increased fibrobacter succinogenes population but only when sugarcane was fed as freshly cut (p=0.02). using sugarcane genotypes with high ndfd can increase intake and benefit fiber-degrading bacteria in the rumen.

TI  == active dry saccharomyces cerevisiae can alleviate the effect of subacute ruminal  acidosis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of the study was to determine the effect of active dry saccharomyces cerevisiae (adsc) supplementation on dry matter intake, milk yield, milk components, ruminal ph, and microbial community during a dietary regimen that leads to subacute ruminal acidosis (sara). sixteen multiparous, rumen-cannulated lactating holstein cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments that included adsc (biomate; ab vista, marlborough, uk; 8 x 10(10) cfu/head per day) or control. during wk 1 to 6, all cows received a high-forage (hf) diet (77:23, forage:concentrate). cows were then abruptly switched during wk 7 to a high-grain (hg) diet (49:51, forage:concentrate) and remained on the hg until the end of wk 10. feed intake and milk yields were recorded daily. ruminal  ph was recorded continuously using an indwelling system for 1 to 2 d per week during the pre-experimental phase, and wk 6, 7, and 10. ruminal digesta samples were collected at the end of the experiment and analyzed for relative change in microbial communities using real-time quantitative pcr. cows were considered to have sara if the duration below ph 5.6 was >/=300 min/d. ruminal ph during wk 6 (hf plateau) was not different across treatments (15 +/- 46 min/d at ph <5.6). the dietary regimen successfully induced sara during wk 7 (transition from hf to  hg diet), and ruminal ph (551 +/- 46 min/d at ph <5.6) was not different across treatments. however, cows receiving adsc had an improved ruminal ph (122 +/- 57 vs. 321 +/- 53 min/d at ph <5.6) during wk 10 (hg plateau) compared with control. additionally, cows receiving adsc had a better dry matter intake (23.3 +/- 0.66 vs. 21.6 +/- 0.61 kg/d) and 4% fat-corrected milk yield (29.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 26.5 +/- 1.2 kg/d) than control cows during the hg phase (wk 8 to 10). during hg feeding, cows receiving adsc had greater total volatile fatty acid and propionate concentrations (175 +/- 7.5 vs. 154 +/- 7.5 and 117 +/- 6.1 vs. 94 +/- 5.7 mm for adsc and control, respectively) and lower acetate:propionate ratio (0.26 +/- 0.5  vs. 0.36 +/- 0.05 for adsc and control, respectively). microbial analyses conducted on samples collected during wk 10 showed that cows supplemented with s. cerevisiae had a 9-fold, 2-fold, 6-fold, 1.3-fold, and 8-fold increase in s. cerevisiae, fibrobacter succinogenes, anaerovibrio lipolytica, ruminococcus albus, and anaerobic fungi, respectively, which suggested an increase in cellulolytic microbes within the rumen. cows supplemented with adsc had 2.2-fold  reduction in prevotella albensis, which is a gram-negative bacterium predominant  during sara. prevotella spp. are suggested to be an important source of lipopolysaccharide responsible for inflammation within the rumen. cows supplemented with adsc had a 2.3-fold increase in streptococcus bovis and a 12-fold reduction in megasphaera elsdenii. the reduction in m. elsdenii may reflect lower concentration of lactic acid within the rumen for adsc cows. in conclusion, adsc supplementation to dairy cows was demonstrated to alleviate the  condition of sara caused by abrupt dietary changes from hf to hg, and can potentially improve rumen function, as indicated by greater numbers of cellulolytic microorganisms within the rumen.

TI  == genomics, evolution, and molecular epidemiology of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec).
AB  == the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) is a group of human and animal derived streptococci that are commensals (rumen and gastrointestinal tract), opportunistic pathogens or food fermentation associates. the classification of sbsec has undergone massive changes and currently comprises 7 (sub)species grouped into four branches based on sequences identities: the streptococcus gallolyticus, the streptococcus equinus, the streptococcus infantarius and the streptococcus alactolyticus branch. in animals, sbsec are causative agents for ruminal acidosis, potentially laminitis and infective endocarditis (ie). in humans, a strong association was established between bacteraemia, ie and colorectal cancer. especially the sbsec-species s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is an emerging pathogen for ie and prosthetic joint infections. s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus and the s. infantarius branch are further associated with biliary and urinary tract infections. knowledge on pathogenic mechanisms is so far limited to colonization factors such as pili and biofilm formation. certain strain variants of s. gallolyticus subsp.  macedonicus and s. infantarius subsp. infantarius are associated with traditional dairy and plant-based food fermentations and display traits suggesting safety. however, due to their close relationship to virulent strains, their use in food fermentation has to be critically assessed. additionally, implementing accurate and up-to-date taxonomy is critical to enable appropriate treatment of patients and risk assessment of species and strains via recently developed multilocus sequence typing schemes to enable comparative global epidemiology. comparative genomics revealed that sbsec strains harbour genomics islands (gi) that seem acquired from other streptococci by horizontal gene transfer. in case of virulent strains these gi frequently encode putative virulence factors, in strains from food fermentation the gi encode functions that are pivotal for strain performance during fermentation. comparative genomics is a powerful tool to identify acquired pathogenic functions, but there is still an urgent need for more physiological and epidemiological data to understand sbsec-specific traits.

AB  == an 80-year-old japanese man had a fall presented with a 3-week history of right lumbago exacerbated by body movement as well as a 1-week history of anomalous behavior and appetite loss. he visited our hospital complaining of difficulty in  standing up. he had a history of mitral prolapse due to an unknown rupture of the chordae tendineae 3 years earlier, which resulted in moderate mitral valve regurgitation and atrial fibrillation. upon visiting the hospital, he had petechial hemorrhage and jaundice of the conjunctiva, a systolic murmur (levine ii/vi) at the apex and 4th interspace of the left sternal border, and a positive  right straight leg raising test result. moderate bilirubinemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation which were considered to have been produced secondarily were observed. infective endocarditis was suspected, and 3 sets of blood culture  were extracted. the patient was admitted on the same day. blood cultures were positive for streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (6/6) on the following day. transesophagela echocardiography was carried out on the same day,  and vegetation with a diameter of 4mm was observed in the anterior mitral leaflet; the patient was subsequently diagnosed as having infective endocarditis. colonic endoscopy was performed after hospitalization. twelve colonic adenomata were found, and endoscopic mucosal resection was performed on one polyp. the bacterium found in the culture was classified as streptococcus bovis type i, which causes infective endocarditis and bacteremia. furthermore, this bacteria is a relatively rare causative organism of infective endocarditis. tolerance to macrolide and tetracycline are reported in the literature. moreover, the cell wall of this bacterium may have low pathogenicity as well as cause chronic inflammation in the large intestine mucous membrane, colonic polyps, and colorectal cancer. several colonic adenomata and a partial shift to a malignant pathology were observed in this case. when this bacterium is detected, searching  for a pathological change in the large intestine is believed to be indispensable.

AB  == the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected  animals was investigated. demodex bovis and d. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. the mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes (group a)) and opportunistic organisms (proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and moraxella bovis and staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes (group a) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent  microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. the "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.

TI  == bovicin hc5 and nisin reduce staphylococcus aureus adhesion to polystyrene and change the hydrophobicity profile and gibbs free energy of adhesion.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen often multidrug-resistant that not only causes a variety of human diseases, but also is able to survive on biotic and abiotic surfaces through biofilm communities. the best way to inhibit  biofilm establishment is to prevent cell adhesion. in the present study, subinhibitory concentrations of the bacteriocins bovicin hc5 and nisin were tested for their capability to interfere with the adhesion of s. aureus to polystyrene. subinhibitory dosages of the bacteriocins reduced cell adhesion and  this occurred probably due to changes in the hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell and polystyrene surfaces. after treatment with bovicin hc5 and nisin, the surfaces became more hydrophilic and the free energy of adhesion (g(adhesion)) between bacteria and the polystyrene surface was unfavorable. the transcriptional level of selected genes was assessed by rt-qpcr approach, revealing that the bacteriocins affected the expression of some important biofilm associated genes (icad, fnba, and clfb) and rnaiii, which is involved in the quorum sensing mechanism. the conditioning of food-contact surfaces with bacteriocins can be an  innovative and powerful strategy to prevent biofilms in the food industry. the results are relevant for food safety as they indicate that bovicin hc5 and nisin  can inhibit bacterial adhesion and consequent biofilm establishment, since cell adhesion precedes biofilm formation.

TI  == childhood meningitis caused by streptococcus bovis group: clinical and biologic data during a 12-year period in france.
AB  == background: bacterial meningitis (bm) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. sporadic cases of streptococcus bovis have been described in neonates and infants. to assess the epidemiologic, clinical and biologic characteristics of this meningitis, we used the french surveillance network for bm in children. methods: two hundred and twenty-seven pediatric wards working with 168 microbiology departments throughout france were asked to report all cases of bm in patients <18 years. diagnosis was based on a combination of fever, meningeal signs and a positive cerebrospinal fluid (csf) culture and/or a positive polymerase chain reaction in the csf and/or positive blood culture associated with pleiocytosis. results: among 4806 cases of bm recorded in 12 years (2001-2012), 23 cases were caused by s. bovis (0.5%). all were infants. among them, 15 cases (65.2%) occurred in the neonatal period. the majority occurred in premature infants (73.9%). in 21 cases, the diagnosis was based on a  positive csf culture. blood culture was positive in 17 children. when s. bovis subtype was identified, it was type 2 (streptococcus gallolyticus pasteurianus) in 80% of cases. all infants received antibiotic therapy with parenteral penicillin and/or third-generation cephalosporin combined with an aminoglycoside. the duration of treatment ranged from 10 to 25 days. of the 23 patients, 17 (73.9%) had a second lumbar puncture and in all those cases, the csf was sterile. no deaths or neurologic complications were reported. conclusion: bm due to s. bovis is rare and primarily affects infants, particularly premature infants. antibiotic treatment is effective with low morbidity and mortality.

TI  == dissecting the catalytic and substrate binding activity of a class ii lanthipeptide synthetase bovm.
AB  == lanm proteins are the synthetases of the class ii lanthipeptides, which are responsible for lanthionine or methyllanthionine formation in lanthipeptides. lanms are bifunctional enzymes with n-terminal dehydratase and c-terminal cyclase domains. however, the catalytic and especially the substrate binding function of  lanm are not fully investigated. in this study, we analyzed the function of conserved residues of bovm, which is the synthetase of lanthipeptide bovicin hj50, with alanine substitution method. mass spectrometry (ms) and surface plasmon resonance (spr) analyses showed six hydrophilic residues (e.g. asp247) were involved in the dehydration activity of bovm and four hydrophobic residues (e.g. ile254) were responsible for the substrate binding of bovm. in addition, a  conserved asp155 was proposed to be general base in the elimination of phosphates during the dehydration reactions. this research of bovm shed a light on the catalytic and substrate binding mechanism of lanm proteins.

TI  == comparative genomics of the bacterial genus streptococcus illuminates evolutionary implications of species groups.
AB  == members of the genus streptococcus within the phylum firmicutes are among the most diverse and significant zoonotic pathogens. this genus has gone through considerable taxonomic revision due to increasing improvements of chemotaxonomic  approaches, dna hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequencing. it is proposed to place the majority of streptococci into "species groups". however, the evolutionary implications of species groups are not clear presently. we use comparative genomic approaches to yield a better understanding of the evolution of streptococcus through genome dynamics, population structure, phylogenies and virulence factor distribution of species groups. genome dynamics analyses indicate that the pan-genome size increases with the addition of newly sequenced  strains, while the core genome size decreases with sequential addition at the genus level and species group level. population structure analysis reveals two distinct lineages, one including pyogenic, bovis, mutans and salivarius groups, and the other including mitis, anginosus and unknown groups. phylogenetic dendrograms show that species within the same species group cluster together, and infer two main clades in accordance with population structure analysis. distribution of streptococcal virulence factors has no obvious patterns among the species groups; however, the evolution of some common virulence factors is congruous with the evolution of species groups, according to phylogenetic inference. we suggest that the proposed streptococcal species groups are reasonable from the viewpoints of comparative genomics; evolution of the genus is congruent with the individual evolutionary trajectories of different species groups.

AB  == there is a well known association between streptococcus bovis infection and the presence of a coexisting colonic adenocarcinoma. association of s. bovis with other malignancies has only been rarely reported. we report a 77-year-old male who presented with with streptococcus bovis bacteremia in the setting of acute cholecystitis. given the association of colon adenocarcinoma and streptococcus bovis bacteremia, colonoscopy was performed prior to cholecystectomy to evaluate  a possible coexisting colon neoplasm, which was negative. at cholecystectomy, the patient was found to have a carcinoma of the gallbladder, which was treated with  radical cholecystectomy and periportal lymphadenectomy. this is the first case of streptococcus bovis infection and coexisting gallbladder cancer to be reported, and highlights the need for maintenance of a high index of suspicion for malignancies other than colon cancer when patients present with streptococcus bovis bacteremia.

TI  == ruminal bacterial community shifts in grain-, sugar-, and histidine-challenged dairy heifers.
AB  == ruminal bacterial community composition (bcc) and its associations with ruminal fermentation measures were studied in dairy heifers challenged with combinations  of grain, fructose, and histidine in a partial factorial study. holstein-friesian heifers (n=30) were randomly allocated to 5 triticale grain-based treatment groups: (1) control (no grain), (2) grain [fed at a dry matter intake (dmi) of 1.2% of body weight (bw)], (3) grain (0.8% of bw dmi) + fructose (0.4% of bw dmi), (4) grain (1.2% of bw dmi) + histidine (6g/head), and (5) grain (0.8% of bw dmi) + fructose (0.4% of bw dmi) + histidine (6g/head). ruminal fluid was collected using a stomach tube 5, 115, and 215min after consumption of the rations and bacterial 16s ribosomal dna sequence data was analyzed to characterize bacteria. large variation among heifers and distinct bcc were evident in a between-group constrained principal components analysis. bacterial composition in the fructose-fed heifers was positively related to total lactate and butyrate concentrations. bacterial composition was positively associated with ruminal ammonia, valerate, and histamine concentrations in the grain-fed heifers. the predominant phyla were the firmicutes (57.6% of total recovered sequences), bacteroidetes (32.0%), and candidate phylum tm7 (4.0%). prevotella was the dominant genus. in general, grain or histidine or their interactions with time had minimal effects on the relative abundance of bacterial phyla and families. fructose increased and decreased the relative abundance of the firmicutes and proteobacteria phyla over time, respectively, and decreased the abundance of the  prevotellaceae family over time. the relative abundance of the streptococcaceae and veillonellaceae families was increased in the fructose-fed heifers and these  heifers over time. a total of 31 operational taxonomic units differed among treatment groups in the 3.6h sampling period, streptococcus bovis was observed in fructose fed animals. the tm7 candidate phylum had an increased abundance of sequence reads by over 2.5 fold due to the introduction of histidine into the diet. rapid changes in bcc can occur in a short period after a single substrate challenge and the nature of these changes may influence ruminal acidosis risk and differ from those in cattle exposed to substrate challenges over a longer time period.

TI  == comparison of clinical features of left-sided infective endocarditis involving previously normal versus previously abnormal valves.
AB  == native valve infective endocarditis (ie) in patients with normal valves has increased in the last decades. whether patients with normal valves present a similar prognosis to those with pathologic valves is unresolved. our aim is to describe epidemiologic and clinical differences between patients with left-sided  ie and normal valves and those with native pathologic valves. we analyzed 945 consecutive episodes of ie, 435 of which involved left-sided nonprosthetic ie. they were classified into 2 groups: episodes in normal valves (normal group, n=173) and episodes in pathologic valves (abnormal group, n=262). patients in the normal group were younger, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus bovis were more frequently isolated, and vegetations were more frequently found. heart failure, septic shock, and the need for surgery or death were more common. multivariate analysis identified the following as factors independently associated with normal valve ie: age<65 years, s bovis, s aureus, heart failure,  and vegetation detection. factors independently associated with in-hospital events included s aureus, periannular complications, heart failure, and septic shock development. in conclusion, compared with patients with abnormal valve ie,  patients with ie on normal valves were younger, had a more virulent microbiological profile, developed heart failure and septic shock more frequently, needed more surgical procedures, and had worse prognosis.

TI  == streptococcus viridians bacteraemia and colonic adenocarcinoma.
AB  == even though streptococcus bacteraemia is an infrequent presentation of colonic malignancies, there is a well-established link between streptococcus bovis bacteraemia and colonic malignancies. most of the physicians are well aware of this correlation and further workup is pursued in most of the cases. however, many physicians may not be aware that other species of streptococcus viridians, other than s. bovis, can be associated with colonic malignancies. in this case report, we present a case of streptococcus viridians (anginosus) bacteraemia as a complication of an undiagnosed sigmoid adenocarcinoma. while further evidence is  needed to warrant a gastrointestinal (gi) workup in a patient with other species  of streptococcus viridians bacteraemia, we would like to increase the awareness in the physicians' community regarding streptococcus viridians, other than s. bovis bacteraemia. this would be especially relevant for patients who have no gi  screening, as streptococcus viridians bacteraemia can be an early sign of colonic neoplasm.

TI  == analysis of bacterial communities and bacterial pathogens in a biogas plant by the combination of ethidium monoazide, pcr and ion torrent sequencing.
AB  == the present study investigated the changes of bacterial community composition including bacterial pathogens along a biogas plant, i.e. from the influent, to the biogas reactor and to the post-digester. the effects of post-digestion temperature and time on the changes of bacterial community composition and bacterial pathogens were also studied. microbial analysis was made by ion torrent sequencing of the pcr amplicons from ethidium monoazide treated samples, and ethidium monoazide was used to cleave dna from dead cells and exclude it from pcr amplification. both similarity and taxonomic analysis showed that the bacterial community composition in the influent was changed after anaerobic digestion. firmicutes were dominant in all the samples, while proteobacteria decreased in the biogas reactor compared with the influent. variations of bacterial community  composition in the biogas reactor with time were also observed. this could be attributed to varying composition of the influent. batch experiments showed that  the methane recovery from the digested residues (obtained from biogas reactor) was mainly related with post-digestion temperature. however, post-digestion time  rather than temperature had a significant effect on the changes of bacterial community composition. the changes of bacterial community composition were also reflected in the changes of relative abundance of bacterial pathogens. the richness and relative abundance of bacterial pathogens were reduced after anaerobic digestion in the biogas reactor. it was found in batch experiments that bacterial pathogens showed the highest relative abundance and richness after 30 days' post-digestion. streptococcus bovis was found in all the samples. our results showed that special attention should be paid to the post-digestion since  the increase in relative abundance of bacterial pathogens after post-digestion might reflect regrowth of bacterial pathogens and limit biosolids disposal vectors.

TI  == streptococcus bovis infection and colorectal neoplasia: a meta-analysis.
AB  == aim: a meta-analysis was conducted to determine the risk associated with streptococcus bovis infection and the occurrence of colorectal neoplasia (crn). the level of risk remains unknown. method: we conducted a search of medline, pubmed and embase up to january 2014. we used a random-effects model to analyse the data. results: we identified 48 studies concerning three main topics: s. bovis septicaemia, s. bovis endocarditis and s. bovis faecal carriage. the total  sample sizes were 1729, 807 and 1145, respectively; the 48 studies included 9 case-control studies and 39 case series. overall, the presence of s. bovis infection was found to be significantly associated with the presence of crn. streptococcus bovis endocarditis showed the strongest association in analyses of  case-control studies and case series (or 14.54, 95% ci 5.66-37.35, test for heterogeneity i2 = 43.53; event rate of 0.53, 95% ci 0.45-0.61, test for heterogeneity i2 = 53.50). similarly, s. bovis septicaemia was also associated with a high level of concurrence with crn (or 7.48, 95% ci 3.10-18.06, test for heterogeneity i(2) = 43.32; event rate 0.49, 95% ci 0.42-0.56, test for heterogeneity i2 = 69.97). patients with crn were found to have a higher incidence of s. bovis in faeces upon stool culture (or 2.52, 95% ci 1.14-5.58, test for heterogeneity i2 = 69.17). conclusion: the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant association between the presence of s. bovis endocarditis or s. bovis septicaemia and crn. furthermore, there is a statistically significant increase in likelihood of finding s. bovis in the stool of individuals with crn.

TI  == bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics, a novel subgroup of lantibiotics featured by an indispensable disulfide bridge.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally-synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides with potent antimicrobial activities. discovery of novel lantibiotics has been greatly accelerated with the soaring release of genomic information of microorganisms. as a unique class ii lantibiotic, bovicin hj50 is produced by streptococcus bovis hj50 and contains one rare disulfide bridge. by using its precursor bova as a drive sequence, 16 bova-like peptides were revealed in a wide variety of species. from them, three representative novel lan loci from clostridium perfringens d str. jgs1721, bacillus cereus as 1.348 and b. thuringiensis as 1.013 were identified by pcr screening. the corresponding mature lantibiotics designated perecin, cerecin and thuricin were obtained and structurally elucidated to be bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics especially by containing a conserved disulfide bridge. the disulfide bridge was substantiated to be essential for the function of bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics as its disruption eliminated their antimicrobial activities. further analysis indicated  that the disulfide bridge played a crucial role in maintaining the hydrophobicity of bovicin hj50, which might facilitate it to exert antimicrobial function. this  study unveiled a novel subgroup of disulfide-containing lantibiotics from bacteria of different niches and further demonstrated the indispensable role of disulfide bridge in these novel bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics.

TI  == type aii lantibiotic bovicin hj50 with a rare disulfide bond: structure, structure-activity relationships and mode of action.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides containing unusual amino acids. as promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics, they  have a high potential for alleviating the problem of emergent antibiotic resistance, with possible applications in many industries that have antibacterial demand. bovicin hj50 is a type aii lantibiotic, the largest group of lantibiotics, comprising a linear n-terminal region and a globular c-terminal region. interestingly, bovicin h50 has a disulfide bond that is rare in this group. owing to limited information about the spatial structures of type aii lantibiotics, the functional regions of this type and the role of the disulfide bond are still unknown. in the present study, we resolved the solution structure  of bovicin hj50 using nmr spectroscopy. this is the first spatial structure of a  type aii lantibiotic. bovicin hj50 exhibited high flexibility in aqueous solution, whereas varied rigidities were observed in the different rings with the conserved ring a being the most rigid. the charged residues lys(1)(1), asp(1)(2)  and lys(3)(0), as well as the essential disulfide bond were critical for antimicrobial activity. importantly, bovicin hj50 showed not only peptidoglycan precursor lipid ii-binding ability, but also pore-forming activity, which is significantly different from other bacteriostatic type aii lantibiotics, suggesting a novel antimicrobial mechanism.

TI  == infective endocarditis caused by streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus and colon cancer.
AB  == a 56-year-old man presented to our department with a 2-month history of fever and chills. he had received a mitral valvuloplasty 3 years ago. he had been administered levofloxacin for 2 months. we discontinued levofloxacin and repeated the blood cultures. bacterial blood cultures were positive and transoesophageal echocardiography revealed vegetation attached to the posterior mitral leaflet. we started the patient on intravenous antibiotic therapy for infectious endocarditis by streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus. a colonoscopic screening revealed adenomatoid intracellular carcinoma. previous studies have reported a weak association between colorectal cancer and streptococcus bovis biotype ii/2,  which includes s gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus; however, the rate is notably higher than the rate of colorectal cancer as indicated by positive faecal occult-blood test results. we conclude that colonoscopies should be routine while scanning for colorectal cancer in all patients with s bovis bacteraemia, regardless of the subspecies.

TI  == development and application of a multilocus sequence typing scheme for streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (formerly known as s. bovis biotype i) is a commensal of the gastrointestinal tract in animals and in up to 15% of healthy humans. furthermore, it is a facultative pathogen that can cause infectious endocarditis, mastitis, and septicemia. the number of infections is increasing, but the transmission routes and zoonotic potential remain unknown. to assess the zoonotic potential and characterize the epidemiological structure of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, we established a multilocus sequence typing  (mlst) scheme. we amplified and sequenced internal fragments of seven housekeeping genes. the resulting sequences were analyzed with bionumerics software 6.6 by using the unweighted-pair group method using average linkages algorithm. a total of 101 s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains isolated from animals, humans, and environmental samples were analyzed and divided into 50 sequence types. our first results highlight the importance of this mlst scheme for investigating the epidemiology, transmission patterns, and infection chains of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.

TI  == inhibition of fructan-fermenting equine faecal bacteria and streptococcus bovis by hops (humulus lupulus l.) beta-acid.
AB  == aims: the goals of this study were to determine if beta-acid from hops (humulus lupulus l.) could be used to control fructan fermentation by equine hindgut micro-organisms, and to verify the antimicrobial mode of action on streptococcus  bovis, which has been implicated in fructan fermentation, hindgut acidosis and pasture-associated laminitis (pal) in the horse. methods and results: suspensions of uncultivated equine faecal micro-organisms produced fermentation acids when inulin (model fructan) was the substrate, but beta-acid (i.e. lupulone) concentrations >/=9 ppm inhibited lactate production and mitigated the decrease in ph. inulin-fermenting strep. bovis was isolated from the beta-acid-free suspensions after enrichment with inulin. the isolates were sensitive to beta-acid, which decreased the viable number of streptococci in faecal suspensions, as well as growth, lactate production and the intracellular potassium of strep. bovis in pure culture. conclusions: these results are consistent with the hypothesis that hops beta-acid prevented the growth of fructan-fermenting equine faecal bacteria, and that the mechanism of action was dissipation of the intracellular potassium of strep. bovis. significance and impact of the study: bacterial hindgut fermentation of grass fructans has been linked to pal and other metabolic disorders in horses. hops beta-acid is a potential phytochemical intervention to decrease the growth of bacteria responsible for pal.

TI  == comparative genomics of the dairy isolate streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 against related members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex.
AB  == background: within the genus streptococcus, only streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. members of the sbsec have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 to the other sbsec genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status. results: despite the fact that the sbsec species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. streptococcus macedonicus, streptococcus infantarius cj18 and streptococcus pasteurianus atcc 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. in addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of s. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. analysis of the s. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy lactococcus lactis and s. thermophilus as potential donors. in addition, s. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in s. gallolyticus. for example, s. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of s. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy s. infantarius cj18, but also for the blood isolate s. pasteurianus atcc 43144. conclusions: our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of s. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. during this  process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. finally, s. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative sbsec virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.

TI  == antimicrobial constituents and synergism effect of the essential oils from cymbopogon citratus and alpinia galanga.
AB  == from the fresh leaf sheathes of lemongrass (cymbopogon citratus) and rhizomes of  galanga (alpinia galanga) light yellow and colorless oils, respectively, were obtained by hydrodistillation and microwave assisted extraction (mae) in yields of 0.24% and 0.03%, and 0.11% and trace (w/w), respectively. by gc/ms analysis, five major constituents were identified in lemongrass oil, e-citral, z-citral, beta-myrcene, selina-6-en-4-ol, and cis-ocimene, and five in galanga oil, 1,8-cineole, phenol 4-(2-propenyl)-acetate, dl-limonene, alpha-pinene, and a-terpineol. three major components of the combined lemongrass and galanga oils (ratio 7:3, 1:1, 3:7) were 1,8-cineole (46.3%, 31.5%, 19.3%), e-citral (12.8%, 22.7%, 32.8%) and z-citral (8.5%, 15.2%, 21.6%). the mics of lemongrass and galanga oils were: against staphylococcus aureus 0.5% and 4%, v/v, against pseudomonas aeruginosa 40% and >40%,v/v, against streptococcus bovis 0.25% and 0.5%, v/v, and against candida albicans 0.25% and 0.5%, v/v. citral (from lemongrass oil) gave greater potentiation than 1,8-cineole (from galanga oil). the combination profiles of galanga oil with lemongrass oil (volume ratios 3:7, 1:1, and 7:3) were tested against the four pathogenic microorganisms. synergistic activity was best noted for only one ratio (volume ratio 3:7) as the sigmafic< 1  against all tested microorganisms. the present investigation provides evidenc that the utilization of two essential oils in combination should be assessed for  synergistic antimicrobial activity in order to reduce their minimum effective dose.

TI  == prognostic implications of diabetes in patients with left-sided endocarditis: findings from a large cohort study.
AB  == patients with diabetes mellitus (dm) have a higher incidence of infections, and those with bacteremia are more prone to develop sepsis and infective endocarditis (ie). nevertheless, data concerning the impact of dm on the prognosis of patients with ie are limited and sometimes contradictory. we examined the impact of dm on  the inhospital outcome of left-sided ie in a large cohort of patients. we studied 594 consecutive episodes of left-sided ie diagnosed at 3 tertiary care centers. they were divided into 2 groups: episodes in patients with dm (n = 114) and episodes in patients without dm (n = 480). we retrospectively analyzed the influence of dm therapy on patient outcome. compared to patients without dm, patients with dm were older (67 +/- 10 vs. 60 +/- 15 yr; p < 0.001), less frequently male (53.5% vs. 67.9%; p = 0.004), and more commonly had chronic renal failure (23.9% vs. 6.9%; p < 0.001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.6% vs. 7.8%; p = 0.019). enterococcus (14.9% vs. 7.4%; p = 0.011) and streptococcus bovis (8.8% vs. 3.8%; p = 0.024) were isolated more frequently. in  the univariable analysis, septic shock (29.2% vs. 16.4%; p = 0.005) and mortality (43.5% vs. 30.0%; p = 0.008) were more common among patients with dm than in those without. considering the different treatments for dm, septic shock (33.3%;  p = 0.011) and death (50.8%; p = 0.012) were more frequent in patients receiving  oral medication to treat diabetes than in patients with the other treatment modalities. however, multivariable analysis showed that dm had an independent association with development of septic shock (or 2.282; 95% ci 1.186-4.393), but  it was not a predictor of inhospital mortality.staphylococci were the most frequently involved microorganisms in all patients; however, enterococcus and streptococcus bovis were more frequently isolated from individuals with dm and left-sided ie, whereas viridans group streptococci were more commonly isolated from those with left-sided ie who did not have dm. dm was independently associated with the development of septic shock, but it was not an independent predictor of inhospital mortality in patients with left-sided ie.

TI  == bacteraemia due to streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus is associated with digestive tract malignancies and resistance to macrolides and clindamycin.
AB  == objectives: this study was intended to delineate the association between digestive tract malignancies and bacteraemia due to streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus. methods: we reviewed the medical records and microbiological results of patients with bacteraemia due to streptococcus bovis during the period 2000-2012. species and subspecies identification of isolates originally classified as s. bovis was confirmed by 16s rrna sequencing and pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) assays. minimum inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method. results: of the 172 s. bovis complex isolates obtained from 172 patients  (age range, <1-94 years, median age, 66) with bacteraemia, 31 isolates were identified to be s. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus, 126 were s. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus, and 15 were shown to be streptococcus infantarius. the majority (n = 104, 60%) of patients were male and had underlying malignancies (n = 87, 51%). bacteraemia due to s. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus was significantly associated with endocarditis while s. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus was more likely to be associated with malignancies of the digestive tract, including gastric, pancreatic, hepatobiliary and colorectal cancers. septic shock at presentation was the only factor associated with mortality among patients with bacteraemia due to either subspecies of s. bovis. isolates of s. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus had higher rates of resistance to macrolides and clindamycin than isolates of s. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus. conclusion: extensive diagnostic work-up for digestive tract malignancies and trans-esophageal echocardiogram should be investigated in  patients with bacteraemia caused by s. gallolyticus.

TI  == novel bartonella infection in northern and southern sea otters (enhydra lutris kenyoni and enhydra lutris nereis).
AB  == since 2002, vegetative valvular endocarditis (vve), septicemia and meningoencephalitis have contributed to an unusual mortality event (ume) of northern sea otters in southcentral alaska. streptococcal organisms were commonly isolated from vegetative lesions and organs from these sea otters. bartonella infection has also been associated with bacteremia and vve in terrestrial mammals, but little is known regarding its pathogenic significance in marine mammals. our study evaluated whether streptococcus bovis/equinus (sb/e) and bartonella infections were associated with ume-related disease characterized by vve and septicemia in alaskan sea otter carcasses recovered 2004-2008. these bacteria were also evaluated in southern sea otters in california. streptococcus  bovis/equinus were cultured from 45% (23/51) of northern sea otter heart valves,  and biochemical testing and sequencing identified these isolates as streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli. one-third of sea otter hearts were co-infected with bartonella spp. our analysis demonstrated that sb/e was strongly associated with  ume-related disease in northern sea otters (p<0.001). while bartonella infection  was also detected in 45% (23/51) and 10% (3/30) of heart valves of northern and southern sea otters examined, respectively, it was not associated with disease. phylogenetic analysis of the bartonella its region allowed detection of two bartonella species, one novel species closely related to bartonella spp. jm-1, b. washoensis and candidatus b. volans and another molecularly identical to b. henselae. our findings help to elucidate the role of pathogens in northern sea otter mortalities during this ume and suggested that bartonella spp. is common in sea otters from alaska and california.

TI  == phylogenomics and the dynamic genome evolution of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the genus streptococcus comprises important pathogens that have a severe impact on human health and are responsible for substantial economic losses to agriculture. here, we utilize 46 streptococcus genome sequences (44 species), including eight species sequenced here, to provide the first genomic level insight into the evolutionary history and genetic basis underlying the functional diversity of all major groups of this genus. gene gain/loss analysis revealed a dynamic pattern of genome evolution characterized by an initial period of gene gain followed by a period of loss, as the major groups within the genus diversified. this was followed by a period of genome expansion associated with the origins of the present extant species. the pattern is concordant with an emerging view that genomes evolve through a dynamic process of expansion and streamlining. a large proportion of the pan-genome has experienced lateral gene transfer (lgt) with causative factors, such as relatedness and shared environment, operating over different evolutionary scales. multiple gene ontology terms were significantly enriched for each group, and mapping terms onto the phylogeny showed that those corresponding to genes born on branches leading to the major groups represented approximately one-fifth of those enriched. furthermore, despite the extensive lgt, several biochemical characteristics have  been retained since group formation, suggesting genomic cohesiveness through time, and that these characteristics may be fundamental to each group. for example, proteolysis: mitis group; urea metabolism: salivarius group; carbohydrate metabolism: pyogenic group; and transcription regulation: bovis group.

TI  == is there a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy?

TI  == identification of ligand specificity determinants in lantibiotic bovicin hj50 and the receptor bovk, a multitransmembrane histidine kinase.
AB  == lantibiotic bovicin hj50 is produced by streptococcus bovis hj50 and acts as the  extracellular signal to autoregulate its own biosynthesis through bovk/r two-component system. bovicin hj50 shows a linear n-terminal and glubolar c-terminal structure, and the sensor histidine kinase bovk contains eight transmembrane segments lacking any extensive surface-exposed sensory domain. the  signal recognition mechanism between bovicin hj50 and bovk is still unknown. we performed saturated alanine scanning mutagenesis and other amino acid substitutions on bovicin hj50 using a semi-in vitro biosynthesis. results of the  mutants inducing activities indicated that several charged and hydrophobic amino  acids in ring b of bovicin hj50, as well as two glycines were key residues to recognize bovk. circular dichroism analyses indicated that both glycines contributed to bovicin hj50 structural changes in the membrane. biotin-labeled bovicin hj50 could interact with the n-terminal sensor of bovk, and several charged residues and a conserved hydrophobic region in the n-terminal portion of  bovk sensor domain were important for interacting with the signal bovicin hj50. by combining the results, we suggested a mechanism of bovicin hj50 recognizing and activating bovk mainly through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.

TI  == trends in diagnosis and control of bovine mastitis: a review.
AB  == mastitis (inflammation of mammary gland) is a most devastating disease condition  in terms of economic losses occurring throughout the world. the etiological agents may vary from place to place depending on climate; animal species and animal husbandry and include wide variety of gram positive and gram negative bacteria; and fungi. they may be either contagious viz. staphylococcus aureus; streptococcus agalactiae or environmental viz. s. dysgalactiae, s. uberis, corynebacterium bovis and coagulase negative staphylococcus. conventional diagnostic tests viz. california mastitis test (cmt); r-mastitest and mast-o-test methods are applied under field conditions; whereas somatic cell count and bulk tank somatic cell count (btscc) are useful for early mastitis detection and detection of sub clinical or chronic mastitis respectively. in vitro culture based diagnosis require further study as they can detect only viable cells. the advent of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technology along with its various versions like multiplex and real time pcr has improved the rapidity and sensitivity of diagnosis. circulating micro rna (mirna) based diagnosis; immune assay and proteomics based detection along with biochips and biosensors prove to  be asset to diagnosticians for advanced diagnosis of this economically important  condition. improvement of milking hygiene; implementation of post-milking teat disinfection; regular control of the milking equipments; implementation of milking order; improvement of bedding material are the general measures to prevent new cases of mastitis. the use of antibiotics (intramammary infusions; bacteriocins) and herbs (terminalia spp.) are important for prophylaxis and therapeutics. vaccines viz. cell based; recombinant (staphylococcal enterotoxin type c mutant) or chimeric (paua); live (s. uberis 0140j stain based) and bacterial surface extract based; dna-based and dna-protein based have greatly aided in management of bovine mastitis. quorum sensing and disease resistant breeding using novel biomarkers viz. toll like receptors (tlr) 2 and 4, interleukin (il) 8; breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (brca1) and calcium channel voltage-dependent alpha 2/delta sub unit 1 (cacna2d1) are also indispensable. this mini review gives an overview of all these different aspects  that act as trend setters as far as the diagnosis and control of bovine mastitis  is concerned to help the diagnosticians; epidemiologists and researchers not to remain ignorant about this grave condition.

TI  == cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies using quantitative real-time pcr and  bacterial culture to identify contagious mastitis cases in large dairy herds.
AB  == diagnostic strategies to detect contagious mastitis caused by mycoplasma bovis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae in dairy herds during an outbreak have been minimally studied with regard to cost and diagnostic sensitivity. the objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies for identification of infected cows in two california dairy herds during contagious mastitis outbreaks. m. bovis was  investigated in a subset of a herd (n=1210 cows) with an estimated prevalence of  2.8% (95% ci=1.9, 3.7), whereas staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae were studied  in a second herd (n=351 cows) with an estimated prevalence of 3.4% (95% ci=1.5, 5.3) and 16.8% (95% ci=12.9, 20.7), respectively. diagnostic strategies involved  a combination of testing stages that utilized bacterial culture, quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr), or both. strategies were applied to individual or pooled samples of 5, 10, 50 or 100 samples. culture was considered the gold standard for sensitivity estimation of each strategy. the reference strategy was the strategy  with the lowest cost per culture-positive cow which for both m. bovis and strep.  agalactiae consisted of 2 stages, culture of samples in pools of 5 followed by culture of individual samples in positive pools with a sensitivity of 73.5% (95%  ci: 55.6, 87.1) and 96.6% (95% ci: 27.7, 84.8), respectively. the reference strategy for staph. aureus consisted of 3 stages, culture of individual samples in pools of 100 (stage 1), culture constituents of those positive from stage 1 in pools of 5 (stage 2), culture constituents of those positive from stage 2 individually (stage 3) which resulted in a sensitivity of 58.3% (95% ci: 88.3, 99.6). the most cost-effective alternative to the reference strategy was whole herd milk culture for all 3 pathogens. qpcr testing was a component of the second most cost-effective alternative for m. bovis and the third most cost-effective alternatives for the 3 pathogens. a stochastic model was used to assess the effect of prevalence or herd size on the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies. in the current study, increasing the prevalence of mastitis did not alter the ranking of strategies by cost-effectiveness. however, larger herds could benefit from testing larger pools such as 50 or 100 samples to improve cost-effectiveness. several diagnostic strategy options exist to identify contagious mastitis in herds, decisions should be based on cost and sensitivity of the strategies available.

TI  == pathogen-specific effects on milk yield in repeated clinical mastitis episodes in holstein dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of clinical mastitis (cm) cases due to different pathogens on milk yield in holstein cows. the first 3 cm cases in a cow's lactation were modeled. eight categories of pathogens were included: streptococcus spp.; staphylococcus aureus; coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns); escherichia coli; klebsiella spp.; cases with cm signs but no bacterial growth (above the level detectable by our microbiological procedures) observed in the culture sample, and cases with contamination (>/= 3 pathogens in the sample); other pathogens that may be treated with antibiotics (included citrobacter, corynebacterium bovis, enterobacter, enterococcus, pasteurella, pseudomonas; "other treatable"); and other pathogens not successfully treated with antibiotics (trueperella pyogenes, mycoplasma, prototheca, yeasts; "other not treatable"). data from 38,276 lactations in cows from 5 new york state dairy herds, collected from 2003-2004 until 2011, were analyzed. mixed models with an autoregressive correlation structure (to account for correlation among the repeated measures of milk yield within a lactation) were estimated. primiparous (lactation 1) and multiparous (lactations 2 and 3) cows were analyzed separately, as the shapes of their lactation curves differed.  primiparas were followed for up to 48 wk of lactation and multiparas for up to 44 wk. fixed effects included parity, calving season, week of lactation, cm (type, case number, and timing of cm in relation to milk production cycle), and other diseases (milk fever, retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum).  herd was modeled as a random effect. clinical mastitis was more common in multiparas than in primiparas. in primiparas, streptococcus spp. occurred most frequently as the first case. in multiparas, e. coli was most common as the first case. in subsequent cases, cm cases with no specific growth or contamination were most common in both parity groups. the hazard of cm increased with case number. mastitic cows were generally higher producers before the cm episode than their nonmastitic herdmates. milk loss varied with pathogen and case number. in primiparas, the greatest losses were associated with e. coli and "other not treatable" organisms. in multiparas, the greatest losses were associated with klebsiella spp. and "other not treatable" organisms. milk loss was not associated with occurrence of cns. the findings may help farmers to make optimal management  decisions for their cows.

TI  == combined computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography  in the diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis: a case series.
AB  == background: the diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis is challenging. the gold standard for prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosis is trans-esophageal echocardiography. however, trans-esophageal echocardiography may result in negative findings or yield images difficult to differentiate from thrombus in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. combined computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is a potentially promising diagnostic tool for several infectious conditions and it has also been employed in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis but data are still scant. case presentations: we reviewed the charts of 6 patients with prosthetic aortic valves evaluated for suspicion of prosthetic valve endocarditis, at two different hospital, over a 3-year period. we found 3 patients with early-onset pve cases and blood cultures yielding pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus lugdunensis, respectively; and 3 late-onset cases in the remaining 3 patients with isolation in the blood of streptococcus bovis, candida  albicans and p. aeruginosa, respectively. initial trans-esophageal echocardiography was negative in all the patients, while fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed images suspicious for prosthetic valve endocarditis. in 4 out of 6 patients valve replacement was done with histology confirming the prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosis. after an adequate course  of antibiotic therapy fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed resolution of prosthetic valve endocarditis in all the patients. conclusion: our  experience confirms the potential role of fluoroseoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the diagnosis and follow-up of prosthetic valve endocarditis.

AB  == the study addressed the importance of yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) viability  for reducing the incidence of subacute ruminal acidosis (sara) and improving total tract nutrient digestibility in beef heifers. six ruminally cannulated beef heifers (680 +/- 50 kg bw) were used in a replicated 3 x 3 latin square design and were fed a diet consisting of 40% barley silage, 10% chopped grass hay, and 50% barley grain-based concentrate (dm basis). treatments were 1) no yeast (control), 2) active dried yeast (ady; 4 g providing 10(10) cfu/g; ab vista, marlborough, uk), and 3) killed dried yeast (kdy; 4 g autoclaved ady). the treatments were directly dosed via the ruminal cannula daily at the time of feeding. the periods consisted of 2 wk of adaptation (d 1 to 14) and 7 d of measurements (d 15 to 21). ruminal ph was continuously measured (d 15 to 21) using an indwelling system. ruminal contents were sampled on d 15 and 17 at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h after feeding. total tract nutrient digestibility was measured using an external marker (ybcl3) from d 15 to 19. no treatment difference was observed for dmi (p = 0.86). yeast supplementation (ady and kdy) tended to increase total tract digestibility of starch (p = 0.07) whereas no effects were observed on digestibility of other nutrients. both ady and kdy elevated minimum (p < 0.01) and mean ruminal ph (p = 0.02) whereas no effects were observed on maximum ph (p = 0.12). irrespective of its viability, yeast supplementation was effective in reducing time that ruminal ph was below 5.8 (p < 0.01) and 5.6 (p <  0.01). no treatment differences were observed for the ruminal vfa profile and lactate concentration. no treatment differences were observed on the relative population size of streptococcus bovis, fibrobacter succinogenes, and megasphaera elsdenii (p > 0.10); however, the proportion of ruminococcus flavefaciens in solid fraction of digesta was greater with kdy (p = 0.05). the study demonstrates the positive effects of yeast, irrespective of its viability, in reducing the severity of sara. however, further studies are required to evaluate the importance of yeast viability for other dietary conditions, particularly when the risk of acidosis is high.

TI  == characterization of the core rumen microbiome in cattle during transition from forage to concentrate as well as during and after an acidotic challenge.
AB  == this study investigated the effect of diet and host on the rumen bacterial microbiome and the impact of an acidotic challenge on its composition. using parallel pyrosequencing of the v3 hypervariable region of 16s rrna gene, solid and liquid associated bacterial communities of 8 heifers were profiled. heifers were exclusively fed forage, before being transitioned to a concentrate diet, subjected to an acidotic challenge and allowed to recover. samples of rumen digesta were collected when heifers were fed forage, mixed forage, high grain, during challenge (4 h and 12 h) and recovery. a total of 560,994 high-quality bacterial sequences were obtained from the solid and liquid digesta. using cluster analysis, prominent bacterial populations differed (p</=0.10) in solid and liquid fractions between forage and grain diets. differences among hosts and  diets were not revealed by dgge, but real time qpcr showed that several bacteria  taxon were impacted by changes in diet, with the exception of streptococcus bovis. analysis of the core rumen microbiome identified 32 otu's representing 10  distinct bacterial taxa including bacteroidetes (32.8%), firmicutes (43.2%) and proteobacteria (14.3%). diversity of otus was highest with forage with 38 unique  otus identified as compared to only 11 with the high grain diet. comparison of the microbial profiles of clincial vs. subclinical acidotic heifers found a increases in the relative abundances of acetitomaculum, lactobacillus, prevotella, and streptococcus. increases in streptococcus and lactobacillus likely reflect the tolerance of these species to low ph and their ability to proliferate on surplus fermentable carbohydrate. the acetogen, acetitomaculum may thereforeplay a role in the conversion of lactate to acetate in acidotic animals. further profiling of the bacterial populations associated with subclinical and clinical acidosis could establish a microbial fingerprint for these disorders and provide insight into whether there are causative microbial populations that could potentially be therapeutically manipulated.

TI  == comparative genomics analysis of streptococcus isolates from the human small intestine reveals their adaptation to a highly dynamic ecosystem.
AB  == the human small-intestinal microbiota is characterised by relatively large and dynamic streptococcus populations. in this study, genome sequences of small-intestinal streptococci from s. mitis, s. bovis, and s. salivarius species-groups were determined and compared with those from 58 streptococcus strains in public databases. the streptococcus pangenome consists of 12,403 orthologous groups of which 574 are shared among all sequenced streptococci and are defined as the streptococcus core genome. genome mining of the small-intestinal streptococci focused on functions playing an important role in the interaction of these streptococci in the small-intestinal ecosystem, including natural competence and nutrient-transport and metabolism. analysis of the small-intestinal streptococcus genomes predicts a high capacity to synthesize amino acids and various vitamins as well as substantial divergence in their carbohydrate transport and metabolic capacities, which is in agreement with observed physiological differences between these streptococcus strains. gene-specific pcr-strategies enabled evaluation of conservation of streptococcus  populations in intestinal samples from different human individuals, revealing that the s. salivarius strains were frequently detected in the small-intestine microbiota, supporting the representative value of the genomes provided in this study. finally, the streptococcus genomes allow prediction of the effect of dietary substances on streptococcus population dynamics in the human small-intestine.

TI  == [new insight into bacterial zoonotic pathogens posing health hazards to humans].
AB  == this article presents the problem of evolutionary changes of zoonotic pathogens responsible for human diseases. everyone is exposed to the risk of zoonotic infection, particularly employees having direct contact with animals, i.e. veterinarians, breeders, butchers and workers of animal products' processing industry. the article focuses on pathogens monitored by the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc), which has been collecting statistical data on zoonoses from all european union countries for 19 years and publishing collected data in annual epidemiological reports. currently, the most important 11 pathogens responsible for causing human zoonotic diseases are being monitored, of which seven are bacteria: salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium bovis, brucella spp., coxiella burnetti and verotoxin-producing e. coli (vtec)/shiga-like toxin producing e. coli (stec). as  particularly important are considered foodborne pathogens. the article also includes new emerging zoonotic bacteria, which are not currently monitored by ecdc but might pose a serious epidemiological problem in a foreseeable future: streptococcus iniae, s. suis, s. dysgalactiae and staphylococci: staphylococcus intermedius, s. pseudintermedius. those species have just crossed the animal-human interspecies barrier. the exact mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown, it is connected, however, with genetic variability, capability to survive in changing environment. these abilities derive from dna rearrangement and horizontal gene transfer between bacterial cells. substantial increase in the number of scientific publications on this subject, observed over the last few years, illustrates the importance of the problem.

AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus is an emerging cause of infective endocarditis that has been epidemiologically linked to colorectal cancer. s. gallolyticus is poorly transformable using electroporation and no defined mutant has been published yet. hence, we used mobilization to introduce plasmid dna from streptococcus agalactiae into s. gallolyticus using the transfer origin of the conjugative element tngbs1 (orittngbs1), followed by a classical homologous recombination technique. two isogenic mutants of s. gallolyticus ucn34, one deleted for the pil1 pilus operon and another for the sortase a gene, were constructed and characterized. this genetic tool should help in unravelling virulence mechanisms  of this bacterium.

TI  == prevalence and comparison of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus in raw and fermented dairy products from east and west africa.
AB  == streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (sii) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus are members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) associated with human infections. sbsec-related endocarditis was  furthermore associated with rural residency in southern europe. sbsec members are increasingly isolated as predominant species from fermented dairy products in europe, asia and africa. african variants of sii displayed dairy adaptations to lactose metabolism paralleling those of streptococcus thermophilus including genome decay. in this study, the aim was to assess the prevalence of sii and possibly other sbsec members in dairy products of east and west africa in order to identify their habitat, estimate their importance in dairy fermentation processes and determine geographic areas affected by this potential health risk.  presumptive sbsec members were isolated on semi-selective m17 and sm agar media.  subsequent genotypic identification of isolates was based on rep-pcr fingerprinting and sbsec-specific16s rrna gene pcr assay. detailed identification was achieved through application of novel primers enhancing the binding stringency in partial groes/groel gene amplification and subsequent dna sequencing. the presence of s. thermophilus-like lacs and lacz genes in the sbsec isolates was determined to elucidate the prevalence of this dairy adaptation. isolates (n = 754) were obtained from 72 raw and 95 fermented milk samples from cote d'ivoire and kenya on semi-selective agar media. colonies of sii were not detected from raw milk despite high microbial titers of approximately 10(6)cfu/ml on m17 agar medium. however, after spontaneous milk fermentation sii was genotypically identified in 94.1% of kenyan samples and 60.8% of kenyan isolates. sii prevalence in cote d'ivoire displayed seasonal variations in samples from 32.3% (june) to 40.0% (dec/jan) and isolates from 20.5% (june) to 27.7% (dec/jan) present at titers of 10(6)-10(8)cfu/ml. lacs and lacz genes were detected in all  kenyan and 25.8% (june) to 65.4% (dec/jan) of ivorian sii isolates. regional differences in prevalence of sii and dairy adaptations were observed, but no clear effect of dairy animal, fermentation procedure and climate was revealed. conclusively, the high prevalence of sii in kenya, cote d'ivoire in addition to somalia, sudan and mali strongly indicates a pivotal role of sii in traditional african dairy fermentations potentially paralleling that of typical western dairy species s. thermophilus. putative health risks associated with the consumption of high amounts of live sii and potential different degrees of evolutionary adaptation or ecological colonization require further epidemiologic and genomic investigations, particularly in africa.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

AB  == in the milk industry in india, buffalo breeds are most commonly used for milk production. efficiency of fiber digestion in ruminants is critical for animal productivity. bacteria play an important role in fiber digestion and utilization. absolute quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify ten bacterial species  in rumen fluid of surti buffalo fed green fodder, dry roughage and compound concentrate mixture. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as a fraction  of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of ruminococcus albus, which comprised 5.66% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 0.9% to 4.24% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the ruminal fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens and prevotella species. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus bovis, ruminobacter amylophilus, treponema bryantii and anaerovibrio lipolytica was even less abundant, each comprising < 0.11% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == streptococcus bovis group and biliary tract infections: an analysis of 51 cases.
AB  == streptococcus bovis is a well-known cause of endocarditis, but its role in other  infections has not been well described. we analysed prospectively all patients with biliary tract infections caused by s. bovis group during the period 1988-2011. we selected those cases associated with cholangitis and cholecystitis, defined according to tokyo guidelines. identification of the strains was performed using the api 20 strep and the gp card of the vitek 2 system, and was confirmed by molecular methods. our series included 51 cases (30 cholangitis and  21 cholecystitis). the associated microorganisms were: streptococcus infantarius  (biotype ii/1) 29 cases (57%), streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (biotype ii/2) 20 cases (39%) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus  (biotype i) two cases (4%). the only difference found between s. infantarius and  s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus was a greater association of the first with malignant strictures of the bile ducts: 48% (14/29) versus 5% (1/20), p <0.001. thirty-seven of the cases also had bacteraemia, causing 20% (37/185) of all s. bovis bacteraemia, with differences between s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (2/112; 2%) and the other two microorganisms: s. infantarius and s. gallolyticus  subsp. pasteurianus (35/73; 48%; p <0.001). the vast majority of biliary tract infections due to s. bovis group are caused by s. infantarius and s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (s. bovis biotype ii), and nearly half of the bacteraemia due to these two species has a biliary source (43% of the s. infantarius and 56% of s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus).

TI  == streptococcus bovis bacteraemia: an evaluation of the long-term effect on cardiac outcomes.
AB  == introduction: streptococcus bovis can lead to bacteraemia, septicaemia, and ultimately endocarditis. the objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term implications of s. bovis endocarditis on cardiac morbidity and mortality. methods: a retrospective cohort study was performed between january 2000 and march 2009 to assess all patients diagnosed with s. bovis bacteraemia from the belfast health and social care trust. the primary end-point for cardiac  investigations was the presence of endocarditis. secondary end-points included referral for cardiac surgery and overall mortality. results: sixty-one positive s. bovis blood cultures from 43 patients were included. following echocardiography, seven patients were diagnosed with infective endocarditis (16.3 % of total patients); four patients (9.3 %) had native valve involvement while three (7.0 %) had prosthetic valve infection. five of these seven patients had more than one positive s. bovis culture (71.4 %). three had significant valve dysfunction that warranted surgical repair/replacement, one of whom was unfit for surgery. there was a 100 % recurrence rate amongst the valve replacement patients (n = 2) and six patients with endocarditis had colorectal pathology. patients with endocarditis had similar long-term survival as those with non-endocarditic bacteraemia (57.1 % alive vs. 50 % of non-endocarditis patients, p = 0.73). conclusion: streptococcus bovis endocarditis patients tended to have pre-existing valvular heart disease and those with prosthetic heart valves had higher surgical intervention and relapse rates. these patients experienced a higher rate of co-existing colorectal pathology but currently have reasonable long-term outcomes. this may suggest that they represent a patient population that merits consideration for an early surgical strategy to maximise long-term results, however, further evaluation is warranted.

TI  == is colonoscopy necessary in cases of infection by streptococcus bovis biotype ii?
AB  == the association of colorectal neoplasia (crn) with streptococcus bovis biotype i  (sbi) infection is well recognized. however, this is not the case for streptococcus bovis biotype ii (sbii). we conducted this study in order to analyze the relationship between sbii and crn. we analyzed all cases of bacteremia due to sbi (n = 99) and sbii (n = 36) diagnosed in our hospital (during the period 1988-2011) that were followed up with colonoscopy. in addition, we reviewed the literature (during the period 1982-2011) to select all  cases of infection of sb that had undergone colonoscopy or other adequate form of colorectal examination. a multivariate analysis was performed to detect crn risk  factors in patients infected with sb. from the 223 cases of sb infection included in the analysis (135 from our institution and 88 from the literature review), 159 were due to sbi and 64 were caused by sbii. as compared with sbi, the sbii cases  had a lower frequency of crn (27 % vs. 67 %, p <0.001), advanced adenomas (8 % vs. 29 %, p <0.01), and carcinomas (6 % vs. 21 %, p <0.01). in a multivariate analysis, and after adjusting for age, sex, type of infection, and biotype, sbii  infection was not associated with crn: odds ratio (or) = 0.17; 95 % confidence interval (ci) = 0.09 to 0.33. the only factor independently associated with crn was sbi infection: or = 5.7; 95 % ci = 3.0 to 10.9. the prevalence of crn in patients infected with sbii is significantly lower than patients with sbi and does not appear to be higher than the crn prevalence among the general population.

TI  == systemic prepartum treatment of end-term dairy heifers with penethamate hydriodide: effect on udder health, milk yield, and culling until 120 days in milk.
AB  == prepartum intramammary treatment with antimicrobials of end-term dairy heifers has frequently been proposed as a practice to reduce the prevalence of intramammary infections (imi) at calving. from a safety standpoint for both animal and administrator, systemic treatment is preferred. a clinical trial was conducted on heifers from 10 well-managed, commercial dairy farms with a low prevalence of heifer mastitis. the aim was to assess both the short- and long-term effects of a systemic prepartum therapy with penethamate hydriodide on  udder health and milk production. because it was hypothesized that some herds would benefit more from this treatment than others, specific herd-level information was collected before the start of the actual trial to screen for and  explain potential herd-specific treatment effects. further, the effect of treatment on antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococcal isolates was monitored. end-term heifers were either treated systemically (over 3 consecutive  days) 2 wk before expected calving date with penethamate hydriodide (n=76) or remained untreated (n=73). systemic prepartum treatment of end-term heifers with  penethamate hydriodide resulted in fewer imi in early lactation. however, all 6 cases of clinical mastitis in early lactation occurred in the treatment group [streptococcus uberis (n=1), corynebacterium bovis (n=1), staphylococcus aureus (n=1); 1 sample was contaminated; 2 samples remained culture negative]. no long-term treatment effects (from 4 to 120 d in milk) on milk production, udder health, or culling hazard during later lactation were detected, although treated  heifers belonging to herds classified as having low-yielding heifers out-produced the control heifers. moreover, penicillin susceptibility of staphylococci isolated from milk samples of treated or control heifers did not differ. herds with a low prevalence of heifer mastitis are not likely to benefit from prepartum systemic antimicrobial treatment of the end-term heifers.

TI  == correlation among streptococcus bovis, endocarditis and septicemia in a patient with advanced colon cancer: a case report.
AB  == introduction: one of the bacterial agents that has been found to be associated with colorectal cancer is streptococcus bovis, with 13% of infective endocarditis cases caused by this pathogenic species. case presentation: we describe the case  of a 57-year-old caucasian man with infiltrating and ulcerating metastatic adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. the patient was receiving second-line chemotherapy treatment and, on the eighth day of the second cycle, he developed a grade iv pancytopenia. we diagnosed a severe sepsis with positive blood cultures  for streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus with a secondary endocarditis. conclusions:  a recent study suggests that the majority of patients affected by colonic cancer  have a streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus colonization that becomes apparent as an  overt infection only when immunosystem disorders or cardiac valve lesions occur.  this correlation is important for involving more specialists in a correct and early diagnosis of this rare, but potentially fatal, complication.

TI  == the itinerary of streptococcus gallolyticus infection in patients with colonic malignant disease.
AB  == bacteria constitute about 90% of all cells in the human body. the densest and most complex bacterial community is in the large intestine. this population is quite stable in healthy intestines, but intestinal disease distorts the ecological balance and induces dysbiosis. results of studies have indicated that  the epithelial and metabolic changes that occur with colorectal cancer provide a  competitive advantage to a subset of intestinal bacteria. strikingly, however, streptococcus gallolyticus gallolyticus (previously known as streptococcus bovis  biotype i) is one of the very few opportunistic pathogens that has been clinically linked to colonic malignant diseases. in this personal view we describe how s. gallolyticus gallolyticus exploits its unique range of virulence  features to cause infections in patients with colorectal cancer. we postulate that distinct virulence factors on one hand enable this bacterium to establish a  symptomatic infection in susceptible individuals, and on the other hand make its  ability to do this dependent on pre-existing colonic abnormalities. we believe that our current reconstruction of this route of infection aids understanding of  how s. gallolyticus gallolyticus infections can be best exploited for early detection of colorectal cancer.

TI  == isolation and characterization of the microflora of nixtamalized corn masa.
AB  == corn tortillas are a staple in the diet among the mexican population, and are traditionally produced through a process known as nixtamalization. this traditional process involves steeping whole-kernel corn in an alkaline solution overnight and then grinding the corn into dough (masa), which is then baked. while the masa is held before baking, significant microbial change can occur which leads to fermentation and spoilage. the objective of this research was to characterize and identify the microflora of nixtamalized corn masa from six different commercial tortilla mills throughout guadalajara, mexico. the identification of samples was conducted using the microbial identification system (mis), which analyzes cellular fatty acids via gas chromatography to identify bacterial species. lactic acid bacteria and aerobic mesophiles were the predominant organisms, with both groups having counts ranging from 10(4) to 10(7)cfu/g across all mills. coliform populations were observed at counts of 10(2) to 10(3)cfu/g, while yeast and mold counts were typically less than 10(1)cfu/g. some mills showed no presence of coliforms or yeast or mold. streptococcus bovis and lactobacillus oris were isolated from all mills, and were the most prevalent organisms representing 43% and 17% of all lactic acid bacteria isolated, respectively. s. bovis was also isolated on the aerobic tryptic soy plates and was the most prevalent species representing 19% of the total organisms from these aerobic plates.

TI  == progress in the development of vaccines against rumen methanogens.
AB  == vaccination against rumen methanogens offers a practical approach to reduce methane emissions in livestock, particularly ruminants grazing on pasture. although successful vaccination strategies have been reported for reducing the activity of the rumen-dwelling organism streptococcus bovis in sheep and s. bovis and lactobacillus spp. in cattle, earlier approaches using vaccines based on whole methanogen cells to reduce methane production in sheep have produced less promising results. an anti-methanogen vaccine will need to have broad specificity against methanogens commonly found in the rumen and induce antibody in saliva resulting in delivery of sufficiently high levels of antibodies to the rumen to reduce methanogen activity. our approach has focussed on identifying surface and  membrane-associated proteins that are conserved across a range of rumen methanogens. the identification of potential vaccine antigens has been assisted by recent advances in the knowledge of rumen methanogen genomes. methanogen surface proteins have been shown to be immunogenic in ruminants and vaccination of sheep with these proteins induced specific antibody responses in saliva and rumen contents. current studies are directed towards identifying key candidate antigens and investigating the level and types of salivary antibodies produced in sheep and cattle vaccinated with methanogen proteins, stability of antibodies in  the rumen and their impact on rumen microbial populations. in addition, there is  a need to identify adjuvants that stimulate high levels of salivary antibody and  are suitable for formulating with protein antigens to produce a low-cost and effective vaccine.

AB  == "green juice", obtained by squeezing fresh alfalfa leaves inoculated with lactic  acid bacteria, was fermented at room temperature for 7-21 d to obtain 12-47 g lactic acid l(-1). inoculation of green juice with streptococcus bovis and incubation at 39 degrees c reduced fermentation time to 8-12h. the resulting "brown juice" from either fermentation had a ph of approximately 4.5 and a protein precipitate. upon adjustment to ph 5.2-6.8 and inoculation with megasphaera elsdenii, brown juice was fermented within 48 h to up to 18 g of mixed volatile fatty acids (vfa) l(-1). single-stage fermentation of green juice  by both species in coculture typically resulted in overgrowth of s. bovis and acid inhibition of m. elsdenii, inhibiting vfa production. because the juice fermentations are conducted without sterilization or supplemental nutrients, they can potentially contribute to an integrated process featuring protein recovery and fermentation of fractionated solids to vfa and other products.

TI  == short communication: comparison of ph, volatile fatty acids, and microbiome of rumen samples from preweaned calves obtained via cannula or stomach tube.
AB  == the objective of this study was to compare rumen samples from young dairy calves  obtained via a stomach tube (st) or a ruminal cannula (rc). five male holstein calves (46+/-4.0 kg of body weight and 11+/-4.9 d of age) were ruminally cannulated at 15 d of age. calves received 4 l/d of a commercial milk replacer (25% crude protein and 19.2% fat) at 12.5% dry matter, and were provided concentrate and chopped oats hay ad libitum throughout the study (56 d). in total, 29 paired rumen samples were obtained weekly throughout the study in most  of the calves by each extraction method. these samples were used to determine ph  and volatile fatty acids (vfa) concentration, and to quantify prevotella ruminicola and streptococcus bovis by quantitative pcr. furthermore, a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed on rumen samples harvested during wk 8 of the study to determine the degree of similarity between rumen bacteria communities. rumen ph was 0.30 units greater in st compared with rc samples. furthermore, total vfa concentrations were greater in rc than in st samples. however, when analyzing the proportion of each vfa by anova, no differences were  found between the sampling methods. the quantification of s. bovis and p. ruminicola was similar in both extraction methods, and values obtained using different methods were highly correlated (r(2)=0.89 and 0.98 for s. bovis and p.  ruminicola, respectively). fingerprinting analysis showed similar bacteria band profiles between samples obtained from the same calves using different extraction methods. in conclusion, when comparing rumen parameters obtained using different  sampling techniques, it is recommended that vfa profiles be used rather than total vfa concentrations, as total vfa concentrations are more affected by the method of collection. furthermore, although comparisons of ph across studies should be avoided when samples are not obtained using the same sampling method, the comparison of fingerprinting of a bacteria community or a specific rumen bacterium is valid.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == starchy biomass-powered enzymatic biofuel cell based on amylases and glucose oxidase multi-immobilized bioanode.
AB  == the present study reports the design of a novel bioanode to directly utilize starch as a fuel in an enzymatic biofuel cell. the enzymatic fuel cell is based on three enzymes (alpha-amylase, glucoamylase and glucose oxidase). the carbon paste electrode containing these three enzymes and tetrathiafulvalene can both saccharize and oxidize starchy biomass. in cyclic voltammetry, catalytic currents were successfully observed with both glucose and starchy white rice used as a substrate. finally, a membrane-less white rice/o2 biofuel cell was assembled and  the electrochemical performance was evaluated. the three enzyme based electrode was used as a bioanode and an immobilized bilirubin oxidase (derived from myrothecium verrucaria) electrode was used as a biocathode. the biofuel cell delivered an open circuit voltage of 0.522v and power density of up to 99.0 muwcm(-2). our results show that a readily available fuel can be used for enzymatic fuel cells, and will lead to new designs.

TI  == molecular characterization of alpha-amylase from staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is one of the prominent gram positive human pathogen secretes many surface and secretary proteins including various enzymes and pathogenic factors that favour the successful colonization and infection of host  tissue. alpha-amylase is one of the enzymes secreted by s. aureus which catalyses the breakdown of complex sugars to monosaccharides, which are required for colonization and survival of this pathogen in any anatomical locales. in the present study we have cloned, sequenced, expressed and characterized alpha-amylase gene from s. aureus atcc12600. the recombinant enzyme has a molecular weight of 58kda and the kinetics showed vmax 0.0208+/-0.033 (mg/ml)/mg/min and km 10.633+/-0.737mg/ml. the multiple sequence analysis showed  alpha- amylase of s. aureus exhibited large differences with bacillus subtilis and streptococcus bovis. as the crystal structure of s. aureus alpha- amylase was unavailable, we used homology modelling method to build the structure. the built  structure was validated by ramachandran plot which showed 90% of the residues in  the allowed region while no residue was found in the disallowed region and the built structure was close to the crystal structure with z-score: -6.85. the structural superimposition studies with alpha- amylases of bacillus subtilis and  streptococcus bovis showed distinct differences with rmsd values of 18.158aand 7.091a respectively which correlated with enzyme kinetics, indicating alpha-amylase is different among these bacteria.

TI  == streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex fecal carriage, colorectal carcinoma, and infective endocarditis: a new appraisal of a complex connection.
AB  == the proportion of group d streptococcal infective endocarditis (ie) (predominantly due to streptococcus gallolyticus) and the incidence of colorectal cancer are higher in france than in most european countries. we assumed that this could be explained by a high group d streptococci (gds) fecal carriage rate. the  aims of this study were to re-assess the gds fecal carriage rate in france and its relationship with colorectal cancer. consecutive adult subjects who were to undergo a complete colonoscopy were invited to participate. gds were searched in  subjects' stools before their colonoscopy using biomolecular techniques. colonoscopic findings were sorted into four subgroups: normal colonoscopy, non-tumoral lesions, benign tumors, and premalignant/malignant tumors. gds fecal  carriages were calculated overall and in each subgroup and compared. the data from 259 subjects were analyzed. gds were identified in the feces of 12 subjects, with the following distribution: s. lutetiensis (n = 9), s. pasteurianus (n = 2), and s. gallolyticus (n = 1). this accounted for an overall gds fecal carriage rate of 4.6 %. the gds fecal carriage rate was 6 % in case of normal colonoscopy, 1.3 % in case of non-tumoral lesions, 3.2 % in case of benign tumors, and 11 % in case of premalignant/malignant tumors. these four percentages were not statistically different. the gds fecal carriage rate was lower than expected, which did not confirm our working hypothesis. most strains belonged to s. bovis biotype ii, while s. gallolyticus was found only once. these findings suggest that different gds play different roles in the etiopathogenesis of ie and colorectal cancer.

TI  == association of streptococcus bovis endocarditis and advanced colorectal neoplasia: a case-control study.
AB  == objective: to study the association between streptococcus bovis (s. bovis) endocarditis and advanced colorectal neoplasia. methods: this was a case-control  study of patients with s. bovis endocarditis undergoing colonoscopic evaluation.  patients were matched 1:20 with controls by gender and age (+/-2 years) from a large screening colonoscopy database. the baseline, colonoscopic and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with s. bovis endocarditis were analyzed. results: from 1996 to 2010, 18 adult patients with s. bovis bacteremia  were identified, of whom 10 with infective endocarditis (ie) underwent colonoscopic evaluation. endocarditis involved a native or prosthetic valve in six and four of those patients, respectively. all 10 patients recovered without recurrence of ie (mean follow-up duration 49.6 months). none had a concurrent or  preceding history of colon disease and only one had subclinical chronic liver disease. advanced neoplasia, defined as the presence of polyps >/=1 cm (n = 6), villous histology (n = 3), high-grade focal dysplasia (n = 1) or cancer (n = 1),  was found under colonoscopy in 6 of the 10 cases (60.0%) compared with 13/200 (6.5%) matched controls (or 21.6, 95% ci 5.4-86.1, p < 0.0001). conclusions: s. bovis endocarditis is strongly associated with the presence of advanced colorectal neoplasia. in the absence of any contraindication, colonoscopic examination is strongly recommended in patients with endocarditis. the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this association and the predilection for s. bovis bacteremia in patients with advanced colonic neoplasia remain unclear.

TI  == effect on quarter milk somatic cell count and antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococcus rostri causing intramammary infection in dairy water buffaloes.
AB  == in many parts of the world, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) are the predominant cause of intramammary infections (imi) in dairy cows and in water buffaloes, as well. a longitudinal field study was carried out on one well-managed dairy water buffalo herd to determine the prevalence and distribution of cns and a recently described cns-species, staphylococcus rostri,  in milk samples to explore its relevance for buffaloes' udder health throughout lactation, and to gain insight into the susceptibility of the latter species toward commonly used antimicrobials. twice weekly quarter milk samples from a cohort of 11 lactating water buffaloes were collected over an 8-mo period. the cns (n=109; 76.2% of all culture-positive samples) were the predominant pathogens causing imi, followed by corynebacterium bovis (n=11; 7.6%) and streptococcus spp. (n=9; 6.2%) other than stretococcus uberis (n=2; 1.4%). thirty-seven hemolytic staphylococci suspected to be staphylococcus aureus were further differentiated using transfer dna-intergenic spacer-pcr and rpob-gene sequencing  because they were coagulase-negative. thirty-three of those isolates were identified as staph. rostri, whereas 2 others were identified as staphylococcus epidermidis. none of the staph. rostri isolates displayed resistance to the antimicrobial agents tested. mean quarter milk somatic cell count (qscc) of all samples collected throughout lactation was 20,970 cells/ml. the qscc at sampling  of quarters infected with staph. rostri (34,466 cells/ml) and cns other than staph. rostri (34,813 cells/ml) were significantly higher than the qscc of noninfected quarters (20,287 cells/ml), yet not significantly different from each other. these findings provide novel insight into the prevalence and distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility, and relevance of staph. rostri compared with other  cns species causing imi in water buffaloes. further studies are needed to pinpoint the relevance, niches, and transmission routes of staph. rostri, as well as other cns in water buffaloes.

TI  == milk haptoglobin, milk amyloid a, and n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity in bovines with naturally occurring clinical mastitis diagnosed with a quantitative  pcr test.
AB  == the associations between quantitative bacteriological results from a real-time pcr test and concentrations of acute-phase proteins (app) and n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase) activity in milk in naturally occurring  clinical mastitis were investigated. milk app concentrations and nagase activity  in clinical mastitis caused by different udder pathogens were studied. the associations between the severity of the clinical signs and concentrations of app and nagase activity were estimated. milk samples from 281 cases of clinical mastitis were collected from 3 estonian dairy farms and analyzed by pcr to identify pathogens. twenty-seven samples out of 281 (9.6%) were pcr negative. milk samples containing 4 or more bacterial species (n=28) were considered possibly contaminated and excluded from all further analyses. in total, 443 bacterial identifications were made from the remaining 226 milk samples. a single bacterial species was detected in 68 samples (30.1%), 2 species were detected in  99 samples (43.8%), and 3 species were detected in 59 (26.1%) samples. to determine the inflammatory response in the udder, the concentrations of milk amyloid a (maa) and haptoglobin (hp) and nagase activity in the milk were analyzed. a significant positive association was found between the severity of the clinical signs and inflammatory markers in the milk. milk amyloid a and hp concentrations and nagase activity were significantly higher in samples with large quantities of bacterial dna from escherichia coli or streptococcus dysgalactiae compared with milk samples not containing those species. large quantities of bacterial dna from trueperella pyogenes or streptococcus uberis in  the milk were associated with elevated concentrations of hp and high nagase activity, but not with increased maa concentrations. milk samples containing corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci had significantly lower concentrations of maa and hp and lower nagase activity compared with samples where these species were not detected. it can be concluded that concentrations of app and nagase activity in the milk were associated with the quantity of bacterial dna in the milk samples.

TI  == competence for natural genetic transformation in the streptococcus bovis group streptococci s. infantarius and s. macedonicus.
AB  == natural genetic transformation is common among many species of the genus streptococcus, but it has never, or rarely, been reported for the streptococcus pyogenes and s. bovis groups of species, even though many streptococcal competence genes and the competence regulators sigx, comr, and coms are well conserved in both groups. to explore the incidence of competence in the s. bovis  group, 25 isolates of s. infantarius and s. macedonicus were surveyed by employing culture in chemically defined media devoid of peptide nutrients and treatment with synthetic candidate pheromone peptides predicted from the sequence of the gene coms. approximately half of strains examined were transformable, many transforming at high rates comparable to those for the well-characterized streptococcal natural transformation systems. in s. infantarius, nanomolar amounts of the synthetic pheromone ltawwgl induced robust but transient competence in high-density cultures, but mutation of the comrs locus abolished transformation. we conclude that at least these two species of the s. bovis group retain a robust system of natural transformation regulated by a comrs pheromone circuit and the alternative sigma factor sigx and infer that transformation is even more common among the streptococci than has been recognized. the tools presented here will facilitate targeted genetic manipulation in this group of streptococci.

TI  == safety evaluation of the antimicrobial peptide bovicin hc5 orally administered to a murine model.
AB  == background: bovicin hc5 is an antimicrobial peptide that shows a broad spectrum of activity and potential for biotechnological and therapeutic applications. to gain insight about the safety of bovicin hc5 application, the histological and immunostimulatory effects of orally administrated bovicin hc5 to balb/c mice were evaluated. balb/c mice were divided into three groups: negative control (nc group); mice given purified bovicin hc5 (bov group); mice given ovalbumin (positive control, pc group; a murine model of enteropathy). the mice were initially pre-sensitized, and pbs, bovicin hc5 or ovalbumin were administered for 30 days by daily gavages. histological and morphometric analysis were performed and the relative expression of cytokines was analyzed by real-time rt-pcr. results: the oral administration of bovicin hc5 to balb/c mice reduced weight gain and caused alterations in the small intestine, although absorptive changes have not been detected. the number of total goblet cells and the mucopolysaccharides production were not affected by bovicin hc5 administration. a hypertrophy of paneth cells and an increase in the number of mitotic cells were observed in bov group, while the number of mast cells remained unaltered. increased expression of tnf-alpha, inf-gamma and il-12 was observed in the small  intestine upon bovicin hc5 administration. conclusion: bovicin hc5 has only minor effects on intestinal permeability and did not elicit an allergenic response upon oral administration to animal models. considering the low in vivo toxicity of bovicin hc5, it might be a good candidate for enteral applications.

TI  == relationship between concentration of lingual antimicrobial peptide and somatic cell count in milk of dairy cows.
AB  == lingual antimicrobial peptide (lap) belongs to the beta-defensin family in cattle and is found in milk. lap concentrations increase in milk from mastitic udders; however, the relationship between lap concentrations and the somatic cell count (scc) in milk remains to be elucidated in detail. therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between lap concentrations and the scc in bovine milk to assess whether lap may be used as an indicator of scc. milk was collected from 66 udders showing various sccs. the scc and lap concentrations were measured in the milk. a significantly higher lap concentration was observed  in milk having 500-5000 x 10(3)cells/ml and >5000 x 10(3)cells/ml scc groups than in lower scc groups (<50 x 10(3)cells/ml and 50-500 x 10(3)cells/ml). a significantly positive correlation between lap concentrations and sccs in milk was observed (r=0.68). in milk samples with >26 nm of lap, 92.0% of milk samples  had high sccs (>200 x 10(3)cells/ml). the concentration of lap in milk infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and  escherichia coli was significantly higher than that in uninfected milk. these results suggest that the concentration of lap can be a useful indicator of the scc in dairy cows.

TI  == insight into the evolution of the histidine triad protein (htp) family in streptococcus.
AB  == the histidine triad proteins (htps), also known as pht proteins in streptococcus  pneumoniae, constitute a family of surface-exposed proteins that exist in many pathogenic streptococcal species. although many studies have revealed the importance of htps in streptococcal physiology and pathogenicity, little is known about their origin and evolution. in this study, after identifying all htp homologs from 105 streptococcal genomes representing 38 different species/subspecies, we analyzed their domain structures, positions in genome, and most importantly, their evolutionary histories. by further projecting this information onto the streptococcal phylogeny, we made several major findings. first, htp genes originated earlier than the streptococcus genus and gene-loss events have occurred among three streptococcal groups, resulting in the absence of the htp gene in the bovis, mutans and salivarius groups. second, the copy number of htp genes in other groups of streptococcus is variable, ranging from one to four functional copies. third, both phylogenetic evidence and domain structure analyses support the division of two htp subfamilies, designated as htp i and htp ii. although present mainly in the pyogenic group and in streptococcus  suis, htp ii members are distinct from htp i due to the presence of an additional leucine-rich-repeat domain at the c-terminus. finally, htp genes exhibit a faster nucleotide substitution rate than do housekeeping genes. specifically, the regions outside the htp domains are under strong positive selection. this distinct evolutionary pattern likely helped streptococcus to easily escape from recognition by host immunity.

TI  == comparative genome analysis of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius cj18, an african fermented camel milk isolate with adaptations to dairy environment.
AB  == background: streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (sii) belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex associated with several human and animal infections. sii is a predominant bacterium in spontaneously fermented  milk products in africa. the genome sequence of sii strain cj18 was compared with that of other streptococcus species to identify dairy adaptations including genome decay such as in streptococcus thermophilus, traits for its competitiveness in spontaneous milk fermentation and to assess potential health risks for consumers. results: the genome of sii cj18 harbors several unique regions in comparison to sii atcc baa-102t, among others an enlarged exo- and capsular polysaccharide operon; streptococcus thermophilus-associated genes; a region containing metabolic and hypothetical genes mostly unique to cj18 and the  dairy isolate streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus; and a second oligopeptide transport operon. dairy adaptations in cj18 are reflected by a high  percentage of pseudogenes (4.9%) representing genome decay which includes the inactivation of the lactose phosphotransferase system (laciiabc) by multiple transposases integration. the presence of lacs and lacz genes is the major dairy  adaptation affecting lactose metabolism pathways also due to the disruption of laciiabc.we constructed mutant strains of lacs, lacz and laciiabc and analyzed the resulting strains of cj18 to confirm the redirection of lactose metabolism via lacs and lacz.natural competence genes are conserved in both sii strains, but cj18 contains a lower number of crispr spacers which indicates a reduced defense  capability against alien dna. no classical streptococcal virulence factors were detected in both sii strains apart from those involved in adhesion which should be considered niche factors. sii-specific virulence factors are not described. several sii-specific regions encoding uncharacterized proteins provide new leads  for virulence analyses and investigation of the unclear association of dairy and  clinical sii with human diseases. conclusions: the genome of the african dairy isolate sii cj18 clearly differs from the human isolate atcc baa-102t. cj18 possesses a high natural competence predisposition likely explaining the enlarged genome. metabolic adaptations to the dairy environment are evident and especially lactose uptake corresponds to s. thermophilus. genome decay is not as advanced as in s. thermophilus (10-19%) possibly due to a shorter history in dairy fermentations.

TI  == [streptococcus bovis, taxonomic status, clinical relevance and antimicrobial susceptibility].
AB  == streptococcus bovis is a large bacterial complex of facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci that includes distinct, genetically-related species. traditionally, s. bovis was classified into three biotypes: i (mannitol fermentation-positive), ii/1 (mannitol-negative and beta-glucuronidase-negative), and ii/2 (mannitol-negative and beta-glucuronidase-positive). the introduction of molecular techniques in the last few decades has led to proposals for a genetic classification of this complex: s. bovis biotype i belongs to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, s. bovis biotype ii/1 is, in fact, streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, designated as streptococcus lutetiensis, and s. bovis biotype ii/2 is streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, commonly designated as streptococcus pasteurianus. although this modern taxonomy is currently accepted, many clinicians remain unfamiliar with these terms. the importance of correct identification lies in the strong association between bacteriemia, endocarditis and/or colon cancer and the various subspecies. in general, s. bovis is more susceptible to antimicrobial agents than other streptococci, but high levels of resistance to macrolides and tetracycline  have been described.

TI  == early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  == the development of high-level daptomycin resistance (hldr; mic of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (vgs) isolates. our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of hldr after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of vgs and streptococcus bovis; to determine whether hldr also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain s. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of hldr in vitro and in vivo. in vitro  studies were performed with 114 vgs strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 streptococcus bovis strains  isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. hldr was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of s. mitis isolates, 47% of  s. oralis isolates, and 13% of s. sanguis isolates. in our experimental model, hldr was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h  and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. in vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against s. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the mic and prevented the development of hldr.  in vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented hldr in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. in conclusion, hldr develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of hldr in most cases.

AB  == the incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infections in cats catheterised for an obstructive lower urinary tract disease (lutd) has not previously been evaluated. the objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of significant bacteriuria in cats with obstructive lutd managed for 48 h with a closed urine collection system. eighteen male cats admitted for a non-infectious obstructive lutd were evaluated. this was a prospective study. a standard protocol was used for aseptic catheter placement and maintenance. three  urine samples were collected from each animal through the catheter immediately after placement, 24 h after placement and just before removal. all samples underwent complete urinalysis, including bacterial culture. catheter tips were tested by bacterial culture. six cats (33.3%) developed significant bacteriuria during catheterisation. the causative bacteria were common feline uropathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus species) in five cases, and streptococcus bovis in one. one cat developed a fungal infection. the presence of bacteria in urinary sediment was correlated strongly with positive urine culture results. the catheter tips from 10/18 cats (55.5%) were positive for culture. the positive predictive value of a positive culture from the urinary catheter tip was 87.5%. the specificity was 53.8%. the same infectious agents were cultured from both urine and catheter tip in six cases. in summary, one-third of cats developed significant bacteriuria during catheterisation. silent bacteriuria could not be clearly differentiated from true urinary tract infection. the presence of bacteria in the urinary sediment was strongly indicative of bacteriuria. the specificity of urinary catheter tip culture was low.

AB  == background: due to its abundance and low-price, glycerol has become an attractive carbon source for the industrial production of value-added fuels and chemicals. this work reports the engineering of e. coli for the efficient conversion of glycerol into l-lactic acid (l-lactate). results: escherichia coli strains have previously been metabolically engineered for the microaerobic production of d-lactic acid from glycerol in defined media by disrupting genes that minimize the synthesis of succinate, acetate, and ethanol, and also overexpressing the respiratory route of glycerol dissimilation (glpk/glpd). here, further rounds of  rationale design were performed on these strains for the homofermentative production of l-lactate, not normally produced in e. coli. specifically, l-lactate production was enabled by: 1), replacing the native d-lactate specific  dehydrogenase with streptococcus bovis l-lactate dehydrogenase (l-ldh), 2) blocking the methylglyoxal bypass pathways to avoid the synthesis of a racemic mixture of d- and l-lactate and prevent the accumulation of toxic intermediate, methylglyoxal, and 3) the native aerobic l-lactate dehydrogenase was blocked to prevent the undesired utilization of l-lactate. the engineered strain produced 50 g/l of l-lactate from 56 g/l of crude glycerol at a yield 93% of the theoretical  maximum and with high optical (99.9%) and chemical (97%) purity. conclusions: this study demonstrates the efficient conversion of glycerol to l-lactate, a microbial process that had not been reported in the literature prior to our work. the engineered biocatalysts produced l-lactate from crude glycerol in defined minimal salts medium at high chemical and optical purity.

AB  == background: risk of transfusion-transmitted bacterial sepsis has been substantially reduced by a bacterial surveillance program (bst). however, new problems emerge as asymptomatic bacteremia is detected in blood donors. streptococcus bovis bacteremia, which is known to associate with infective endocarditis and colonic carcinoma, is an example. study design and methods: a retrospective study was conducted to examine the demographic and clinical outcome of this group of donors. all confirmed culture-positive cases under the bst were  retrieved and those donors with s. bovis bacteremia were contacted for follow-up. viable culture samples were sent for detailed microbiologic analysis. results: from 1998 to 2012, a total of 16 donors were found to have s. bovis bacteremia, giving an estimated prevalence of 1 in 110,800 donations. they consisted of nine  men and seven women with median age of 43.5 years. eight donors had undergone colonoscopy with colonic carcinoma detected in two and benign adenoma in four. five of the 16 isolates could be retrieved for 16s dna sequencing. four were identified as s. gallolyticus ssp. pasteurianus and one as s. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus. the two patients with colonic carcinoma had one each of subspecies  pasteurianus and gallolyticus. conclusion: the findings highlight a close association of s. bovis and colonic carcinoma. we recommend prompt donor follow-up if s. bovis bacteremia is detected. besides, all confirmed s. bovis should be fully characterized by molecular technique.

TI  == effects of soybean small peptides on rumen fermentation and on intestinal and total tract digestion of luxi yellow cattle.
AB  == four luxi beef cattle (400+/-10 kg) fitted with ruminal, duodenal and ileal cannulas were used in a 4x4 latin square to assess the effects of soybean small peptide (ssp) infusion on rumen fermentation, diet digestion and flow of nutrient in the gastrointestinal tract. the ruminal infusion of ssp was 0 (control), 100,  200 and 300 g/d. ruminal ssp infusion linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased microbial protein synthesis and rumen ammonia-n concentration. concentrations of total volatile fatty acid were linearly increased (p = 0.029) by infusion ssp. rumen samples were obtained for analysis of microbial ecology by real-time pcr. populations of rumen butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ciliate protozoa, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and prevotella ruminicola were expressed as a proportion of total rumen bacterial 16s ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rdna). butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations which related to total bacterial 16s rdna were increased (p<0.05), while streptococcus bovis populations were linearly (p = 0.049) and quadratically (p = 0.020) decreased by  infusion of ssp. apparent rumen digestibility of dm and ndf were (q, p<0.05; l, p<0.05) increased with infusion ssp. total tract digestion of dm, om and ndf were linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased by infusing ssp. the flow  of total amino acids (aa), essential amino acids (eaa) and individual amino acids were linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased with infusion ssp. the digestibility of lysine was quadratically (p = 0.033) increased and apparent  degradability of arginine was linearly (p = 0.032) and quadratically (p = 0.042)  increased with infusion ssp. the results indicated that infusion ssp could improve nutrient digestion, ruminal fermentation and aa availability.

TI  == mastitis diagnosis in dairy cows using pathoproof real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in comparison with conventional bacterial culture in a northern german field study.
AB  == in the following field study, the commercial pathoproof mastitis pcr assay, a real-time pcr for identifying eleven mastitis pathogens and the staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene, was compared with conventional bacterial culture. for this purpose, 681 udder quarter samples from 173 clinically healthy cows with varying  somatic cell count from four dairy herds in the region of osnabruck, lower saxony, germany, were collected between july 2010 and february 2011 and subjected to pcr and bacterial culture. the frequency of positive pathogen signals was markedly higher with pcr compared with culture (70.6% vs. 32.2%). this was accompanied by a substantial higher percentage of multiple pathogen identifications and a lower percentage of single identifications in the pcr compared with bacterial culture. using bacterial culture as gold standard, moderate to high sensitivities (76.9-100%) and specificities (63.3-98.7%) were calculated for six out of seven pathogens with sufficient detection numbers. for  enterococcus spp, the sensitivity was only 9.1%. when the pcr results of pooled udder quarter samples of the 173 cows were compared with the single udder quarter samples, in 72% of the cases, major pathogen dna was either not found in both types of samples, or in the case of a positive pool sample, the respective pathogens were found in at least one udder quarter sample. with both methods, the most frequently detected mastitis pathogens were coryneform bacteria (pcr: corynebacterium bovis), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and staphylococcus (s.) aureus, followed by arcanobacterium pyogenes/peptoniphilus indolicus with pcr, and then with both methods, streptococcus uberis. the staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene was found in 27.7% of the s. aureus and in 37.0% of the cns identifications.

TI  == streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colon cancer: myth or reality? a case report and literature review.
AB  == a relationship between infective endocarditis and colon cancer was established in 1950, and streptococcus bovis was successfully isolated in 1970. however, this association and its pathogenesis still remain unclear. in this paper, we describe the clinical case of a patient with a history of colon cancer and infective endocarditis caused by streptococcus bovis. the role of s bovis as an aetiological agent in the development of colon cancer is intriguing but uncertain. s bovis infection should be considered a silent sign of gastrointestinal malignancy or hepatic disease. we believe that in order to demonstrate the presence of colon cancer, all patients with s bovis infection require an endoscopic investigation of the colon.

TI  == potentiation by metal ions of the efficacy of the ionophores, monensin and tetronasin, towards four species of ruminal bacteria.
AB  == concentrations of na(+), k(+) and ca(2+) in the growth medium were varied within  limits normally found in vivo to determine how cation concentrations affect the sensitivity of ruminal bacteria to the ionophores, monensin (a na(+)/h(+) and k(+)/h(+) exchanger) and tetronasin (ca(2+)/h(+)). high [na(+)] (172 mm cf. 137 mm in control medium) enhanced the efficacy of monensin towards eubacterium ruminantium 2388, streptococcus bovis c277, lactobacillus casei lb17 and prevotella albensis m384. high [k(+)] (35 mm cf. 19 mm) alone caused a decreased  potency of both ionophores, except with l. casei. added ca(2+) (7.4 cf. 2.8 mm) increased the potency of tetronasin when [na(+)] was low. high [na(+)] alone also potentiated the efficacy of tetronasin. monensin caused intracellular [na(+)] and [k(+)] to be decreased in the most sensitive of these organisms, e. ruminantium,  whereas only intracellular [ca(2+)] fell with tetronasin. the changes were small; however, deltap fell by only 20 mv after 2 h when ionophores caused immediate cessation of growth. atp concentrations fell by 77% and 75% with monensin and tetronasin, respectively. thus, altering cation concentrations might be used to potentiate the efficacy of ionophores, by increasing the rate of energy expenditure to maintain ionic homoeostasis in sensitive bacteria.

TI  == [effects of secondary structure of the leader peptide on modification and processing of bovicin hj50].
AB  == objective: elucidating the correlation between the secondary structure of the leader peptide of lantibiotic bovicin hj50 and its modification and processing. methods: the variants with mutated leader peptide were synthesized by semi-in vitro biosynthesis, and their modification pattern were then analyzed by maldi-tof ms. at the same time, the effect of leader peptide mutants on processing the modified propeptide was examined by hplc and antimicrobial activity. results: we constructed 6 mutants (f-16a, v-15e, e-14l, e-8p, l-7d, l-4k) involved in forming secondary structure of the bovicin hj50 leader peptide. f-16a, v-15e, l-4k showed very little effect on modification and processing whereas e-14l and e-8p caused changes in modification. in addition, we found that l-7d strongly affected the processing. conclusion: the conserved helix structure  in the leader peptide of bovicin hj50 was closely related to the activity of bovm and bovt150, and the presence of secondary structure was very important to modification and processing of bovicin hj50.

TI  == [role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == characterization of a new camp factor carried by an integrative and conjugative element in streptococcus agalactiae and spreading in streptococci.
AB  == genetic exchanges between streptococci occur frequently and contribute to their genome diversification. most of sequenced streptococcal genomes carry multiple mobile genetic elements including integrative and conjugative elements (ices) that play a major role in these horizontal gene transfers. in addition to genes involved in their mobility and regulation, ices also carry genes that can confer  selective advantages to bacteria. numerous elements have been described in s. agalactiae especially those integrated at the 3' end of a trna(lys) encoding gene. in strain 515 of s. agalactiae, an invasive neonate human pathogen, the ice (called 515_trna(lys)) is functional and carries different putative virulence genes including one encoding a putative new camp factor in addition to the one previously described. this work demonstrated the functionality of this camp factor (camp factor ii) in lactococcus lactis but also in pathogenic strains of veterinary origin. the search for co-hemolytic factors in a collection of field strains revealed their presence in s. uberis, s. dysgalactiae, but also for the first time in s. equisimilis and s. bovis. sequencing of these genes revealed the prevalence of a species-specific factor in s. uberis strains (uberis factor) and  the presence of a camp factor ii encoding gene in s. bovis and s. equisimilis. furthermore, most of the camp factor ii positive strains also carried an element  integrated in the trna(lys) gene. this work thus describes a camp factor that is  carried by a mobile genetic element and has spread to different streptococcal species.

TI  == effects of the oral administration of viable and heat-killed streptococcus bovis  hc5 cells to pre-sensitized balb/c mice.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides have been suggested as an alternative to classical antibiotics in livestock production and bacteriocin-producing bacteria could be added to animal feeds to deliver bacteriocins in the gastrointestinal (gi) tract  of ruminant and monogastric animals. in this study, viable (v) and heat-killed (hk) streptococcus bovis hc5 cells were orally administered to pre-sensitized mice in order to assess the effects of a bacteriocin-producing bacteria on histological parameters and the immune response of the gi tract of monogastric animals. the administration of v and hk s. bovis hc5 cells during 58 days to balb/c mice did not affect weight gain, but an increase in gut permeability was detected in animals receiving the hk cells. viable and heat killed cells caused similar morphological alterations in the gi tract of the animals, but the most prominent effects were detected in the small intestine. the oral administration of s. bovis hc5 also influenced cytokine production in the small intestine, and the immune-mediated activity differed between v and hk cells. the relative expression of il-12 and inf-gamma was significantly higher in the small intestine of mice treated with v cells, while an increase in il-5, il-13 and tnf-alpha expression was only detected in mice treated with hk cells. considering that even under a condition of severe challenge (pre-sensitization followed by daily exposure to the same bacterial immunogen) the general health of the animals was maintained, it appears that oral administration of s. bovis hc5 cells could be a  useful route to deliver bacteriocin in the gi tract of livestock animals.

TI  == macedovicin, the second food-grade lantibiotic produced by streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198.
AB  == streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 was found to produce a second lantibiotic named macedovicin in addition to macedocin. macedovicin was purified to homogeneity and mass spectrometric analysis identified a peptide of approximately 3.4 kda. partial n-terminal sequence analysis and tandem mass spectrometry revealed that macedovicin was identical to bovicin hj50 and thermophilin 1277 produced by streptococcus bovis and streptococcus thermophilus, respectively. macedovicin inhibits a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria, several food spoilage species (e.g. clostridium spp.) and oral streptococci. we determined the complete biosynthetic gene cluster of macedovicin. even though the gene clusters  of macedovicin, thermophilin 1277 and bovicin hj50 were almost identical at the nucleotide level, there were important differences in their predicted genes and proteins. bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics were also found to be encoded by streptococcus suis strains sc84 and d12, enterococcus columbae plch2, clostridium perfringens jgs1721 and several bacillus strains. all these lantibiotics contained a number of conserved amino acids that may be important for their biosynthesis and activity, while phylogenetic analysis supported their dispersion by horizontal gene transfer. in conclusion, the production of multiple bacteriocins may enhance the bio-protective potential of s. macedonicus during food fermentation.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == lipopeptide biosurfactants from paenibacillus polymyxa inhibit single and mixed species biofilms.
AB  == although biofilms are recognised as important in microbial colonisation, solutions to their inhibition are predominantly based on planktonic assays. these solutions have limited efficacy against biofilms. here, a series of biofilm-orientated tests were used to identify anti-biofilm compounds from marine micro-flora. this led to the isolation of a complex of anti-biofilm compounds from an extract of paenibacillus polymyxa (ppe). a combination of rphplc and mass spectrometry identified the principle components of ppe as fusaricidin b (li-fo4b) and polymyxin d1, with minor contributions from surfactins. this complex (ppe) reduced the biofilm biomass of bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus bovis. in contrast, ampicillin was only effective against s. aureus. ppe also inhibited a self-assembling marine biofilm (samb) in co-incubation assays by 99.3% +/- 1.9 and disrupted established samb by 72.4% +/- 4.4, while ampicillin showed no significant reduction. the effectiveness of this complex of lipopeptides against  single and multispecies biofilms suggests a future role in biofilm prevention strategies.

TI  == significant bacterial contamination risk reduction with the use of diversion pouch.
AB  == background: significant efforts have been made towards bacterial risk minimization by limiting the chance of bacteria entering into collected blood, detecting its presence and eliminating them by pathogen reduction technology. improved skin disinfection and the use of diversion pouch are effective upstream  measures to reduce the risk of bacterial sepsis. here we report on our experience with the use of blood bags with diversion pouch. materials and methods: an observational study was performed to compare the bacterial contamination rate for two periods of time, i.e. before and after introduction of diversion pouch into blood bags. the incidence of bacterial contamination was monitored by the existing bacterial surveillance programme using pooled samples from 5 units of random donor platelets underwent aerobic culture in the bact/alert 3d system. results: between 1 june 2004 and 31 may 2006 (blood bag without diversion pouch), 50 (0.0213%) out of 234,252 units of random donor platelets were found to have bacteria on culture whereas 15 (0.0057%) isolates out of 262,156 units were found from 1 june 2007 to 31 may 2009 (after diversion pouch was introduced). overall,  there was an 85% reduction in bacterial contaminated risk due to skin flora (p <  0.0001) but an increasing trend of detection of non skin flora such as streptococcus bovis was noted. conclusion: integration of diversion pouch into blood bags to divert the first 30 ml blood during blood collection on top of the  current skin disinfection protocol can significantly reduce the risk of bacterial contamination.

AB  == the aim of this study was the development of an efficient method to identify the  prebiotics-assimilating-bacteria in gut microbiota using dna-stable isotope probing (dna-sip) technology. for efficient probing of microbiota with stable isotopes, a small-scale repeated batch culture using a low-carbon-source-containing medium was developed. fecal samples from cattle were inoculated and [u-(13)c]-fructose was applied to the culture after 24 h stabilization. organic acid production, ph value of the period and the total diversity of microorganisms of the culture were successfully maintained during the chasing period. dna samples were extracted from the culture and were subjected to isopycnic centrifugation and fractionation in order to separate fructose fermenters from non-fermenters. t-rflp (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism) and the modified t-rflp of each fraction suggested that streptococcus bovis was the most dominant fructose fermenter in this culture. in  addition, we improved the modified t-rflp method and successfully identified lactobacillus vitulinus and megasphaella eldenii as minor fructose-fermenters and several species of clostridium cluster iv as non-fermenters. from these results we concluded that the methods shown here provide a means for assessing the importance of individual prebiotics on gut microbiota.

TI  == examining the effect of intramammary infections with minor mastitis pathogens on  the acquisition of new intramammary infections with major mastitis pathogens--a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  == major mastitis pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and the coliforms are usually considered more virulent and damaging to the udder than minor mastitis pathogens  such as corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns). the current literature contains several studies detailing analyses with conflicting results as to whether intramammary infection (imi) with the minor pathogens decreases, increases, or has no effect on the risk of a quarter acquiring a new intramammary infection (nimi) with a major pathogen. to investigate the available scientific evidence regarding the effect of imi with minor pathogens on the acquisition of nimi with major pathogens, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. the total extant english- and french-language literature in electronic databases was searched and all publications cited by relevant papers were investigated. results from 68 studies were extracted from 38 relevant papers. random-effects models were used to investigate the effects of cns and c.  bovis on acquisition of new imi with any of the major pathogens, as well as individually for the minor pathogens and staph. aureus. significant heterogeneity among studies exists, some of which could be accounted for by using meta-regression. overall, observational studies showed no effect, whereas challenge studies showed strong and significant protective effects, specifically  when major pathogens were introduced into the mammary gland via methods bypassing the teat end. underlying risk can account for several unmeasured factors, and studies with higher underlying risk found more protective effects of minor pathogens. larger doses of challenge organisms reduced the protective effect of minor pathogens, and studies with more stringent diagnostic criteria for pathogen imi identified less protection. smaller studies (those utilizing fewer than 40 cows) also showed a greater protective effect than larger studies.

TI  == toxicity of bovicin hc5 against mammalian cell lines and the role of cholesterol  in bacteriocin activity.
AB  == bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria and some archaea. the assessment of the toxic potential of antimicrobial peptides is important in order to apply these peptides on an industrial scale. the aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro cytotoxic and haemolytic potential of bovicin hc5, as well as to determine whether cholesterol  influences bacteriocin activity on model membranes. nisin, for which the mechanism of action is well described, was used as a reference peptide in our assays. the viability of three distinct eukaryotic cell lines treated with bovicin hc5 or nisin was analysed by using the mtt assay and cellular morphological changes were determined by light microscopy. the haemolytic potential was evaluated by using the haemoglobin liberation assay and the role of cholesterol on bacteriocin activity was examined by using model membranes composed of dopc (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and dpopc (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). the ic(50) of bovicin hc5 and nisin against vero cells was 65.42 and 13.48 microm, respectively. when the mtt assay was performed with mcf-7 and hepg2 cells, the ic(50) obtained for bovicin hc5 was 279.39 and 289.30 microm, respectively, while for nisin these values were 105.46 and 112.25 microm. the haemolytic activity of bovicin hc5 against eukaryotic cells was always lower than that determined for nisin. the presence of cholesterol did not influence the activity of either bacteriocin on dopc model membranes, but nisin showed reduced carboxyfluorescein leakage in dpopc membranes containing cholesterol. in conclusion, bovicin hc5 only exerted cytotoxic effects at concentrations that were greater than the concentration needed for its biological activity, and the presence of cholesterol did not affect its interaction with model membranes.

TI  == trial watch: experimental toll-like receptor agonists for cancer therapy.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlrs) are prototypic pattern recognition receptors (prrs) best known for their ability to activate the innate immune system in response to  conserved microbial components such as lipopolysaccharide and double-stranded rna. accumulating evidence indicates that the function of tlrs is not restricted  to the elicitation of innate immune responses against invading pathogens. tlrs have indeed been shown to participate in tissue repair and injury-induced regeneration as well as in adaptive immune responses against cancer. in particular, tlr4 signaling appears to be required for the efficient processing and cross-presentation of cell-associated tumor antigens by dendritic cells, which de facto underlie optimal therapeutic responses to some anticancer drugs. thus, tlrs constitute prominent therapeutic targets for the activation/intensification of anticancer immune responses. in line with this notion, long-used preparations such as the coley toxin (a mixture of killed streptococcus pyogenes and serratia marcescens bacteria) and the bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg, an attenuated strain of mycobacterium bovis originally developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis), both of which have been associated  with consistent anticancer responses, potently activate tlr2 and tlr4 signaling.  today, besides bcg, only one tlr agonist is fda-approved for therapeutic use in cancer patients: imiquimod. in this trial watch, we will briefly present the role of tlrs in innate and cognate immunity and discuss the progress of clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of experimental tlr agonists as immunostimulatory agents for oncological indications.

AB  == background: the nomenclature of streptococcus bovis has changed. the study aims were to examine and compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of infections based on the new taxonomy and the genetic relatedness of strains. methods: bacteremic cases from 2004 to 2010 at assaf harofeh medical center were  reviewed. vitek 2 later confirmed with polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) was used for subspecies identification. vitek 2 later confirmed with etests was used for minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) testing. repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction (rep-pcr) was used to determine the genetic relatedness of strains. results: twenty-four bacteremia cases were included. the median age of patients was 81 years (range 1 day to 91 years), two were neonates, three were pregnant, and 18 were elderly (>/= 65 years of age). the charlson's combined conditional age-related score was 8.2 +/- 2.9, and 11 (58 %) patients were immunosuppressed.  there were 13 patients who had s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, six had s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, four had s. infantarius subsp. coli, and one had s. infantarius subsp. infantarius. ten of 19 non-pregnant adult patients had  colon adenoma or carcinoma, three had acute biliary disease, and five had endocarditis. two patients died in the hospital. rep-pcr revealed polyclonality.  there were no significant associations between subspecies or genotypes and the various clinical characteristics or outcomes. conclusion: s. bovis bacteremia is  a serious disease that affects elderly immunosuppressed individuals. infection is strongly associated with colon pathology and endocarditis, regardless of the new  taxonomy or clone complex. the identification of s. bovis is of paramount importance, and microbiology laboratories should differentiate its processing from that of other s. viridans.

TI  == effects of an extract of plant flavonoids (bioflavex) on rumen fermentation and performance in heifers fed high-concentrate diets.
AB  == to study the effects of an extract of plant flavonoids [bioflavex (fl)] in cattle fed high-concentrate diets, 2 experiments were designed. in the first experiment, the effects of bioflavex on the development of rumen acidosis was evaluated in 8  holstein-friesian crossbreed heifers (451 kg; sem 14.3 kg of bw) using a crossover design. each experimental period lasted 22 d; from d 1 to 20, the animals were fed rye grass, on d 21 the animals were fasted, and on d 22, rumen acidosis was induced by applying 5 kg of wheat without [ control: (ctr) heifers who did not receive bioflavex] or with flavonoids [heifers who received fl; 300 mg/kg dm] through a rumen cannula. rumen ph was recorded continuously (from d 19  to d 22). on d 22, average rumen ph was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the fl animals (6.29; sem = 0.031) than it was in the ctr heifers (5.98; sem = 0.029). after the wheat application, the rumen vfa concentration increased (p < 0.01), the proportion of acetic acid decreased (p < 0.01), and lactate concentration (mmol/l) increased, but the increase was not as great (p = 0.09) in the fl as it  was in the ctr heifers (0.41 to 1.35 mmol/l; sem = 0.24). on d 22, streptococcus  bovis and selenomonas ruminantium titers increased after the wheat application, but megasphaera elsdenii titers increased (p < 0.05) only in the fl heifers. in the second experiment, the effect of bioflavex on the performance and rumen fermentation in finishing heifers was evaluated. forty-eight fleckvieh heifers (initial bw = 317 kg; sem = 5.34) were used in a completely randomized design. heifers were assigned to 1 of 4 blocks based on their bw and, within each block,  assigned to 1 of 2 pens (6 heifers/pen). in addition, 16 heifers (2/pen) were rumen cannulated. individual bw and group consumption of concentrate and straw were recorded weekly until the animals reached the target slaughter weight. supplementation with fl did not affect adg, feed consumption, or feed conversion  ratio. rumen ph and molar proportions of propionate were greater (p < 0.01) and acetate proportion was less in the fl (p < 0.01) than they were in the ctr heifers. flavonoid supplementation might be effective in improving rumen fermentation and reducing the incidence of rumen acidosis. this effect of flavonoids may be partially explained by increasing the numbers of lactate-consuming microorganisms (e.g., m. elsdenii) in the rumen.

TI  == oral and airway microbiota in hiv-infected pneumonia patients.
AB  == despite the increased frequency of recurrent pneumonia in hiv-infected patients and recent studies linking the airway bacterial community (microbiota) to acute and chronic respiratory infection, little is known of the oral and airway microbiota that exist in these individuals and their propensity to harbor pathogens despite antimicrobial treatment for acute pneumonia. this pilot study compared paired samples of the oral and airway microbiota from 15 hospitalized hiv-infected patients receiving antimicrobial treatment for acute pneumonia. total dna was extracted, bacterial burden was assessed by quantitative pcr, and amplified 16s rrna was profiled for microbiome composition using a phylogenetic microarray (16s rrna phylochip). though the bacterial burden of the airway was significantly lower than that of the oral cavity, microbiota in both niches were  comparably diverse. however, oral and airway microbiota exhibited niche specificity. oral microbiota were characterized by significantly increased relative abundance of multiple species associated with the mouth, including members of the bacteroides, firmicutes, and tm7 phyla, while airway microbiota were primarily characterized by a relative expansion of the proteobacteria. twenty-two taxa were detected in both niches, including streptococcus bovis and chryseobacterium species, pathogens associated with hiv-infected populations. in  addition, we compared the airway microbiota of five of these patients to those of five non-hiv-infected pneumonia patients from a previous study. compared to the control population, hiv-infected patients exhibited relative increased abundance  of a large number of phylogenetically distinct taxa, which included several known or suspected pathogenic organisms, suggesting that recurrent pneumonia in hiv-infected populations may be related to the presence of these species.

TI  == the cryptic competence pathway in streptococcus pyogenes is controlled by a peptide pheromone.
AB  == horizontal gene transfer is an important means of bacterial evolution that is facilitated by transduction, conjugation, and natural genetic transformation. transformation occurs after bacterial cells enter a state of competence, where naked dna is acquired from the extracellular environment. induction of the competent state relies on signals that activate master regulators, causing the expression of genes involved in dna uptake, processing, and recombination. all streptococcal species contain the master regulator sigx and sigx-dependent effector genes required for natural genetic transformation; however, not all streptococcal species have been shown to be naturally competent. we recently demonstrated that competence development in streptococcus mutans requires the type ii comrs quorum-sensing circuit, comprising an rgg transcriptional activator and a novel peptide pheromone (l. mashburn-warren, d. a. morrison, and m. j. federle, mol. microbiol. 78:589-606, 2010). the type ii comrs system is shared by the pyogenic, mutans, and bovis streptococci, including the clinically relevant pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. here, we describe the activation of sigx by a small-peptide pheromone and an rgg regulator of the type ii comrs class. we confirm previous reports that sigx is functional and able to activate sigx-dependent gene expression within the competence regulon, and that sigx stability is influenced by the cytoplasmic protease clpp. genomic analyses of available s. pyogenes genomes revealed the presence of intact genes within the competence regulon. while this is the first report to show natural induction of sigx, s. pyogenes remained nontransformable under laboratory conditions. using radiolabeled dna, we demonstrate that transformation is blocked at the stage of dna uptake.

TI  == molecular characterization of a novel mosaic tet(s/m) gene encoding tetracycline  resistance in foodborne strains of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the presence of antibiotic-resistance (ar) genes in foodborne bacteria of enteric origin represents a relevant threat to human health in the case of opportunistic  pathogens, which can reach the human gut through the food chain. streptococcus bovis is a human opportunistic pathogen often associated with infections in immune-compromised or cancer patients, and it can also be detected in the environment, including fermented foods. we have focused on the molecular characterization of a tetracycline (tet)-resistance gene present in 39 foodborne  isolates of s. bovis phenotypically resistant to this drug. the gene was identified as a novel tet(s/m) fusion, encoding a mosaic protein composed of the  n-terminal 33 amino acids of tet(s), in-frame with the tet(m) coding sequence. heterologous expression of the mosaic gene was found to confer tet resistance upon escherichia coli recipients. moreover, the tet(s/m) gene was found to be transcriptionally inducible by tet under the endogenous tet(s) promoter in both s. bovis and e. coli. nucleotide sequencing of the surrounding genomic region of  16.2 kb revealed large blocks of homology with the genomes of streptococcus infantarius and lactococcus lactis. a subregion of about 4 kb containing mosaic tet(s/m) was flanked by two copies of the is1216 mobile element. pcr amplification with primers directed outwards from the tet(s/m) gene identified the presence of a 4.3 kb circular form corresponding to the intervening chromosomal region between the two is1216 elements, but lacking a replication origin. the circular element shared extensive overall homology with a region of the multidrug-resistance plasmid pk214 from lc. lactis, containing tet(s), as well as the is1216 transposase-containing element and intervening non-coding sequences. linear reconstruction of the insertion events likely to have occurred  within this genomic region, inferred from sequence homology, provides further evidence of the chromosomal rearrangements that drive genomic evolution in complex bacterial communities such as the gut and food microbiota.

TI  == effects of hop varieties on ruminal fermentation and bacterial community in an artificial rumen (rusitec).
AB  == background: there is a growing interest in the use of hops (humulus lupulus) as an alternative to antibiotics to manipulate ruminal fermentation. however, the effects of different hop varieties on ruminal fermentation and bacterial populations have not been studied. here the effects of three hop varieties, cascade (cas), millennium (mil) and teamaker (tm), at a level of 800 microg ml(-1) inoculum on ruminal fermentation and microbial populations in an artificial rumen system (rusitec) fed a barley silage-based total mixed ration were investigated. bacterial populations were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and expressed as a percentage of total bacterial 16s rrna gene copies. results: all hops reduced (p < 0.001) total gas, methane and the acetate:propionate ratio. liquid-associated fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus albus and streptococcus bovis were reduced (p < 0.05) by mil and tm. feed particle-associated s. bovis was reduced (p < 0.01) by mil and tm, but tm and cas increased (p < 0.01) ruminobacter amylophilus and prevotella bryantii respectively. methanogens were decreased (p < 0.05) by mil in both liquid and solid fractions and by cas in the solid fraction. the total amount of alpha- and  beta-acids in hops affected the ruminal fermentation. conclusion: hop-induced changes in fermentation and microbial populations may improve energy efficiency use in the rumen. further research is needed to determine the effects of hops on  in vivo ruminal fermentation, microbial populations and animal performance.

AB  == the ability of ruminal microbes to degrade the explosive compound hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (rdx) in ovine whole rumen fluid (wrf) and as 24 bacterial isolates was examined under anaerobic conditions. compound degradation was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identification of metabolites. organisms in wrf microcosms degraded 180 mum rdx within 4 h. nitroso-intermediates hexahydro-1-nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3,5-triazine (mnx), hexahydro-1,3-dinitroso-5-nitro-1,3,5-triazine (dnx), and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitroso-1,3,5-triazine (tnx) were present as early as 0.25 h and were detected throughout the 24-h incubation period, representing one reductive pathway of ring cleavage. following reduction to mnx, peaks consistent  with m/z 193 and 174 were also produced, which were unstable and resulted in rapid ring cleavage to a common metabolite consistent with an m/z of 149. these represent two additional reductive pathways for rdx degradation in ovine wrf, which have not been previously reported. the 24 ruminal isolates degraded rdx with varying efficiencies (0-96 %) over 120 h. of the most efficient degraders identified, clostridium polysaccharolyticum and desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans degraded rdx when medium was supplemented with both nitrogen and carbon, while anaerovibrio lipolyticus, prevotella ruminicola, and streptococcus bovis ifo utilized rdx as a sole source of nitrogen. this study showed that organisms in whole rumen fluid, as well as several ruminal isolates,  have the ability to degrade rdx in vitro and, for the first time, delineated the  metabolic pathway for its biodegradation.

TI  == interaction with lipid ii induces conformational changes in bovicin hc5 structure.
AB  == bovicin hc5 is a lantibiotic produced by streptococcus bovis hc5 that targets the cell wall precursor lipid ii. an understanding of the modes of action against target bacteria can help broadening the clinical applicability of lantibiotics in human and veterinary medicine. in this study, the interaction of bovicin hc5 with lipid ii was examined using tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy with model membrane systems that do or do not allow pore formation by bovicin hc5. in the presence of lipid ii, a blue-shift of 12 nm could be observed for the fluorescence emission maximum of the tryptophan residue for all  of the membrane systems tested. this change in fluorescence emission was paralleled by a decrease in accessibility toward acrylamide and phospholipids carrying a spin-label at the acyl chain; the tryptophan residue of bovicin hc5 was located near the twelfth position of the membrane phospholipid acyl chains. moreover, the binding of lipid ii by bovicin hc5 induced remarkable conformational changes in the bovicin hc5 structure. the interaction of bovicin hc5 with lipid ii was highly stable even at ph 2.0. these results indicate that bovicin hc5 interacts directly with lipid ii and that the topology of this interaction changes under different conditions, which is relevant for the biological activity of the peptide. to our knowledge, bovicin hc5 is the only bacteriocin described thus far that is able to interact with its target in extreme ph values, and this fact might be related to its unique structure and stability.

TI  == investigating clustering in interval-censored udder quarter infection times in dairy cows using a gamma frailty model.
AB  == udder infections in dairy cows are observed at udder quarter level. therefore, the best strategy to study infection dynamics of particular bacteria causing mastitis is to follow up and model individual udder quarter infection times. udder quarter infection times, however, are not independent as they are clustered within a cow and herds. another challenge in modelling infection times is that the exact infection time is unknown; it is only known that the infection has taken place in the interval between the last negative and the first positive sample. we applied a technique based on the gamma frailty model which handles the clustering and interval censoring simultaneously. parameter estimates can be obtained analytically and their variance is obtained by the inverse of the hessian matrix. the proposed technique was applied to udder quarter infection times for corynebacterium bovis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus uberis.  multiparous cows were more likely to get infected earlier in lactation with c. bovis or s. uberis than primiparous cows. the times to infection of all three bacteria were highly clustered at cow level and the results of a stratified model on a subset of herds suggested a high clustering on herd level for c. bovis and s. uberis.

TI  == catalytic efficiency diversification of duplicate beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases from neocallimastix patriciarum j11.
AB  == four types of beta-1,3-1,4 glucanase (beta-glucanase, ec 3.2.1.73) genes, designated bgla13, bgla16, bgla51, and bglm2, were found in the cdna library of neocallimastix patriciarum j11. all were highly homologous with each other and demonstrated a close phylogenetic relationship with and a similar codon bias to streptococcus equinus. the presence of expansion and several predicted secondary  structures in the 3' untranslated regions (3'utrs) of bgla16 and bglm2 suggest that these two genes were duplicated recently, whereas bgla13 and bgla16, which contain very short 3'utrs, were replicated earlier. these findings indicate that  the beta-glucanase genes from n. patriciarum j11 may have arisen by horizontal transfer from the bacterium and subsequent duplication in the rumen fungus. beta-glucanase genes of streptococcus equinus, ruminococcus albus 7, and n. patriciarum j11 were cloned and expressed by escherichia coli. the recombinant beta-glucanases cloned from s. equinus, r. albus 7, and n. patriciarum j11 were endo-acting and had similar substrate specificity, but they demonstrated different properties in other tests. the specific activities and catalytic efficiency of the bacterial beta-glucanases were also significantly lower than those of the fungal beta-glucanases. our results also revealed that the activities and some characteristics of enzymes were changed during the horizontal gene transfer event. the specific activities of the fungal beta-glucanases ranged from 26,529 to 41,209 u/mg of protein when barley-derived beta-glucan was used as the substrate. they also demonstrated similar ph and temperature optima, substrate specificity, substrate affinity, and hydrolysis patterns. nevertheless, bgla16 and bglm2, two recently duplicated beta-glucanases, showed much higher k(cat) values than others. these results support the notion that duplicated beta-glucanase genes, namely, bgla16 and bglm2, increase the reaction efficiency  of beta-glucanases and suggest that the catalytic efficiency of beta-glucanase is likely to be a criterion determining the evolutionary fate of duplicate forms in  n. patriciarum j11.

AB  == streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) commonly associated with human and animal infections. we elucidated the lactose metabolism of s. infantarius subsp.  infantarius predominant in african fermented milk products. s. infantarius subsp. infantarius isolates (n = 192) were identified in 88% of spontaneously fermented  camel milk suusac samples (n = 24) from kenya and somalia at log(1)(0) 8.2-8.5 cfu ml(-)(1). african s. infantarius isolates excreted stoichiometric amounts of  galactose when grown on lactose, exhibiting a metabolism similar to streptococcus thermophilus and distinct from their type strain. african s. infantarius subsp. infantarius cj18 harbors a regular gal operon with 99.7-100% sequence identity to s. infantarius subsp. infantarius atcc baa-102(t) and a gal-lac operon with 91.7-97.6% sequence identity to s. thermophilus, absent in all sequenced sbsec strains analyzed. the expression and functionality of lacz was demonstrated in a  beta-galactosidase assay. the gal-lac operon was identified in 100% of investigated s. infantarius isolates (n = 46) from suusac samples and confirmed in malian fermented cow milk isolates. the african s. infantarius variant potentially evolved through horizontal gene transfer of an s. thermophilus-homologous lactose pathway. safety assessments are needed to identify any putative health risks of this novel s. infantarius variant.

AB  == the gastrointestinal tract of bovines often contains bacteria that contribute to  disorders of the rumen, and may also contain foodborne or opportunistic human pathogens as well as bacteria capable of causing mastitis in cows. thus there is  a need to develop broad-spectrum therapies that are effective while not leading to unacceptably long antibiotic withdrawal times. the effects of the ch(4)-inhibitors nitroethane (2 mg/ml), 2-nitro-1-propanol (2 mg/ml), lauric acid (5 mg/ml), the commercial product lauricidin(r) (5 mg/ml), and a finely ground product of the hawaiian marine algae, chaetoceros (10 mg/ml), were compared in pure cultures of streptococcus agalactia, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus bovis, and in a mixed lactic acid rumen bacterial culture. lauricidin(r) and lauric acid exhibited the most bactericidal acidity against all bacteria. these results suggest potential animal health benefits from supplementing cattle diets  with lauric acid or lauricidin(r) to improve the health of the rumen and help prevent shedding of human pathogens.

TI  == a fibrolytic enzyme additive for lactating holstein cow diets: ruminal fermentation, rumen microbial populations, and enteric methane emissions.
AB  == the objective was to determine if supplementing a dairy cow diet with an exogenous fibrolytic enzyme additive (econase rde; ab vista, marlborough, wiltshire, uk) altered fermentation, ph, and microbial populations in the rumen or enteric methane (ch(4)) emissions. in a companion study, this enzyme additive  improved efficiency of fat-corrected milk production in a dose-dependent manner by up to 11% for early lactation dairy cows. nine ruminally cannulated, lactating holstein cows were used in a replicated 3 x 3 latin square design with 21-d periods. dietary treatments were 0 (control), 0.5 (low), and 1.0 (high) ml of enzyme/kg of total mixed ration dry matter. rumen contents were collected on 2 d  (d 15 and 19), ruminal ph was measured continuously for 6 d (d 13 to 18) by using an indwelling system, and enteric ch(4) production was measured for 3 d (d 16 to  18) using the sulfur hexafluoride tracer gas technique. the enzyme additive did not alter volatile fatty acids, nh(3), ph, or population densities of total protozoa, bacteria, and methanogens in ruminal fluid. however, population densities of certain bacteria, calculated as copy number of species-specific 16s-rrna, were affected by enzyme treatment. population density of ruminobacter amylophilus was increased and that of fibrobacter succinogenes tended to be increased by the high enzyme treatment. selenomonas ruminantium tended to increase linearly with increasing levels of enzyme in the diet, although its population density was only numerically increased by the high enzyme treatment. streptococcus bovis, however, tended to be decreased by the low enzyme treatment. increasing the level of enzyme supplement in the diet also linearly increased enteric ch(4) production, even when adjusted for feed intake or milk production (19.3, 20.8, and 21.7 g of ch(4)/kg of dry matter intake or 12.9, 13.6, and 15.1g of ch(4)/kg of milk for the control, low, and high enzyme treatments, respectively). this shift in ruminal bacterial communities and higher ch(4) emissions could imply increased ruminal digestion of feed, which needs to be substantiated in longer term studies.

TI  == the role of lactoferrin binding protein b in mediating protection against human lactoferricin.
AB  == bacteria that inhabit the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory and genitourinary tracts of mammals encounter an iron-deficient environment because of iron sequestration by the host iron-binding proteins transferrin and lactoferrin. lactoferrin is also present in high concentrations at sites of inflammation where the cationic, antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin is produced by proteolysis of lactoferrin. several gram-negative pathogens express a lactoferrin receptor that  enables the bacteria to use lactoferrin as an iron source. the receptor is composed of an integral membrane protein, lactoferrin binding protein a (lbpa), and a membrane-bound lipoprotein, lactoferrin binding protein b (lbpb). lbpa is essential for growth with lactoferrin as the sole iron source, whereas the role of lbpb in iron acquisition is not yet known. in this study, we demonstrate that  lbpb from 2 different species is capable of providing protection against the killing activity of a human lactoferrin-derived peptide. we investigated the prevalence of lactoferrin receptors in bacteria and examined their sequence diversity. we propose that the protection against the cationic antimicrobial human lactoferrin-derived peptide is associated with clusters of negatively charged amino acids in the c-terminal lobe of lbpb that is a common feature of this protein.

TI  == correlation between composition of the bacterial community and concentration of volatile fatty acids in the rumen during the transition period and ketosis in dairy cows.
AB  == the transition period is a severe challenge to dairy cows. glucose supply cannot  meet demand and body fat is mobilized, potentially leading to negative energy balance (neb), ketosis, or fatty liver. propionate produces glucose by gluconeogenesis, which depends heavily on the number and species of microbes. in  the present study, we analyzed the rumen microbiome composition of cows in the transition period, cows with ketosis, and nonperinatal cows by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (trflp) analysis of 16s rrna genes and quantitative pcr. trflp analysis indicated that the quantity of veillonellaceae organisms was reduced and that of streptococcaceae organisms was increased in rumen samples from the transition period and ketosis groups, with the number of lactobacillaceae organisms increased after calving. quantitative pcr data suggested that the numbers of the main propionate-producing microbes, megasphaera elsdenii and selenomonas ruminantium, were decreased, while numbers of the main lactate-producing bacterium, streptococcus bovis, were increased in the rumen of  cows from the transition period and ketosis groups, with the number of lactobacillus sp. organisms increased after calving. volatile fatty acid (vfa) and glucose concentrations were decreased, but the lactic acid concentration was  increased, in rumen samples from the transition period and ketosis groups. our results indicate that the vfa concentration is significantly related to the numbers of selenomonas ruminantium and megasphaera elsdenii organisms in the rumen.

TI  == effects of a combination of hinokitiol (beta-thujaplicin) and an organic acid mixture on ruminal fermentation in heifers fed a high-grain diet.
AB  == this study evaluated the effects of hinokitiol (a natural antibacterial compound  extracted from thujopsis dolabrata var. hondai) and an organic acid mixture (citrate content 50%) on ruminal fermentation. antibacterial properties were examined by measuring minimal inhibitory concentration. hinokitiol at 1.56microg/ml or an organic acid mixture at 1600microg/ml inhibited streptococcus bovis growth. the combination of 0.78microg/ml hinokitiol and 200microg/ml of an  organic acid mixture also inhibited s. bovis growth. both hinokitiol and the hinokitiol and an organic acid mixture combination showed strong antibacterial properties on gram-positive bacteria such as s. bovis, but relatively weak antibacterial activities on gram-negative bacteria such as megasphaera elsdenii.  three ruminally cannulated heifers were fed a bloat-producing diet containing barley, pelleted alfalfa meal, soybean meal and salt without long-cut roughage to investigate the ruminal characteristics in vivo. feeding to heifers a bloat-producing diet containing 7.8mg/kg hinokitiol and 0.2% of an organic acid mixture significantly decreased the increase in stable ingesta volume. hinokitiol or an organic acid mixture did not affect ruminal volatile fatty acids, protozoa  and bacteria. these results suggest that a combination of hinokitiol and an organic acid mixture might reduce frothy bloat in cattle fed high-grain diets.

AB  == questions under study/principles: prosthetic joint infections (pji) may be a potential sentinel event for an unknown neoplastic or infectious source in elderly patients. however, the value and cost-effectiveness of investigations to  determine the origin of these infections is unknown. methods: retrospective study at geneva university hospitals, evaluating associated medical examinations performed in search of the origin of all presumed surgical site and haematogenous arthroplasty infections. results: a total of 182 pji were found in 182 patients (median age 75 years). seventy pji (38%) were classified as probably haematogenous, occurring more than 2 years post-implantation, with 27 (15%) due to gram-negative pathogens. overall, the origin of pji was found solely by admission history in 28 cases (15%). among the remaining 154 cases, no remote origin could be detected despite 17 echocardiograms, 17 other sonograms, 49 chest x-rays, 23 computed tomograms, 107 urinary cultures, 11 endoscopies, 9 scintigraphies and 31 medical specialist consultations. the average cost of these exams was 675 swiss francs (845 us$) per pji. at long-term follow-up six patients were found to have developed a neoplasm, of which only one (hepatocellular carcinoma after pji due to streptococcus bovis) could eventually be attributed to prior infection. conclusions: from an epidemiologic point of view, patient history is the best way to predict the origin of pji. blind additional radiographic or endoscopic exams are costly, inconclusive and do not contribute to the management of these cases.

TI  == telemedicine can help to ensure that patients receive timely medical care.
AB  == we describe a case illustrating that telephone consultations can help to lower the psychological threshold for accessing medical care in people who are not aware of the seriousness of their symptoms, or who might otherwise be reluctant to access face-to-face care. a 69-year-old male patient called a teleconsultation service at the weekend because of acute fever. the patient was scheduled to have  a hip replacement and the usual pre-operative check-up done the day before had been normal. however, a careful medical history taken during the teleconsultation revealed potentially serious symptoms. we therefore referred the patient to the emergency room immediately with the suspicion of severe infection, possibly due to colon cancer. the patient was subsequently diagnosed with septicaemia and adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid. this demonstrates that teleconsultation is not only a powerful tool for triage and diagnosis, but can also help to reduce delay  in diagnosing severe diseases in primary health care.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve  a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium  jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have  different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.

TI  == significant association of streptococcus bovis with malignant gastrointestinal diseases.
AB  == streptococcus bovis is a gram-positive bacterium causing serious human infections, including endocarditis and bacteremia, and is usually associated with underlying disease. the aims of the current study were to compare prevalence of the bacterium associated with malignant and nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases and to determine the susceptibility of the isolated strains to different antimicrobial agents. the result showed that the prevalence of s. bovis in stool  specimens from patients with malignant or with nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases was statistically significant. this result may support the idea that there is correlation between s. bovis and the malignant gastrointestinal diseases.

TI  == survey of marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacteria isolated from cattle with respiratory disease and mastitis in europe.
AB  == a monitoring programme conducted in europe since 1994 to survey the marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle has established the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated before any antibiotic treatment from bovine mastitis and bovine respiratory disease (brd) cases between 2002 and 2008. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by a standardised microdilution technique. for respiratory pathogens, pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica isolates (751 and 514 strains, respectively) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (mic</=0.03 microg/ml for 77.39 per cent of the strains) and only 1.75 per cent of m haemolytica strains were resistant (mic>/=4  microg/ml). histophilus somni isolates (73 strains) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml). mycoplasma bovis mic (171 strains) ranged from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml. for mastitis pathogens, the majority of escherichia coli isolates were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (95.8 per cent of 617 strains). staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (568  and 280 strains) had a homogenous population with mic centred on 0.25 microg/ml.  streptococcus uberis and streptococcus dysgalactiae (660 and 217 strains) were moderately susceptible with mic centred on 1 microg/ml. marbofloxacin mic for these various pathogens appeared stable over the seven years of the monitoring programme and was similar to previously published mic results.

TI  == a novel multiplex pcr/rflp assay for the identification of streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex members from dairy microbial communities based on the 16s rrna gene.
AB  == the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) comprises pathogenic species associated with different degrees with human infections but also spontaneously fermented dairy products. we aimed therefore at developing a specific identification assay for the sbsec targeting the 16s rrna gene comprising a multiplex pcr followed by a differentiating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflp). the multiplex pcr assay was positively applied on 200 sbsec isolates including reference strains. the assay did not yield false-positive amplifications with strains of closely related bacteria and isolates of non-sbsec streptococci, lactococci, enterococci, and other genera of  dairy origin. the downstream rflp using msei and xbai enabled further discrimination of streptococcus infantarius/s. bovis (biotype ii.1) from streptococcus gallolyticus (biotype i and ii.2)/streptococcus alactolyticus and s. equinus. furthermore, the newly developed primers can be used directly for sanger sequencing. conclusively, this novel pcr/rflp assay is applicable in the complex dairy microbial communities and provides an important tool to assess the  prevalence of members of the sbsec in dairy products.

TI  == cow teat skin, a potential source of diverse microbial populations for cheese production.
AB  == the diversity of the microbial community on cow teat skin was evaluated using a culture-dependent method based on the use of different dairy-specific media, followed by the identification of isolates by 16s rrna gene sequencing. this was  combined with a direct molecular approach by cloning and 16s rrna gene sequencing. this study highlighted the large diversity of the bacterial community that may be found on teat skin, where 79.8% of clones corresponded to various unidentified species as well as 66 identified species, mainly belonging to those  commonly found in raw milk (enterococcus, pediococcus, enterobacter, pantoea, aerococcus, and staphylococcus). several of them, such as nonstarter lactic acid  bacteria (nslab), staphylococcus, and actinobacteria, may contribute to the development of the sensory characteristics of cheese during ripening. therefore,  teat skin could be an interesting source or vector of biodiversity for milk. variations of microbial counts and diversity between the farms studied have been  observed. moreover, staphylococcus auricularis, staphylococcus devriesei, staphylococcus arlettae, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus equinus, clavibacter  michiganensis, coprococcus catus, or arthrobacter gandavensis commensal bacteria  of teat skin and teat canal, as well as human skin, are not common in milk, suggesting that there is a breakdown of microbial flow from animal to milk. it would then be interesting to thoroughly study this microbial flow from teat to milk.

TI  == a longitudinal case series description of meningitis due to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus in infants.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, previously known as streptococcus bovis biotype ii.2, is known to cause multiple infectious complications, including bacterial meningitis, in adults. only sporadic individual case reports  have identified this pathogen as a cause of meningitis in infants. this study is  the first to longitudinally document s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus as a cause of meningitis in four epidemiologically unrelated infants less than 2 weeks of age. the 16s rrna gene sequences of all 4 isolates were identical, and further were identical to 3 central nervous system (cns) strains (two adults and one child) reported in existing literature. s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus is an increasingly recognized cause of meningitis and bacteremia in the newborn period, and it merits further study with respect to etiology of infection.

AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (previously called streptococcus bovis biotype i) infections have long been associated with colorectal cancer (crc). this work aimed to investigate the crc-associated humoral immune response  to four pilus proteins of this bacterium by newly developed elisas. pilus proteins are interesting diagnostic targets as they are the building blocks of pilin-like structures that mediate bacterial virulence and are readily exposed to the host immune system upon infection. the presence of serum antibodies against these pilus proteins was evaluated in dutch and american populations. these analyses showed that an immune response to these antigens was specific for clinical s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus infections, but that increased serum antibody titers to multiple pilus proteins in single individuals were rarely observed. however, a multiplex approach based on antibody titers against any of these four antigens resulted in assay sensitivities between 16% and 43% for the detection of early-stage crc. together these findings underscore the potential of a multi-antigen approach to complement diagnosis of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus-associated crc.

AB  == background: streptococcus bovis has long been associated with colorectal cancer (crc). however, not all genospecies are as closely related to crc. with this systematic review, we aim to increase the awareness of the association between s. bovis biotype i (streptococcus gallolyticus) and crc and urge for uniform molecular microbiological classification. methods: in january 2011, the pubmed database was searched for all studies that investigated the association between s. bovis, infective endocarditis (ie), and crc. a total of 191 studies were screened for eligibility and yielded 52 case reports and 31 case series, of which 11 were used for meta-analysis on the association between s. bovis biotype, ie, and adenomas/carcinomas (crc). results: among the s. bovis-infected patients who  underwent colonic evaluation, the median percentage of patients who had concomitant adenomas/carcinomas was 60% (interquartile range, 22%), which largely exceeds the disease rate reported in the general asymptomatic population. meta-analysis showed that patients with s. bovis biotype i infection had a strongly increased risk of having crc (pooled odds ratio [or], 7.26; 95% confidence interval [ci], 3.94-13.36) and ie (pooled or, 16.61; 95% ci, 8.85-31.16), compared with s. bovis biotype ii-infected patients. notably, crc occurred more often among patients with s. bovis ie than among patients with s. bovis infection at other sites (pooled or, 3.72; 95% ci, 2.03-6.81). conclusions: our meta-analysis clearly indicates that s. bovis should no longer be regarded as a single species in clinical practice, because s. gallolyticus (s. bovis biotype  i) infection, in particular, has an unambiguous association with crc.

TI  == rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16s rdna sequences.
AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

TI  == role of lipid ii and membrane thickness in the mechanism of action of the lantibiotic bovicin hc5.
AB  == lantibiotics are antimicrobial peptides produced by gram-positive bacteria, nisin being the most well-known member. nisin inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis and forms pores at sensitive membranes upon interaction with lipid ii, the essential  bacterial cell wall precursor. bovicin hc5, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus bovis hc5, has the putative n-terminal lipid ii binding motif, and  we investigated the mode of action of bovicin hc5 using both living bacteria and  model membranes, with special emphasis on the role of lipid ii. bovicin hc5 showed activity against staphylococcus cohnii and staphylococcus warneri, but bovicin hc5 hardly interfered with the membrane potential of s. cohnii. in model  membranes, bovicin hc5 was not able to cause carboxyfluorescein release or proton influx from dopc vesicles containing lipid ii. bovicin hc5 blocked lipid ii-dependent pore formation activity of nisin, and a high-affinity interaction with lipid ii was observed (apparent binding constant [k(a)] = 3.1 x 10(6) m(-1)), with a 1:1 stoichiometry. in dopc vesicles containing lipid ii, bovicin hc5 was able to assemble with lipid ii into a prepore-like structure. furthermore, we observed pore formation activity of bovicin hc5, which was stimulated by the presence of lipid ii, in thin membranes. moreover, bovicin hc5  induced the segregation of lipid ii into domains in giant model membrane vesicles. in conclusion, bovicin hc5 has a primary mode of action similar to that of nisin, but some differences regarding the pore-forming capacity were demonstrated.

AB  == objective: an association of streptococcus bovis bacteremia with carcinoma of colon has been reported, but data regarding peritoneal dialysis (pd) peritonitis  caused by s. bovis is scarce. in this study, we examined the clinical characteristics, associations, and outcomes of this disease entity. methods: the  case records of patients with s. bovis pd peritonitis presenting to 2 renal centers between january 2000 and september 2010 were reviewed. clinical features  and outcomes were identified and analyzed. results: of cultures from 23 episodes  of s. bovis peritonitis in 20 patients (1.28% of all peritonitis episodes at our  center), 19 (82.6%) showed s. bovis alone, and 4 (17.4%) showed mixed growth. in  7 episodes, the s. bovis was moderately resistant to penicillin g. rates of resistance to clindamycin and erythromycin were 43.5% and 47.8% respectively. in  18 episodes (78.3%), a primary response was achieved with a first-generation cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside. in 4 episodes, a secondary response was achieved after a switch from cephalosporin to vancomycin, and in 1 episode with mixed growth, the tenckhoff catheter had to be removed. repeat peritonitis occurred in 3 patients at a mean of 50.0 months (range: 24.2 - 83.1 months). of the 20 patients of s. bovis peritonitis, 10 (50%) underwent either a barium enema or a colonoscopy. one patient had history of colonic carcinoma 2 years before the peritonitis, and a subsequent work-up revealed no recurrence. three patients had  diverticulosis, and one had a concomitant sigmoid polyp. findings in the other 6  patients were normal. no colorectal malignancy had developed in the remaining 10  patients after a mean follow-up of 76.6 months (range: 0.8 - 125.1 months). conclusions: outcomes in s. bovis pd peritonitis were favorable, and an association with colorectal cancer was not found in our patients. routine colonoscopy in these patients remains controversial and should be individualized.

AB  == daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved by the european medicines agency (emea) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cssti) and staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. we evaluated the in vitro  activity of daptomycin and comparators tested against clinical isolates from european hospitals over a 7-year period (2003-2009). a total of 36,769 consecutive isolates were collected in 34 medical centers located in 13 european  countries, turkey and israel. the collection included s. aureus (18,352; 27.2% oxacillin-resistant [mrsa]); coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 6,874), enterococcus spp. (7,241; 9.4% vancomycin-resistant), beta-hemolytic (3,009), viridans group streptococci (1,176), and streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus (107).  the organisms were isolated mainly from patients with bloodstream infection (56%) or cssti (23%). daptomycin was very active against s. aureus and cons (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l for both organisms), and its activity was not adversely influenced by oxacillin resistance. all enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to daptomycin (mic(50/90), 1/1 mg/l). daptomycin (mic(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and linezolid (mic(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.7% susceptible) were the most active agents tested against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. vancomycin- resistant and -susceptible enterococcal strains were equally susceptible to daptomycin. daptomycin was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.8% susceptible) and s. bovis (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible).in summary, daptomycin was very  potent against this large collection (36,769) of gram-positive organisms isolated in european hospitals, and its activity remained stable across the 7-year period  evaluated (2003-2009), using reference methods and interpretive criteria. decreases in daptomycin potency were not observed since emea approval and widespread clinical use, and emerging resistance to other compounds did not adversely influence daptomycin activity against contemporary gram-positive species.

AB  == all streptococcus bovis blood culture isolates recovered from january 2003 to january 2010 (n = 52) at the hospital universitario ramon y cajal were reidentified on the basis of their genetic traits using new taxonomic criteria. initial identification was performed by the semiautomatic wider system (fco. soria-melguizo, spain) and the api 20 strep system (biomerieux, france). all isolates were reidentified by pcr amplification and sequencing of both the 16s rrna and soda genes and by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms; bruker, germany). results of 16s rrna/soda gene sequencing were as follows: streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 14/14 (number of isolates identified by 16s rrna/number of isolates identified by soda gene sequencing); streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, 24/24; streptococcus spp., 7/0; streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, 0/2; streptococcus lutetiensis, 0/5; leuconostoc  mesenteroides, 4/0; and lactococcus lactis, 3/3. maldi-tof ms identified 27 s. gallolyticus isolates but not at the subspecies level, 4 l. mesenteroides isolates, 3 l. lactis isolates, and 6 s. lutetiensis isolates, whereas 12 isolates rendered a nonreliable identification result. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped all s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates into 3 major clusters clearly different from those of the s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolates, which, in turn, exhibited no clonal relationship. the percentages of resistance to the tested antimicrobials were 38% for erythromycin, 23% for fosfomycin, 10% for levofloxacin, 6% for tetracycline, and 4% for co-trimoxazole. the most frequent underlying diseases were hepatobiliary disorders (53%), endocarditis (17%), and malignancies (12%). we conclude that sequencing of the soda gene was the most discriminatory method and that s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus appears to have a higher genetic diversity than  s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.

TI  == two weeks of postsurgical therapy may be enough for high-risk cases of endocarditis caused by streptococcus viridans or streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the duration of antimicrobial therapy after surgery for infective endocarditis (ie) is controversial. a short course of postsurgical therapy is currently accepted only for patients with negative valve culture. we performed a retrospective (1994-2008) analysis of patients who underwent surgery for ie in our hospital and had a high risk of complications ( one of more of the following: <2 weeks of antibiotic treatment before surgery; embolism; perivalvular extension; and positive valve culture) to compare outcomes of patients who received short-course antimicrobial therapy (sat) (median 15 days) or long-course antimicrobial therapy (lat) (median 32 days), irrespective of the results of valve culture. our endpoints included length of hospital stay, renal and hepatic  failure, relapse, re-infection, and mortality rates 1 year after surgery. during  the study period, 140 patients underwent surgery for ie (valve replacement, 87.9%). of these, 133 fulfilled the high-risk group criteria and 92 completed the antimicrobial schedule. comparison of patients receiving sat (37) and lat (55) showed that the sat group had a shorter length of hospital stay (29 vs. 40 days,  p 0.01), and a trend towards lower frequency of renal failure (5.4% vs. 18.2%, p  0.11) and hepatic failure (5.4% vs. 9.1%, p 0.69), whereas mortality (5.4% vs. 3.6%, p 1), relapse (0% vs. 1.8%, p 1) and re-infection (5.4% vs. 3.6%, p 1) rates were similar between both groups. multivariate analysis showed that ie caused by streptococcus viridans or streptococcus bovis was independently associated with sat. postsurgical sat is safe, especially when ie is caused by streptococcus viridans or streptococcus bovis, even in patients at high risk of complications.

TI  == efficacy and safety of outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy for infective endocarditis: a ten-year prospective study.
AB  == background: the length of treatment of infective endocarditis (ie) with parenteral antibiotics varies from 2 to 6 weeks. although several studies indicate that outpatient parenteral antibiotic treatment (opat) could be safe for uncomplicated viridans-group streptococci (vgs) ie, the experience in spain is limited and data on other types of endocarditis and opat are scarce worldwide. methods: prospective single center study of a cohort including all patients with  ie admitted to the hospital clinic of barcelona opat program from january 1997 to december 2006. results: during the study period, 392 consecutive episodes of ie in non-drug abusers were attended to. of these, 73 episodes (42 native-valve, 23  prosthetic-valve, and 8 pacemaker-lead) were admitted to the opat program (19%).  the percentage of inclusion was higher for viridans group streptococci (vgs) or streptococcus bovis (s. bovis) ie (32% of all vgs or s. bovis ie episodes diagnosed vs. 14% of the remaining etiologies, p<.001). twelve patients (16%) were readmitted due to complications, of which 3 died (4%). glycopeptides use was the only predictor factor of hospital readmission (or 4.5, 95% confidence interval 1.2; 16.8, p=.026). no differences in opat outcome were found between vgs plus s. bovis ie and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) plus coagulase-negative staphylococci ie. patients spent a median of 17 day on opat (interquartile range 11-26.5), which enabled 1,466 days of hospital stay to be saved. conclusions: these data suggest that opat for ie may be a safe and effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of selected patients with types of endocarditis other than uncomplicated vgs or s. bovis endocarditis, although patients taking glycopeptides need close clinical opat monitoring.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == detection and characterization of pediocin pa-1/ach like bacteriocin producing lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == fifty-five bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from seven different sources. eight isolates were found to produce pediocin pa-1 like bacteriocin as detected by pedb gene pcr and dot-blot hybridization. the culture  filtrate (cf) activity of these isolates exhibited strong antilisterial, antibacterial activity against tested food-borne pathogens and lab. the identification and genetic diversity among the selected lab was performed by conventional morphological and molecular tools like rflp, rapd, and 16s rdna gene sequencing. the isolates were identified as, 1 each of pediococcus acidilactici cb1, lactobacillus plantarum acr2, and streptococcus equinus ac1, 2 were of p. pentosaceus cb4 and r38, and other 3 were enterococcus faecium acr4, bl1, v3. partial characterization of the bacteriocins revealed that the peptide was heat-stable, active at acidic to alkaline ph, inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, and had molecular weight around 4.6 kda and shared the properties of class iia pediocin-family. the bacteriocin production at different temperatures, ph, and salt concentrations was studied to investigate the optimal condition for application of these isolates as a starter culture or as a biopreservative in either acidic or non-acidic foods.

TI  == screening of species-specific lactic acid bacteria for veal calves multi-strain probiotic adjuncts.
AB  == the selection of promising specific species of lactic acid bacteria with potential probiotic characteristics is of particular interest in producing multi  species-specific probiotic adjuncts in veal calves rearing. the aim of the present work was to select and evaluate in vitro the functional activity of lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacterium longum and bacillus coagulans strains isolated from veal calves in order to assess their potential use as multi species-specific probiotics for veal calves. for this purpose, bacterial strains  isolated from faeces collected from 40 healthy 50-day-calves, were identified by  riboprinter and 16s rrna gene sequence. the most frequent strains belonged to the species b. longum, streptococcus bovis, lactobacillus animalis and streptococcus  macedonicus. among these, 7 strains were chosen for testing their probiotic characteristics in vitro. three strains, namely l. animalis sb310, lactobacillus  paracasei subsp. paracasei sb137 and b. coagulans sb117 showed varying individual but promising capabilities to survive in the gastrointestinal tract, to adhere, to produce antimicrobial compounds. these three selected species-specific bacteria demonstrated in vitro, both singularly and mixed, the functional properties needed for their use as potential probiotics in veal calves.

TI  == effects of adding polyclonal antibody preparations on ruminal fermentation patterns and digestibility of cows fed different energy sources.
AB  == nine ruminally cannulated cows fed different energy sources were used to evaluate an avian-derived polyclonal antibody preparation (pap-mv) against the specific ruminal bacteria streptococcus bovis, fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium aminophilum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium sticklandii and monensin (mon) on ruminal fermentation patterns and in vivo digestibility. the experimental design was three 3 x 3 latin squares distinguished by the main energy source in the diet [dry-ground corn grain (cg), high-moisture corn silage  (hmcs), or citrus pulp (cipu)]. inside each latin square, animals received one of the feed additives per period [none (con), mon, or pap-mv]. dry matter intake and ruminal fermentation variables such as ph, total short-chain fatty acids (tscfa), which included acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as well as lactic acid and nh(3)-n concentration were analyzed in this trial. total tract dm apparent digestibility and its fractions were estimated using chromic oxide as an external marker. each experimental period lasted 21 d. ruminal fluid sampling was carried  out on the last day of the period at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h after the morning meal. ruminal ph was higher (p = 0.006) 4 h postfeeding in mon and pap-mv groups when compared with con. acetate:propionate ratio was greater in pap-mv compared with mon across sampling times. polyclonal antibodies did not alter (p > 0.05) tscfa, molar proportion of acetate and butyrate, or lactic acid and nh(3)-n concentration. ruminal ph was higher (p = 0.01), 4 h postfeeding in cipu diets compared with cg and hmcs. there was no interaction between feed additive and energy source (p > 0.05) for any of the digestibility coefficients analyzed. starch digestibility was less (p = 0.008) in pap-mv when compared with con and mon. in relation to energy sources, ndf digestibility was greater (p = 0.007) in  cg and cipu vs. the hmcs diet. the digestibility of adf was greater (p = 0.002) in cipu diets followed by cg and hmcs. feeding pap-mv or monensin altered ruminal fermentation patterns and digestive function in cows; however, those changes were independent of the main energy source of the diet.

TI  == novel clues on the specific association of streptococcus gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus with colorectal cancer.
AB  == background: the prevalence of streptococcus gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus ( streptococcus bovis biotype i) endocarditis is in general low but very often linked to colorectal cancer. therefore, this study aimed to reveal the virulence  characteristics that distinguish this opportunistic pathogen from a panel of (closely related) intestinal bacteria. methods: the route of infection was reconstructed in vitro with adhesion, invasion, and translocation assays on differentiated caco-2 cells. furthermore, cellular immune responses upon infection and bacterial biofilm formation were analyzed in a comparative manner.  results: s. gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus strains were demonstrated to have a relative low adhesiveness and could not internalize epithelial cells. however, these bacteria were uniquely able to paracellularly cross a differentiated epithelium without inducing epithelial interleukin 8 or 1beta responses. importantly, they had an outstanding ability to form biofilms on collagen-rich surfaces, which in vivo are found at damaged heart valves and (pre)cancerous sites with a displaced epithelium. conclusions: together, these data show that s. gallolyticus subsp gallolyticus has a unique repertoire of virulence factors that facilitate infection through (pre)malignant colonic lesions and subsequently can  provide this bacterium with a competitive advantage in (1) evading the innate immune system and (2) forming resistant vegetations at collagen-rich sites in susceptible patients with colorectal cancer.

TI  == isolation of streptococcus bovis from apheresis platelets of asymptomatic donor warranted colonoscopy investigation: case report and literature review.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) products is one of the most serious complications of transfusion. culturing plt components may detect the presence of bacteria, thus reducing the risk of a septic result after transfusion. streptococcus bovis has previously been reported as a contaminating  microorganism in plt products. here we report an asymptomatic donor diagnosed with occult colon malignancy after positive isolation of s. bovis from his apheresis plts (aps). we also review previous cases. case report: the plt donor was a 50-year-old man with more than 150 prior plateletpheresis or whole blood donations. bacterial culture of his ap components yielded two positive results: group d streptococcus was isolated in july 2008 and s. bovis was reported in april 2010. the donor received further testing, and colonofibroscopic examination revealed colonic neoplasm. pathologic examination of the biopsied tissue led to a diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma. he underwent a left hemicolectomy in july 2010. examination of the resection specimen confirmed adenocarcinoma, stage iii with regional lymph node metastatic adenocarcinoma. conclusion: donated ap products positive for s. bovis should not be presumed to be due to contamination  during collection. this bacteremia originating from donor factors needs to be carefully evaluated. colonofibroscopic examination is recommended for these donors to detect colonic malignancy as early as possible.

TI  == increased dietary zinc oxide changes the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the ileum of piglets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the effects of increased dietary zno on the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the small intestine of piglets that were fed diets containing a total of 124 or 3,042 mg of zn per kilogram of diet, respectively. zinc was supplemented to the basal diet as zno. bacterial 16s rrna genes of ileal dna extracts were pcr-amplified with 2 bar-coded primer sets and sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing. the bacterial core species were calculated from the relative abundances of reads present in 5 of 6 samples per group and at a minimum of 5 sequences per sample. the reference database silva was used to assign sequence reads at an alignment minimum of 200 bases and 100% identity. lactic acid bacteria dominated the bacterial core, but showed diverse responses to dietary zno. of the dominant lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus reuteri was reduced due to increased dietary zno (44.7 vs. 17.9%; p=0.042), but l. amylovorus was not influenced. however, the changes of relative  abundances of other lactic acid bacteria were more noteworthy; weissella cibaria  (10.7 vs. 23.0%; p=0.006), w. confusa (10.0 vs. 22.4%; p=0.037), leuconostoc citreum (6.5 vs. 14.8%; p=0.009), streptococcus equinus (0.14 vs. 1.0%; p=0.044), and s. lutetiensis (0.01 vs. 0.11%; p=0.016) increased in relative abundance. nonlactic acid bacteria that were influenced by increased dietary zno included the strict anaerobic species, sarcina ventriculi, which showed a strong numerical decrease in relative abundance (14.6 vs. 5.1%). species of the enterobacteriaceae increased their relative abundance, as well as species diversity, in the high dietary zno experimental group. bacterial diversity indices were increased due to increased dietary zno (p < 0.05), which was traced back to the increase of sequences from subdominant species. increased dietary zno led to an increase of less prominent species and, thus, had a major impact on the bacterial composition and diversity in piglets. this effect may help to stabilize the intestinal microbiota in the sensitive postweaning period.

AB  == the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis remains a challenge, as nearly half of cases develop in the absence of preexistent heart disease and known risk factors. not infrequently, a blunted clinical course at onset can lead to erroneous diagnoses. we present the case of a 47-year-old previously healthy man in which a presumptive diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome was made based on the absence  of echocardiographically detected heart involvement, a negative blood culture, normal c-reactive protein (crp) levels, a positive lupus anticoagulant (lac) test, and evidence of splenic infarcts. the patient eventually developed massive  aortic endocarditic involvement, with blood cultures positive for streptococcus bovis, and was referred for valvular replacement. this case not only reminds us of the diagnostic challenges of bacterial endocarditis, but also underlines the need for a critical application of antiphospholipid syndrome diagnostic criteria.

TI  == monitoring intestinal microbiota profile: a promising method for the ultraearly detection of colorectal cancer.
AB  == colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers and is very hard to be detected at an ultraearly stage because of lack of valuable predicating methods that often lead to treatment failure. intestinal microbiota has long been considered to implicate in colorectal cancer pathology; and many recent reports point out a close linkage between the intestinal bacteria and the genesis of the  tumor. present studies indicate that the structure and characteristics of the intestinal microbiota are significantly altered in colorectal cancer, precancerous lesion, and high risk population compared with healthy controls and  low risk population. based on the current studies and theories, we postulate monitoring the intestinal bacterial profile by the molecular methods that could fulfill the ultraearly prediction about the degree of the risk developing into colorectal cancer. further population-based epidemiological study is useful to reveal the characteristics of the intestinal microbiota in ultraearly colorectal  cancer, which might provide some novel prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for the colorectal cancer.

TI  == the association of streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus with colorectal tumors: the nature and the underlying mechanisms of its etiological role.
AB  == streptococcus bovis (s. bovis) bacteria are associated with colorectal cancer and adenoma. s. bovis is currently named s. gallolyticus. 25 to 80% of patients with  s. bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors. colonic neoplasia may arise years after the presentation of bacteremia or infectious endocarditis of s. bovis/gallolyticus. the presence of s. bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia and/or endocarditis is also related to the presence of villous or tubular-villous adenomas in the large intestine. in addition, serological relationship of s. gallolyticus with colorectal tumors and direct colonization of s. gallolyticus in tissues of colorectal tumors were found. however, this association is still under controversy and has long been underestimated. moreover, the etiological versus non-etiological nature of this associationis not settled yet. therefore, by covering the most of up to date studies, this review attempts to clarify the nature and the core of s. bovis/gallolyicus association with colorectal tumors and analyze the possible underlying mechanisms.

AB  == in this case report, the authors demonstrate a case of subacute bacterial endocarditis presenting with anaemia. it is the first of its kind to describe a delay in diagnosis due to an initial patient investigation for a bleed rather than a cardiac evaluation. astute clinicians need to be aware of the causes of anaemia in patients with endocarditis and consider that in streptococcus bovis (s bovis) infection can be related to gastrointestinal polyps or malignancy resulting in bleeding. although patients with s bovis endocarditis should undergo full gastrointestinal investigation after endocarditis is diagnosed, it should not delay medical treatment. in this article, the authors discuss the consequences of failing to achieve timely recognition of endocarditis along with  common systemic complications. the authors also outline current recommendations for surgical intervention as heart valve replacement surgery was warranted in the patient to prevent fatal outcome.

AB  == up to half of quarter milk samples submitted for mastitis diagnosis are culture-negative results or lead to identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci or corynebacterium bovis in conventional culturing, the so-called minor pathogens. the interpretation and usefulness of these results in terms of udder and animal health management is limited, even though the amount of resources spent is relatively high. this work aimed to test two methods of analysis of milk samples with the goal of increasing detection of intramammary pathogens. in the first study, 783 milk samples were processed in duplicate: before and after freezing at -20 degrees c for 24 h, using standard bacteriological techniques. there was a significant difference between the two methods with samples frozen for 24 h yielding significantly fewer gram-positive catalase-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive bacilli and significantly more samples leading to no growth, than samples before freezing. the number of samples yielding gram-positive catalase-negative cocci was not significantly affected by freezing. in the second study, a real-time pcr-based test was performed on milk samples with an individual quarter somatic cell count  above 500,000 cells/ml that were either negative (n=51 samples) or that led to the isolation of minor pathogens in culturing: corynebacterium bovis (n=79 samples) or non-aureus staphylococci (nas, n=32). a mastitis pathogen, beyond the result obtained with standard bacteriology, was detected on 47% of the no-growth  samples, on 35% of the samples from which c. bovis had been isolated and on 25% of the samples from which nas had been isolated. the most commonly detected major pathogen was escherichia coli, followed by streptococcus uberis, arcanobacterium  pyogenes/peptoniphilus indolicus and streptococcus dysgalactiae. these results suggest that simply freezing milk samples for 24 h does not increase the detection of intramammary bacteria in milk samples and therefore should not be recommended. however, use of the real-time pcr-based test may be useful in diagnosing intramammary infections when milk samples with high somatic cell counts are culture-negative or when culturing results in the detection of minor pathogens.

TI  == autoregulation of lantibiotic bovicin hj50 biosynthesis by the bovk-bovr two-component signal transduction system in streptococcus bovis hj50.
AB  == streptococcus bovis hj50 produces a lacticin 481-like 33-amino-acid-residue lantibiotic, designated bovicin hj50. bovk-bovr in the bovicin hj50 biosynthetic  gene cluster is predicted to be a two-component signal transduction system involved in sensing signals and regulating gene expression. disruption of bovk or bovr resulted in the abrogation of bovicin hj50 production, suggesting both genes play important roles in bovicin hj50 biosynthesis. addition of exogenous bovicin  hj50 peptide to cultures of a bovm mutant that lost the capability for bovicin hj50 production and structural gene bova transcription in s. bovis hj50 induced dose-dependent transcription of the bova gene, demonstrating that bovicin hj50 production was normally autoregulated. the transcription of bova was no longer induced by bovicin hj50 in bovk and bovr disruption mutants, suggesting that bovk-bovr plays an essential role in the signal transduction regulating bovicin hj50 biosynthesis. a phosphorylation assay indicated that bovk has the ability to autophosphorylate and subsequently transfer the phosphoryl group to the downstream bovr protein to carry on signal transduction. electromobility shift assays (emsa) and green fluorescent protein (gfp) reporter gene expression assays showed the specific binding of bovr to the bova promoter, indicating that bovr regulates bova expression by direct binding between them. taken together, bovicin hj50 biosynthesis is induced by bovicin hj50 itself and regulated via the two-component signal transduction system bovk-bovr.

TI  == microbial and viral pathogens in colorectal cancer.
AB  == the heterogenetic and sporadic nature of colorectal cancer has led to many epidemiological associations with causes of this disease. as our understanding of the underlying molecular processes in colorectal-cancer develops, the concept of  microbial-epithelial interactions as an oncogenic trigger might provide a plausible hypothesis for the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. by contrast with  other cancers of the gastrointestinal tract (gastric carcinoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid-tissue lymphoma), a direct causal link between microbial infection (bacteria and viruses) and colorectal carcinoma has not been established. studies support the involvement of these organisms in oncogenesis, however, in colorectal cancer, clinical data are lacking. here, we discuss current evidence (both in vitro and clinical studies), and focus on a putative role for bacterial and viral pathogens as a cause of colorectal cancer.

TI  == a novel double-tryptophan peptide pheromone controls competence in streptococcus  spp. via an rgg regulator.
AB  == all streptococcal genomes encode the alternative sigma factor sigx and 21 sigx-dependent proteins required for genetic transformation, yet no pyogenic streptococci are known to develop competence. resolving this paradox may depend on understanding the regulation of sigx. we report the identification of a regulatory circuit linked to the sigx genes of mutans, pyogenic, and bovis streptococci that uses a novel small, double-tryptophan-containing sigx-inducing  peptide (xip) pheromone. in all three groups, the xip gene (coms), and sigx have  identical, non-canonical promoters consisting of 9 bp inverted repeats separated  from a -10 hexamer by 19 bp. coms is adjacent to a gene encoding a putative transcription factor of the rgg family and is regulated by its product, which we  designate comr. deletion of comr or coms in streptococcus mutans abolished transformability, as did deletion of the oligopeptide permease subunit oppd, suggesting that xip is imported. providing s. mutans with synthetic fragments of  coms revealed that seven c-terminal residues, including the ww motif, cause robust induction of both sigx and the competent state. we propose that this circuit is the proximal regulator of sigx in s. mutans, and we infer that it controls competence in a parallel way in all pyogenic and bovis streptococci.

TI  == association of symptoms with gastrointestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  == aim: to investigate the correlations between self-reported symptoms of irritable  bowel syndrome (ibs) and the gastrointestinal (gi) microbiota composition. methods: fecal samples were collected from a total of 44 subjects diagnosed with  ibs. their symptoms were monitored with a validated inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire adjusted for ibs patients. thirteen quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were applied to evaluate the gi microbiota composition. eubacteria and gi bacterial genera (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus and veillonella), groups (clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale, desulfovibrio desulfuricans) and distinct bacterial phylotypes [closest 16s rdna  sequence resemblance to species bifidobacterium catenulatum, clostridium cocleatum, collinsella aerofaciens (c. aerofaciens), coprococcus eutactus (c. eutactus), ruminococcus torques and streptococcus bovis] with a suspected association with ibs were quantified. correlations between quantities or presence/absence data of selected bacterial groups or phylotypes and various ibs-related symptoms were investigated. results: associations were observed between subjects' self-reported symptoms and the presence or quantities of certain gi bacteria. a ruminococcus torques (r. torques)-like (94% similarity in  16s rrna gene sequence) phylotype was associated with severity of bowel symptoms. furthermore, among ibs subjects with r. torques 94% detected, the amounts of c. cocleatum 88%, c. aerofaciens-like and c. eutactus 97% phylotypes were significantly reduced. interesting observations were also made concerning the effect of a subject's weight on gi microbiota with regard to c. aerofaciens-like  phylotype, bifidobacterium spp. and lactobacillus spp. conclusion: bacteria seemingly affecting the symptom scores are unlikely to be the underlying cause or cure of ibs, but they may serve as biomarkers of the condition.

TI  == rumen microbial population dynamics during adaptation to a high-grain diet.
AB  == high-grain adaptation programs are widely used with feedlot cattle to balance enhanced growth performance against the risk of acidosis. this adaptation to a high-grain diet from a high-forage diet is known to change the rumen microbial population structure and help establish a stable microbial population within the  rumen. therefore, to evaluate bacterial population dynamics during adaptation to  a high-grain diet, 4 ruminally cannulated beef steers were adapted to a high-grain diet using a step-up diet regimen containing grain and hay at ratios of 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, and 80:20. the rumen bacterial populations were evaluated at each stage of the step-up diet after 1 week of adaptation, before the steers were transitioned to the next stage of the diet, using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis, 16s rrna gene libraries, and quantitative real-time pcr. the t-rflp analysis displayed a shift in the rumen microbial population structure during the final two stages of the step-up diet. the 16s rrna gene libraries demonstrated two distinct rumen microbial populations in hay-fed and high-grain-fed animals and detected only 24 common operational taxonomic units out of 398 and 315, respectively. the 16s rrna gene libraries of  hay-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to  the phylum fibrobacteres, whereas the 16s rrna gene libraries of grain-fed animals contained a significantly higher number of bacteria belonging to the phylum bacteroidetes. real-time pcr analysis detected significant fold increases  in the megasphaera elsdenii, streptococcus bovis, selenomonas ruminantium, and prevotella bryantii populations during adaptation to the high-concentrate (high-grain) diet, whereas the butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and fibrobacter succinogenes populations gradually decreased as the animals were adapted to the high-concentrate diet. this study evaluates the rumen microbial population using  several molecular approaches and presents a broader picture of the rumen microbial population structure during adaptation to a high-grain diet from a forage diet.

TI  == spontaneous bacterial peritonitis caused by streptococcus bovis: case report and  review of the literature.
AB  == spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) is a frequent and severe complication that occurs in patient with cirrhosis and ascites. it occurs in 10% to 30% of patients admitted to hospital. the organisms that cause sbp are predominantly enteric. escherichia coli is the most frequent recovered pathogen, and gram-positive bacteria, mainly staphylococcus spp., are being considered an emerging causative agent of sbp. streptococcus bovis that may be found as part of the commensal bowel flora in about 10% of healthy adults constitute an uncommon cause of peritonitis that was first reported in 1994. we describe the first case  of sbp at the university hospital of santa maria (husm) caused by s. bovis, resistant to the antibiotics erythromycin and clindamycin (inducible clindamycin  resistance detected by disk diffusion test using the d-zone test).

TI  == streptococcus bovis infection of total hip arthroplasty in association with carcinoma of colon.
AB  == streptococcus bovis is normally found in the gastrointestinal tract of the human  population. the association between streptococcus bovis and bowel neoplasia has been frequently reported. this report presents two cases of total hip arthroplasty with streptococcus bovis infection at 18 and 11 years after arthroplasty. the diagnosis was made with the help of clinical findings, standard radiographs, and laboratory tests (complete blood count, c-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, and the hip aspiration). infections were treated by implant removal and antibiotic spacer implantation. intravenous antibiotics were administered for 12 weeks. revision arthroplasty was performed when laboratory tests (complete blood count, c-reactive protein, sedimentation rate) were within  normal limits. streptococcus bovis infection prompted the authors to investigate  for any bowel malignancy. colonoscopy and transrectal biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma in case 1, while case 2 had prior diagnosis of flat polyps in the  colon. there are a limited number of reports in the literature reporting the presence of streptococcus bovis infection concurrent with arthroplasty and bowel  malignancy. these two case reports highlight the possibility of hematogenous seeding of arthroplasty components by streptococcus bovis in patients with colonic neoplasia. streptococcus bovis infection of hip arthroplasty may provide  an opportunity for diagnosis of colonic neoplasia. acute hip pain in patients with hip endoprostheses and simultaneous bowel malignancy should be evaluated promptly for hematogenous infection by standard radiograph, complete blood count, c-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, and hip aspiration.

TI  == phenotyping and genotyping of streptococci in bovine milk in argentinean dairy herds.
AB  == most veterinary and milk hygiene laboratories identify streptococci and enterococci based on serological and biochemical tests. the analysis of 16s rdna  was suggested to be used for more exact identification; however, its use has not  been considered so far in monitoring studies. the objective of the present study  was to compare a conventional phenotypic method with restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis of 16s rdna (16s rdna rflp) for identification of streptococci isolated from composite milk samples collected in connection with intramammary infection (imi) in six argentinean dairy farms. composite milk samples (n = 1223) from cows belonging to six herds were collected for bacteriological analysis. twelve reference strains and fifty streptococci or streptococcuslike isolates were identified to species level by the api 20 strep system, conventional biochemical tests and 16s rdna rflp in a blind assay. the remaining streptococci or streptococcus-like isolates (n = 40) were identified to the species level both by 16s rdna rflp and conventional biochemical tests. as indicated by kappa values, agreement between the 16s rdna rflp and the conventional scheme for identification of streptococcus agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, s. uberis, s. equinus and enterococcus faecalis was 0.91, 0.73, 0.92, 0.81 and 0.85, respectively. together with the less frequently isolated streptococcal species, the conventional scheme correctly identified 77 out of 90  isolates (85.5%). thus, the use of 16s rdna rflp is considered valuable for monitoring studies due to its affordable cost for standard laboratories.

TI  == dissection of the bridging pattern of bovicin hj50, a lantibiotic containing a characteristic disulfide bridge.
AB  == bovicin hj50, a lantibiotic produced by streptococcus bovis hj50, is featured by  the presence of a disulfide bridge. this study described a simplified in vitro synthetic strategy for producing bovicin hj50 totally based on escherichia coli expression system. in this strategy termed as semi-in vitro biosynthesis (sivb),  prepeptide bova and modification enzyme bovm were co-expressed to generate posttranslationally modified bova. then a specific protease bovt150 was employed  to remove the leader peptide in vitro and produce biologically active bovicin hj50. via sivb, a series of ring-broken bovicin mutants c13a, c21a, c29a and t10a/c32a were prepared by introducing site-directed mutations into bova gene. further, we analyzed the bridging patterns of these mutants through chemical modification and successfully clarified the bridging pattern of bovicin hj50. the results showed that two thioether bridges exist between thr8 and cys13, and thr10 and cys32, respectively, and that the disulfide bond bridging cys21 and 29 is very relevant for the antimicrobial activity of bovicin hj50. this is the first study that reports the bridging pattern of bovicin hj50.

AB  == the diversity and temporal stability of the predominant bacteria in the human ileum was studied with the use of ileal effluent samples of seven individuals with brooke ileostomies. the total number of bacteria within the ileal effluent was in the range of 10(7) -10(8) bacteria per gram (wet weight). the diversity of the bacteria in the ileal effluent showed marked differences compared with that in faecal samples from age-matched healthy adults. the ileal effluent had a higher relative abundance of species within the orders lactobacillales and clostridiales, mainly streptococcus bovis-related species, and the veillonella group, and a lower proportion of species related to ruminococcus gnavus, r. obeum and bacteroides plebeius. in addition, inter-individual differences were found, indicative of a highly personal ileal microbiota profile. furthermore, temporal profiles showed large fluctuations per individual over a period of 9-28 days (average similarity over a period of 9 days was as low as 44%), and differences between morning and afternoon profiles were observed. parallel cloning and sequencing efforts revealed several phylotypes that were not identified in previous studies (12 out of 65 phylotypes showed less than 97% sequence similarity with previously reported sequences). achaea were found to be below detection limit by quantitative pcr. overall, the results indicate that the microbiota of the human ileum is relatively unstable, less complex and consisting of different dominating phylotypes when compared with the colonic microbiota.

TI  == increased exposure to bacterial antigen rpl7/l12 in early stage colorectal cancer patients.
AB  == background: cancer 2010. (c) 2010 american cancer society. : intestinal bacteria  have long been implicated in colorectal cancer pathology, and many reports point  to a close linkage between streptococcus bovis biotype i (recently renamed streptococcus gallolyticus) infections and tumors of the human colon. this work aims to investigate the humoral immune response to this bacterium during different stages of colorectal cancer. methods: the presence of serum antibodies  against s. bovis antigen rpl7/l12, previously assigned as a potential diagnostic  antigen, was evaluated in dutch (n = 209) and american (n = 112) populations using a newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: the analyses  consistently showed that an immune response against this bacterial antigen was increased in polyp patients and stage i/ii colorectal cancer patients as compared with asymptomatic individuals. this was not paralleled by increased antibody production to endotoxin, an intrinsic cell wall component of the majority of intestinal bacteria, which implies that the humoral immune response against rpl7/l12 is not a general phenomenon induced by the loss of colonic barrier function. notably, increased anti-rpl7/l12 levels were not or were only mildly detected in late stage colorectal cancer patients having lymph node or distant metastasis. conclusions: cancer 2010. (c) 2010 american cancer society. : these findings are indicative of an increased exposure to antigen rpl7/l12 during early stages of colon carcinogenesis and suggest that intestinal bacteria such as s. bovis constitute a risk factor for the progression of premalignant lesions into early stage carcinomas. clearly, the current findings emphasize the necessity for further studies on the possible etiologic relationship between intestinal bacteria and human colorectal cancer.

TI  == molecular characterization and significance of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  in a ruminal bacterium, streptococcus bovis.
AB  == to gain knowledge about the significance of phosphoenolpyruvate (pep) carboxykinase (pck) in streptococcus bovis, the sequence of the gene encoding pck (pck) was determined. transcriptional analysis indicated that the pck is transcribed in a monocistronic fashion. the level of pck-mrna was higher when cells were grown on lactose than on glucose, suggesting that pck synthesis increases when the growth rate is low. the pck-mrna level was higher in a mutant  lacking ccpa, which encodes the catabolite control protein a (ccpa), than in the  parent strain, suggesting that pck transcription is suppressed by ccpa. s. bovis  pck showed oxaloacetate (oaa)-decarboxylating activity, but no pep-carboxylating  activity (reverse reaction). in s. bovis, oaa was speculated to be produced from  pep via pyruvate. disruption of pck in s. bovis resulted in decreased growth rate and cell yield. when a pck-disrupted mutant was grown in a medium lacking amino acids, the lag phase was longer and the cell yield was lower than the case of the parent strain. these results suggest that pck is involved in the initiation of growth, including the induction of amino acid synthesis and energy metabolism.

TI  == involvement of two-component signal transduction system, comde, in the regulation of growth and genetic transformation, in the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis.
AB  == in ruminants, streptococcus bovis is considered to be associated with acute rumen acidosis. to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of s. bovis growth, we investigated the function of the two components of the peptide pheromone-signaling system, comd and come, which are encoded by comd and come, respectively, via the competence-stimulating peptide comc, which is encoded by comc. deletion of entire comc and two-thirds of comd resulted in decreased growth rate, which may be related to the change in the expression of several proteins, as shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. the transcript level of comed was decreased by the disruption of comcd, suggesting that the transcription of comed might be stimulated by comc. the transformation frequency was decreased by  the disruption of comcd. addition of recombinant comc to s. bovis cultures increased the growth rate and transformation frequency. in the cultures of mixed  ruminal microbes, addition of mature comc peptide increased the number of s. bovis per total bacterial counts as estimated by the cdna amounts of 16srrna. thus, the peptide pheromone-signaling system via comc, d, and e might be involved in the control of s. bovis growth in addition to competence development. this is  the first report suggesting that an autoinducing peptide functions in the ruminal ecosystem.

TI  == effects of hops (humulus lupulus l.) extract on volatile fatty acid production by rumen bacteria.
AB  == aims: to determine the effects of hops extract on in vitro volatile fatty acid (vfa) production by bovine rumen micro-organisms. methods and results: when mixed rumen microbes were suspended in media containing carbohydrates, the initial rates of vfa production were suppressed by beta-acid-rich hops extract. the rates of vfa production increased over extended incubations (24 h), and hops extract caused an increase in the propionate to acetate ratio. hops extract inhibited the growth and metabolism of streptococcus bovis, but selenomonas ruminantium and megasphaera elsdenii were not affected. likewise, the propionate production of m. elsdenii/s. bovis co-cultures, but not m. elsdenii/s. ruminantium co-cultures, was decreased in the presence of hops extract. conclusions: these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the hops inhibit gram-positive lactic acid bacteria (s. bovis), and the rumen microbial community requires a period of adaptation before normal vfa production resumes. selenomonas bovis and s. ruminantium both produce lactate, which is the substrate for propionate production by m. elsdenii. however, s. ruminantium has an outer membrane, while s. bovis does not. significance and impact of study: the enhanced production of the gluconeogenesis precursor, propionic acid, provides further evidence that plant secondary metabolites from hops could be used to improve rumen fermentation.

AB  == aim: argon plasma coagulation (apc) is considered a safe treatment for haemorrhagic chronic radiation proctocolitis (crpc), but bacteraemia is a rare complication. the study aimed to evaluate the frequency of bacteraemia after apc. method: a prospective study of 21 patients who underwent apc (30 procedures) for  crpc was carried out. blood cultures (bactec((r)) ) were obtained before and 30 min after the procedure (60 samples total). patients were monitored for 48 h after the procedure to detect signs of infection. results: none of the 21 patients had fever or any sign suggestive of infection after any of the 30 sessions. all baseline blood cultures were negative and two (7%) of the 30-min blood cultures were positive (staphylococcus hominis n = 1; streptococcus bovis and rhodotorula sp n = 1). the first was likely to be a contaminant and the second patient had no evidence of any other colonic disease (neoplasia or polyps) beside crpc. conclusion: apc is a low-risk procedure regarding bacteraemia and does not warrant prophylactic antibiotic administration.

TI  == changes in faecal bacteria associated with concentrate and forage-only diets fed  to horses in training.
AB  == reasons for performing study: diets rich in readily fermentable carbohydrates, fed traditionally to meet the increased energy requirements of the performance horse, are associated with a number of gastrointestinal disorders that involve disturbances in the intestinal microbiota, however, these changes are poorly understood. objectives: with the long-term objective of improving intestinal health and to increase understanding of the relationship between diet and microbiota, the effect of feeding standardbred horses a high-energy forage-only (f) diet was studied compared to a more traditional forage-concentrate (c) diet on faecal microbiota. methods: diets were fed in a cross-over design to 6 mature  geldings on a scheduled training regime, both periods consisting of 29 days. dna  was extracted from faecal samples collected at 4 time points from each period, bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified and community composition assessed by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism, cloning and sequencing. faecal ph and cultivable lactic acid bacteria (lab) and enterobacteria were also assessed on the final collection day of each period. results: diet f resulted in  a microbial composition that was more stable between sampling periods and had lower counts (p < 0.05) of cultivable lab and specifically members of the streptococcus bovislequinus complex. motile and swarming lactobacillus ruminis was present in all horses on diet c and not in horses on diet f. diet c also resulted in the increase (p < 0.05) in members of clostridiaceae cluster iii and  a concomitant reduction (p < 0.05) in an unknown group of bacteroidales. conclusions and potential relevance: the greater microbial stability and reduction in lab and members of the streptococcus bovis/equinus complex on diet f indicate an opportunity to develop feeding strategies that support equine health  and welfare. novel changes identified in the faecal microbiota that resulted from carbohydrate inclusion merit further investigation.

TI  == central nervous system infections in filipino patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
AB  == background and purpose: infections including those of the central nervous system  (cns) are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). this case series describes the etiology, contributing factors and outcomes of cns infections in a group of filipino patients with sle.  design: retrospective case series. methods: we reviewed the medical records of sle patients diagnosed and confined for a cns infection at the university of santo tomas hospital in manila, philippines, from 1997 to 2007. results: a total  of 23 sle patients (22 females) diagnosed with cns infection were included in this study. the mean age was 25.8 years (range 12-51) at sle diagnosis, and 30.9  years (range 14-58) at cns infection, with a mean disease duration of 55 months (range 7-125). nineteen cases (82.6%) were meningitis, and four (17.4%) were diagnoses of brain abscess. the etiologic agents were identified as cryptococcus  neoformans in seven (30.4%), mycobacterium tuberculosis in seven (30.4%), streptococcus pneumoniae in two (8.7%), salmonella sp. in one (4.4%), corynebacterium bovis with actinomyces sp. in one (4.4%), and no isolate in five  (21.7%). the average daily prednisone dose was 28.9 mg (range 0-60 mg); 10 patients had recently received pulse cyclophosphamide, and two were on mycophenolate mofetil at the time of infection. most cases had active sle; the lone patient in disease remission had s. pneumoniae meningitis post-splenectomy.  the most common presentation was headache (100%) and fever (87%). the infection resolved completely in nine patients (39.1%), and resolved with sequelae in two patients (8.7%); 12 patients (52.2%) died. conclusion: we described the etiology  and outcomes of cns infections in a group of filipino patients with sle. risk factors included active sle in the majority of cases requiring moderate- to high-dose steroids and other immunosuppressants like cyclophosphamide. although c. neoformans and m. tuberculosis were the most common etiologic agents, it is just as important to search for less common organisms which can produce disease in highly susceptible hosts. a high index of suspicion and early appropriate management are crucial to favorable outcome among these patients.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with the production of plaa-som, a traditional fermented fish product of thailand.
AB  == plaa-som is a thai fermented fish product for which whole fish or fish fillets are fermented with either cooked rice or steamed sticky rice, salt, and garlic. a total of 762 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated during plaa-som fermentation by culture on caco(3)-mrs agar plates. they were screened and grouped by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), giving six groups that were identified by ribosomal dna sequencing as lactococcus garvieae,  streptococcus bovis, weissella cibaria, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus fermentum. freshly mixed ingredients contained low populations of lab (less than 10 cfu/g) that subsequently grew during fermentation to final populations of approximately 10(7)cfu/g. early stages of the process were dominated by the presence of lc. garvieae, s. bovis, and w. cibaria. at 48 h into fermentation, w. cibaria, p. pentosaceus, and lb. plantarum were prevalent, and gave way to a dominance of lb. plantarum that completed the fermentation. a mixture of these lab species could be considered as species for development of a starter culture for plaa-som fermentation.

TI  == characterization of bacteriocin produced by streptococcus bovis j2 40-2 isolated  from traditional fermented milk 'dahi'.
AB  == a bacteriocin-producing strain streptococcus bovis j2 40-2 was isolated from traditional fermented milk 'dahi' in bangladesh. despite its narrow antimicrobial spectrum, it showed strong antimicrobial activity against extremely challenging and problematic organisms in foods, such as listeria monocytogenes. bacteriocin was sensitive to several proteolytic enzymes and showed antimicrobial activity over a wide ph range of 2.0-10.0. it was stable when heated to 110 degrees c for  20 min, but lost 25% of its activity when heated to 121 degrees c for 15 or 20 min. optimum bacteriocin production (5600 au/ml) was achieved when the strain was cultured at 37 degrees c for 24 h in mrs medium rather than in tylg, gm17, or skim milk medium. bacteriocin was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (80% saturation), dialysis (cut-off mw: 3500) and gel filtration chromatography. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that bacteriocin had a molecular weight of approximately 4.5 kda.

TI  == age-dependent profile of left-sided infective endocarditis: a 3-center experience.
AB  == background: the influence of age on the main epidemiological, clinical, echocardiographic, microbiological, and prognostic features of patients with infective endocarditis remains unknown. we present the series with the largest numbers and range of ages of subjects to date that analyzes the influence of age  on the main characteristics of patients with isolated left-sided infective endocarditis. furthermore, this series is the first one in which patients have been distributed according to age quartile. methods and results: a total of 600 episodes of left-sided endocarditis consecutively diagnosed in 3 tertiary centers were stratified into age-specific quartiles and 107 variables compared between the different groups. with increasing age, the percentage of women, previous heart disease, predisposing disease (diabetes mellitus and cancer), and infection by enterococci and streptococcus bovis also increased. valvular insufficiency and perforation and staphylococcus aureus infection were more common in younger patients. the therapeutic approach differed depending on patient age because of the growing proportion of older patients who only received medical treatment. clinical course and hospital prognosis were worse in the older patients because of increased surgical mortality among them. conclusions: increasing age is associated with less valvular impairment (insufficiency and perforation), a more  favorable microbiological profile, and increased surgical mortality among adults  with left-sided infective endocarditis.

TI  == genome sequence of streptococcus gallolyticus: insights into its adaptation to the bovine rumen and its ability to cause endocarditis.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly known as streptococcus bovis biotype i) is an increasing cause of endocarditis among streptococci and frequently associated  with colon cancer. s. gallolyticus is part of the rumen flora but also a cause of disease in ruminants as well as in birds. here we report the complete nucleotide  sequence of strain ucn34, responsible for endocarditis in a patient also suffering from colon cancer. analysis of the 2,239 proteins encoded by its 2,350-kb-long genome revealed unique features among streptococci, probably related to its adaptation to the rumen environment and its capacity to cause endocarditis. s. gallolyticus has the capacity to use a broad range of carbohydrates of plant origin, in particular to degrade polysaccharides derived from the plant cell wall. its genome encodes a large repertoire of transporters and catalytic activities, like tannase, phenolic compounds decarboxylase, and bile salt hydrolase, that should contribute to the detoxification of the gut environment. furthermore, s. gallolyticus synthesizes all 20 amino acids and more vitamins than any other sequenced streptococcus species. many of the genes encoding these specific functions were likely acquired by lateral gene transfer from other bacterial species present in the rumen. the surface properties of strain ucn34 may also contribute to its virulence. a polysaccharide capsule might be implicated in resistance to innate immunity defenses, and glucan mucopolysaccharides, three types of pili, and collagen binding proteins may play  a role in adhesion to tissues in the course of endocarditis.

TI  == rumen chemical and bacterial changes during stepwise adaptation to a high-concentrate diet in goats.
AB  == the correlation between rumen chemical and bacterial changes was investigated during a four periodical stepwise adaptation to a high-concentrate diet (concentrate level at 0%, 30%, 50% and 70% for diet i to iv, respectively) in goats. the results showed that ruminal ph decreased from 6.7 to 5.5 after switching from diet i to ii, and was maintained at about 5.5 on diet iii. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis results showed that the rumen bacterial community was relatively stable during the initial three feeding periods, except  for the appearance of three bands when diet changed from i to ii, suggesting that an appropriate concentrate level can promote the proliferation of some bacteria.  after 12 days of feeding diet iii, total volatile fatty acid (vfa) concentration  and butyrate proportion decreased. at days 2 and 3 of feeding diet iv, ruminal ph declined sharply to 5.3 and 4.7, respectively, and total vfa concentration decreased further while lactic acid concentration increased markedly, suggesting  a relation between lactic acid accumulation and ruminal ph decline. at the same time, many bacteria disappeared, including most fibrolytic-related bacteria while streptococcus bovis and prevotella-like species dominated. interestingly, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens-like species maintained throughout the experiment,  suggesting its tolerance to low ph. in conclusion, rumen bacterial community was  relatively stable feeding 0% to 50% concentrate diets, and it was observed that appropriate concentrate levels in the diet could increase the diversity of rumen  bacteria. however, concentrate-rich diets caused lactic acid accumulation and low ruminal ph that caused the disappearance of most fibrolytic-related bacteria sensitive to low ph while s. bovis and genus prevotella persisted.

TI  == identification of tetracycline- and erythromycin-resistant gram-positive cocci within the fermenting microflora of an italian dairy food product.
AB  == aims: microbiological and molecular analysis of antibiotic resistance in gram-positive cocci derived from the italian pdo (protected designation of origin) dairy food product mozzarella di bufala campana. methods and results: one hundred and seven coccal colonies were assigned to enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus bovis genera by ardra analysis (amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis). among them, 16 ent. faecalis, 26 l. lactis and 39 strep. bovis displayed high minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values  for tetracycline, while 17 l. lactis showed high mic values for both tetracycline and erythromycin. strain typing and molecular analysis of the phenotypically resistant isolates demonstrated the presence of the tet(m) gene in the tetracycline-resistant strains and of tet(s) and erm(b) in the double-resistant strains. southern blot analysis revealed plasmid localization of l. lactis tet(m), as well as of the erm(b) and tet(s) genes. genetic linkage of erm(b) and  tet(s) was also demonstrated by pcr amplification. conjugation experiments demonstrated horizontal transfer to ent. faecalis strain jh2-2 only for the plasmid-borne l. lactis tet(m) gene. conclusions: we characterized tetracycline-and erythromycin-resistance genes in coccal species, representing the fermenting microflora of a typical italian dairy product. significance and impact of the study: these results are of particular relevance from the food safety viewpoint, especially in the light of the potential risk of horizontal transfer of antibiotic-resistance genes among foodborne commensal bacteria.

TI  == ph dynamics and bacterial community composition in the rumen of lactating dairy cows.
AB  == the influence of ph dynamics on ruminal bacterial community composition was studied in 8 ruminally cannulated holstein cows fitted with indwelling electrodes that recorded ph at 10-min intervals over a 54-h period. cows were fed a silage-based total mixed ration supplemented with monensin. ruminal samples were  collected each day just before feeding and at 3 and 6h after feeding. solid and liquid phases were separated at collection, and extracted dna was subjected to pcr amplification followed by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (arisa). although cows displayed widely different ph profiles (mean ph=6.11 to 6.51, diurnal ph range=0.45 to 1.39), correspondence analysis of the arisa profiles revealed that 6 of the 8 cows showed very similar bacterial community compositions. the 2 cows having substantially different community compositions had intermediate mean ph values (6.30 and 6.33) and intermediate diurnal ph ranges (averaging 0.89 and 0.81 ph units). fortuitously, these 2 cows alone also  displayed milk fat depression, along with markedly higher ruminal populations of  1 bacterial operational taxonomic unit (otu) and reduced populations of another arisa amplicon. cloning and sequencing of the elevated otu revealed phylogenetic  similarity to megasphaera elsdenii, a species reportedly associated with milk fat depression. the higher populations of both m. elsdenii and otu246 in these 2 cows were confirmed using quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) with species-specific primers, and the fraction of total bacterial rdna copies contributed by these 2 taxa were very highly correlated within individual cows. by contrast, the fraction of total bacterial rdna copies contributed by streptococcus bovis and genus ruminococcus, 2 taxa expected to respond to ruminal ph, did not differ among cows (mean= <0.01 and 10.6%, respectively, of rrna gene copies, determined  by qpcr). the data indicate that cows with widely differing ph profiles can have  similar ruminal bacterial community compositions, and that milk fat depression can occur at intermediate ruminal ph. the results support recent reports that milk fat depression is associated with shifts in bacterial community composition  in rumine and is specifically related to the relative abundance of megasphaera elsdenii.

TI  == effects of acarbose on ruminal fermentation, blood metabolites and microbial profile involved in ruminal acidosis in lactating cows fed a high-carbohydrate ration.
AB  == the objective was to evaluate the effects of an inhibitor of alpha-amylase and glucosidase (acarbose, pfizer limited, corby, uk) on ruminal fermentation, blood  metabolism and microbial profile in dairy cows in a 2x2 cross-over experiment. eight holstein cows fitted with rumen cannulas (milk yield, 24.3+/-2.35 kg/d, body weight, 622+/-54 kg, days in milk, 183+/-67, 5 multiparous and 3 primiparous) were used. treatments were: control (no additive, ctr) and alpha-amylase and glucosidase inhibitor (0.75 g acarbose-premix/cow per d, ami).  animals were given ad-libitum access to a high non-fibre carbohydrate (nfc) partial mixed ration (pmr) containing 17.6% crude protein, 28.3% neutral detergent fibre, and 46.5% nfc in the dry matter and supplementary concentrate during milking. blood samples were taken to determine blood glucose, insulin and  urea within the first hour after the morning feeding on two separate days in each period. samples of ruminal contents were collected during 3 d in each period at 0, 4 and 8 h after feeding to determine volatile fatty acid and ammonia-n concentrations and to quantify protozoa, streptococcus bovis and megasphaera elsdenii. rumen ph was recorded electronically at 22-min intervals during 6 d in  each period. results were analysed using a mixed-effects model. cows on ami treatment spent less time with ruminal ph <5.6 compared with cows in the ctr group (3.74 and 6.52+/-0.704 h/d, respectively). cows in the ami group had greater daily average ph compared with those in the ctr group (6.05 and 5.92+/-0.042, respectively). ami animals tended (p=0.09) to have lower str. bovis to meg. elsdenii ratio than ctr (4.09 and 26.8+/-12.0, respectively). these results indicate that dietary supplementation with acarbose in dairy cattle fed high-production rations may be effective in reducing the time for which rumen ph  is suboptimal, with no negative effects on ruminal fermentation and blood metabolites.

TI  == description of development of rumen ecosystem by pcr assay in milk-fed, weaned and finished lambs in an intensive fattening system.
AB  == this study examined the reticulo-rumen characteristics of the microbial community and its fermentative characteristics in milk-fed, at weaning and finished lambs in a conventional fattening system. five lambs were assigned to each of three groups: milk-fed lambs slaughtered at 30 days (t30), weaned lambs slaughtered at  45 days (t45) and 'finished lambs' slaughtered at 90 days (t90). at slaughter, rumen size, fermentation parameters (ph, volatile fatty acids and microbial enzyme activity) and protozoal counts were recorded. quantitative pcr was used to quantify the genes encoding 16s and 18s ribosomal dna of the rumen bacterial and  protozoal populations, respectively, and the sequential colonization of the rumen by cellulolytic (ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens) and amylolytic (prevotella ruminicola, streptococcus bovis) bacteria, and protozoa (entodinium sp.). denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to study the development of rumen microbiota biodiversity. intake of solid food before weaning caused a significant increase in rumen weight (p < 0.0001) and bacterial dna (p < 0.05) and volatile fatty acid analysis concentration (p < 0.01), whereas ph declined. in milk-fed lambs, cellulolytic bacteria were evident after 30 days. thereafter,  in the 45-day and 90-day groups, the proportions of r. flavefaciens decreased and r. albus increased. amylolytic bacteria were present in milk-fed lambs; the proportion of p. ruminicola increased in fattening lambs and s. bovis was the least abundant species. protozoal concentrations were irregular; milk-fed lambs had a significant number of protozoa species from entodinium and subfamily isotrichiidae, but they disappeared at weaning. lamb rumen were refaunated in some individuals at 90 days (entodinium and subfamily diplodiniinae spp.), although individual concentrations were variable.

TI  == infective endocarditis: identification of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci  from blood cultures by partial 16s rrna gene analysis and by vitek 2 examination.
AB  == streptococci, enterococci and streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. viridans streptococci (vs) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. strains originated from  two groups of patients: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. of the 330 strains, based on  partial 16s rrna gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were vs strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were e. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci. among vs strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same vs group. non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. most vs strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. pyogenic strains (n=10), enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group  of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB  == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several  physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one  would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether  this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using  other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not  discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI  == rumen microbiome composition determined using two nutritional models of subacute  ruminal acidosis.
AB  == subacute ruminal acidosis (sara) is a metabolic disease in dairy cattle that occurs during early and mid-lactation and has traditionally been characterized by low rumen ph, but lactic acid does not accumulate as in acute lactic acid acidosis. it is hypothesized that factors such as increased gut permeability, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and inflammatory responses may have a role in the  etiology of sara. however, little is known about the nature of the rumen microbiome during sara. in this study, we analyzed the microbiome of 64 rumen samples taken from eight lactating holstein dairy cattle using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (trflp) of 16s rrna genes and real-time pcr. we used rumen samples from two published experiments in which sara had been  induced with either grain or alfalfa pellets. the results of trflp analysis indicated that the most predominant shift during sara was a decline in gram-negative bacteroidetes organisms. however, the proportion of bacteroidetes organisms was greater in alfalfa pellet-induced sara than in mild or severe grain-induced sara (35.4% versus 26.0% and 16.6%, respectively). this shift was also evident from the real-time pcr data for prevotella albensis, prevotella brevis, and prevotella ruminicola, which are members of the bacteroidetes. the real-time pcr data also indicated that severe grain-induced sara was dominated by streptococcus bovis and escherichia coli, whereas mild grain-induced sara was dominated by megasphaera elsdenii and alfalfa pellet-induced sara was dominated by p. albensis. using discriminant analysis, the severity of sara and degree of inflammation were highly correlated with the abundance of e. coli and not with lipopolysaccharide in the rumen. we thus suspect that e. coli may be a contributing factor in disease onset.

TI  == surface-exposed histone-like protein a modulates adherence of streptococcus gallolyticus to colon adenocarcinoma cells.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly known as streptococcus bovis biotype i) is a low-grade opportunistic pathogen which is considered to be associated with colon  cancer. it is thought that colon polyps or tumors are the main portal of entry for this bacterium and that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (hspgs) at the colon tumor cell surface are involved in bacterial adherence during the first stages of infection. in this study, we have shown that the histone-like protein a (hlpa) of s. gallolyticus is a genuine anchorless bacterial surface protein that binds to lipoteichoic acid (lta) of the gram-positive cell wall in a growth phase-dependent manner. in addition, hlpa was shown to be one of the major heparin-binding proteins of s. gallolyticus able to bind to the hspg-expressing colon tumor cell lines hct116 and ht-29. strikingly, although wild-type levels of hlpa appeared to contribute to adherence, coating of additional hlpa at the bacterial surface resulted in reduced binding to colon tumor cells. this may be explained by the fact that heparan sulfate and lta compete for the same binding site in hlpa. altogether, this study implies that hlpa serves as a fine-tuning factor for bacterial adherence.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of streptococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples in korea.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance of streptococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples. a total of 178 isolates  belonging to 6 different streptococcus species were examined: s. uberis (n = 99), s. bovis (n = 30), s. oralis (n = 24), s. salivarius (n = 13), s. intermedius (n  = 7), and s. agalactiae (n = 5). only 8.9% (16/178) of the isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested in this study, and s. agalactiae and s. intermedius isolates were all resistant to at least 1 antimicrobial agent  tested. overall, the most frequently observed resistance was to tetracycline (61.2%), followed by lincomycin (43.2%), gentamycin (35.3%), oxacillin (34.3%), and erythromycin (28.6%). cephalothin and penicillin were the only antimicrobial  agents to which most of the streptococci (>or=92%) were susceptible. wide differences in the prevalence of resistance are apparent among the individual species: s. salivarius displayed exceptionally high resistance to cephalothin (23.0%) and oxacillin (76.9%) and s. agalactiae (20%) and s. intermedius (14.2%)  to penicillin. streptococcus salivarius and s. agalactiae were all susceptible to erythromycin, but others showed various rates of resistance ranging from 12.5% to 42.8%. resistance to 3 or more of 7 antimicrobial agents was observed in all species (37.6%, 67/178).

TI  == a collagen-binding adhesin, acb, and ten other putative mscramm and pilus family  proteins of streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (streptococcus bovis group, biotype i).
AB  == members of the streptococcus bovis group are important causes of endocarditis. however, factors associated with their pathogenicity, such as adhesins, remain uncharacterized. we recently demonstrated that endocarditis-derived streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates frequently adhere to extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins. here, we generated a draft genome sequence of an ecm protein-adherent s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain and found, by genome-wide analyses, 11 predicted lpxtg-type cell wall-anchored proteins with characteristics of mscramms, including a modular architecture of domains predicted to adopt immunoglobulin (ig)-like folding. a recombinant segment of one of these, acb, showed high-affinity binding to immobilized collagen, and cell surface expression of acb correlated with the presence of acb and collagen adherence of isolates. three of the 11 proteins have similarities to major pilus  subunits and are organized in separate clusters, each including a second ig-fold-containing mscramm and a class c sortase, suggesting that the sequenced strain encodes three distinct types of pili. reverse transcription-pcr demonstrated that all three genes of one cluster, acb-sbs7-srtc1, are cotranscribed, consistent with pilus operons of other gram-positive bacteria. further analysis detected expression of all 11 genes in cells grown to mid to late exponential growth phases. wide distribution of 9 of the 11 genes was observed among s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates with fewer genes present in other s. bovis group species/subspecies. the high prevalence of genes  encoding putative mscramms and pili, including a collagen-binding mscramm, among  s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates may play an important role in the predominance of this subspecies in s. bovis endocarditis.

TI  == evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  == objectives: to prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. methods: an evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). the scoring procedure  was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. the zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. results: the following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli. a second group of "significant importance" included toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus, cryptosporidium parvum, mycobacterium bovis, echinococcus granulosus, streptococcus spp., echinococcus multilocularis, yersinia enterocolitica, mycobacterium avium, fasciola hepatica, giardia intestinalis, and rotavirus. conclusions: this methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. applications: these results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. they also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.

TI  == [novel clinical and epidemiologic trends in elderly infective endocarditis].
AB  == the age of peak incidence of infective endocarditis (ie) has shifted from 45 years in the 50's to 70 years at the present time. elderly persons carry a five times higher risk of ie than the general adult population. factors accounting for this phenomenon include increased use of invasive procedures and implanted medical devices as well as a higher prevalence of degenerative valve disease. in  the elderly, ie onset may be insidious, often masked by one or more underlying conditions such as cancer, diabetes and chronic organ failure, hence the diagnosis may be delayed. the leading pathogen is staphylococcus aureus, more frequently methicillin-resistant, although streptococcus bovis and enterococci are gaining prevalence. vascular phenomena and embolic events are less common in  the elderly, probably due to a lessened acute phase response and a larger use of  antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs. because of diminished renal clearance, antibiotics should be carefully titrated in aged ie patients. cardiac surgery is  performed less often in elderly ie due to poor preoperative conditions. indeed, both these factors may account for the higher mortality rate, that is twice that  of younger ie patients. notwithstanding, age > or = 65 years has been found to be an independent predictor of mortality. prophylactic measures residing mostly on the prevention of health-care associated acquisition need to be more widely implemented in this growing subgroup of ie patients.

TI  == novel strategy for yeast construction using delta-integration and cell fusion to  efficiently produce ethanol from raw starch.
AB  == we developed a novel strategy for constructing yeast to improve levels of amylase gene expression and the practical potential of yeast by combining delta-integration and polyploidization through cell fusion. streptococcus bovis alpha-amylase and rhizopus oryzae glucoamylase/alpha-agglutinin fusion protein genes were integrated into haploid yeast strains. diploid strains were constructed from these haploid strains by mating, and then a tetraploid strain was constructed by cell fusion. the alpha-amylase and glucoamylase activities of  the tetraploid strain were increased up to 1.5- and tenfold, respectively, compared with the parental strain. the diploid and tetraploid strains proliferated faster, yielded more cells, and fermented glucose more effectively than the haploid strain. ethanol productivity from raw starch was improved with increased ploidy; the tetraploid strain consumed 150 g/l of raw starch and produced 70 g/l of ethanol after 72 h of fermentation. our strategy for constructing yeasts resulted in the simultaneous overexpression of genes integrated into the genome and improvements in the practical potential of yeasts.

TI  == production of bacteriocins by streptococcus bovis strains from australian ruminants.
AB  == aims: to examine the prevalence of bacteriocin production in streptococcus bovis  isolates from australian ruminants and the feasibility of industrial production of bacteriocin. methods and results: streptococcus bovis strains were tested for  production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) by antagonism assay against lactococcus lactis. blis production was associated with source animal location (i.e. proximity of other bacteriocin-positive source animals) rather than ruminant species/breed or diet. one bacteriocin showing strong inhibitory activity (sb15) was isolated and examined. protein sequence, stability and activity spectrum of this bovicin were very similar to bovicin hc5. production could be increased through serial culturing, and increased productivity could be  partially maintained during cold storage of cultures. conclusions: blis production is geographically widely distributed in eastern australia, and it appears that the bacteriocin(+) trait is maintained in animals at the same location. the hc5-like bacteriocin, originally identified in north america, is also found in australia. production of bacteriocin can be increased through serial culturing. significance and impact of the study: the hc5-like bacteriocins appear to have a broad global distribution. serial culturing may provide a route  towards commercial manufacturing for use in industrial applications, and purified bacteriocin from s. bovis sb15 could potentially be used to prevent food spoilage or as a feed additive to promote growth in ruminant species.

TI  == effects of dietary changes and yeast culture (saccharomyces cerevisiae) on rumen  microbial fermentation of holstein heifers.
AB  == the effects of a dietary challenge to induce digestive upsets and supplementation with yeast culture on rumen microbial fermentation were studied using 12 holstein heifers (277 +/- 28 kg of bw) fitted with a ruminal cannula, in a crossover design with 2 periods of 5 wk. in each period, after 3 wk of adaptation to a 100% forage diet, the dietary challenge consisted of increasing the amount of grain at a rate of 2.5 kg/d (as-fed basis) over a period of 4 d, until a 10:90 forage:concentrate diet was reached, and then it was maintained for 10 d. between periods, animals were fed again the 100% forage diet without any treatment for 1  wk as a wash-out period. treatments started the first day of each period, and they were a control diet (cl) or the same diet with addition of yeast culture (yc, diamond v xpcls). digestive upsets were determined by visual observation of  bloat or by a reduction in feed intake (as-fed basis) of 50% or more compared with intake on the previous day. feed intake was determined daily at 24-h intervals during the adaptation period and daily at 2, 6, and 12 h postfeeding during the dietary challenge. ruminal liquid samples were collected daily during  the dietary challenge to determine ruminal ph at 0, 3, 6, and 12 h postfeeding, and total and individual vfa, lactic acid, ammonia-n, and rumen fluid viscosity at 0 and 6 h postfeeding. the 16s rrna gene copies of streptococcus bovis and megasphaera elsdenii were determined by quantitative pcr. foam height and strength of the rumen fluid were also determined the day after the digestive upset to evaluate potential foam production. a total of 20 cases (83.3%) of digestive upsets were recorded in both periods during the dietary challenge, all  diagnosed due to a reduction in feed intake. rumen fermentation profile at 0 h on the digestive upset day was characterized by low ruminal ph, which remained under 6.0 for 18 h, accompanied by elevated total vfa concentration and, in some cases, by elevated lactate concentration. addition of yc during the dietary challenge did not affect the incidence (10 cases per treatment) or time (7.00 +/- 0.62 d) to digestive upset. however, yc reduced (p < 0.05) the foam strength on the day after digestive upset, suggesting potential benefits of reducing the risk of developing bloat. the proposed dietary challenge model was successful in causing  a digestive upset as indicated by reduced feed intake, but the yc addition had no significant impact on rumen fermentation.

TI  == real-time polymerase chain reaction-based identification of bacteria in milk samples from bovine clinical mastitis with no growth in conventional culturing.
AB  == in more than 30% of milk samples from clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis, bacteria fail to grow even after 48 h of conventional culture. the "no-growth" samples are problematic for mastitis laboratories, veterinarians, and dairy producers. this study provides the first investigation of the bacteriological etiology of such samples, using a real-time pcr-based commercial reagent kit. the assay targets the dna of the 11 most common bacterial species or groups in mastitis and the staphylococcal blaz gene (responsible for penicillin resistance) and can identify and quantify bacterial cells even if dead or growth-inhibited. a study was made of 79 mastitic milk samples with no-growth bacteria in conventional culture, originating from cows with clinical mastitis. of the 79 samples, 34 (43%) were positive for 1 (32 samples) or 2 (2 samples) of the target bacteria. the positive findings included 11 staphylococcus spp. (staphylococci other than staphylococcus aureus), 10 streptococcus uberis, 2 streptococcus dysgalactiae, 6 corynebacterium bovis, 3 staph. aureus, 1 escherichia coli, 1 enterococcus, and 1 arcanobacterium pyogenes. the positive samples contained as many as 10(3) to 10(7) bacterial genome copies per milliliter of milk. this study demonstrates that in nearly half of the clinical mastitis cases in which conventional culture failed to detect bacteria, mastitis pathogens were still present, often in substantial quantities. the clearly elevated n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity values of the milk samples, together with clinical signs of the infected cows and quarters, confirmed the diagnosis of clinical mastitis and indicated that real-time, pcr-based bacterial findings are  able to reveal bacteriological etiology. we conclude that all common mastitis bacteria can occur in large quantities in clinical mastitis samples that exhibit  no growth in conventional culture, and that the real-time pcr assay is a useful tool for bacteriological diagnosis of such milk samples. low bacterial concentration is commonly speculated to explain the no-growth milk samples. this  hypothesis is not supported by the results of the current study.

AB  == study design: a case report and clinical discussion. objective: to describe an unique case of purulent discitis at c3-c4 and an anterior c1-c4 epidural abscess  secondary to oxygen-ozone therapy for the herniated cervical discs. summary of background data: previously reported complications secondary to ozone therapy are rarely documented. no cases of pyogenic discitis with associated epidural abscess after oxygen-ozone therapy have been reported to date. to our knowledge, this is  the first such case reported in literature. methods: a 57-year-old female patient with nuchal stiffness was previously treated with ozone therapy at the discs of c3-c4, c4-c5, and c6-c7. five days later, she presented with an attack of neck pain and fever followed by progressive quadriplegia with sudden onset of dyspnea  and was referred to our hospital. on admission, physical examination revealed a temperature of 38.8 degrees c, evident neck tenderness, marked global weakness (grade 1-2/5 mrc) in bilateral upper-limb, and a modest global weakness in bilateral lower-limb (grade 4/5 mrc). laboratory findings showed a significantly  elevated wcc, esr, and crp. blood culture was negative. enhanced-mr imaging demonstrated a purulent discitis at c3-c4 and a ventral c1-c4 epidural abscess with homogenous enhancement indicative of a solid phlegmonous granulation tissue. results: we formulated a 3-stage treatment involving c1-c4 multilevel decompressive laminectomies, subtotal unilateral c3-c4 facetectomies, and tissue  sampling for culture with application of a corset after surgery, followed by a delayed secondary posterior thorough drainage of epidural liquid pus using a suction-irrigation drainage, after the abscess had turned to a necrotic liquid abscess, on the basis of findings of enhanced-mr imaging, by 10-day duration of intravenously antibiotic therapy tailored to streptococcus bovis isolated from infected tissue. over the next few weeks, the patient made an excellent neurologic recovery. however, she did not consent to undergo further occipitocervical fusion until the follow-up mr imaging at 8 months demonstrated postlaminectomy kyphosis. after surgery, the patient remained clinically satisfactory in neurology without evidence of a recurrence of spinal infection. a slight improvement in the cervical spine curve was demonstrated in the follow-up  radiograph at nearly 4-month postoccipitocervical fusion. conclusion: this case report illustrates a rare but life-threatening complication of oxygen-ozone therapy for the cervical disc herniation. infection is a common risk for any invasive spinal techniques involving puncture, so attention should be paid to the sterility during the procedures. a high index of suspicion along with reliance on enhanced-mri is essential to diagnose the condition and institute appropriate treatment on an individual basis.

AB  == background: bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid is evaluated for the diagnosis and study of lung disease and airway inflammation. cytologic profiles for bal fluid have not been reported for badgers and may be useful in understanding the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases such as mycobacterium bovis. objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate cytologic and microbial findings in bal fluid from captive european badgers (meles meles) and identify correlates with the results of concurrently collected blood and fecal samples. methods: bal fluid (by a nonbronchoscopic method) and jugular venous blood samples (for routine cbc) were obtained from 23 captive tuberculosis-free anesthetized badgers on 2 occasions 4 weeks apart. fecal samples were collected for routine parasitology. morphologic evaluation and 100-cell differentials were done on cytocentrifuged bal specimens. pellets from centrifuged bal were aerobically cultured for bacteria. results: with the 2 bal samples from each of the 23 badgers combined, the median (range) cell percentages were 73.0% (5-95%) neutrophils, 7.5% (2-16%)  macrophages, 8.0% (0-27%) lymphocytes, and 9.5% (0-92%) eosinophils. macrophages  frequently contained silica-like crystals. other findings included ciliated epithelial cells, goblet cells, mucus, and aelurostrongylus sp. larvae. a light growth of streptococcus, pasteurella, or escherichia coli was cultured in 6 badgers. trypanosoma pestanai were identified in blood from 10 badgers and fecal  parasites (mainly coccidia) were found in 20 badgers. no correlation was found between bal and cbc results and the presence of parasites. conclusions: the predominance of neutrophils in bal fluid from badgers differs from the predominance of macrophages found in bal from other species. this difference may  reflect the burrowing lifestyle or the unique immune response of badgers.

TI  == association of streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  == the genus streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, streptococcus gallinaceus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. during investigations of the  aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or  valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. phenotypic characterization using the api20 strep kit identified the isolates as aerococcus viridans (10), aerococcus urinae (2), leuconostoc species (4), streptococcus salivarius (2), streptococcus  bovis ii 3 (1), enterococcus avium (3), enterococcus faecium (1) or gemella morbillorum (1). however, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were e. avium (3), e. faecium (1) or  lactobacillus species (1). misidentification by api20 strep was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as s. pluranimalium. the isolates of s. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dna. the capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

TI  == streptococcus bovis endocarditis, a silent sign for colonic tumour.
AB  == aim: an association between colonic carcinoma and streptococcus bovis endocarditis/bacteraemia was first suggested in 1951. this knowledge has great clinical implications, yet we found scant awareness amongst general surgical trainees. the aim of this article was to review the evidence available in the literature and explore the pathophysiology behind this association. method: the literature was reviewed, between 1950 and 2008, using pubmed, embase and ovid database searches. we utilized different combinations of the keywords: streptococcus bovis, endocarditis, septicaemia and colon cancer/carcinoma. quality assessment was determined using the oxford centre for evidence-based medicine levels of evidence (may 2001). studies were selected based on their relevance to the aims to be addressed. results: we included nine case reports and found 24 studies demonstrating an association between s. bovis bacteraemia/endocarditis and colon cancer; the reported incidence in studies was  variable (6-67%). the majority of studies (20) were retrospective analysis of data; only four studies were prospective. a total of 12 of 24 studies also reported an association with extra-colonic malignancy (1-22%) and 12 with liver disease (3-57%). eight studies relevant to the pathophysiology of this association were identified. conclusion: streptococcus bovis endocarditis and/or  bacteraemia is an early clue to the likely presence of colorectal cancer. whilst  further studies are required to determine the precise pathophysiology, clinicians should be aware of this association. it is advisable to investigate rigorously for colon cancer in all patients presenting with s. bovis endocarditis/bacteraemia; such patients may also present with liver disease or, occasionally, extra-colonic malignancy.

AB  == antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (mdr) strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and candida albicans. atcc strains of streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus bovis, pseudimonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and candida albicans were also tested. the strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. the mdr strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of acacia nilotica,  syzygium aromaticum and cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of terminalia arjuna and eucalyptus globulus. community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. the most potent antimicrobial plant was a. nilotica (mic range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher mic values than a. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. this study concludes  that a. nilotica, c. zeylanicum and s. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.

TI  == physiological changes in rumen fermentation during acidosis induction and its control using a multivalent polyclonal antibody preparation in heifers.
AB  == physiological changes in rumen fermentation during acidosis induction and its control using a multivalent polyclonal antibody preparation (pap) were studied in a completely randomized experiment using 12 crossbred heifers (452 +/- 20 kg of bw). treatments were control (ctr) or pap. the acidosis induction protocol consisted of 3 periods: 3 mo of 100% fescue hay fed for ad libitum intake, 10 d (from d 1 to 10 of the experiment) of adaptation to the treatment (100% forage feeding + 10 ml/d of pap top-dressed to the treatment group), and 5 d (from d 11  to 15 of the experiment) of transition, which consisted of increasing the concentrate (16.5% cp) 2.5 kg/d up to 12.5 kg/d while maintaining ad libitum intake of fescue and providing 10 ml/d of pap to the treated heifers. concentrate feeding of 12.5 kg/d was maintained until heifers developed acidosis (from d 16 to 22 of the experiment). when an animal was considered acidotic, it was changed  to a 50:50 forage:concentrate diet, monitored for 4 d, and removed from the experiment. samples of ruminal fluid were collected before and 6 h after feeding  to determine ph, vfa, lactate, protozoa counts, and dna extraction for quantitative real-time pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses.  only samples collected during adaptation to the treatment, at 3 and 1 d before acidosis, on the acidosis day, and at 1 and 4 d after acidosis were analyzed. differences were declared at p < 0.05. heifers (83% for ctr, and 50% for pap) entered into acidosis 5.25 +/- 0.17 d after the beginning of the transition. the  fermentation profile of animals with acidosis was similar between treatments. from 3 d before acidosis to acidosis day, decreases in ph and in acetate-to-propionate ratio and increases in total vfa, butyrate, and entodiniomorph counts were observed. however, the greatest concentrations of streptococcus bovis and megasphaera elsdenii (79 +/- 54 and 104 +/- 73 ng of dna/ml of ruminal fluid, respectively) and a decrease in dmi (10.6 vs. 6.46 kg, respectively) were recorded 1 d after acidosis. compared with ctr heifers, heifers fed pap had greater ph before feeding on d 6 (6.70 vs. 6.11), 8 (6.54 vs. 5.95), and 9 (7.26 vs. 6.59) after the beginning of the feeding challenge. heifers fed pap tended to have greater total vfa concentrations than ctr (124 and 114 +/- 4.0 mm, respectively). these results indicate that pap may be effective in controlling acidosis of heifers during a rapid transition to a high-concentrate diet.

TI  == characteristics of the bovicin hj50 gene cluster in streptococcus bovis hj50.
AB  == bovicin hj50 is a new lantibiotic containing a disulfide bridge produced by streptococcus bovis hj50; its encoding gene bova was reported in our previous publication. to identify other genes involved in bovicin hj50 production, dna fragments flanking bova were cloned and sequenced. the bovicin hj50 biosynthesis  gene locus was encoded by a 9.9 kb region of chromosomal dna and consisted of at  least nine genes in the following order: bova, -m, -t, -e, -f, orf1, orf2, bovk and bovr. a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase gene named sdb1 was located downstream of bovr. a knockout mutant of this gene retained antimicrobial activity and the molecular mass of bovicin hj50 in the mutant was the same as that of bovicin hj50 in s. bovis hj50, implying that sdb1 is not involved in bovicin hj50 production.  transcriptional analyses showed that bova, bovm and bovt constituted an operon, and the transcription start site of the bova promoter was located at a g residue  45 bp upstream of the translation start codon for bova, while bove through bovr were transcribed together and the transcription start site of the bove promoter was located at a c residue 35 bp upstream of bove. we also demonstrated successful heterologous expression of bovicin hj50 in lactococcus lactis mg1363,  which lacks thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase genes; this showed that thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase genes other than sdb1 are not essential for bovicin hj50 biosynthesis.

TI  == bovicin hc5 inhibits wasteful amino acid degradation by mixed ruminal bacteria in vitro.
AB  == streptococcus bovis hc5 produces a broad spectrum lantibiotic (bovicin hc5) that  inhibits pure cultures of hyper ammonia-producing bacteria (hab). experiments were preformed to see if: (1) s. bovis hc5 cells could inhibit the deamination of amino acids by mixed ruminal bacteria taken directly from a cow, (2) semi-purified bovicin was as effective as s. bovis hc5 cells, and 3) semi-purified and the feed additive monensin were affecting the same types of ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria. because purified and semi-purified bovicin hc5 was as effective as s. bovis hc5 cells, it appeared that bovicin hc5 was penetrating the cell membranes of hab before it could be degraded by peptidases and proteinases. mixed ruminal bacteria that were successively transferred and enriched nine times with trypticase did not become significantly more resistant to either bovicin hc5 (50 au ml(-1)) or monensin (5 microm), and amplified rdna restriction analysis indicated that bovicin hc5 and monensin appeared to be selecting against the same types of bacteria.

TI  == the ability of non-bacteriocin producing streptococcus bovis strains to bind and  transfer bovicin hc5 to other sensitive bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus bovis hc5 produces a broad spectrum lantibiotic (bovicin hc5), but  s. bovis jb1 does not have antimicrobial activity. preliminary experiments revealed an anomaly. when s. bovis jb1 cells were washed in stationary phase s. bovis hc5 cell-free culture supernatant, the s. bovis jb1 cells were subsequently able to inhibit hyper-ammonia producing ruminal bacteria (clostridium sticklandii, clostridium aminophilum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius). other non-bacteriocin producing s. bovis strains also had the ability to bind and transfer semi-purified bovicin hc5. bovicin hc5 that was bound to s. bovis jb1 was much more resistant to pronase e than cell-free bovicin hc5, but it could be  inactivated if the incubation period was 24 h. acidic nacl treatment (100 mm, ph  2.0) liberates half of the bovicin hc5 from s. bovis hc5, but it did not prevent  bovicin hc5 from binding to s. bovis jb1. acidic nacl liberated some bovicin hc5  from s. bovis jb1, but the decrease in activity was only 2-fold. bovicin hc5 is a positively charged peptide, and the ability of s. bovis jb1 to bind bovicin hc5 could be inhibited by either calcium or magnesium (100 mm). acidic nacl-treated s. bovis jb1 cells were unable to accumulate potassium, but they were still able  to bind bovicin hc5 and prevent potassium accumulation by untreated s. bovis jb1  cells. based on these results, bovicin hc5 bound to s. bovis jb1 cells still acts as a pore-forming lantibiotic.

TI  == lactobacillus casei secreting alpha-msh induces the therapeutic effect on dss-induced acute colitis in balb/c mice.
AB  == the neuropeptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha- msh) has anti-inflammatory property by downregulating the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines. because alpha-msh elicits the anti-inflammatory effect in various inflammatory disease models, we examined the therapeutic effect of oral administration of recombinant lactobacillus casei, which secretes alpha-msh (l. casei-alpha-msh), on dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis in balb/c mice. thus, we constructed the alpha-msh-secreting lactobacillus casei by the basic plasmid, pluat-ss, which was composed of a pldhutls promoter and alpha-amylase signal sequence from streptococcus bovis strain. acute colitis was induced by oral administration of 5% dss in drinking water for 7 days. to investigate the effect of l. casei-alpha-msh on the colitis, l. casei or l. casei-alpha-msh was orally administered for 7 days and their effects on body weight, mortality rate,  cytokine production, and tissue myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity were observed. administration of l. casei-alpha-msh reduced the symptom of acute colitis as assessed by body weight loss (dss alone: 14.45+/-0. 2 g; l. casei-alpha- msh: 18.2+/-0.12 g), colitis score (dss alone: 3.6+/-0.4; l. casei-alpha-msh: 1.4+/-0.6), mpo activity (dss alone: 42.7+/-4.5 u/g; l. casei-alpha-msh: 10.25+/-0.5 u/g), survival rate, and histological damage compared with the dss alone mice. l. casei-alpha-msh-administered entire colon showed reduced in vitro  production of proinflammatory cytokines and nf-kappab activation. the alpha-msh-secreting recombinant l. casei showed significant anti-inflammatory effects in the murine model of acute colitis and suggests a potential therapeutic role for this agent in clinical inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  == ecology and pathogenicity of gastrointestinal streptococcus bovis.
AB  == streptococcus bovis is an indigenous resident in the gastrointestinal tracts of both humans and animals. s. bovis is one of the major causes of bacterial endocarditis and has been implicated in the incidence of human colon cancer, possibly due to chronic inflammatory response at the site of intestinal colonization. certain feeding regimens in ruminants can lead to overgrowth of s.  bovis in the rumen, resulting in the over-production of lactate and capsular polysaccharide causing acute ruminal acidosis and bloat, respectively. there are  multiple strategies in controlling acute lactic acidosis and bloat. the incidence of the two diseases may be controlled by strict dietary management. gradual introduction of grain-based diets and the feeding of coarsely chopped roughage decrease the incidence of the two disease entities. ionophores, which have been used to enhance feed conversion and growth rate in cattle, have been shown to inhibit the growth of lactic acid bacteria in the rumen. other methods of controlling lactic acid bacteria in the ruminal environment (dietary supplementation of long-chain fatty acids, induction of passive and active immune responses to the bacteria, and the use of lytic bacteriophages) have also been investigated. it is anticipated that through continued in-depth ecological analysis of s. bovis the characteristics responsible for human and animal pathogenesis would be sufficiently identified to a point where more effective control strategies for the control of this bacteria can be developed.

TI  == adherence characteristics of endocarditis-derived streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus (streptococcus bovis biotype i) isolates to host extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  == members of the streptococcus bovis group are frequent colonizers of the intestinal tract, which can also cause endocarditis. however, their ability to adhere to and colonize host tissues and the factors associated with pathogenicity are largely unknown. here, we assessed 17 endocarditis-derived human isolates [identified here as 15 streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus (s. bovis biotype i), one s. gallolyticus ssp. pasteurianus (biotype ii/2) and one streptococcus infantarius ssp. coli (biotype ii/1)] for their in vitro adherence  to components of the extracellular matrix (ecm). adherence to collagen type i was found to be the most common phenotype exhibited by 76% of isolates, followed by collagen type iv (53%), fibrinogen (47%), collagen type v (35%) and fibronectin (35%). pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses showed that >50% of endocarditis-derived s. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus isolates are genetically diverse, although two clusters of two and four isolates were observed. the diversity of strains and differences observed in adherence characteristics to distinct host ecm proteins suggest that isolates of s. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus produce different surface components, similar to other gram-positive pathogens, to colonize the host and cause infection.

TI  == screening of surface properties and antagonistic substances production by lactic  acid bacteria isolated from the mammary gland of healthy and mastitic cows.
AB  == bovine mastitis (bm) is a costly disease in dairy cattle production. the prevention and treatment of mastitis is performed by applying antimicrobial products that negatively affect milk quality. in the last years, the use of probiotic microorganisms to prevent infections in humans and animals has being aggressively studied. samples from teat canal and milk (foremilk and stripping) were taken from healthy and mastitic mammary quarters. a screening of the surface properties and antagonistic substances production of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the mammary gland was performed to select potential probiotic strains to prevent mastitis. somatic cell count, physico-chemical and microbiological studies were carried out. pre-selected microorganisms were genetically identified. compared with stripping milk, foremilk showed lower levels of fat and higher levels of ph, density, microorganism numbers, lower percentage of strains with mean and high hydrophobicity and mean autoaggregation  and higher number of strains able to produce hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins.  the other parameters analyzed were not statistically significant. one hundred and two lab strains were isolated. most of them had low degrees of hydrophobicity and autoaggregation. no correlation between these properties was found. antagonistic  metabolites were mainly produced by strains isolated from healthy quarters. most  of the pre-selected strains were identified as streptococcus bovis and weissella  paramesenteroides. three bacteriocin-producers were found and their products partially characterized. the results of this work are the basis for the further design of a specie-specific probiotic product able to prevent bm.

TI  == properties and role of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the control of fermentation pattern and growth in a ruminal bacterium, streptococcus bovis.
AB  == to clarify the control of glycolysis and the fermentation pattern in streptococcus bovis, the molecular and enzymatic properties of nad(+)-specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) were examined. the gapdh gene (gapa) was found to cluster with several others, including those that encode phosphoglycerate kinase and translation elongation factor g, however, gapa was transcribed in a monocistronic fashion. since biochemical properties, such as optimal ph and affinity for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (gap), were not very different between gapdh- and nadp(+)-specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapn), the flux from gap may be greatly influenced by the relative amounts of these two enzymes. using s. bovis jb1 as a parent, jb1gapa and jb1ldh, which overproduce gapdh and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), respectively, were constructed to examine the control of the glycolytic flux and lactate production. there were no significant differences in growth rates and formate-to-lactate ratios among jb1, jb1gapa, and jb1ldh grown on glucose. when grown on lactose, jb1ldh showed a much lower formate-to-lactate ratio than jb1gapa, which showed the highest nadh-to-nad(+) ratio. however, growth rates did not differ among jb1, jb1gapa, and jb1ldh. these results suggest that gapdh is not involved in the control of the glycolytic flux and that lactate production is mainly controlled by ldh activity.

TI  == secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor: a secreted pattern recognition receptor for mycobacteria.
AB  == rationale: human secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi) displays bactericidal activity against pathogens such as escherichia coli and streptococcus. furthermore, it has been reported that murine slpi shows potent antimycobacterial activity. objectives: the aim of the present study was to investigate whether human recombinant slpi not only kills mycobacteria but also acts as a pattern recognition receptor for the host immune system. methods: for the in vivo experiment, balb/c mice were infected by intranasal instillation with mycobacterium bovis bcg and viable bcg load in lung homogenates was later determined. for the in vitro experiments, slpi was incubated overnight with a suspension of m. bovis bcg or the virulent strain mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv, and the percentage survival as well as the binding of slpi to mycobacteria was determined. furthermore, bacteria phagocytosis was also determined by flow cytometry. measurements and main results: intranasal slpi treatment decreased the number of colony-forming units recovered from lung homogenates, indicating that slpi interfered with m. bovis bcg infection. moreover, slpi decreased the viability of both m. bovis bcg and h37rv. we demonstrated that slpi attached to the surface of the mycobacteria by binding to pathogen-associated molecular pattern mannan-capped lipoarabinomannans and phosphatidylinositol mannoside. furthermore, we found that in the sputum of patients with tuberculosis, mycobacteria were coated with endogenous slpi. finally, we showed that phagocytosis of slpi-coated mycobacteria was faster than that of uncoated bacteria. conclusions: the present results demonstrate for the first time that human slpi kills mycobacteria and is a new pattern recognition receptor for them.

AB  == in order to achieve direct and efficient fermentation of optically pure d-lactic  acid from raw corn starch, we constructed l-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhl1)-deficient lactobacillus plantarum and introduced a plasmid encoding streptococcus bovis 148 alpha-amylase (amya). the resulting strain produced only  d-lactic acid from glucose and successfully expressed amya. with the aid of secreting amya, direct d-lactic acid fermentation from raw corn starch was accomplished. after 48 h of fermentation, 73.2 g/liter of lactic acid was produced with a high yield (0.85 g per g of consumed sugar) and an optical purity of 99.6%. moreover, a strain replacing the ldhl1 gene with an amya-secreting expression cassette was constructed. using this strain, direct d-lactic acid fermentation from raw corn starch was accomplished in the absence of selective pressure by antibiotics. this is the first report of direct d-lactic acid fermentation from raw starch.

AB  == in a previous study, preparations of polyclonal antibodies (pap) against fusobacterium necrophorum (pap-fn) or streptococcus bovis (pap-sb) were successful in decreasing ruminal counts of target bacteria and increasing ruminal ph in steers fed high-grain diets. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of feeding pap-fn or pap-sb on performance, carcass characteristics,  and ruminal fermentation variables of feedlot steers. in exp. 1, during 2 consecutive years, 226 or 192 angus and angus crossbred steers were fed a high-grain diet containing either pap-sb or pap-fn, or both. when measured on a bw basis, steers fed only pap-sb had a greater g:f (p < 0.05) than those fed no pap. nevertheless, when both pap were fed, feed efficiency was similar (p > 0.10) to steers fed no pap or only pap-sb. steers receiving pap-fn (alone or in combination with pap-sb) had a decreased (p < 0.05) dressing percentage. steers receiving pap-fn (alone or in combination with pap-sb) had a decreased severity of liver abscess (p < 0.05). no differences (p > 0.10) were observed in any other carcass characteristics. in exp. 2, sixteen ruminally cannulated angus crossbred  steers (bw = 665 +/- 86 kg) were fed a high-grain diet containing either pap-sb or pap-fn, or both. feeding only pap-fn or pap-sb for 19 d decreased (p < 0.05) ruminal counts of s. bovis when compared with steers fed both or no pap. the ruminal counts of f. necrophorum in steers fed pap-fn alone or in combination with pap-sb were decreased by 98% (p < 0.05) after 19 d, when compared with the counts in control steers. mean daily ruminal ph was greater (p < 0.05) in steers  fed both pap when compared with feeding either or no pap. ruminal ph in the first 4 h after feeding was greater (p < 0.05) for steers receiving pap-fn alone or in  combination with pap-sb. steers receiving either pap alone or in combination had  less (p < 0.05) ruminal nh(3)-n concentrations in the first 4 h after feeding when compared with those of control steers. polyclonal antibody preparations against s. bovis were effective in enhancing g:f of steers fed high-grain diets,  but dressing percentage was decreased. mechanisms of enhancement of g:f remain unknown but may be related to changes in ruminal counts of target bacteria and associated effects on ruminal fermentation products.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == a traditional sudanese fermented camel's milk product, gariss, as a habitat of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius.
AB  == samples of the traditional sudanese fermented camel's milk product gariss representing 9 different regions in sudan were microbiologically characterized using an integrated approach including phenotypic and genotypic methods. lactic acid bacteria [log(cfu/g)=7.76-8.66] and yeasts [log(cfu/g)=6.05-7.79] were detected in high numbers. a total of 180 lab isolates were identified of which 123 isolates were found to belong to the streptococcus bovis group. thirteen representative isolates were characterized by pcr amplification and sequencing of the housekeeping genes rpob and soda and the streptococcal glucosyltransferase gene (gtf). all thirteen isolates were identified as streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, a potential human pathogen. the gene encoding the virulence determinant gtf was detected in 10 of the 13 tested strains. the same isolates were able to survive exposure to 0.3% (w/v) oxgall for 4 h and ph=2.7 for 1-4 h.  also lactobacillus fermentum were detected in high numbers, whereas enterococcus  faecium and lactobacillus helveticus were detected more occasionally. the yeast microflora in all gariss samples consisted of kluyveromyces marxianus and issatchenkia orientalis with the former being predominant in 7 out of 9 samples.

TI  == comprehensive study of strains previously designated streptococcus bovis consecutively isolated from human blood cultures and emended description of streptococcus gallolyticus and streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli.
AB  == modern taxonomy has delineated streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli, and s. infantarius subsp. infantarius within the heterogenous group of previously designated clinical streptococcus bovis bacteria. in the present study, 58 consecutive blood culture isolates initially designated s. bovis were further characterized by applying phenotypic and molecular genetic methods, and possible  disease associations were investigated by studying the patients' records. published phenotypic characteristics of s. gallolyticus and s. infantarius were not unequivocal and did not allow an unambiguous phenotypic differentiation of the 58 clinical isolates. however, full-length 16s rrna gene sequences clearly assigned the strains to s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (n = 29), s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (n = 12), and s. infantarius subsp. coli (n = 17). only 28% of the patients with available records presented with endocarditis  and 7% presented with colon carcinoma, whereas 37% of the patients had altered liver parenchyma and 28% had gall bladder disease as underlying diseases. detailed antimicrobial susceptibility data on both s. gallolyticus subspecies and s. infantarius subsp. coli are given for the first time. as a result of the extensive characterization of the largest number of s. gallolyticus and s. infantarius human clinical isolates published so far, emended species descriptions are given. it is recommended that both clinical microbiologists and  infectious disease specialists avoid the designation s. bovis for true s. gallolyticus and s. infantarius strains in the future in order to get a clearer picture of the possible disease associations of these species.

TI  == use of primers based on the heat shock protein genes hsp70, hsp40, and hsp10, for the detection of bovine mastitis pathogens streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis and streptococcus bovis.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, and streptococcus bovis are three of the major pathogens which cause mastitis in dairy herds. since conventional methods for the detection of these mastitis pathogens are laborious and time-consuming, rapid methods are needed. with an attempt to know if heat shock protein (hsp) genes other than hsp60 gene, could be used for pcr primer designing, in this study, we tried to design pcr primers based on the heat shock  protein genes hsp70, hsp40, and hsp10 for the specific detection of s. agalactiae, s. uberis, and s. bovis, respectively. using these primers, all the randomly selected target strains could be specifically detected. bacterial species other than the target organisms, including strains of other streptococcus spp., and strains of non-streptococcus spp., would not generate any false positive results. as these pcr primers were used for direct detection of mastitis pathogens, the detection limit was n (n=1-9) x 10(3)cfu/ml of cell dilutions. if  a 10h pre-enrichment step was performed, the detection limit was n x 10(0)cfu/ml. thus, these primers could be used for the specific and sensitive detection of bovine mastitis bacteria.

TI  == development of a novel biochip for rapid multiplex detection of seven mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk samples.
AB  == to efficiently prevent and treat bovine mastitis and minimize its effect on the dairy industry, a sensitive, rapid, and specific test is required for identifying the mastitis-causing pathogens. in this study, a biochip capable of detecting 7 common species of mastitis-causing pathogens, including corynebacterium bovis, mycoplasma bovis, staphylococcus aureus, and the streptococcus spp. s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. dysgalactiae, and s. uberis, within 6 hr was developed.  the technique is based on dna amplification of genes specific to the target pathogens and consists of 4 basic steps: dna extraction of bacteria, polymerase chain reaction, dna hybridization, and colorimetric reaction. to examine the accuracy and specificity of this biochip, a preliminary test with 82 random quarter milk samples were analyzed and compared with results from conventional microbiological methods conducted simultaneously. results from all but 1 sample analyzed by the biochip were in agreement with those analyzed by bacteriology. the biochip could be a feasible tool for rapidly diagnosing mastitis-causing pathogens in milk and providing information for a more effective treatment to cure mastitis.

TI  == molecular properties and transcriptional control of the phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase genes in a ruminal bacterium, streptococcus bovis.
AB  == molecular properties of pyruvate kinase (pyk) and phosphofructokinase (pfk) in streptococcus bovis and transcriptional control of the two enzymes were examined. sequence analysis indicated that the pyk gene (pyk) clusters with the pfk gene (pfk) and several other genes. it was demonstrated that the pyk and pfk are cotranscribed and their transcription appeared to be regulated at the transcriptional level in response to the sugars supplied. the intracellular pyk-mrna level was lower in a catabolite control protein a (ccpa)-disrupted mutant than in its parent strain, and a binding site of ccpa was found in the upstream region of pfk. these results suggest that pfk-pyk transcription is enhanced by ccpa. a recombinant pyk-overexpressing strain showed approximately five-fold higher pyk activity, but it did not affect the growth rate or formate-to-lactate ratio significantly, suggesting that the flux in the glycolytic pathway is not altered by an increase in pyk activity.

TI  == new strategy for enhancement of microbial viability in simulated gastric conditions based on display of starch-binding domain on cell surface.
AB  == the c-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (cph) of lactococcus lactis  il1403 fused to the linker region and the starch-binding domain (sbd) of the *-amylase of streptococcus bovis 148 was produced intracellularly in escherichia  coli. the fusion protein (cph-sbd) was able to bind to the cell surface of lactobacillus casei nrrl b-441 and to corn starch. therefore, adhesion of cells to corn starch was mediated by the fusion protein. at a cell density of 10(9) cfu/ml and a starch concentration of 5 mg/ml, cph-sbd-displaying l. casei cells aggregated with corn starch, whereas the free cells of l. casei did not form any  aggregates with corn starch. after incubation in simulated gastric juice (ph 3.0, 1 h), the survival percentages of free cells, amylose-coated free cells, and free cells mixed with corn starch were 0.074%, 7.2%, and 3.1% respectively. when cph-sbd-displaying bacteria aggregated with corn starch, their survival percentage was 8% higher than that of free cells mixed with corn starch. the survival of the amylose-coated cph-sbd-displaying l. casei cells was comparable to that of amylose-coated free cells, whereas the survival percentage of amylose-coated aggregates of cph-sbd-displaying bacteria with corn starch was 28% higher than that of amylose-coated mixture of free cells with corn starch. these  results demonstrate the potential usefulness of the cell-surface display technique for enhancement of the delivery of viable microorganisms to the intestinal tract.

TI  == colonoscopy is mandatory after streptococcus bovis endocarditis: a lesson still not learned. case report.
AB  == background: even though the relationship between certain bacterial infections and neoplastic lesions of the colon is well-recognized, this knowledge has not been sufficiently translated into routine practice yet. case presentation: we describe the case of a 51-year-old man who was admitted to our surgical department due to  rectal bleeding and abdominal pain. preoperative colonoscopy, staging exams and subsequent surgery demonstrated a stenotic adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon, invading the left urinary tract and the homolateral bladder wall, with regional lymph nodes involvement and massive bilobar liver metastases (t4n1m1). after hartmann's rectosigmoidectomy and despite systemic chemotherapy, a rapid progression occurred and the patient survived for only 5 months after diagnosis.  five years before detecting this advanced colonic cancer, the patient underwent aortic valve replacement due to a severe streptococcus bovis endocarditis. subsequent to this infection he never underwent a colonoscopy until overt intestinal symptoms appeared. conclusion: as this case illustrates, in the unusual setting of a streptococcus bovis infection, it is necessary to timely and carefully rule out occult colon cancer and other malignancies during hospitalization and, if a tumor is not found, to schedule endoscopic follow-up. rigorous application of these recommendations in the case described would have likely led to an earlier diagnosis of cancer and maybe saved the patient's life.

TI  == the activity and stability of cell-associated activity of bovicin hc5, a bacteriocin from streptococcus bovis hc5.
AB  == streptococcus bovis hc5 cultures released a broad spectrum lantibiotic, bovicin hc5, into the cell-fee culture supernatant after they reached stationary phase, but most of the antibacterial activity remained cell-associated. cell-associated  bovicin hc5 was more resistant to degradation by pronase e than the cell-free activity. acidic nacl (ph 2.0, 100 mm) did not release all of the cell-associated activity, and cells that were sequentially treated with acidic nacl and pronase e still had antibacterial activity. cell-associated activity retained after acidic  nacl treatment was still able to catalyze potassium efflux from s. bovis jb1, a sensitive strain. these results indicate that cell-associated bovicin hc5 is more active and stable than cell-free bovicin hc5.

AB  == surface-engineered yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae codisplaying rhizopus oryzae glucoamylase and streptococcus bovis alpha-amylase on the cell surface was used for direct production of ethanol from uncooked raw starch. by using 50 g/l cells  during batch fermentation, ethanol concentration could reach 53 g/l in 7 days. during repeated batch fermentation, the production of ethanol could be maintained for seven consecutive cycles. for cells immobilized in loofa sponge, the concentration of ethanol could reach 42 g/l in 3 days in a circulating packed-bed bioreactor. however, the production of ethanol stopped thereafter because of limited contact between cells and starch. the bioreactor could be operated for repeated batch production of ethanol, but ethanol concentration dropped to 55% of its initial value after five cycles because of a decrease in cell mass and cell viability in the bioreactor. adding cells to the bioreactor could partially restore ethanol production to 75% of its initial value.

AB  == there is a need to further our understanding of the role that the equine hindgut  ecosystem plays in digestive processes and diseases. the aim of the present study was to utilise the real-time pcr technique to determine the abundance of candidate cellulolytic (ruminococcus flavefaciens; fibrobacter succinogenes) and  non-cellulolytic (streptococcus bovis) bacteria in lumen contents from the caecum, ventral and dorsal colon, and rectum of healthy horses (n 14). total dna  was extracted from frozen and lyophilised lumen contents, and pcr primers and taqman probes were designed based on 16s rdna sequences for specific detection of candidate bacterial species. overall, in frozen and lyophilised digesta, there were significantly (p f. succinogenes > s. bovis (p < 0.05), while in lyophilised digesta r. flavefaciens was present in significantly (p < 0.05) greater amounts than f. succinogenes and s. bovis. r. flavefaciens and f. succinogenes were abundant at significantly (p < 0.05) greater levels in lyophilised digesta v. frozen digesta, with no difference in s. bovis levels. these data indicate that for these bacteria at least, faeces are a suitable model for studying the bacterial ecosystem within the equine colon. the present study also indicates that the preservation method of digesta affects levels of bacteria detected.

TI  == pcr-rflp assay for species and subspecies differentiation of the streptococcus bovis group based on groesl sequences.
AB  == the sequence diversity of groesl genes among streptococcus bovis group isolates was analysed, including five reference strains and 36 clinical isolates. phylogenetic analysis of the groes and groel sequences showed that the isolates that belonged to the same species or subspecies usually clustered together. the intergenic spacer region between groes and groel was variable in size (67-342 bp) and sequence and appeared to be a unique marker for species or subspecies determination. sequence similarities of the groesl genes among species and subspecies ranged from 84.2 to 99.0 % in groes, and from 88.0 to 99.0 % in groel. based on the sequences determined, a streptococcus bovis group-specific pcr assay was developed, which may provide an alternative means of distinguishing the bovis group from other viridans streptococci. restriction digestion of the amplicon with acli further differentiated the species and subspecies.

TI  == bidirectional cell-surface anchoring function of c-terminal repeat region of peptidoglycan hydrolase of lactococcus lactis il1403.
AB  == with the aim of constructing an efficient protein display system for lactic acid  bacteria (labs), the effect of fusion direction on the cell-surface binding activity of the c-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (cph) of lactococcus lactis il1403 was studied. cph fused to the alpha-amylase (amy) of streptococcus bovis 148 either at its c-terminus (cph-amy) or at its n-terminus (amy-cph) was expressed intracellularly in escherichia coli. this domain was able to direct binding of amy to the surface of l. lactis atcc 19435 in both constructs. however, the number of bound molecules per cell and the specific activity for starch digestion in the case of cph-amy were 3 and 14 times greater  than those in the case of amy-cph, respectively. of the labs tested, l. lactis atcc 19435 showed the highest binding capability for cph-amy, up to 6 x 10(4) molecules per cell, with a dissociation rate constant of 5.00 x 10(-5) s(-1). the binding of cph-amy to the surface of lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc 9649 cells was very stable with a dissociation rate constant of 6.96 x 10(-6) s(-1). the production of cph-amy in the soluble form increased 3-fold as a result of coexpression with a molecular chaperone, trigger factor. the results of this study suggest the usefulness of cph as a bidirectional anchor protein for the production of cell-surface adhesive enzymes in e. coli. furthermore, the importance of the fusion direction of cph in determining cell-surface binding and enzymatic activities was shown.

TI  == [a case of bacterial meningitis due to streptococcus bovis in an infant with normal cerebrospinal fluid findings at the first csf examination].
AB  == streptococcus bovis very occasionally causes rarely sepsis, endocarditis, and meningitis in newborns and the elderly. we report the case of infant meningitis caused by s. bovis despite normal cerebrospinal fluid (csf) findings at the first csf examination. a 77-day-old boy with 21-trisomy and patent foramen ovale and seen for a high fever underwent blood examination and lumbar puncture due to toxic appearance despite a lack of meningeal signs, and was admitted. his csf findings were normal and he was given intravenous ceftriaxone against potential bacteremia. he had systemic seizures with continuous fever for 2 days after admission and a second csf examination. gram-positive coccus grew from his csf at the first examination, and csf cells from the second lumbar puncture increased to 4060/tl (86% neutrophils), so vancomycin was added against potential enterococcal meningitis. s. bovis was finally grown from the first csf, ceftriaxone discontinued, and intravenous ampicillin added. he recovered after 20 days of antibiotic administration. s. bovis becomes a potential pathogen for meningitis in infants, and must be considered as a cause of meningitis despite its very rarity. csf findings at the first lumbar puncture may be normal for meningitis in newborns and infants at the first csf examination, so we must be very careful in  the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis even with normal csf findings, and considered antibiotic treatment against potential bacterial meningitis.

AB  == here, we established a system for displaying heterologous protein to the c terminus of the peptidoglycan-binding domain (ca domain) of acma (a major autolysin from lactococcus lactis). western blot and flow cytometric analyses revealed that the fusion proteins (ca-amya) of the ca domain and alpha-amylase from streptococcus bovis 148 (amya) are efficiently expressed and successfully displayed on the surfaces of l. lactis cells. amya was also displayed on the cell surface while retaining its activity. moreover, with an increase in the number of ca domains, the quantity of ca-amya fusion proteins displayed on the cell surface increased. when three repeats of the ca domain were used as an anchor protein, 82% of alpha-amylase activity was detected on the cells. the raw starch-degrading activity of amya was significantly higher when amya was fused to the c terminus of the ca domain than when it was fused to the n terminus. in addition, ca-amya fusion proteins were successfully displayed on the cell surfaces of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei.

AB  == to investigate the distribution of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inhabiting canine intestines, a total of 374 gram-positive lab and bifidobacteria (bf) isolated from large intestinal contents in 36 dogs were classified and identified by phenotypic and genetic analyses. based on cell morphological sizes, these isolates were divided into seven biotypes containing the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, and streptococcus. the lab and bf isolates were classified into 38 chemotypes based on sds-page protein profile analysis of whole cells. furthermore, partial 16s rdna sequencing analysis demonstrated the presence of 24 bacterial species in the 38 chemotypes from 36 dogs. the identified species consisted of ten species belonging to the genus lactobacillus  (78.8%), seven species to the genus bifidobacterium (6.8%), five species to the genus enterococcus (11.6%), one species of streptococcus bovis (2.0%), and one species of pediococcus acidilactici (0.8%). in particular, the most predominant species in canine intestines were l. reuteri, l. animalis, and l. johnsonii and were found in the high frequency of occurrence of 77.8, 80.6, and 86.1%, respectively. besides these, enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, and streptococcus bovis were also isolated in the present study. the sequences of the isolates also showed high levels of similarity to those of the reference strains registered previously in the ddbj and the similarity was above 97.2%. their partial 16s rrna genes were registered in the ddbj.

TI  == direct production of l-lysine from raw corn starch by corynebacterium glutamicum  secreting streptococcus bovis alpha-amylase using cspb promoter and signal sequence.
AB  == corynebacterium glutamicum is an important microorganism in the industrial production of amino acids. we engineered a strain of c. glutamicum that secretes  alpha-amylase from streptococcus bovis 148 (amya) for the efficient utilization of raw starch. among the promoters and signal sequences tested, those of cspb from c. glutamicum possessed the highest expression level. the fusion gene was introduced into the homoserine dehydrogenase gene locus on the chromosome by homologous recombination. l-lysine fermentation was conducted using c. glutamicum secreting amya in the growth medium containing 50 g/l of raw corn starch as the sole carbon source at various temperatures in the range 30 to 40 degrees c. efficient l-lysine production and raw starch degradation were achieved at 34 and  37 degrees c, respectively. the alpha-amylase activity using raw corn starch was  more than 2.5 times higher than that using glucose as the sole carbon source during l-lysine fermentation. amya expression under the control of cspb promoter  was assumed to be induced when raw starch was used as the sole carbon source. these results indicate that efficient simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of raw corn starch to l-lysine were achieved by c. glutamicum secreting amya using the cspb promoter and signal sequence.

TI  == molecular profiling of lactobacillus, streptococcus, and bifidobacterium species  in feces of active racehorses.
AB  == diversity and compositions of the lactobacillus, streptococcus, and bifidobacterium group in the feces of six healthy, actively racing horses (thoroughbreds) were analyzed by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and real-time pcr with primer sets specific for each group. pcr-dgge analysis of the feces showed that lactobacillus equi, lactobacillus johnsonii, a phylogenetic relative of lactobacillus salivarius, a phylogenetic relative of lactobacillus gastricus, and weissella confusa were predominant in almost all of the feces tested, and streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus was predominant in the streptococcus group. the bifidobacterium group was not detected by single-pcr but atypical species of the  group were found in three of the six thoroughbreds tested by nested-pcr. calculation and estimation of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria revealed that lactic acid bacteria were predominant in the feces and bifidobacteria were minor. these results indicate that the community of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in horse feces are unique because of the presence of specific species for horse feces and a minority of the bifidobacterium group. repeated tests of the feces from the same horse over 3 months showed that the diversity and composition of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the feces was basically stable throughout the test period.

TI  == infective endocarditis associated with spondylodiscitis and frequent secondary epidural abscess.
AB  == background: although many patients with ie complain of joint, muscle, and back pain, infections at these sights are rare. indeed, in patients with back pain and endocarditis, less than 4% actually demonstrate spondylodiscitis. case description: we recently encountered 4 patients with this complication, one each  caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mitis, and enterococcus faecalis, and wondered whether the nature of the infecting organism  determined the development of spondylodiscitis and epidural abscess. in a literature review, 36 patients with endocarditis and spondylodiscitis were identified. only 9 (25%) were caused by streptococcus viridans and the remainder  by staphylococci, enterococci, and other streptococci. usually more than 50% of all cases of ie were caused by streptococcus viridans, although more recent studies would indicate an incidence of about 40%. conclusion: we conclude that spondylodiscitis with epidural abscess is more likely to occur in those patients  with endocarditis who are infected by organisms with pyogenic potential.

TI  == the energy spilling reactions of bacteria and other organisms.
AB  == for many years it was assumed that living organisms always utilized atp in a highly efficient manner, but simple growth studies with bacteria indicated that the efficiency of biomass production was often at least 3-fold lower than the amount that would be predicted from standard biosynthetic pathways. the utilization of energy for maintenance could only explain a small portion of this  discrepancy particularly when the growth rate was high. these ideas and thermodynamic arguments indicated that cells might have another avenue of energy  utilization. this phenomenon has also been called 'uncoupling', 'spillage' and 'overflow metabolism', but 'energy spilling' is probably the most descriptive term. it appears that many bacteria spill energy, and the few that do not can be  killed (large and often rapid decrease in viability), if the growth medium is nitrogen-limited and the energy source is in 'excess'. the lactic acid bacterium, streptococcus bovis, is an ideal bacterium for the study of energy spilling. because it only uses substrate level phosphorylation to generate atp, atp generation can be calculated with a high degree of certainty. it does not store glucose as glycogen, and its cell membrane can be easily accessed. comparative analysis of heat production, membrane voltage, atp production and ohm's law indicated that the energy spilling reaction of s. bovis is mediated by a futile cycle of protons through the cell membrane. less is known about escherichia coli, but in this bacterium energy spilling could be mediated by a futile cycle of potassium or ammonium ions. energy spilling is not restricted to prokaryotes and  appears to occur in yeasts and in higher organisms. in man, energy spilling may be related to cancer, ageing, ischemia and cardiac failure.

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of hindgut bacteria associated with the development of equine laminitis.
AB  == carbohydrate-induced laminitis in horses is characterized by marked changes in the composition of the hindgut microbiota, from a predominantly gram-negative population to one dominated by gram-positive bacteria. the objective of this study was to monitor changes in the relative abundance of selected hindgut bacteria that have previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of equine laminitis using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). caecal cannulae were surgically implanted in five standardbred horses and laminitis induced by oral administration of a bolus dose of oligofructose. caecal fluid and faecal specimens were collected over a 48 h period at 2 to 4 h intervals post-oligofructose administration and subjected to fish using probes specific for nine bacterial groups to determine changes in their relative abundance compared with total bacteria hybridizing to the generic eubmix probe. additionally, hoof biopsies were taken over the course of the experiment at 6 h intervals and evaluated for histopathological changes consistent with laminitis, allowing changes in hindgut microbiota to be correlated with the onset of lesions in the foot. of the microorganisms specifically targeted, streptococci of the streptococcus bovis/equinus complex were the only bacteria that consistently proliferated in both caecal fluid and faeces immediately before the onset of histological signs of laminitis. furthermore, lactobacilli, enterobacteriaceae, allisonella histaminiformans, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, mitsuokella jalaludinii and clostridium difficile did not establish significant populations in the hindgut before the onset of equine laminitis.

TI  == a case of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis caused by streptococcus bovis.
AB  == background: streptococcus bovis is a gram-positive streptococcus present as normal flora in the digestive tracts of herbivores. it is occasionally isolated from the human intestine and may act as a causative organism of infectious endocarditis, urinary infections and meningitis. this report describes a rare case of a patient that underwent surgical treatment for endogenous endophthalmitis caused by s. bovis complicated by bacteremia and suppurative spondylitis. methods: endophthalmitis of the right eye occurred in a 76-year-old  man accompanied by hypopyon and prominent vitreous opacity complicated by suppurative spondylitis. the visual acuity of the right eye consisted of light perception. lensectomy and vitrectomy were performed immediately using a perfusate containing antibiotics. antibiotics were administered by intravenous infusion following surgery. results: s. bovis was detected in the cultures of blood and vitreous fluid collected during surgery. the visual acuity was 20/160 at 11 months after surgery. conclusions: reports of endogenous endophthalmitis in human caused by s. bovis have not been found to date in a search of the medline database. this is the first report of acute endogenous endophthalmitis caused by  s. bovis.

TI  == repeated meningitis as a delayed complication of scoliosis surgery.
AB  == study design: case report. objective: to report a case of very delayed repeated meningitis after surgical treatment of scoliosis. summary of background data: delayed infection after spine surgery is a well-reported phenomenon, presenting usually with local wound symptoms and back pain. the occurrence of meningitis after spinal instrumentation is reported but not common. delayed repeated episodes of meningitis after surgical treatment of scoliosis have never been reported. case report: we report a case of a 44-year-old gentleman, submitted to  surgical treatment of scoliosis years ago, who presented with repeated episodes of meningitis due to the formation of an abnormal communication between an infected cyst in the bone cavity where the rods were located and the intradural space in the lumbar spine. computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the presence of a bone cyst with thickened layering, and surgical exploration revealed the communication between this cystic cavity and the intradural space. after surgical closure of the dural space and cleaning of the cyst, the patient responded well to antibiotic therapy and was free of new episodes of meningitis up to the last follow-up, 1 year after the surgical treatment. clinical diagnosis of delayed postoperative infection in spine surgery may be difficult if no wound signs are present. clinical symptoms vary and may include increased back pain, wound redness, swelling and drainage, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and white blood count, fever, and malaise. conclusions: delayed meningitis can be a late complication of spinal instrumentation for scoliosis. a high index of suspicion is necessary.

TI  == association of tannase-producing staphylococcus lugdunensis with colon cancer and characterization of a novel tannase gene.
AB  == background: the relationship between streptococcus (st.) bovis endocarditis and colon cancer is well known. in st. bovis, the biotype i strain (formerly, st. gallolyticus) produces tannase that degrades tannins. the aim of this study was to investigate the association of tannase-producing bacteria with colon cancer, and to identify the major tannase-producing bacteria and the gene involved. methods: tannase-producing bacteria were isolated in tannic acid-treated selective agar medium from feces and rectal swabs of 357 patients who underwent colon endoscopy from 1999 to 2004. results: tannase-producing bacteria were isolated more frequently from the colon cancer group (24.3%) than from the adenoma or normal groups (14.4%; p < 0.05). s. gallolyticus, staphylococcus (s.)  lugdunensis, lactobacillus (l.) plantarum, and l. pentosus were all identified as tannase-producing bacteria. of these, s. lugdunensis was significantly isolated from the advanced-stage cancer group (22.2%; p < 0.001) more than from the early-stage cancer (8.6%) or adenoma (4.9%) groups. the gene (tana) for tannase in s. lugdunensis was cloned and sequenced. the tana gene was associated with all s. lugdunensis but not with other bacteria by southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction. conclusions: tannase-producing s. lugdunensis is associated with  advanced-stage colon cancer, and the tana gene is a useful marker for the detection of s. lugdunensis.

TI  == improvement in lactic acid production from starch using alpha-amylase-secreting lactococcus lactis cells adapted to maltose or starch.
AB  == to achieve direct and efficient lactic acid production from starch, a genetically modified lactococcus lactis il 1403 secreting alpha-amylase, which was obtained from streptococcus bovis 148, was constructed. using this strain, the fermentation of soluble starch was achieved, although its rate was far from efficient (0.09 g l(-1) h(-1) lactate). high-performance liquid chromatography revealed that maltose accumulated during fermentation, and this was thought to lead to inefficient fermentation. to accelerate maltose consumption, starch fermentation was examined using l. lactis cells adapted to maltose instead of glucose. this led to a decrease in the amount of maltose accumulation in the culture, and, as a result, a more rapid fermentation was accomplished (1.31 g l(-1) h(-1) lactate). maximum volumetric lactate productivity was further increased (1.57 g l(-1) h(-1) lactate) using cells adapted to starch, and a high  yield of lactate (0.89 g of lactate per gram of consumed sugar) of high optical purity (99.2% of l: -lactate) was achieved. in this study, we propose a new approach to lactate production by alpha-amylase-secreting l. lactis that allows efficient fermentation from starch using cells adapted to maltose or starch before fermentation.

AB  == 16s rrna-based stable isotope probing (sip) and nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr)  spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling were used to identify bacteria fermenting  glucose under conditions simulating the human intestine. the tim-2 in vitro model of the human intestine was inoculated with a gi tract microbiota resembling that  of the small intestine, to which subsequently 4, 20 or 40 mm of [u-(13)c]-glucose were added. rna was extracted from lumen samples after 0 (control), 1, 2 and 4 h  and subjected to density-gradient ultracentrifugation. phylogenetic analysis of unlabeled 16s rrna revealed a microbial community dominated by lactic acid bacteria and clostridium perfringens. distinct (13)c-incorporation into bacterial rna was only observed for the 40-mm addition. 16s rrna fingerprinting showed an activity drop of lactobacillus fermentum after glucose addition, while streptococcus bovis and c. perfringens were identified as the most active glucose-fermenters. accordingly, nmr analysis identified lactate, acetate, butyrate and formate as the principal fermentation products, constituting up to 91% of the (13)c-carbon balance. rna-sip combined with metabolic profiling allowed us to detect differential utilization of a general model carbohydrate, indicating that this approach holds great potential to identify bacteria involved in the fermentation of dietary relevant oligo- and polymeric carbohydrates in the human intestine.

AB  == we engineered a corynebacterium glutamicum strain displaying alpha-amylase from streptococcus bovis 148 (amya) on its cell surface to produce amino acids directly from starch. we used pgsa from bacillus subtilis as an anchor protein, and the n-terminus of alpha-amylase was fused to the pgsa. the genes of the fusion protein were integrated into the homoserine dehydrogenase gene locus on the chromosome by homologous recombination. l-lysine fermentation was carried out using c. glutamicum displaying amya in the growth medium containing 50 g/l soluble starch as the sole carbon source. we performed l-lysine fermentation at various temperatures (30-40 degrees c) and phs (6.0-7.0), as the optimal temperatures and phs of amya and c. glutamicum differ significantly. the highest  l-lysine yield was recorded at 30 degrees c and ph 7.0. the amount of soluble starch was reduced to 18.29 g/l, and 6.04 g/l l-lysine was produced in 24 h. the  l-lysine yield obtained using soluble starch as the sole carbon source was higher than that using glucose as the sole carbon source after 24 h when the same amount of substrates was added. the results shown in the current study demonstrate that  c. glutamicum displaying alpha-amylase has a potential to directly convert soluble starch to amino acids.

AB  == alpha-hemolytic streptococci are very difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. in this study, a pyrosequencing method for the identification of streptococcal species based on two variable regions of the 16s rrna gene is described. almost all studied streptococcal species (n = 51) represented by their type strains could be differentiated except for some closely related species of the streptococcus bovis or s. salivarius group. the pyrosequencing results of alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from blood (n = 99) or from the normal pharyngeal microbiota (n = 25) were compared to the results obtained by the vitek 2 with gp card (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). as expected, the results of  the two methods did not completely agree, but 93 (75.0%) of the isolates assigned to the same streptococcal group by both methods and 57 (46.0%) reached consistent results at the species level. however, 10 strains remained unidentified by vitek  2, and 4 isolates could not be assigned to any streptococcal group by pyrosequencing. identification of members of the s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups proved difficult for both methods. furthermore, the pyrosequencing analysis revealed great sequence variation, since only 43 (32.3%) of the 133 isolates analyzed by pyrosequencing had sequences identical to a type strain. the variation was greatest in the pharyngeal isolates, slightly lower in the blood culture isolates, and nonexistent in invasive pneumococcal isolates (n = 17) that all had the s. pneumoniae type strain sequence. the resolution of the results obtained by the two methods is impeded by the lack of a proper gold standard.

TI  == geno- and phenotypic diversity of avian isolates of streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (streptococcus bovis) and associated diagnostic problems.
AB  == recently, strains of streptococcus bovis were reclassified as streptococcus gallolyticus. in the present study we describe for the first time an outbreak of  s. gallolyticus in a broiler flock. mortality during the first week was normal (<1%), with a final total mortality at the end of production reaching 4.3%. specific symptoms were not observed. postmortem pathology demonstrated enlarged and light spleens and livers accompanied by multifocal irregular necroses surrounded by a hemorrhagic zone. in addition, these birds suffered from arthritis and osteomyelitis. strains isolated from liver and spleen lesions showed clonality as demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. compared to strains representing previously derived phylogeny, including the s. bovis-s. equinus complex, the 16s rrna-derived phylogeny of the strains investigated in this study demonstrated a paraphyletic group (s. gallolyticus) well separated from two monophyletic groups: (i) s. equinus-s. bovis plus s. infantarius and (ii) s. alactolyticus plus s. intestinalis. according to information in genbank,  none of the strains included from the two monophyletic groups have been isolated  from birds. further biochemical analyses, including tannase activity, identified  for the first time avian isolates belonging to s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. however, these investigations also demonstrated a clear heterogeneity with pigeon isolates.

TI  == gemella endocarditis: consider the colon.
AB  == gemella species, including gemella morbillorum, are part of the normal flora of the human oropharynx, upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. differentiation of gemella from viridans streptococci in the laboratory may be difficult. although uncommonly pathogenic, they have been implicated in a variety of human infections, most notably infective endocarditis. dental instrumentation  appears to be the usual source of infection. the case is reported of gemella morbillorum native valve endocarditis, which was associated with an underlying colonic carcinoma. an association with colonic neoplasm has been described in three previous cases of endocarditis attributed to gemella. it is well documented that streptococcus bovis endocarditis may occur in the setting of colonic neoplasia. it is suggested that colonic investigation should be considered in patients with gemella endocarditis, in whom no other source is apparent.

TI  == bacterial competition between a bacteriocin-producing and a bacteriocin-negative  strain of streptococcus bovis in batch and continuous culture.
AB  == a bacteriocin-producing streptococcus bovis strain (hc5) outcompeted a sensitive  strain (jb1) before it reached stationary phase (ph 6.4), even though it grew 10% slower and cell-free bovicin hc5 could not yet be detected. the success of bacteriocin-negative s. bovis isolates was enhanced by the presence of another sensitive bacterium (clostridium sticklandii sr). pcr based on repetitive dna sequences indicated that s. bovis hc5 was not simply transferring bacteriocin genes to s. bovis jb1. when the two s. bovis strains were coinoculated into minimal medium, bacteriocin-negative isolates predominated, and this effect could be explained by the longer lag time (0.5 vs. 1.5 h) of s. bovis hc5. if the glucose concentration of the minimal medium was increased from 2 to 7 mg ml(-1),  the effect of lag time was diminished and bacteriocin-producing isolates once again dominated the coculture. when the competition was examined in continuous culture, it became apparent that batch culture inocula were never able to displace a strain that had already reached steady state, even if the inoculum was large. this result indicated that bacterial selection for substrate affinity was  even more important than bacteriocin production.

TI  == [the importance of streptococcus bovis systemic infections].
AB  == streptococcus bovis is relatively common cause of bacteremia and endocarditis, especially in older persons, or in patients that have some kind of chronic disease. these infections are frequently connected with malignant, potentially malignant, or benign colorectal neoplasia. hematogenous dissemination of streptococcus bovis could result with various clinical manifestations, namely purulent meningitis, brain abscess, osteomyelitis, spondylodiscitis, and many different kinds of infections in aids patients are reported. in this report, two  patients hospitalized at the departement of infectious diseases at the general hospital "dr. josip bencevic" in slavonski brod are presented. the first patient  was addmited to the hospital because of fever of unknown origin, and in his blood cultures, streptococcus bovis was isolated. he was an older man, who had undergone prostatectomy due prostatic adenoma several years before. the other patient, previously completely healthy younger man, suffered purulent meningitis  caused by the same microorganism. colon endoscopy was performed in both patients  and it revealed colon polyps. histologically, in both cases, those were benign neoplasia. in croatia, until this report, there have been no other reports about  patients suffering systemic streptococcus bovis infections. at the same time, this report describes streptococcus bovis purulent meningitis in a previously healthy adult, which is also extremely rare in the medical literature. since streptococcus bovis infections are associated with colon carcinoma, it is imperative to perform colonoscopy in each patient suffering infection with this germ, and to consider him as a high risk patient for developing colon cancer.

TI  == streptococcus bovis infection in young infants.
AB  == background: sporadic cases of invasive streptococcus bovis disease have been reported in young infants. however, little is known about the clinical manifestations or the conditions that predispose to s. bovis infection in this population. objective: the objective of this case series and review of the literature was to describe cases of s. bovis infection treated at 2 children's hospitals and compare patients evaluated at our institutions with those reported  in the literature. results: seven infants with s. bovis infection were treated at our institutions; 4 of the patients had s. bovis meningitis and 3 of these also had s. bovis bacteremia. five of the patients had signs of gastrointestinal disturbance at presentation. none of the 7 patients died. twenty-three patients with s. bovis infection reported in the literature had meningitis with concurrent bacteremia (n = 9), bacteremia alone (n = 9), meningitis alone (n = 4), and pneumonia with overwhelming sepsis (n = 1). six (26%) of the patients reported in the literature died as a consequence of s. bovis infection. the difference in median age between our patients (14 days; range, 1-43 days) and those reported in the literature (3 days; range, 1-60 days) was not statistically significant (p =  0.49). abdominal distention was more commonly noted among patients in our series  (71%) than among patients reported in the literature (10%; odds ratio = 21.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.7-319.0). conclusions: bacteremia and meningitis were the most common manifestations. gastrointestinal disturbance was common among patients in our series. the mortality rate from s. bovis infection appears to be  lower than suggested by previous reports.

AB  == in patients with surgical indications for both cardiac surgery and a malignant neoplasm, cardiac surgery should generally be performed first; however, in some cases simultaneous surgery is recommended. we report a case of infectious endocarditis of the mitral valve caused by streptococcus bovis with rectal cancer. blood cultures showed a rise in coagulase-negative s. bovis, and the source of infection was thought to be the rectal cancer. the patient presented with cerebral infarction prior to surgery, and the possibility of recurrence of an infarction was predicted. the tumor of the rectum was hemorrhagic, so to avoid hemorrhagic complications due to perioperative heparinization and anticoagulant therapy and to remove the source of infection, mitral valve replacement and a hartmann's operation were performed simultaneously. the postoperative course was  uneventful.

TI  == the effect of calcium and magnesium on the activity of bovicin hc5 and nisin.
AB  == some gram-positive bacteria produce small peptides (bacteriocins) that have antimicrobial activity, but many bacteria can become bacteriocin resistant. bovicin hc5, a lantibiotic produced by streptococcus bovis hc5, has the ability to inhibit nisin-resistant bacteria. because nisin resistance has in many cases been correlated with an alteration of lipoteichoic acids or the polar head groups of membrane phospholipids, we decided to examine the effect of divalent cations on nisin and bovicin hc5 activity. both bacteriocins catalyzed potassium efflux from s. bovis jb1, a non-bacteriocin-producing strain. the addition of large amounts (100 mm) of calcium or magnesium increased the ability of s. bovis jb1 to bind congo red (an anionic dye) and counteracted bacteriocin-mediated potassium loss. calcium was more effective than magnesium in decreasing nisin activity, but the reverse was observed with bovicin hc5. nisin-resistant s. bovis jb1 cells bound three times as much congo red as nisin-sensitive cells, and this result is  consistent with the idea that changes in cell surface charge can be a mechanism of bacteriocin resistance. the nisin-resistant cells were less susceptible to bovicin hc5, but bovicin hc5 still caused a 50% depletion of intracellular potassium. these results indicate that nisin and bovicin hc5 react differently with the cell surfaces of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == streptococcal pd peritonitis--a 10-year review of one centre's experience.
AB  == background: detailed descriptive studies focusing on streptococcal peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis are lacking. most of the current information is available through isolated case reports. methods: we conducted a retrospective analysis of our peritoneal dialysis (pd) peritonitis database over the last decade to study the clinical profile and treatment outcomes of streptococcal peritonitis. results: a total of 68 patients (age: 57.12 +/- 16.6 years; male: 58.7%) with 104 episodes of streptococcal peritonitis (11.7% of total peritonitis) were identified. of the patients, 18 (26.4%) were considered immunocompromised [failed renal transplant, systemic lupus erythematosus (sle)] and 28 (41.1%) had diabetes. streptococcus viridans accounted for the majority (94 episodes: 90.3%) of the streptococcal peritonitis. one patient developed s. viridans peritonitis after dental cleaning without antibiotic prophylaxis. two (1.9%) infections with s. agalactiae and s. bovis each and seven (6.7%) with non-haemolytic streptococcus were noted. three patients had hospital-acquired infection. twenty-six (25%) episodes needed 8 +/- 5.9 days of hospitalization. concurrent infection with two organisms accounted for 17 (16.3%) episodes. cefazolin (71) and vancomycin (29) were the primary antibiotics used for the treatment. five episodes needed two antibiotics and one patient required antifungal treatment. a third of the patients (33.3%) had peritonitis that resolved slowly, although the majority of those (94%) did ultimately resolve with antibiotics alone. five (4.8%) episodes required removal of the pd catheter. three of them were associated with dual infections (one each with yeast, stenotrophomonas and enterococcus). relapse occurred in eight (7.6%) episodes, and 11 (10.5%) recurred over the period from 4 weeks to 6 months after treatment. conclusions: streptococci remain a significant cause of pd peritonitis. viridans  strep is the primary subtype responsible. isolated infections with these organisms are associated with slower response, good outcome and higher rates of recurrence.

TI  == in vitro bacterial growth and in vivo ruminal microbiota populations associated with bloat in steers grazing wheat forage.
AB  == the role of ruminal bacteria in the frothy bloat complex common to cattle grazing winter wheat has not been previously determined. two experiments, one in vitro and another in vivo, were designed to elucidate the effects of fresh wheat forage on bacterial growth, biofilm complexes, rumen fermentation end products, rumen bacterial diversity, and bloat potential. in exp. 1, 6 strains of ruminal bacteria (streptococcus bovis strain 26, prevotella ruminicola strain 23, eubacterium ruminantium b1c23, ruminococcus albus sy3, fibrobacter succinogenes ssp. s85, and ruminococcus flavefaciens c94) were used in vitro to determine the  effect of soluble plant protein from winter wheat forage on specific bacterial growth rate, biofilm complexes, vfa, and ruminal h2 and ch4 in mono or coculture  with methanobrevibacter smithii. the specific growth rate in plant protein medium containing soluble plant protein (3.27% nitrogen) was measured during a 24-h incubation at 39 degrees c in hungate tubes under a co2 gas phase. a monoculture  of m. smithii was grown similarly, except under h2:co2 (1:1), in a basal methanogen growth medium supplemented likewise with soluble plant protein. in exp. 2, 6 ruminally cannulated steers grazing wheat forage were used to evaluate  the influence of bloat on the production of biofilm complexes, ruminal microbial  biodiversity patterns, and ruminal fluid protein fractions. in exp. 1, cultures of r. albus (p < 0.01) and r. flavefaciens (p < 0.05) produced the most h2 among  strains and resulted in greater (p < 0.01) ch4 production when cocultured with m. smithii than other coculture combinations. cultures of s. bovis and e. ruminantium + m. smithii produced the most biofilm mass among strains. in exp. 2, when diets changed from bermudagrass hay to wheat forage, biofilm production increased (p < 0.01). biofilm production, concentrations of whole ruminal content (p < 0.01), and cheesecloth filtrate protein fractions (p < 0.05) in the ruminal  fluid were greater on d 50 for bloated than for nonbloated steers when grazing wheat forage. the molecular analysis of the 16s rdna showed that 2 different ruminal microbiota populations developed between bloated and nonbloated animals grazing wheat forage. bloat in cattle grazing wheat pastures may be caused by increased production of biofilm, resulting from a diet-influenced switch in the rumen bacterial population.

AB  == evidence suggests a trend for a higher fecal carriage rate of streptococcus bovis in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). this study defines the fecal carriage rate of s. bovis among children with ibd compared to controls. subjects with ibd were prospectively enrolled from the patient population of a pediatric gastroenterology practice. stool samples from ibd patients as well as controls were analyzed within 24 hr for the presence of s. bovis. the study enrolled 47 patients with ibd and 34 controls. among the 47 ibd patients, 3 had a positive stool culture for s. bovis (6%) and 1 had an equivocal result between s. bovis and s. salivarius. including this equivocal result, 8.5% of ibd patients were s. bovis carriers. among the 34 controls, 3 (9%) were found to be fecal carriers of s. bovis. assuming that the equivocal stool was indeed s. bovis, these groups are not statistically different as determined by fisher's exact test (p=0.6). we conclude that the fecal carriage rate of s. bovis is not increased among pediatric patients with ibd compared with controls.

TI  == profiling the humoral immune response in colon cancer patients: diagnostic antigens from streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the human bowel contains a large and dynamic bacterial population that is not only essential for intestinal health, but also critical for the development of diseases such as cancer. in this respect, the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus bovis has been associated with colon cancer for many years. to investigate the clinical importance of this association, an immunocapture mass spectrometry assay was developed that can generate infection-related protein profiles. the composition of these profiles is governed by the capture of specific antigens by serum antibodies from colon cancer patients. this assay showed that s. bovis antigen profiles could distinguish 11 out of 12 colon cancer patients from 8 control subjects, whereas antigen profiles derived from the gut bacterium escherichia coli were not diagnostic for colon cancer. moreover, s. bovis antigen profiles were also detected in polyp patients, indicating that infection with this bacterium does occur early during carcinogenesis. highly accurate tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify one of the diagnostic antigens as a surface-exposed heparin-binding protein, which might be involved in attachment of s. bovis to tumor cells. together, these findings corroborate the hypothesis that colonic lesions provide a specific niche for s. bovis, resulting  in tumor-associated "silent" infections. these infections, however, only become apparent in colon cancer patients with a compromised immune system (bacteremia) or coincidental cardiac valve lesions (endocarditis). this makes profiling of the humoral immune response against "silent" s. bovis infections a promising diagnostic tool for the early detection of human colon cancer, which is crucial for the effective treatment of this disease.

AB  == the primary objective of this study was to determine management practices concerning mastitis in brandenburg, germany, the prevalence of mastitis pathogens in dairy cows, and their resistance to selected antimicrobial agents. a further objective was to study the potential effect of parity and stage of lactation on the resistance of staphylococcus aureus isolates against ampicillin. milk samples for microbiological culture were collected from 4 groups of clinically healthy cows (first lactation, >1 lactation, >50 d in milk, and >250 d in milk; 8 cows/group) in 80 dairy herds. resistance of gram-positive pathogens against 6 antimicrobial agents was tested using the broth microdilution method. mastitis pathogens were isolated from 26.4% of the milk samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns, 9.1% of quarters) and corynebacterium bovis (7.3%) were the pathogens most frequently isolated. among the major pathogens, staph. aureus (5.7%) and streptococcus uberis (1.0%) had the highest prevalence. streptococcus  agalactiae was isolated in samples from 29% of the herds. although the prevalence of most pathogens was higher in older cows, the prevalence of cns was higher in primiparous cows. results of the mastitis control questionnaire showed that cows  with clinical mastitis were transferred to a sick cow pen in 70% of the herds. cephalosporins were the drug of first choice for treatment of clinical mastitis cases followed by fixed combinations of antimicrobial agents, beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins, and penicillin. most farmers treated cows 3 to 4 times per case. cloxacillin, alone or in combination, and penicillin were most often used for dry-cow therapy. antimicrobial resistance of the pathogens was within the range of other reports. resistance of staph. aureus to ampicillin  increased significantly during the first lactation. further research is required  to determine the factors that lead to the selection of staph. aureus strains that are resistant to ampicillin during the first lactation.

AB  == background/aims: the aetiology of infective endocarditis (ie) can be determined directly from surgically removed valve tissue using broad-range bacterial rdna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) followed by sequencing. we sought to assess the value of this methodology in a routine clinical setting. methods: broad-range pcr with primers targeting conserved bacterial rdna sequences was applied to directly analyse valve samples from 56 patients operated on for diagnosed or suspected ie. identification of the aetiological agent was performed by partial dna sequencing  of the 16s and 23s rdna genes. results: the final diagnosis was definite ie in 36 patients and possible ie in 2 patients, while the diagnosis of ie was rejected in 18 patients. pcr analysis from removed valve tissue was positive in 25 patients with ie. molecular identification was consistent with the blood culture finding in 20 of these patients. the pcr approach was the only method to yield the aetiological diagnosis in additional 4 patients (2 staphylococcus species, 1 streptococcus bovis, 1 bartonella quintana), all of whom had received antimicrobials before blood cultures were taken. the mean duration of preoperative antimicrobial treatment for the patients with pcr-positive valves was 19.6 (range 1-58) days. conclusions: bacterial dna may persist during treatment in infected valves for long periods. the pcr method is especially useful when the causative agent of ie is fastidious or when the specimen is taken during antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == isolation and identification of mixed linked beta -glucan degrading bacteria in the intestine of broiler chickens and partial characterization of respective 1,3-1,4-beta -glucanase activities.
AB  == media with 1,3-1,4-beta -glucans as selective markers were used for isolation of  non-starch-polysaccharide (nsp) degrading bacteria from the intestinal tract of broiler chicken. formerly unknown 1,3-1,4-beta endoglucanase activities in various bacterial species were identified in this study. e. faecium , streptococcus , bacteroides and clostridium strains seem to be responsible for degradation of mixed linked beta -glucans in the small intestine and in the hind  gut of chickens. strict anaerobic bacteria (bacteroides ovatus , b. uniformis , presumably b. capillosus and clostridium perfringens ) as well as an unidentified bacterium with 98% 16s rdna homology to an uncultered chicken cecum bacterium were isolated. additionally, streptococcus bovis with 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity was also detected. different 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity profiles were observed in sds/page zymograms.

TI  == evolution of surveillance methods for detection of bacterial contamination of platelets in a university hospital, 1991 through 2004.
AB  == background: platelet (plt) bacterial contamination (pbc) is the most common transfusion-associated infection. it is important to understand the impact of interventions addressing this problem. study design and methods: pbc was studied  by prospective (active) and transfusion-reaction triggered (passive) surveillance from july 1991 to december 2004. active surveillance, utilized for 10 years, included bacterial culture of all or 4- and 5-day-old plts at issue and intermittent use of gram stain, ph measurements, and early (24-hr) culture of single-donor plateletpheresis (sdp) units. results: active surveillance detected  38 instances of pbc, 7 in sdp units (1:2213) and 31 in random-donor plt units (1:2090 units, p = 0.89; or 1:418 pools of 5 units, p < 0.001). contaminants were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; n = 27), staphylococcus aureus (4), bacillus cereus (1), serratia marcescens (2), streptococci (2 s. bovis, 1 s. uberis), and cons with viridans group streptococcus (1). only one instance of contamination, caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, was detected by passive surveillance, with fatal outcome. colony counts of contaminants ranged from 0.5 x 10(2) to 4 x 10(11) colony-forming units per ml at time of issue. pbc was interdicted before transfusion in 6 cases through gram stain screening. transfusion reactions occurred in 13 of 32 recipients (41%), with 9 severe reactions (28%) and 3 deaths (9%). ph testing failed to detect 5 contaminated units and resulted in discard of nearly 2 percent of units, whereas culture of sdp units at 24 hours failed to identify a contaminated unit. conclusion: improved active surveillance methods for detecting pbc are needed to improve the  safety of plt transfusions.

AB  == we report a 37-year-old african-american man with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) diagnosed in may 2001 when he presented with biopsy-proven nephritis. he had been treated intermittently from may 2001 to november 2004 with intravenously (i.v.) administered cyclophosphamide and high doses of prednisone due to unrelenting proteinuria. in november 2004, he was admitted to the hospital because of deterioration of renal function and massive proteinuria (21 g dl(-1) 24 h(-1)) and treated with pulses of methylprednisolone and two courses of i.v. administered cyclophosphamide. his hospital course was complicated by cellulitis  and bacteremia with pseudomonas spp. and streptococcus bovis. he was discharged on prednisone 60 mg daily, ciprofloxacin, augmentin, and hemodialysis. he was readmitted a week later with new onset of seizure activity, slurred speech, and left-sided hemiparesis. magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed multiple ringlike enhancing foci in the frontal and occipital lobes. brain biopsy was performed, and gram stain and initial cultures were negative. empiric tobramycin, cefepime, and metronidazole were administered. diagnosis was delayed for several  months, but culture eventually grew nocardia asteroides. trimethoprim-sulfomethoxazole and linezolid therapy was begun. this was followed  by slow, but steady, clinical improvement. risk factors, diagnostic clues, and treatment are reviewed.

TI  == changes in equine hindgut bacterial populations during oligofructose-induced laminitis.
AB  == in the horse, carbohydrate overload is thought to play an integral role in the onset of laminitis by drastically altering the profile of bacterial populations in the hindgut. the objectives of this study were to develop and validate microbial ecology methods to monitor changes in bacterial populations throughout  the course of experimentally induced laminitis and to identify the predominant oligofructose-utilizing organisms. laminitis was induced in five horses by administration of oligofructose. faecal specimens were collected at 8 h intervals from 72 h before to 72 h after the administration of oligofructose. hindgut microbiota able to utilize oligofructose were enumerated throughout the course of the experiment using habitat-simulating medium. isolates were collected and representatives identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the majority of these isolates collected belonged to the genus streptococcus, 91% of which were identified as being most closely related to streptococcus infantarius ssp. coli.  furthermore, s. infantarius ssp. coli was the predominant oligofructose-utilizing organism isolated before the onset of lameness. fluorescence in situ hybridization probes developed to specifically target the isolated streptococcus  spp. demonstrated marked population increases between 8 and 16 h post oligofructose administration. this was followed by a rapid population decline which corresponded with a sharp decline in faecal ph and subsequently lameness at 24-32 h post oligofructose administration. this research suggests that streptococci within the streptococcus bovis/equinus complex may be involved in the series of events which precede the onset of laminitis in the horse.

TI  == artisanal and experimental pecorino siciliano cheese: microbial dynamics during manufacture assessed by culturing and pcr-dgge analyses.
AB  == traditional artisanal pecorino siciliano (ps) cheeses, and two experimental ps cheeses were manufactured using either raw or pasteurised ewes' milk with the addition of starter cultures. the bacterial diversity and dynamics of the different cheese types were evaluated both by culturing and characterisation of isolates, and a culture-independent approach based on the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. following cultivation, artisanal and experimental cheese types showed similar microbial counts, and isolates belonging to lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis and leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified by phenotypic characterisation and comparison of the restriction  fragment length polymorphism (rflp) of the 16s rrna gene to that of reference species. the culture-independent fingerprinting technique pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of v6 to v8 regions of the 16s rrna gene of samples taken during artisanal ps cheese manufacture, from raw milk to the ripened cheese, indicated relevant shifts in the microbial community structure. the dominance of streptococcus bovis and lactococcus lactis species in the traditional artisanal ps was revealed by 16s rrna gene sequencing. comparison of  dgge profiles of samples from milk to ripened cheese, derived from artisanal procedure and the two experimental ps cheeses during production showed similar trends with the presence of intense bands in common. nevertheless, the profiles of several artisanal cheeses from different farms appeared more diverse, and these additional species are probably responsible for the generally superior flavour and aroma development of traditional ps cheese.

TI  == the association of streptococcus bovis bacteremia and gastrointestinal diseases:  a retrospective analysis.
AB  == there is a well-established association between streptococcus bovis bacteremia (sbb) and colorectal cancer. however, sbb is also frequently associated with chronic liver disease and has been described with other gastrointestinal disorders. the aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of gastrointestinal disease in patients with sbb. retrospective analysis of the microbiology database at jackson memorial medical center, miami, florida, between 1992 and 2002, was performed. patients' clinical records were reviewed, with special focus on underlying gastrointestinal disease or other major comorbidities. thirty-eight patients (83%) were adults and eight (17%) were pediatric patients. nineteen patients presented with gastrointestinal disorders associated with sbb (41%). nine adult patients (19%) had end-stage liver disease  (five female). six patients had alcohol-induced liver disease (one with concomitant chronic hepatitis c), with the remaining three cases related to autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. colonic neoplasms (adenocarcinoma in 3 and adenomatous polyps in 3) were found in 6 of 10 adult patients in whom colonoscopic evaluation was performed. seven adult patients had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) (18%). mortality in the patients with aids and sbb was high (71%). no significant association with gastrointestinal diseases was found in the pediatric population. bacteremia due to s. bovis in adults is frequently associated with hepatic dysfunction (1:4), colonic neoplasms (1:6), and aids (1:6). this association was  valid for our adult population only. sbb is an early clue to the likely presence  of these serious underlying conditions and warrants rigorous investigation when recognized.

TI  == assessment of biases associated with profiling simple, model communities using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism-based analyses.
AB  == community profiles based on terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analyses of amplified ribosomal rna genes are used to monitor changes in microbial community structure and are sometimes employed for semi-quantitative estimates of species richness and abundance in environmental samples. to assess the accuracy of t-rflp community profiles representing the relative abundance of  bacteria in a sample, five species of ruminal bacteria were used to construct simple "communities". template dna for pcr amplification was generated either by  mixing equal quantities of genomic dna from pure cultures or by mixing equal numbers of cells prior to dna extraction. pairwise mixtures of fibrobacter succinogenes s85 with ruminococcus albus 8, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49 and streptococcus bovis jb1 were created and a 5-member community was constructed. with genomic dna mixes, relative abundance calculations based on t-rflp patterns did not reflect input ratios. these discrepancies could not be accounted for by differences in genome size and rrna operon copy number. in cell mixing experiments, easily lysed cells were overrepresented. to determine if a numerical correction factor could be used to compensate for observed discrepancies, we attempted to quantify biases attributed to dna extraction and pcr amplification. biases attributable to these factors led to deviations from expected pcr product ratios by 6% to 38%. we found that interactions were so complex that a suitable factor could not be derived. the unsystematic dependence of t-rflp peak ratios on variability of dna extraction and pcr amplification prevents accurate quantification of the relative abundance  of microorganisms designed to represent simplified natural populations.

TI  == presence of nad+-specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ccpa-dependent transcription of its gene in the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis.
AB  == to know the role of nadp+-specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapn) in streptococcus bovis, the molecular properties and transcriptional control of the gene encoding gapn (gapn) were examined. the gapn in s. bovis was  deduced to consist of 476 amino acids with a molecular mass of 51.1 kda. the gapn gene was transcribed in a monocistronic fashion. gapn synthesis appeared to be regulated at the transcriptional level in response to changes in growth conditions. in a mutant that lacks the ccpa gene encoding catabolite control protein a (ccpa), the gapn-mrna level was lower than in the parent strain. a binding site of ccpa was found in the upper region of gapn. these results suggest that transcription of gapn is regulated through ccpa. overexpression of gapn in s. bovis did not affect the growth rate or formate-to-lactate ratio, suggesting that the flux in the glycolytic pathway is unlikely to be altered by gapn activity. streptococcus bovis gapn was nadp+ dependent, but not phosphate dependent. in addition, s. bovis did not have other nadph-producing systems such  as the hexose monophosphate pathway and nadph:nad+ oxidoreductase. therefore, gapn may play an important role in nadph production in s. bovis.

TI  == production of l-lactic acid from fresh cassava roots slurried with tofu liquid waste by streptococcus bovis.
AB  == to reduce the production cost of biodegradable plastics, the fermentation performance of l-lactic acid for a new fermentation medium, fresh cassava roots (fcrs) as a substrate slurried with tofu liquid waste (tlw) as basal medium, was  investigated by batch fermentation of streptococcus bovis. the fermentation properties of the three substrates, namely, fcr, tapioca (cassava starch) and glucose, which were independently mixed with tlw, were compared with those independently mixed with the standard basal medium, trypto-soya broth (tsb). experiments were conducted at various sugar concentrations of the substrates with caco(3) as a neutralizer. the maximum l-lactic acid concentrations (c(la)) obtained using the three substrates in tlw were about 75% of those obtained using tsb caused by less nutrients in the tlw. the l-lactic acid productivities (p(la)) and the specific growth rates of s. bovis (mu) in tlw were about 1/4 to 1/3 and 1/5 to 1/4 of those in tsb, respectively. the maximum c(la), p(la) and mu were obtained at 10% w/w sugar concentration. total yields (eta) were nearly constant  up to 10% w/w sugar concentration for tsb and tlw, that is, 80% to 85% and 50% to 60%, respectively. but their total yields decreased in more than 10% w/w sugar concentration in both basal media, because of substrate inhibition. the fermentation properties (c(la), p(la), mu, and eta) were found to be in the order of: fcr > tapioca > glucose for all concentrations of the three substrates. the fermentation properties for fcr and tapioca were higher than those for glucose, in tlw or tsb, because s. bovis in a medium containing starch (fcr and tapioca) has more amylase activity than in a medium containing glucose. the nutrients in fcr with poor nutrient basal medium (tlw) more strongly affected the fermentation properties than those in fcr with rich nutrient basal medium (tsb). the proposed  fermentation medium of fcr slurried with tlw is worth studying in order to reduce production cost of biodegradable plastics.

TI  == factors affecting the activity of bovicin hc5, a bacteriocin from streptococcus bovis hc5: release, stability and binding to target bacteria.
AB  == aims: to determine the factors affecting the release, stability and binding of bovicin hc5 to sensitive bacteria. methods and results: stationary phase streptococcus bovis hc5 cultures had little cell-free bovicin hc5 activity until  the final ph was <5.0, and even more bacteriocin was released by treatment with acidic nacl (ph 2.0, 100 mmol l(-1)). cultures grown with tween 80 had more cell-free bovicin hc5 than untreated controls, but this nonionic detergent enhanced activity rather than release. bovicin hc5 binding to s. bovis jb1 (a susceptible strain) was greater at ph values <6.0. bovicin hc5 bound other sensitive gram-positive bacteria, but not gram-negative species. cultures retained most of their activity for 35 days, but only if the final ph was <5.6. if the final ph was >5.6, peptidases destroyed much of the activity. conclusions: bovicin hc5 remains cell associated until the culture ph is <5.0, but it can be easily dissociated from the cell surface by acidic nacl. it is highly stable in acidic environments and only binds sensitive bacteria at ph values <6.0. significance and impact of the study: streptococcus bovis hc5 does not have generally regarded as safe status. however, bovicin hc5 has a broad spectrum of activity and sensitive bacteria do not become resistant. based on these results,  bovicin hc5 may be a useful bacteriocin model.

TI  == display of alpha-amylase on the surface of lactobacillus casei cells by use of the pgsa anchor protein, and production of lactic acid from starch.
AB  == we developed a new cell surface engineering system based on the pgsa anchor protein from bacillus subtilis. in this system, the n terminus of the target protein was fused to the pgsa protein and the resulting fusion protein was expressed on the cell surface. using this new system, we constructed a novel starch-degrading strain of lactobacillus casei by genetically displaying alpha-amylase from the streptococcus bovis strain 148 with a flag peptide tag (amyaf). localization of the pgsa-amya-flag fusion protein on the cell surface was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis. the  lactic acid bacteria which displayed amyaf showed significantly elevated hydrolytic activity toward soluble starch. by fermentation using amyaf-displaying l. casei cells, 50 g/liter of soluble starch was reduced to 13.7 g/liter, and 21.8 g/liter of lactic acid was produced within about 24 h. the yield in terms of grams of lactic acid produced per gram of carbohydrate utilized was 0.60 g per g  of carbohydrate consumed at 24 h. since amya was immobilized on the cells, cells  were recovered after fermentation and used repeatedly. during repeated utilization of cells, the lactic acid yield was improved to 0.81 g per g of carbohydrate consumed at 72 h. these results indicate that efficient simultaneous saccharification and fermentation from soluble starch to lactic acid were carried out by recombinant l. casei cells with cell surface display of amya.

TI  == abomasal bacteria produce an inhibitor of gastrin secretion in vitro.
AB  == previously, proliferating microflora transferred with abomasal nematodes, were suspected to be the source of the gastrin inhibitor in some parasite excretory/secretory products. aerobic cultures in hbss of abomasal fluid from uninfected sheep became inhibitory during the static growth phase, unless antibiotics were present. basal gastrin secretion was reduced by up to 90%. rumen fluid and incubates and medium in which streptococcus bovis and ovine rumen actinomycete spp. had been grown also contained the inhibitor. unlike abomasal cultures, rumen fluid and incubates also reduced the measurement of gastrin standards. rumen incubates were less potent after exposure to ph 2-3, suggesting  that inactivation normally occurs in the unparasitised abomasum. contaminating bacteria which generate the gastrin inhibitor in parasite es products are probably rumen organisms which survive in the abomasum and proliferate during subsequent incubation. significantly, rumen bacteria have been shown to be capable of affecting the secretory activity of the gastric mucosa.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

TI  == [update on infectious endocarditis].
AB  == although one of the oldest known cardiac disease, infectious endocarditis (ie) remains a subject of constant change from epidemiological, diagnostic and therapeutic points of view. in the epidemiological field, the main feature is the increasing incidence of ie due to streptococcus bovis. representing a quarter of  cases in france, this type of ie is particularly frequent in the elderly and underlying colonic disease should be investigated. in the diagnostic field, the progress of methods of microbiological identification has been considerable, especially in molecular (pcr) and histological diagnosis which are particularly useful in ie with negative blood cultures. from the prognostic point of view, the role of echocardiography has recently been emphasised not only for diagnosis but  also for prognosis and for predicting the embolic risk. the longest vegetations (>10 or 15 mm) are associated with a greater risk not only of embolism but also in terms of prognosis. the recent recommendations of the french society of cardiology recall the main surgical indications in ie and include a new indication of echocardiography.

AB  == streptococcus bovis is being recognised increasingly as a cause of infective endocarditis, and has also been associated with underlying gastrointestinal malignancy. this study evaluated the molecular epidemiology of s. bovis isolates  responsible for endocarditis or bacteraemia in italian patients between january 1990 and august 2003. s. bovis isolates were classified on the basis of their biochemical profiles, antimicrobial susceptibilities and genotypes. of 25 isolates studied, 20 were s. bovis i and five were s. bovis ii. seven biochemical profiles were identified. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis identified 22 profiles that differed by at least two dna fragments and showed a similarity of < 87%. most pfge patterns represented single isolates that differed in antimicrobial susceptibility, but three pfge types were observed, with identical profiles and antibiotypes, in isolates from two different patients. s.  bovis i and ii isolates grouped into two distinct genetic clusters (i and ii) with a similarity coefficient of 38%. two sub-clusters (ia and ib), with a similarity coefficient of 47%, included 17 s. bovis i isolates with similar biochemical profiles (15 with biotype a, and two with biotype b), but different resistance phenotypes. based on the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity of the isolates, it is postulated that the increase in s. bovis endocarditis in this geographical area might have been caused by the selection of sporadic endemic clones from the endogenous intestinal flora.

TI  == [study on treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus].
AB  == objective: to study the treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculo peritoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. methods: for all of the patients suspected to have cerebrospinal fluid (csf) infections, the first step of treatment was removal of the "infected" shunts, then a ventricular drainage was placed in frontal horn of the ventricle, and at the same time csf was obtained from the ventricle for bacterial culture and tests of bacterial sensitivities to  antibiotics. after the shunt removal and before the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, 25-50 mg of vancomycin was administered intraventricularly daily. as soon as the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, antibiotics should be adjusted according to the sensitivity test result. by the time of the infections being controlled, appropriate treatments including reshunting would finally be given for hydrocephalus if necessary. results: among 11 patients, 9 were infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci or staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, one of them with concomitant infection of aerobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacteriaceae aerogenesis, 1 patient with streptococci, and another one with mycobacterium stercoris bovis. the tests of drug sensitivity showed that cocci in infection of 9 patients were all sensitive  to vancomycin, but only 1 of them sensitive to gentamycin. there were other sensitive antibiotics for streptococcus in 1 case and for bacillus in 2 patients. practically vancomycin was effective for 8 of 11 patients, including one case of  streptococcal infection. the duration for anti-infection treatment was in a range of 16-36 days. finally, all of 11 patients survived from the shunt ventriculitis, and 9 of them had significant improvement in their neurological functions. conclusion: (1)intraventricular administration of proper antibiotics is a reliable and effective way to treat ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. (2)vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for ventriculitis, but other kind(s) of some antibiotics are necessary in a few patients in addition to or instead of vancomycin. (3)the effect of systemic use of antibiotics could not be defined in this series of patients, but this may be used as an adjunct in the practice. (4)there are many problems related to diagnosis and treatment of shunt ventriculitis that should be studied more extensively and deeply.

TI  == display of active enzymes on the cell surface of escherichia coli using pgsa anchor protein and their application to bioconversion.
AB  == we have developed a novel escherichia coli cell surface display system by employing pgsa as an anchoring motif. in our display system, c-terminal fusion to pgsa anchor protein from bacillus subtilis was used. the enzymes selected for display were alpha-amylase (amya) from streptococcus bovis 148 and lipase b (calb) from candida antarctica. the molecular mass values of amya and calb are approximately 77 and 34 kda, respectively. the enzymes were displayed on the surface as a fusion protein with a flag peptide tag at the c terminus. both the pgsa-amya-flag and pgsa-calb-flag fusion proteins were shown to be displayed by immunofluorescence labeling using anti-flag antibody. the displayed enzymes were  active forms, and amya and calb activities reached 990 u/g (dry cell weight) and  4.6 u/g (dry cell weight), respectively. amya-displaying e. coli cells grew utilizing cornstarch as the sole carbon source, while calb-displaying e. coli cells catalyzed enantioselective transesterification, indicating that they are effective whole-cell biocatalysts. since a target enzyme with a size of 77 kda and an industrially useful lipase have been successfully displayed on the cell surface of e. coli for the first time, pgsa protein is probably a useful anchoring motif to display various enzymes.

TI  == viridans group streptococci: an underestimated cause of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites.
AB  == objectives: the objective of the study was to examine the characteristics of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) caused by streptococci, in particular viridans group streptococci (vgs), and to investigate a potential association between the long-term administration of norfloxacin and high-level resistance to  fluoroquinolones in these organisms. methods: we reviewed 84 episodes of sbp and  bacterascites caused by streptococci that occurred in 75 patients over a 6-year period. isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility by the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations. results: of the 84 isolates, 46 (54.8%) were associated with sbp, 12 (14.3%) were associated with symptomatic bacterascites, and 26 (31%) were associated with asymptomatic bacterascites. vgs  were responsible for 39 of the 58 episodes of sbp and symptomatic bacterascites,  largely preceding group b streptococci (n=7), streptococcus pneumoniae (n=6) and  streptococcus bovis (n=5). most of the episodes were community acquired. an extraperitoneal site of infection was found in three patients only. positive blood cultures were less frequent in patients with vgs infection than in those with sbp caused by other streptococci (12.8 versus 52.6%, p<0.001). the rates of  susceptibility to penicillin, amoxicillin and cefotaxime were 84.5, 87.9 and 91.4%, respectively. all isolates, including those from patients receiving norfloxacin, were susceptible to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. conclusions: vgs  are an underestimated cause of sbp in patients with cirrhosis. most isolates are  susceptible to beta-lactam agents and new fluoroquinolones.

TI  == active infectious endocarditis: postoperative outcome.
AB  == objective: many changes have occurred in the natural history and the management of active infectious endocarditis (aie) in recent years. therefore, the records of patients admitted in a tertiary care specialized hospital presenting with the  duke criteria were reviewed. methods: adults operated on to treat aie were included during a 3-year period. patients presenting with aie associated with a pacemaker were not included. bacteriologic investigations included blood cultures, intraoperative samplings (including polymerase chain reaction), and serologies. clinical and bacteriologic factors associated with hospital mortality were studied by univariate regression analysis (p < 0.05). results: ninety-eight  of 164 patients (60%) admitted with the diagnosis of aie underwent valvular surgery. the duration between the beginning of aie and surgery was 23 +/- 16 (mean +/- standard deviation) days. only 45 patients had a previous history of valvular disease. seventy-two patients presented with aortic and 41 with mitral valve aie. fifty suffered from embolic events. streptococcus species were responsible in 64 cases (23 were streptococcus bovis) and staphylococcus species  in 24 cases. death occurred postoperatively in 19 patients. the factors associated with fatal outcome were preoperative hemodynamic instability, age, parsonnet and simplified acute physiology score ii scores, diabetes mellitus, preexisting valvulopathy, antiarrhythmic treatment, hypoalbuminemia, renal dysfunction, duration of extracorporeal circulation, and red cell allogeneic transfusions. the type of bacteria did not influence mortality. the mean intensive care unit and hospital stays were 10 and 39 days, respectively. eleven  patients suffered from neurologic sequelae; 2 years later, 2 of them presented with severe deficit and 1 had died. conclusions: aie necessitating cardiac surgery should be considered as a severe and resource-consuming disease.

TI  == gross abnormalities, bacteriology and histological lesions of uteri of dairy cows failing to conceive or maintain pregnancy.
AB  == aim: to describe the gross pathology, bacteriology and histopathology of the reproductive tracts of dairy cows that failed to conceive or maintain pregnancy.  methods: the reproductive tracts of 105 cows that were not pregnant at the end of the seasonal breeding programme were retrieved following slaughter. the tracts were examined grossly, both horns of the uterine lumen were swabbed for bacteriology, and tissue was collected from each horn and the body of the uterus  for histopathology. grossly enlarged uteri and tracts containing purulent vaginal content were excluded. histopathology was performed on three sections of uterine  tissue from each of three cows in which no gross pathological changes were detected and from which no bacteria were isolated, from three cows in which no gross pathology was detected but from which bacteria were isolated, and from three cows in which gross pathological changes were detected but from which no bacteria were isolated. results: thirty-six (34%) cows had one or more gross lesions which involved the ovary, uterine tube, uterus or vagina. bacteria were isolated from the uteri of 22 (21%) cows. isolates included arcanobacterium pyogenes (n = 1), escherichia coli (n = 1), fusobacterium spp (n = 1), haemophilus somnus (n = 5), streptococcus acidominimus (n = 12), s. bovis (n = 2), s. uberis (n = 1) and s. salivarious (n = 1). in only five cows were both gross pathology and bacteria detected. there was no relationship between the isolation of bacteria and the diagnosis of gross pathology of the uterus. there were no differences in the degree of histopathological changes in the uteri from  the three groups of cows examined, and lesions present were minor. conclusions: gross pathological changes and intra-uterine bacteria were found in 34% and 20% of cows, respectively, but the correlation between the two was poor. histopathological changes were unremarkable, suggesting the bacteriological findings were coincidental, that causative agents of infertility were not present at the time of examination, or that unrelated causes such as nutritional anoestrus may have been responsible for the failure of some cows to conceive.

TI  == risk of embolism and death in infective endocarditis: prognostic value of echocardiography: a prospective multicenter study.
AB  == background: the incidence of embolic events (ee) and death is still high in patients with infective endocarditis (ie), and data about predictors of these 2 major complications are conflicting. moreover, the exact role of echocardiography in risk stratification is not well defined. methods and results: in a multicenter prospective european study, including 384 consecutive patients (aged 57+/-17 years) with definite ie according to duke university criteria, we tested clinical, microbiological, and echocardiographic data as potential predictors of  ee and 1-year mortality. transesophageal echocardiography was performed in all patients. embolism occurred before or after ie diagnosis (total-ee) in 131 patients (34.1%) and after initiation of antibiotic therapy (new-ee) in 28 patients (7.3%). staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus bovis were independently associated with total-ee, whereas vegetation length >10 mm and severe vegetation  mobility were predictors of new-ee, even after adjustment for s aureus and s bovis. one-year mortality was 20.6%. in multivariable analysis, independently of  the other predictors of death (age, female sex, creatinine serum >2 mg/l, moderate or severe congestive heart failure, and s aureus) and comorbidity, vegetation length >15 mm was a predictor of 1-year mortality (adjusted relative risk=1.8; 95% ci, 1.10 to 2.82; p=0.02). conclusions: in ie, vegetation length is a strong predictor of new-ee and mortality. in combination with clinical and microbiological findings, echocardiography may identify high-risk patients who will need a more aggressive therapeutic strategy.

TI  == molecular monitoring and characterization of the faecal microbiota of healthy dogs during fructan supplementation.
AB  == the large intestine of dogs contains a complex microbial ecosystem with predominance of streptococci, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, bacteroides and clostridium. generally, this predominant microbiota in dogs is relatively stable  in time but much less is known about its taxonomic composition. moreover, almost  no studies have been conducted to investigate this stability of the faecal microbial population in dogs upon prebiotic administration. the objective of the  present study was to monitor possible changes in faecal microbiota of seven healthy adult dogs related to the administration of two fructans, oligofructose and inulin. for this purpose, population fingerprints generated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis of universal v3 16 s rrna gene pcr amplicons were compared between control (baseline) samples and samples collected  after prebiotic feeding. from these dgge gels, marked changes were observed in the faecal microbiota between subjects and before and after fructan administration. one dgge band that appeared or intensified after fructan intake was further analyzed. sequence analysis could attribute this band to a member of  the streptococcus bovis-equinus group. following cultivation on mrs medium, a set of faecal isolates that most likely represent the stimulated streptococci were allocated to the species streptococcus lutetiensis by (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting and partial 16 s rrna and soda gene sequencing. the data provided in this study demonstrate the ability of fructans to influence the bacterial composition of the gut microbiota in healthy dogs. more work is needed to unravel the relevance of s. lutetiensis or other autochthonous organisms of the dog gut as target groups for prebiotic supplementation.

TI  == binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == protein(s) reactive with n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. the molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kda on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  under reducing conditions. the n-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified  protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found  to react with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from different gram-negative bacteria such as esherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella abortus equi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexeneri, and serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (lta) from gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus sanguis, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the purified protein also reacted with e. coli o26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated gram-positive bacteria such as s. aureus, b. cereus, b. subtilis, enterococcus faecium, and corynebacterum bovis. on the other hand, porcine igg isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these lps, lta, and heat-treated bacterial cells. from the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with glcnac is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with gram-positive and -negative bacteria.

TI  == clinical characteristics and significance of streptococcus salivarius bacteremia  and streptococcus bovis bacteremia: a prospective 16-year study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of streptococcus salivarius isolates recovered from blood cultures and compare them with isolates  of streptococcus bovis biotypes i and ii. seventeen of the 52 (32%) s. salivarius isolates recovered were considered clinically significant, compared with 62 of the 64 (97%) s. bovis isolates (p<0.0001). bacteremia caused by s. salivarius occurred mostly in patients who showed relevant disruption of the mucous membranes and/or serious underlying diseases. patients with s. salivarius bacteremia were younger than those with s. bovis bacteremia (57 vs. 67 years; p<0.01). patients with s. salivarius bacteremia and patients with s. bovis ii bacteremia had similar rates of endocarditis, colon tumors, and non-colon cancer. on the other hand, when compared with s. bovis i bacteremia, s. salivarius bacteremia was associated with lower rates of endocarditis (18% vs. 74%, respectively) (p<0.01) and colon tumors (0% vs. 57%, respectively) (p<0.005) and  higher rates of non-colon cancer (53% vs. 9.5%, respectively) (p<0.01). bacteremia caused by s. bovis ii had a hepatobiliary origin in 50% of the patients, while, in contrast, that due to s. salivarius or s. bovis i was less frequently associated with a hepatobiliary origin (12% and 5%, respectively) (p<0.00001). the rate of penicillin resistance was 31% among s. salivarius isolates and 0% among s. bovis isolates (p<0.0001). in conclusion, the clinical characteristics of s. salivarius bacteremia and s. bovis ii bacteremia are similar, and the isolation of s. salivarius in blood should not be systematically regarded as contamination.

TI  == blood culture-negative endocarditis in a reference center: etiologic diagnosis of 348 cases.
AB  == to identify the current etiologies of blood culture-negative infective endocarditis and to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic characteristics associated with each etiology, as well as with  unexplained cases, we tested samples from 348 patients suspected of having blood  culture-negative infective endocarditis in our diagnostic center, the french national reference center for rickettsial diseases, between 1983 and 2001. serology tests for coxiella burnettii, bartonella species, chlamydia species, legionella species, and aspergillus species; blood culture on shell vial; and, when available, analysis of valve specimens through culture, microscopic examination, and direct pcr amplification were performed. physicians were asked to complete a questionnaire, which was computerized. only cases of definite infective endocarditis, as defined by the modified duke criteria, were included.  a total of 348 cases were recorded-to our knowledge, the largest series reported  to date. of those, 167 cases (48%) were associated with c. burnetii, 99 (28%) with bartonella species, and 5 (1%) with rare, fastidious bacterial agents of endocarditis (tropheryma whipplei, abiotrophia elegans, mycoplasma hominis, legionella pneumophila). among 73 cases without etiology, 58 received antibiotic  drugs before the blood cultures. six cases were right-sided endocarditis and 4 occurred in patients who had a permanent pacemaker. finally, no explanatory factor was found for 5 remaining cases (1%), despite all investigations.q fever endocarditis affected males in 75% of cases, between 40 and 70 years of age. ninety-one percent of patients had a previous valvulopathy, 32% were immunocompromised, and 70% had been exposed to animals. our study confirms the improved clinical presentation and prognosis of the disease observed during the last decades. such an evolution could be related to earlier diagnosis due to better physician awareness and more sensitive diagnostic techniques. as for bartonella species, b. quintana was recorded more frequently than b. henselae (53 vs 17 cases). for 18 patients with bartonella endocarditis, the responsible species was not identified. species determination was achieved through culture and/or pcr in 49 cases and through western immunoblotting in 22. comparison of b. quintana and b. henselae endocarditis revealed distinct epidemiologic patterns. the 2 cases due to t. whipplei reflect the emerging role of this agent as a cause of infective endocarditis. because identification of the bacterium was possible only through analysis of excised valves by histologic examination, pcr, and culture on shell vial, the prevalence of the disease might be underestimated. among patients who received antibiotic drugs before blood cultures, 4 cases (7%)  were found to be associated with streptococcus species (2 s. bovis and 2 s. mutans) through 16s rdna gene amplification directly from the valve, which shows  the usefulness of this technique in overcoming the limitations of previous antibiotic treatment. right-sided endocarditis occurred classically in young patients (mean age, 36 yr), intravenous drug users in 50% of cases, and suffering more often from embolic complications. finally, 5 cases without etiology or explaining factors were all immunocompetent male patients with previous aortic valvular lesions, and 3 of the 5 presented with an aortic abscess. further investigations should be focused on this group to identify new agents of infective endocarditis.

TI  == wasp- mice exhibit defective immune responses to influenza a virus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and mycobacterium bovis bcg.
AB  == objective: to quantify the immune response of wasp- mice to three different pathogens: influenza a virus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and mycobacterium bovis.  methods: primary and secondary t-cell responses to influenza a virus were quantified via tetramer assays. viral clearance from lung was also measured. lethality of intranasal inoculation with luminescent s. pneumoniae was assessed by dose escalation and direct luminescence imaging. after intravenous inoculation with m. bovis, residual mycobacteria in lung, liver, and spleen were measured by  standard culture methods. results: the reduced secondary t-cell response to influenza a virus correlates with a relative but not absolute loss of splenic t and b cells similar to that seen in clinical wiskott-aldrich syndrome (was), and  slower clearance of virus from lung. the reduced magnitude of the secondary t-cell response correlates with a progressive loss of influenza-specific t cells  after primary inoculation. wasp- mice show an increased susceptibility to lethal  pneumonia after intranasal inoculation with s. pneumoniae, which is among the most frequent causes of clinical complications in was patients. wasp- mice clear  m. bovis bacille calmette-guerin (bcg) more slowly from lung, liver, and spleen.  bone marrow-derived macrophages, however, show normal ex vivo cytokine secretion  in response to m. bovis. conclusions: these results demonstrate that wasp- mice are functionally immunodeficient in regard to three different pathogens, and provide relevant end points for the study of treatment modalities in this model.  they also suggest a specific physiologic mechanism, failure to accumulate memory  t cells, for at least one of the defective immune responses.

TI  == emergence of endocarditis due to group d streptococci: findings derived from the  merged database of the international collaboration on endocarditis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of streptococcus bovis endocarditis with those of endocarditis caused by oral streptococci, using data obtained from a large international database of uniformly defined cases of infective endocarditis. s. bovis, a well-known cause of infective endocarditis, remains the common name used to designate group d nonenterococcal streptococci. in some countries, the frequency  of s. bovis endocarditis has increased significantly in recent years. data from the international collaboration on endocarditis merged database was used to identify the main characteristics of s. bovis endocarditis and compared them with those of infective endocarditis (ie) due to oral streptococci. the database contained 136 cases of s. bovis ie and 511 cases of ie due to oral streptococci.  patients with s. bovis ie were significantly older those with ie due to oral streptococci (63+/-16 vs. 55+/-18 years, p<0.00001). the proportion of streptococcal ie due to s. bovis increased from 10.9% before 1989 to 23.3% after  1989 (p=0.0007) and was 56.7% in france as compared with 9.4% in the rest of europe and 6.0% in the usa (p<0.00001). patients with s. bovis ie had more comorbidity and never used intravenous drugs. complication rates, rates of valve  replacement, and mortality rates were similar in the two groups. in conclusion, this study confirmed that s. bovis ie has unique characteristics when compared to endocarditis due to oral streptococci and that it emerged in the 1990s, mainly in france, a finding that is yet unexplained.

TI  == coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  == bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. as no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single candida spp. the quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus bovis ii/2 and gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) actinomyces spp. and veillonella spp.; (2) actinomyces israelii and peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) campylobacter gracilis and actinomyces spp.; (4) prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. the single candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. in particular, actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.

TI  == the influence of endoscopic procedures upon the contamination of helicobacter pylori cultures.
AB  == background: among the various diagnostic methods for the detection of helicobacter pylori infection, histological examination and microbiological processing of gastric biopsy samples are assumed to be the gold standard techniques. aims: since h. pylori culture can be affected by the presence of non-h. pylori bacteria, we evaluated the efficacy of endoscope disinfection and the influence of endoscopic procedures on culture contamination. patients and methods: the procedures used during the first two routine endoscopies were evaluated during 28 consecutive days. endoscopy room, forceps and endoscopic channel were analyzed before and after the beginning of normal procedures. after  disinfection, a biopsy simulation was performed to verify the gastric bacteria. results: endoscope disinfection removed all organisms from forceps and endoscopic channel with 100% efficacy. the most frequent non-h. pylori bacteria detected were streptococcus bovis, enterobacter hormaechei, and staphylococcus aureus. the sensibility of the h. pylori culture was affected by the presence of non-h. pylori bacteria. conclusion: the risk of transmission of microorganisms was not detectable when sterilized biopsy forceps and stringent disinfection standards were employed. whilst s. bovis and e. hormaechei may be common in gastric microbial flora, the presence of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus indicated that the manipulation of biopsies could be responsible for culture contamination with these bacteria.

TI  == molecular characterization and transcription of the luxs gene that encodes luxs autoinducer 2 synthase in streptococcus bovis.
AB  == presence of the luxs gene that encodes luxs autoinducer 2 (ai-2) synthase in streptococcus bovis was demonstrated, and the molecular properties and transcription of the gene were examined. the s. bovis luxs was transcribed in a monocistronic fashion. intracellular luxs-mrna increased sharply during the initial exponential growth, and decreased abruptly after the middle exponential phase. the large drop in luxs transcription began before the glucose supply to cells decreased or the growth rate declined. transcription of luxs was not directly related to cell density, and continued at a maximal rate when cells were kept growing at a maximal rate. it is conceivable that ai-2 activity in s. bovis  acts as a signal for adjusting cell physiology and metabolism in response to environmental conditions. however, the role of luxs in s. bovis, including the regulation of ai-2 synthesis,, remains to be clarified.

TI  == protozoa involved in butyric rather than lactic fermentative pattern during latent acidosis in sheep.
AB  == we used six ruminally cannulated texel wethers to study the relative role of protozoa and lactate-metabolizing bacteria in ruminal fermentative patterns during an induced latent acidosis. the sheep were fed an alfalfa hay diet (h) and latent acidosis was induced, following a short transition period of one week, with a grain-rich acidotic diet (w, 60% wheat + 40% alfalfa hay). ruminal ph, ruminal volatile fatty acids (vfa), lactate and nh3 concentrations, protozoa and  lactate-utilizing bacterial counts, the relative proportions of three main bacteria implicated in lactate metabolism (a lactate-producing species, streptococcus bovis, and two lactate-utilizing species, selenomonas ruminantium,  and megasphaera elsdenii) using specific 16s-rrna-targeting oligonucleotide probes, and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) activity were determined for both diets.  the ph parameters (mean, minimum, maximum, time and area under ph 6.0 and 5.5) measured with the w diet were indicative of a latent (i.e., subacute and maintained) acidosis. however, a butyric rather than lactic latent acidosis was observed in this study. total ruminal lactate concentration remained at low levels with the acidotic diet (< 4 mmol x l(-1)), but changes were observed in vfa composition, which was oriented towards butyrate at the expense of acetate (p < 0.05), while propionate remained constant. in agreement with the low ruminal lactate concentration, no changes in the proportion of s. bovis 16s-rrna were observed. the lactate-metabolizing bacterial population also remained fairly constant in number, proportion and activity. the increase in butyrate concentration was accompanied by a proliferation of entodiniomorphs (p < 0.01). these results suggest that the protozoa limited lactate accumulation and possibly also the decrease in ph during latent acidosis. experiments with defaunated and faunated sheep could provide further evidence of the role of protozoa in the development of rumen latent acidosis.

TI  == vasculitic purpura with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive acute renal  failure in a patient with streptococcus bovis case and neisseria subflava bacteremia and subacute endocarditis.
AB  == subacute bacterial endocarditis is frequently associated with extracardiac manifestations and renal failure. clinical variety of endocarditis manifestation  is wide and has the potential to mimic vasculitis. whereas streptococcus bovis is often isolated and associated with colonic tumors, neisseriaceae are rarely found. an association of subacute bacterial endocarditis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies has been described. we report on a 62-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with acute oliguric renal failure and a nonpruritic purpural rush without fever. antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody diagnostic revealed perinuclear staining with a titre of 1 : 512 and antiproteinase-3 specificity. immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis without extracapillary proliferation was diagnosed in renal biopsy. finally, blood cultures became positive for streptococcus bovis and neisseria flava. echocardiography showed mobile vegetations on tricuspid valve. under treatment with penicillin g and gentamicin, skin efflorescences and renal function recovered, but vegetations increased. a colonic tumor could be excluded, a disastrous dental status may have been a predisposal factor. when classical findings of subacute bacterial endocarditis are less clear, the presence of renal failure and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in absence of fever may lead to misdiagnosis and deleterious immunosuppressive therapy. neisseria subflava, an upper respiratory tract commensal, may cause subacute bacterial endocarditis without typical symptoms.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus bovis from the rumen of the dromedary camel and rusa deer.
AB  == aims: isolation and characterization of streptococcus bovis from the dromedary camel and rusa deer. methods and results: bacteria were isolated from the rumen contents of four camels and two deer fed lucerne hay by culturing on the semi-selective medium mrs agar. based on gram morphology and rflp analysis seven  isolates, mpr1, mpr2, mpr3, mpr4, mpr5, rd09 and rd11 were selected and putatively identified as streptococcus. the identity of these isolates was later  confirmed by comparative dna sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene with the homologous sequence from s. bovis strains, jb1, c14b1, ncfb2476, sbr1, sbr7 and sb5, from cattle and sheep, and the streptococcus equinus strain ncd01037t. the percentage similarity amongst all strains was >99%, confirming the identification of the camel isolates as s. bovis. the strains were further characterized by their ability to utilize a range of carbohydrates, the production of volatile fatty acids (vfa) and lactate and the determination of the doubling time in basal medium 10 supplemented with glucose. all the isolates produced l-lactate as a major fermentation end product, while four of five camel isolates produced vfa. the range of carbohydrates utilized by all the strains tested, including those from cattle and sheep were identical, except that all camel isolates and the deer isolate rd11 were additionally able to utilize arabinose. conclusions: streptococcus bovis was successfully isolated from the rumen of camels and deer,  and shown by molecular and biochemical characterization to be almost identical to s. bovis isolates from cattle and sheep. significance and impact of the study: streptococcus bovis is considered a key lactic acid producing bacterium from the  gastrointestinal tract of ruminants, and has been implicated as a causative agent of lactic acidosis. this study is the first report of the isolation and characterization of s. bovis from the dromedary camel and rusa deer, and suggests a major contributive role of this bacterium to fermentative acidosis.

TI  == use of community genome arrays (cgas) to assess the effects of acacia angustissima on rumen ecology.
AB  == this research developed a community genome array (cga) to assess the effects of acacia angustissima on rumen microbiology. a. angustissima produces non-protein amino acids as well as tannins, which may be toxic to animals, and cga was used to assess the effects of this plant on the ecology of the rumen. cgas were developed using a 7.5 cmx2.5 cm nylon membrane format that included up to 96 bacterial genomes. it was possible to separately hybridize large numbers of membranes at once using this mini-membrane format. pair-wise cross-hybridization  experiments were conducted to determine the degree of cross-hybridization between strains; cross-hybridization occurred between strains of the same species, but little cross-reactivity was observed among different species. cgas were successfully used to survey the microbial communities of animals consuming an a.  angustissima containing diet but quantification was not precise. to properly quantify and validate the cga, fibrobacter and ruminococcus populations were independently assessed using 16s rdna probes to extracted rrna. the cga detected  an increase in these populations as acacia increased in the diet, which was confirmed by rrna analysis. there was a great deal of variation among strains of  the same species in how they responded to a. angustissima. however, in general selenomonas strains tended to be resistant to the tannins in the acacia while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was sensitive. on the other hand some species, like streptococci, varied. streptococcus bovis-like strains were sensitive to an increase in acacia in the diet while streptococcus gallolyticus-like strains were resistant. strep. gallolyticus has independently been shown to be resistant to tannins. it is concluded that there is significant variation in tannin resistance between strains of the same species. this implies that there are specific molecular mechanisms at play that are independent of the phylogenetic position of the organism.

TI  == molecular characterization of ccpa and involvement of this protein in transcriptional regulation of lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate-lyase in the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis.
AB  == a ccpa gene that encodes global catabolite control protein a (ccpa) in streptococcus bovis was identified and characterized, and the involvement of ccpa in transcriptional control of a gene (ldh) encoding lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and a gene (pfl) encoding pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl) was examined. the ccpa gene was shown to be transcribed as a monocistronic operon. a catabolite-responsive element (cre) was found in the promoter region of ccpa, suggesting that ccpa transcription in s. bovis is autogenously regulated. ccpa required hpr that was phosphorylated at the serine residue at position 46 (hpr-[ser-p]) for binding to the cre site, but glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and nadp had no effect on binding. diauxic growth was observed  when s. bovis was grown in a medium containing glucose and lactose, but it disappeared when ccpa was disrupted, which indicates that ccpa is involved in catabolite repression in s. bovis. the level of ccpa mrna was higher when cells were grown on glucose than when they were grown on lactose, which was in line with the level of ldh mrna. when cells were grown on glucose, the ldh mrna level  was lower but the pfl mrna level was higher in a ccpa-disrupted mutant than in the parent strain, which suggests that ldh transcription is enhanced and pfl transcription is suppressed by ccpa. the ccpa-disrupted mutant produced less lactate and more formate than the parent, probably because the mutant had reduced ldh activity and elevated pfl activity. in the upper region of both ldh and pfl,  a cre-like sequence was found, suggesting that the complex consisting of ccpa and hpr-[ser-p] binds to the possible cre sites. thus, ccpa appears to be involved in the global regulation of sugar utilization in s. bovis.

TI  == bovine mastitis in finland 2001--prevalence, distribution of bacteria, and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == a nationwide survey was conducted in finland to estimate prevalence of bovine mastitis, distribution of mastitis pathogens, and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of different mastitis pathogens. in total, 12,661 quarter milk samples were collected from 3282 dairy cows at 216 farms. these were randomly selected from a database covering all finnish dairy farms. quarter milk samples collected by the dairy advisors were submitted for somatic cell counting, bacteriological examination, and testing for antimicrobial susceptibility. if the milk scc of a cow or of a quarter exceeded 300,000/ml, the cow was defined as having mastitis. the results were compared with those of a previous survey done in 1995. the prevalence of mastitis continued to decrease from 38% in 1995 to 31% in 2001. compared with the study from 1995, the number of quarters with bacterial growth in 2001 increased significantly from 21.0 to 33.5%. this mainly resulted from increased prevalence of corynebacterium bovis. coagulase-negative staphylococci remained the most common bacterial group, comprising almost one-half of the pathogens isolated, whereas the relative number of staphylococcus aureus isolations decreased from the time of the previous study. according to in  vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the enterococci demonstrated the highest level of resistance. compared with the other nordic countries, penicillin resistance among the staphylococci was still at a relatively high level in finland (52.1 and 32.0% for staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively). streptococci isolated from mastitis were very susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, as also found in the previous survey in 1995.

TI  == efficacy of extended ceftiofur intramammary therapy for treatment of subclinical  mastitis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  == little research has focused on treatment of cows with subclinical mastitis during lactation. ceftiofur is a new broad-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic for veterinary use that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by interfering with enzymes essential for peptidoglycan synthesis. ceftiofur should  be effective against a wide range of contagious and environmental mastitis pathogens. objectives of the present study were to evaluate the efficacy of ceftiofur for treatment of subclinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows, and to determine if extended therapy regimens enhanced efficacy of ceftiofur. holstein and jersey dairy cows (n = 88) from 3 dairy research herds were used. cows were enrolled in the study based on milk somatic cell counts >400,000/ml and isolation of the same mastitis pathogen in 2 samples obtained 1 wk apart. cows with one or  more intramammary infections (imi) were blocked by parity and dim and allocated randomly to 1 of 3 different ceftiofur treatment regimens: 2-d (n = 49 imi), 5-d  (n = 41 imi), and 8-d (n = 38 imi) treatment regimens. for all groups, 125 mg of  ceftiofur hydrochloride was administered via intramammary infusion. eighteen cows with 38 imi were included as an untreated negative control group. a bacteriological cure was defined as a treated infected mammary quarter that was bacteriologically negative for the presence of previously identified bacteria at  14 and 28 d after the last treatment. efficacy of ceftiofur therapy against all subclinical imi was 38.8, 53.7, and 65.8% for the 2-, 5-, and 8-d ceftiofur treatment regimens, respectively. four of 38 (10.5%) imi in control cows were cured spontaneously without treatment. all 3 ceftiofur treatment regimens were significantly better than the negative control, and the 8-d extended ceftiofur treatment regimen treatment group was significantly better than the standard 2-d  treatment group. pathogen groups had significantly different cure rates from one  another. the cure rate for the 8-d extended ceftiofur treatment regimen was 70% for corynebacterium bovis, 86% for coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, 36% for staph. aureus, 80% for streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. dysgalactiae, and 67%  for strep. uberis.

TI  == improved survival in experimental sepsis with an orally administered inhibitor of apoptosis.
AB  == the pathophysiology of sepsis involves excessive lymphocyte apoptosis, which correlates with adverse outcomes, and disordered cytokine production, which may promote host injury. as the protease inhibitor (pi) class of antiretroviral agents is known to prevent apoptosis in vitro, we evaluated their effect on survival, lymphocyte apoptosis, and consequent cytokine production in mice with sepsis induced by cecal ligation and perforation. mice pretreated with pis have improved survival (67%; p<0.0005) compared with controls (17%) and a significant  (p<0.05) reduction in lymphocyte apoptosis. even mice receiving therapy beginning 4 h after perforation demonstrated improved survival (50%; p<0.05) compared with  controls. pi therapy is also associated with an increase in the th1 cytokine tnf-alpha (p<0.05) early in sepsis and a reduction in the th2 cytokines il-6 and  il-10 (p<0.05) late in sepsis; despite no intrinsic antibacterial effects, pi also reduced quantitative bacterial blood cultures. the beneficial effects of pi  appear to be specific to lymphocyte apoptosis, as lymphocyte-deficient rag1-/- mice did not experience benefit from treatment with pi. thus, inhibition of lymphocyte apoptosis by pi is a candidate approach for the treatment of sepsis.

TI  == effects of the overexpression of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase on fermentation pattern and transcription of the genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate-lyase in a ruminal bacterium, streptococcus bovis.
AB  == whether fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (fbp) triggers the transcriptional regulation of the gene expression of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and pyruvate formate-lyase  (pfl) in streptococcus bovis was examined by constructing a recombinant strain that overexpresses fbp aldolase (fba). when the recombinant strain was grown on glucose, intracellular fbp was much lower as compared to the parent strain, whereas dihydroxyacetone phosphate (dhap) and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (gap)  were slightly higher. intracellular atp and adp were slightly lower, but the nadh/nad(+) ratio was not different. when glucose was replaced by lactose, a less readily utilized substrate, there was no great difference in fbp, dhap, gap, or adenine nucleotides. overexpression of fba decreased the level of ldh-mrna, and increased the level of pfl-mrna. consequently, fbp concentration was positively related to the ldh-mrna level and inversely related to the pfl-mrna level. on the contrary, dhap and gap concentrations were positively related to the pfl-mrna level and inversely related to the ldh-mrna level. the levels of these mrna were  proportional to the amounts of corresponding enzymes in cells. as a result, the ratio of formate to lactate produced was increased by the overexpression of fba.  from these results, it could be presumed that fbp is involved in the transcriptional control of ldh and pfl synthesis in s. bovis.

AB  == background & objectives: streptococcal bacteraemia remains a major and challenging clinical problem throughout the world. the epidemiology of these infections appears to be changing. in the present study we analysed the data collected over a period of 20 yr (1978-1999) to throw light on this. methods: laboratory records of all patients yielding clinically significant, non-pneumococcal, nonenterococcal streptococcal bacteraemia were reviewed for the decades 1978-1988 and 1990-1999 in the two districts (combined population 260,000). results: from a total of 3134 patients with detected bacteraemia 338 (10.8%) yielded streptococci. the organisms comprised: in the beta-haemolytic group (n=169), gas (32%), gbs (34%), gcs (5%), ggs (28%), grs (1%); in the non-haemolytic/streptococcus milleri group (n=160): s. milleri (21%), s. bovis (10%), s. sanguis (30%), s.mitis (10%), s. oralis (8%) and other 'viridans' streptococci (20%); nine isolates were of anaerobic streptococci. there was a steady increase in the number of blood cultures submitted for investigation during the period and streptococcal isolations of all species rose in proportion  (approximately x 2.5) in the second decade compared with the first. complementary data on the occurrence of necrotising fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome in these districts suggested a real increase in the occurrence of serious forms of gas infection. interpretation & conclusion: an increase in the level of detected streptococcal bacteraemia was seen in this part of england over 20 yr, involving  a wide variety of different streptococcal species. this represented both improved ascertainment of infection and an increase in the burden of disease in the population.

TI  == [fever, malaise and new onset mitral valve insufficiency. subacute streptococcus  bovis mitral valve endocarditis ].
AB  == a 62-year-old patient with low grade fever, fatigue, arthralgia and newly discovered mitral regurgitation was diagnosed with subacute endocarditis. streptococcus bovis grew from all six blood culture bottles. streptococcus bovis  is known to be associated with gastrointestinal neoplasias. therefore a colonoscopy was performed and two polyps were removed. histological analysis revealed a tubulovillous adenoma and a serrated adenoma. colonoscopy is mandatory for all patients with streptococcus bovis endocarditis even without any symptoms  for colorectal neoplasia. the significance of streptococcus bovis for the carcinogenesis of colorectal neoplasias and the possible alternative pathway for  colorectal carcinomas through serrated adenomas will be discussed.

TI  == non-life-threatening sepsis: report of two cases.
AB  == streptococcus bovis is one of the nonenterococcal species included among the streptococci group d. it is part of the normal bowel flora in humans and animals, but it is also responsible for infectious diseases (10-15% of all cases of bacterial endocarditis). many cases of bacteremia and metastatic abscesses (spleen, liver, soft tissues, bone, meninges, endocardium) caused by s. bovis were reported as associated with digestive tract diseases, mainly colonic disease, and, in particular colonic neoplasms, or chronic liver diseases. a role  in carcinogenesis has been suggested for this microorganism. the authors report two cases of s. bovis sepsis, one associated with colonic neoplasm and the other  with liver cirrhosis and gastric carcinoma. discussion is focused on probable mechanisms that favor gastric colonization and systemic diffusion of s. bovis from the gut in patients with gastrointestinal neoplasms or chronic liver disease and provides clinical recommendations for patients with s. bovis infections.

TI  == streptococcus bovis endocarditis and its association with chronic liver disease:  an underestimated risk factor.
AB  == clinical and epidemiological characteristics of streptococcus bovis endocarditis  were prospectively studied among 199 patients with definite endocarditis. thirty  patients (15.1%) had s. bovis endocarditis. compared with patients with non-s. bovis endocarditis, these 30 patients were older (mean age, 58.6+/-12.4 years vs. 46.0+/-17.0 years; p<.001) and had higher rates of bivalvular involvement (43.3%  vs. 7.7%; p<.001), embolism (73.3% vs. 40.2%; p=.002), and diskitis (23.3% vs. 0.6% p<.001). in patients with s. bovis biotype i (s. bovis i) endocarditis, advanced liver disease was present in 56.7%, compared with 15.3% of patients with non-s. bovis endocarditis (p<.001), and colonic adenoma was present in 46.7%. the in-hospital mortality rate (16.7%) was correlated with delayed diagnosis and advanced liver diseases. in our city, s. bovis i endocarditis is frequently correlated with liver diseases; diskitis may be the first sign of the disease.

TI  == resistance of rumen bacteria murein to bovine gastric lysozyme.
AB  == background: lysozymes, enzymes mostly associated with defence against bacterial infections, are mureinolytic. ruminants have evolved a gastric c type lysozyme as a digestive enzyme, and profit from digestion of foregut bacteria, after most dietary components, including protein, have been fermented in the rumen. in this  work we characterized the biological activities of bovine gastric secretions against membranes, purified murein and bacteria. results: bovine gastric extract  (bge) was active against both g+ and g- bacteria, but the effect against gram- bacteria was not due to the lysozyme, since purified bgl had only activity against gram+ bacteria. we were unable to find small pore forming peptides in the bge, and found that the inhibition of gram negative bacteria by bge was due to an artefact caused by acetate. we report for first time the activity of bovine gastric lysozyme (bg lysozyme) against pure bacterial cultures, and the specific  resistance of some rumen gram positive strains to bgl. conclusions: some gram+ rumen bacteria showed resistance to abomasum lysozyme. we discuss the implications of this finding in the light of possible practical applications of such a stable antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and macrolide resistance genes of viridans  group streptococci from blood cultures in korea.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to study the antimicrobial susceptibilities and macrolide resistance mechanisms of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in a korean tertiary hospital. methods: mics of five antimicrobials were determined for 106 vgs isolated from blood cultures. the macrolide resistance mechanisms of erythromycin non-susceptible isolates were studied by the double-disc test and pcr. results: in all, 42.4% of the isolates were susceptible to penicillin. nine of 61 penicillin non-susceptible isolates were fully resistant (mic >/= 4 mg/l). rates  of non-susceptibility to erythromycin, clindamycin and ceftriaxone were 33.9%, 17.9% and 9.4%, respectively. twenty-two (61.1%) of 36 erythromycin non-susceptible isolates expressed constitutive resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b antibiotics (a constitutive mls(b) phenotype); 13 isolates (36.1%) expressed an m phenotype; and one isolate, a streptococcus bovis isolate, had an inducible mls(b) resistance phenotype. erm(b) was found in isolates with constitutive/inducible mls(b) phenotypes, and mef(a) in isolates with the m phenotype. in three isolates (two isolates with a constitutive mls(b) phenotype and in one isolate with the m phenotype), none of erm(a), erm(b), erm(c) or mef(a) was detected by pcr. conclusions: penicillin non-susceptible vgs were more resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin and ceftriaxone than were penicillin-susceptible isolates. a constitutive mls(b) phenotype associated with erm(b) was the predominant mechanism of macrolide resistance among erythromycin non-susceptible isolates from this korean hospital.

TI  == the use of pcr for the identification and characterisation of bacteriocin genes from bacterial strains isolated from rumen or caecal contents of cattle and sheep.
AB  == pcr primers were designed to amplify the gene that encodes bovicin 255 from streptococcus gallolyticus lrc0255 and the bacteriocin genes from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains ar10 and or79a (bvid and bvi79a) in order to screen for their incidence in rumen and caecal b. fibrisolvens and streptococcus bovis-like  isolates from new zealand and north american ruminants. none of the b. fibrisolvens-like strains (n=34) isolated from new zealand or north america had the genes encoding for butyrivibriocins ar10 (bvid) or or79 (bvi79a). however, seven s. bovis isolates from new zealand ruminants and three from north american  animals had the bovicin 255 gene. sequence comparison of cloned bovicin 255 pcr products indicated a 92.9-95.7% similarity to that of the corresponding bovicin 255 gene sequence of s. gallolyticus. four of the new zealand bovicin 255 positive s. bovis isolates were from the caecal contents of the same sheep and had identical pfge profiles. two other s. bovis isolates sharing the same pfge profile were isolated from a separate animal from the same flock. pfge analysis of the north american strains indicated that all three were closely related as two of three had identical pfge profiles with the remaining isolate differing only by a single band position. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the 10 isolates were at least 99.8% identical to s. bovis. all 10 s. bovis isolates having the gene for bovicin 255 produced bacteriocin activity that inhibited the growth of peptostreptococcus anaerobius d1 in a deferred antagonism plating (dap) assay. certain s. bovis isolates obtained from ruminants have bacteriocin activity associated with a distinct bovicin 255 gene sequence but it appears that bacteriocin production by the rumen anaerobe b. fibrisolvens may be uncommon in strains isolated from cattle and sheep in new zealand.

TI  == bacteremic streptococcus bovis infections at a university hospital, 1992-2001.
AB  == background and purpose: the association of streptococcus bovis biotypes with types of clinical infection and underlying malignancies has rarely been reported  in taiwan. the aim of this study was to characterize the clinical features and microbiological characteristics of patients with s. bovis bacteremia. methods: from january 1992 to december 2001, 62 patients with s. bovis bacteremia were treated at national taiwan university hospital. their demographic characteristics, clinical features, results of imaging studies, pathological findings, and laboratory data were retrospectively analyzed. antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using the agar dilution method and biotypes were determined using the api 20 strep system. results: the majority of cases (76%) occurred during the 1996-1997 and 1999-2000 periods. thirty five patients were male, and the mean age of the 62 patients was 61 years. underlying diseases included malignancies (40%), cardiac diseases (27%), diabetes mellitus (24%), and liver cirrhosis (21%). fifty two percent (n = 32) of patients presented with primary bacteremia and 24% (15) with definite or possible infective endocarditis. thirteen percent (8) presented with hepatobiliary infections (acute cholecystitis and biliary tract infection). ten patients (16%) had polymicrobial bacteremia. all of the concomitant pathogen(s) were gram-negative rods, among which escherichia coli predominated. the mortality rate on day 30 of illness was 21%. high acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) ii score on the day  of positive blood culture was associated with high mortality. among the 19 patients (31%) who underwent colonoscopy, 9 (47%) had colonic lesions (tubular adenomas or carcinomas). of the 26 patients (41%) who underwent echocardiography, 14 (54%) had vegetation in the valves. of the 47 s. bovis isolates examined for biotypes, 37 (79%) were biotype ii (29 of biotype ii/2 and 8 of biotype ii/1) and 10 (21%) were biotype i. the majority of isolates causing primary bacteremia (92%), hepatobiliary infections (100%) and primary bacterial peritonitis (100%) were biotype ii, while 67% of isolates associated with infective endocarditis were biotype i. all isolates were susceptible to penicillin. conclusions: infective endocarditis should be highly suspected in patients with bacteremia due to s. bovis biotype i. investigations for intra-abdominal foci other than the colon should be undertaken in patients with bacteremia caused by s. bovis biotype ii. due to the increasing number of s. bovis bacteremia patients at the hospital  and unknown origins of about 50% of bacteremia cases, the need for colonoscopy and echocardiography in each case and biotyping of each blood isolate should be emphasized.

TI  == causative organisms of infective endocarditis according to host status.
AB  == a prospective study of infective endocarditis (ie) was conducted between 1994 and 2000 in marseilles, france, and included 170 definite cases diagnosed with the use of modified duke criteria. classification of ie based on the aetiological agent was related to epidemiological characteristics, including age, gender and the nature of the injured valve. enterococci and streptococcus bovis were identified more frequently in older subjects (p 0.02), and s. bovis was also associated with mitral valve infection (p 0.03). streptococcus spp. were found to be associated with native valves (p < 10(-3)), whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci and coxiella burnetii were associated with intracardiac prosthetic  material (p < 0.05). s. bovis and staphylococcus aureus were the predominant species associated with presumably healthy valves (p < 0.05), whereas oral streptococci caused ie exclusively in patients with previous valve damage. the basic host status of ie patients has been linked to specific microorganisms, and  this may be of value when empirical treatment is needed in patients who have received previous antibiotic therapy and whose blood cultures are negative.

AB  == otitis externa in cattle has a significant impact in tropical and subtropical regions, and the aetiological agents are predominantly rhabditiform nematodes and mites of the genus raillietia. its prevalence is higher in mature and zebu cattle. in advanced clinical cases there can be irreversible and fatal neural lesions. ear infection in calves has been associated with concurrent respiratory  diseases and mixed infection. the principal reported agents of otitis in calves are bacteria such as actinomyces spp., corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, escherichia coli, haemophilus somnus, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas spp., streptococcus spp. and mycoplasma bovis. the control and treatment of bovine otitis is not standardized and there is little evidence-based support for the diverse treatments available in the literature.

TI  == [streptococcus bovis infectious endocarditis: clinical and epidemiological characteristics].
AB  == this paper shows our experience concerning the study of streptococcus bovis infectious endocarditis (ei): 47 patients, with no prior history of iv drug abuse (ntd), who suffered ei caused by streptococcus bovis were excerpted from a case record of 1053 cases with diagnosis of ei defined in accordance with duke's hospital criteria. for each patient we considered age, sex, complications, echocardiographic findings, antibiotic therapy, eventual heart-surgery and final  outcome of the disease. we then compared the parameters of our patients, with the ones of 216 ntd patients suffering non streptococcus bovis ei, selected according to age correspondence and concomitant onset of the disease. the characteristics of streptococcus bovis ei are analogous to the ones of eis caused by other micro-organisms in ntd patients, except for a non statistically significant trend of higher frequency in old age and in males. concerning possible predisposing conditions, we considered the association extensively described in the literature between streptococcus bovis ei and gastroenteric pathology (above all colon neoplasms): this association was not frequently observed in our study because appropriate instrumental investigations of the digestive tract were carried out only in a minority of patients.

TI  == effect of ph on the activity of bovicin hc5, a bacteriocin from streptococcus bovis hc5.
AB  == the bacteriocin, bovicin hc5, catalyzed potassium efflux from streptococcus bovis jb1, and this activity was highly ph dependent. when the ph was near neutral, glucose-energized cells were not affected by bovicin hc5, but the intracellular steady-state concentration of potassium decreased at acidic ph values. the idea that ph was affecting bovicin hc5 binding was supported by the observation that acidic ph also enhanced the efflux of potassium from non-energized cells that had been loaded with potassium. the relationship between bovicin hc5 concentration and potassium depletion was a saturation function, but cooperativity plots indicated that the binding of one bovicin molecule to the cell membrane facilitated the binding of another.

TI  == rpob gene sequence-based identification of aerobic gram-positive cocci of the genera streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, abiotrophia, and granulicatella.
AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == the effect of ph and a bacteriocin (bovicin hc5) on clostridium sporogenes md1, a bacterium that has the ability to degrade amino acids in ensiled plant materials.
AB  == fresh plant materials can be fermented and preserved as silage for cattle, but clostridia that deaminate amino acids increase ph. if the ph of the silage rises, spoilage microorganisms proliferate, and undesirable products accumulate. rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria with spores were isolated from fresh alfalfa, fresh corn, and silages. strain md1 had the highest specific activity of amino acid deamination, and it was most closely related to clostridium botulinum a and  b. however, because strain md1 did not produce a toxin, it was classified as clostridium sporogenes. washed cell suspensions of c. sporogenes md1 had specific activities as great as 690 nmol ammonia mg protein(-1) min(-1), and this rate did not decrease until the ph was less than 4.5. batch cultures of c. sporogenes md1  did not initiate growth if the initial ph was less than 5.0, but continuous cultures (0.1 h(-1) dilution rate) persisted until the ph in the culture vessel was 4.6. when c. sporogenes md1 was co-cultured with a bacteriocin-producing streptococcus bovis hc5, ammonia production was greatly reduced. the ability of s. bovis hc5 to inhibit strain md1 was ph-dependent. when the ph was 5.5 or less, strain md1 could no longer be detected. these latter results support the idea that bacteriocin-producing bacteria may be used to improve silage quality.

TI  == carcinogenic properties of proteins with pro-inflammatory activity from streptococcus infantarius (formerly s.bovis).
AB  == several studies reported linkage between bacterial infections and carcinogenesis. streptococcus bovis was traditionally considered as a lower grade pathogen frequently involved in bacteremia and endocarditis. this bacterium became important in human health as it was shown that 25-80% of patients who presented a s.bovis bacteremia had also a colorectal tumor. moreover, in previous experiments, we demonstrated that s.bovis or s.bovis wall extracted antigens (wea) were able to promote carcinogenesis in rats. the aim of the present study was: (i) to identify the s.bovis proteins responsible for in vitro pro-inflammatory properties; (ii) to purify them; (iii) to examine their ability  to stimulate in vitro il-8 and cox-2 expression by human colon cancer cells; and  (iv) to assess in vivo their pro-carcinogenic potential in a rat model of colon carcinogenesis. the purified s300 fraction, as determined by proteomic analysis,  contained 72 protein spots in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis representing 12 different proteins able to trigger human epithelial colonic caco-2 cells and rat  colonic mucosa to release cxc chemokines (human il-8 or rat cinc/gro) and prostaglandins e2, correlated with an in vitro over-expression of cox-2. moreover, these proteins were highly effective in the promotion of pre-neoplastic lesions in azoxymethane-treated rats. in the presence of these proteins, caco-2 cells exhibited enhanced phosphorylation of the three classes of map kinases. our results show a relationship between the pro-inflammatory potential of s.bovis proteins and their pro-carcinogenic properties, confirming the linkage between inflammation and colon carcinogenesis. these data support the hypothesis that colonic bacteria can contribute to cancer development particularly in chronic infection/inflammation diseases where bacterial components may interfere with cell function.

AB  == a bacteriocin-producing strain was isolated from raw milk and named streptococcus bovis hj50. like most bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria, bovicin hj50 showed a narrow range of inhibiting activity. it was sensitive to trypsin, subtilisin and proteinase k. bovicin hj50 was extracted by n-propanol and purified by sp sepharose fast flow, followed by phenyl superose and sephadex g-50. treatment of micrococcus flavus ncib8166 with bovicin hj50 revealed potassium efflux from inside the cell in a concentration-dependent manner. the molecular mass of bovicin hj50 was determined to be 3428.3 da. ms analysis of dtt-treated bovicin hj50 suggested that bovicin hj50 contains a disulfide bridge. the structural gene of bovicin hj50 was cloned by nested pcr based on its n-terminal amino acid sequence. sequence analysis showed that it encodes a 58 aa  prepeptide consisting of an n-terminal leader sequence of 25 aa and a c-terminal  propeptide domain of 33 aa. bovicin hj50 shows similarity to type aii lantibiotics. chemical modification using an ethanethiol-containing reaction mixture showed that two thr residues are modified.

TI  == molecular characteristics and transcription of the gene encoding a multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenase in relation to the deactivation of pyruvate formate-lyase in the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis.
AB  == to clarify the deactivation mechanism of pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl) and its role in the regulation of fermentation in streptococcus bovis, the molecular properties and genetic expression of multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenase (adhe) were investigated. s. bovis was found to have adhe, which was deduced to consist  of 872 amino acids with a molecular mass of 97.4 kda. the adhe was shown to harbor three enzyme activities: (1) alcohol dehydrogenase, (2) coenzyme-a-linked  acetaldehyde dehydrogenase that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-coa to ethanol, and (3) pfl deactivase. similar to escherichia coli adhe, s. bovis adhe  required fe2+ for its activity. the gene encoding adhe ( adhe) was shown to be monocistronic. the level of adhe mrna changed in parallel with the mrna levels of the genes encoding pfl (pfl) and pfl-activating enzyme (act) as the growth conditions changed, although these genes are independently transcribed. synthesis of adhe, pfl-activating enzyme, and pfl appears to be regulated concomitantly. overexpression of adhe did not cause a change in the formate-to-lactate ratio. it is conceivable that adhe is not significantly involved in the reversible inactivation of active pfl under anoxic conditions. partition of the flow from pyruvate appears to be mainly regulated by the activities of lactate dehydrogenase and pfl.

TI  == inhibition of listeria monocytogenes by bovicin hc5, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus bovis hc5.
AB  == cattle can be infected with listeria monocytogenes by consuming contaminated plant materials, soil or silage, and farmers have sought ways of preventing this  contamination. recent work indicated that streptococcus bovis hc5 produced a bacteriocin (bovicin hc5) that could inhibit a variety of gram-positive bacteria, and we examined the ability of bovicin hc5 to inhibit 10 strains of l. monocytogenes that had been isolated from plant materials, soil, silage and infected cattle. growth experiments indicated that all of the l. monocytogenes strains were inhibited by 100 activity units (au) of bovicin hc5 ml(-1). l. monocytogenes cultures that were transferred with sublethal doses (12.5 au ml(-1)) could be adapted in stepwise fashion to higher doses of bovicin hc5. however, even 'adapted' cultures did not grow if 400 au ml(-1) was added. the effect of bovicin hc5 on l. monocytogenes was bactericidal, and viability decreased 5-7 logs after only 2 h of exposure. bovicin hc5 caused a nearly complete efflux of intracellular potassium in 15 min but only if the ph was less  than 6.0. when the ph was greater than 6.0, the cells maintained their potassium  pool. l. monocytogenes cells that were acid-adapted (final ph of 4.6) were as sensitive to bovicin hc5 as those that were not acid-adapted (final ph of 6.3). these results support the idea that bovicin hc5 could be effective in controlling listeria in contaminated silages.

AB  == a knowledge of the microbiological status of milk and of the different structures in the mammary glands has great importance in elucidating the pathogenesis of mammary gland infections. the objective of this study was to evaluate the microbiological status of various structures in the mammary glands from naturally infected dairy cows following slaughter. a total of 94 samples of milk, 184 samples of mammary parenchyma, 168 samples of gland cisterns, and 168 samples of  teat cisterns were collected for microbiological examination. microorganisms were detected in 59.9% of all samples, 67.0% of the milk samples, 70.1% of the mammary parenchymas, 55.9% of the gland cisterns and 48.8% of the teat cistern samples. when all samples were considered, coagulase-negative staphylococcus were the most prevalent (35.7%) followed by coagulase-positive staphylococcus (12.2%), corynebacterium bovis (2.4%), prototheca sp. (1.9%), and streptococcus dysgalactiae (1.5%). there was a significantly higher occurrence of microorganisms in the milk and mammary parenchyma compared to the gland cisterns  and teat cisterns.

TI  == verrucous endocarditis associated with streptococcus bovis in mink (mustela vison).
AB  == between 1998 and 2001, mortalities due to verrucous endocarditis were experienced at several mink farms. gram-positive cocci were isolated from the endocardium of  all the animals examined but not always from other internal organs. almost all the isolates were identified as streptococcus bovis and only a few isolates belonged to other streptococcus species. typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of a selection of isolates revealed several patterns and several  different clones. attempts to reproduce disease by the injection of cultures of a field isolate into healthy mink failed.

TI  == geographical difference of disease association in streptococcus bovis bacteraemia.
AB  == from 1996 to 2001, 48 streptococcus bovis strains were isolated from blood cultures of 37 patients in one hospital. median patient age was 68 years (range:  1 day-88 years). the male : female ratio was 23 : 14. most patients (97 %) had underlying diseases, including biliary tract disease in 14 (38 %), diabetes mellitus in 12 (32 %), liver parenchymal disease in seven (19 %), carcinoma of the colon in four (11 %) and other malignancies in four (11 %). no infective foci (indicative of primary bacteraemia) were identified in 15 patients (40 %) and 14  (38 %) had acute cholangitis/cholecystitis, but only four (11 %) had infective endocarditis. two (5 %), three (8 %) and 32 (87 %) patients had s. bovis of biotypes i, ii/1 and ii/2, respectively, and three (8 %), two (5 %) and 32 (87 %) patients had s. bovis of genotypes 1, 2a and 2b, respectively. all isolates were  sensitive to penicillin, cephalothin and vancomycin, 24 (65 %) were resistant to  erythromycin and 15 (41 %) were resistant to clindamycin (these strains were also resistant to erythromycin). thirteen isolates that were erythromycin- and clindamycin-resistant possessed the ermb gene, 10 possessed the ermt gene and one possessed both the ermb and ermt genes. overall, seven patients (19 %) died. in contrast to most other reports from western countries, where carcinoma of the colon and infective endocarditis were the major underlying disease and infective  focus associated with s. bovis bacteraemia, biliary tract disease and acute cholangitis and/or cholecystitis were the major underlying diseases associated with s. bovis bacteraemia in our locality.

TI  == [metabolism of rumen microbial populations formed on biosubstrates with different assimilation under the effect of pentachlorophenol].
AB  == it has been established that metabolism of mixed microbial population formed on easy assimilated sources of energy and nitrogen (concentrate diet) progressed on  higher level. there is increase of amilolytic activity, formation of lactate, ammonia, low molecular carbonic acids with predomination of propionate molar fraction. the increased resistance to effect of pentachlorophenol (pcp) is characteristic nature of the latter. the role of the most resistant synthrophic bacteria to pcp increases. the pure strains of streptococcus bovis and megasphaera elsdenii do not stop metabolism at 100 microm of pcp. mixed population of microorganisms formed on hard accessible biosubstrates (cellulose)  and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens have the increased cellulosolytic activity and while the high sensibility even to low doses of pcp (10-40 microm) is observed. it has been supposed that mechanism of pcp effect is ambiguous for various species of microbial complex of rumen. it's effect strength on all main chains of metabolism (membrane transport, energetic exchange, protein biosynthesis, etc.) significantly depends on capacity of pool of metabolic intermediates formed as a  result of definite program of biotechnology of nurture, but significantly decreases the harmful effect of biocides.

TI  == establishing populations of megasphaera elsdenii ye 34 and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ye 44 in the rumen of cattle fed high grain diets.
AB  == aim: to determine whether megasphaera elsdenii ye34 (lactic acid degrader) and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ye44 (alternative starch utilizer to streptococcus bovis) establish viable populations in the rumen of beef cattle rapidly changed from a forage-based to a grain-based diet. methods and results: five steers were  inoculated with the two bacterial strains (ye34 and ye44) and five served as uninoculated controls. with the exception of one animal in the control group, which developed acidosis, all steers rapidly adapted to the grain-based diet without signs of acidosis (ph decline and accumulation of lactic acid). bacterial populations of s. bovis, b. fibrisolvens and m. elsdenii were enumerated using real-time taq nuclease assays. populations of s. bovis remained constant (except  in the acidotic animal) at ca 10(7) cell equivalents (ce) ml-1 throughout the study. megasphaera elsdenii ye34, was not detectable in animals without grain in  the diet, but immediately established in inoculated animals, at 10(6) ce ml-1, and increased 100-fold in the first 4 days following inoculation. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, initially present at 10(8) ce ml-1, declined rapidly with the introduction of grain into the diet and was not detectable 8 days after grain introduction. conclusion: megasphaera elsdenii rapidly establishes a lactic acid-utilizing bacterial population in the rumen of grain-fed cattle 7-10 days earlier than in uninoculated cattle. significance and impact of the study: the study has demonstrated that rumen bacterial populations, and in particular the establishment of bacteria inoculated into the rumen for probiotic use, can be monitored by real-time pcr.

TI  == microbial and physiological characterization of weakly amylolytic but fast-growing lactic acid bacteria: a functional role in supporting microbial diversity in pozol, a mexican fermented maize beverage.
AB  == pozol is an acid beverage obtained from the natural fermentation of nixtamal (heat- and alkali-treated maize) dough. the concentration of mono- and disaccharides from maize is reduced during nixtamalization, so that starch is the main carbohydrate available for lactic acid fermentation. in order to provide some basis to understand the role of amylolytic lactic acid bacteria (alab) in this fermented food, their diversity and physiological characteristics were determined. forty amylolytic strains were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. four different biotypes were distinguished via ribotyping; streptococcus bovis strains were found to be predominant. streptococcus macedonicus, lactococcus lactis, and enterococcus sulfureus strains were also identified. s. bovis strain 25124 showed extremely low amylase yield relative to biomass (139 u g [cell dry weight](-1)) and specific rate of amylase  production (130.7 u g [cell dry weight](-1) h(-1)). in contrast, it showed a high specific growth rate (0.94 h(-1)) and an efficient energy conversion yield to bacterial cell biomass (0.31 g of biomass g of substrate(-1)). these would confer on the strain a competitive advantage and are the possible reasons for its dominance. transient accumulation of maltooligosaccharides during fermentation could presumably serve as energy sources for nonamylolytic species in pozol fermentation. this would explain the observed diversity and the dominance of nonamylolytic lactic acid bacteria at the end of fermentation. these results are  the first step to understanding the importance of alab during pozol fermentation.

TI  == adrenomedullin expression by gastric epithelial cells in response to infection.
AB  == many surface epithelial cells express adrenomedullin, a multifunctional peptide found in a wide number of body and cell systems. recently, we and others have proposed that adrenomedullin has an important novel role in host defense. this peptide has many properties in common with other cationic antimicrobial peptides, including the human beta-defensins. upon exposure of human gastric epithelial cells to viable cells of invasive or noninvasive strains of helicobacter pylori,  escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, or streptococcus bovis, a significant increase in adrenomedullin secretion from these cells was demonstrated. adrenomedullin gene expression was also increased in response to these microorganisms. similar observations were noted when these cells were incubated with proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 alpha (il-1 alpha), il-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha and lipopolysaccharide. in cultured cells and an animal infection model, increased adrenomedullin peptide and gene expression was  demonstrated when exposed to e. coli or mycobacterium paratuberculosis, respectively. the data suggest there is a strong association between epithelial infection, inflammation, and adrenomedullin expression, which may have clinical relevance. the regulation of adrenomedullin expression may have therapeutic applications, such as improving or enhancing mucosal immunity.

AB  == 'streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus' is a large bacterial complex including different species frequently isolated from infections of humans (streptococcus gallolyticus, streptococcus infantarius) or animals (s. bovis, s.  equinus, streptococcus alactolyticus). the separation of s. bovis into three different biotypes has been partially correlated with genetic differentiation. in addition, recent advances in bacterial phylogeny have led to the inclusion of streptococcus macedonicus and streptococcus waius in this complex. the aim of this study was to improve physiological differentiation between species related to the complex and to clarify their respective phylogenetic positions. in this study, physiological, genetic and phylogenetic analyses of a set of 88 streptococcal strains were performed. the diversity of strains of s. bovis biotype ii was analysed, and it was confirmed that they belong to different species, either s. equinus or s. infantarius. it was demonstrated that s. gallolyticus, s. bovis biotype ii.2, s. macedonicus and s. waius form a single dna cluster separated into three different subspecies. they are delineated by different biochemical traits, limited dna-dna relatedness and noticeable divergence in 16s rdna sequences. according to the current definition of species, the names s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus subsp. nov., s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus subsp. nov. and s. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus subsp. nov. are proposed for these three subspecies.

TI  == infectious endocarditis from streptococcus bovis associated with colonic carcinoma: case report and literature review.
AB  == background: many studies in the literature have warned of the need for investigation of colonic lesions among patients, especially elderly ones, who have bacteremia and/or endocarditis from streptococcus bovis. bacteremia and infectious endocarditis from streptococcus bovis may be related to the presence of neoplastic lesions in the large intestine and hepatic disease. aim: this report describes a patient who presented infectious endocarditis from streptococcus bovis associated with colonic carcinoma and tubular-villous adenomas. conclusions: the finding of this bacterium among patients with septicemia and/or endocarditis is also related to the presence of villous or tubular-villous adenomas in the large intestine. for this reason, complete and detailed investigation of the large intestine must be performed in patients with  infectious endocarditis, even in the absence of intestinal symptoms. an increased incidence of this condition or hepatic dysfunction has been reported among patients with infectious endocarditis from streptococcus bovis. patients with infectious endocarditis from streptococcus bovis and normal colonoscopy may be included in the group at risk for developing colonic cancer. the knowledge that there is an association between endocarditis from streptococcus bovis and carcinoma of the colon has important clinical implications. if the lesion can be  discovered at an early stage, curative resection may become possible.

AB  == following 2 cases of streprococcus bovis endocarditis with a high level of resistance to clindamycin during 2002, the authors reviewed their clinical experience with s. bovis bacteremia during 2 periods, starting in 1980. 81 episodes of s. bovis bacteremia represented approximately 1% of all episodes of bacteremia. in 32 (40%) cases the bacteremia represented endocarditis, in 15 (19%) the bacteremia originated from sick bowel, 11 (14%) were suspected to arise from urinary tract infection, 10 (12%) originated from biliary or peritoneal infection, and 13 from other or unknown sources. 25 (31%) of the bacteremias were polymicrobial. all of the isolates were highly susceptible to penicillin and clindamycin, with the following exceptions: 2 isolates had a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 0.5 mg/l to penicillin (in 1997) and 5 isolates had an mic of > 2 mg/l to clindamycin (in 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2002). the 2 most recent of these 5 had high-level resistance to clindamycin of > 256 mg/l. it seems that clindamycin resistance in s. bovis is an emerging phenomenon, in contrast to penicillin resistance, high levels of which have not yet been described in s. bovis.

TI  == identification of equine cecal bacteria producing amines in an in vitro model of  carbohydrate overload.
AB  == acute laminitis has been associated with the overgrowth of gram-positive bacteria within the equine hindgut, causing the release of factor(s) leading to ischemia-reperfusion of the digits. the products of fermentation which trigger acute laminitis are, as yet, unknown; however, vasoactive amines are possible candidates. the objectives of this study were to use an in vitro model of carbohydrate overload to study the change in populations of cecal streptococci and lactobacilli and to establish whether certain species of these bacteria were  capable of producing vasoactive amines from amino acids. cecal contents from 10 horses were divided into aliquots and incubated anaerobically with either corn starch or inulin (fructan; both at 1 g/100 ml). samples were taken at 6-h intervals over a 24-h period for enumeration of streptococci, lactobacilli, and gram-negative anaerobes by a dilution method onto standard selective growth media. the effects of the antibiotic virginiamycin (1 mg/100 ml) and calcium hydrogen phosphate (cahpo(4); 0.3 g/100 ml) were also examined. fermentation of excess carbohydrate was associated with increases in numbers of streptococci and  lactobacilli (2- to 3.5-log unit increases; inhibited by virginiamycin) but numbers of gram-negative anaerobes were not significantly affected. a screening agar technique followed by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis enabled the identification of 26 different bacterial strains capable of producing one or more vasoactive amines. these included members of the species streptococcus bovis and  five different lactobacillus spp. these data suggest that certain bacteria, whose overgrowth is associated with carbohydrate fermentation, are capable of producing vasoactive amines which may play a role in the pathogenesis of acute laminitis.

TI  == molecular characterization of hpr and related enzymes, and regulation of hpr phosphorylation in the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis.
AB  == molecular properties of hpr, enzyme i, and hpr kinase in streptococcus bovis, and the regulation of hpr phosphorylation were examined. the genes encoding hpr (ptsh) and enzyme i (ptsi) were found to be cotranscribed. two transcriptional start sites were detected in a region upstream of the hpr kinase gene (hprk). hpr kinase had both hpr-phosphorylating and hpr-dephosphorylating activities. the importance of phosphorylation of ser-46 in hpr was shown by using a mutant hpr in which ser-46 was replaced by ala. when s. bovis was grown in glucose-limited medium, the amount of seryl-phosphorylated hpr (hpr-[ser-p]) decreased drastically as the growth rate decreased. in contrast, the amount of histidyl-phosphorylated hpr (hpr-[his-p]) increased gradually as the growth rate  decreased. the amount of hpr kinase did not greatly change with the growth phase, whereas the intracellular p(i) concentration increased as the growth rate decreased. hpr-[ser-p] decreased as the intracellular p(i) increased as a consequence of inhibition of hpr kinase activity by p(i) and simultaneous enhancement of hpr-[ser-p] phosphatase activity by p(i). thus, it is conceivable  that the ratio of hpr-[ser-p] to hpr-[his-p] is regulated by the bifunctional activity of hpr kinase in response to intracellular p(i) concentration.

AB  == in this manuscript, the authors have sought to gain a better understanding of the interactions between escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from rogossa mrs agar along the digestive tract of grain- and forage-fed cattle.  e. coli from cattle receiving a high-grain diet were more numerous (p<0.05) than  from the high-forage diet and the highest numbers were in the faeces. isolates on rogossa mrs agar were always greater in the high-grain diet (p<0.05) and contained a significant number of lab. a random set of rogossa mrs agar colonies  was selected and artificial neural networks were used to develop a relationship between colony description and species which was validated using sequence analysis (16s rdna). the neural networks correctly predicted species in more than 80 % of cases and was composed, primarily, of lactobacillus vitulinus, lactobacillus ruminis, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus bovis, acidaminococcus fermentans and megasphaera elsdenii. in conjunction with statistical diversity indices, it was demonstrated that diversity in the high-fibre diet was always lower and was a consequence of the dominance of str. bovis. in contrast, the diversity in the high-grain diet was greater (p<0.05) and was a consequence of the decline in str. bovis. these data demonstrate that there is a positive relationship between coliform and lab isolates throughout the digestive tract of cattle, and diet is the major factor regulating bacterial composition.

AB  == condensed tannins in forage legumes improve the nutrition of sheep by reducing ruminal degradation of plant protein and increasing crude protein flow to the intestine. however, the effects of condensed tannins in forage legumes on rumen bacterial populations in vivo are poorly understood. the aim of this study was to investigate the specific effects of condensed tannins from lotus corniculatus on  four proteolytic rumen bacteria in sheep during and after transition from a ryegrass (lolium perenne)-white clover (trifolium repens) diet (i.e., low condensed tannins) to a lotus corniculatus diet (i.e., higher condensed tannins). the bacterial populations were quantified using a competitive polymerase chain reaction. lotus corniculatus was fed with or without ruminal infusions of polyethylene glycol (peg), which binds to and inactivates condensed tannins, enabling the effect of condensed tannins on bacterial populations to be examined. when sheep fed on ryegrass-white clover, populations of clostridium proteoclasticum b316t, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens c211a, eubacterium sp. c12b, and streptococcus bovis b315 were 1.5 x 10(8), 1.1 x 10(6), 4.6 x 10(8), and 7.1 x 10(6) ml(-1), respectively. when the diet was changed to lotus corniculatus, the  average populations (after 8-120 h) of c. proteoclasticum, b. fibrisolvens, eubacterium sp., and s. bovis decreased (p < 0.001) to 2.4 x 10(7), 1.1 x 10(5),  1.1 x 10(8), and 2.5 x 10(5) ml(-1), respectively. when peg was infused into the  rumen of sheep fed lotus corniculatus, the populations of c. proteoclasticum, b.  fibrisolvens, eubacterium sp., and s. bovis were higher (p < 0.01-0.001) than in  sheep fed lotus corniculatus without the peg infusion, with average populations (after 8-120 h) of 4.9 x 10(7), 3.8 x 10(5), 1.9 x 10(8), and 1.0 x 10(6), respectively. sheep fed the lotus corniculatus diet had lower rumen proteinase activity, ammonia, and soluble nitrogen (p < 0.05-0.001) than sheep that were fed lotus corniculatus plus peg. the lotus corniculatus diet reduced rumen nitrogen digestibility (p < 0.05) and ammonia pool size and increased the flow of undegraded feed nitrogen to the abomasum. the nitrogen intake, rumen non-ammonia  nitrogen pool size, rumen microbial non-ammonia nitrogen pool size, and abomasal  microbial non-ammonia nitrogen fluxes were similar both in sheep fed only lotus corniculatus and in sheep fed lotus corniculatus plus peg, but nonmicrobial non-ammonia nitrogen flux to the abomasum was higher (p < 0.01) for the sheep fed only lotus corniculatus. although condensed tannins in lotus corniculatus reduced the populations of some proteolytic bacteria, total ruminal microbial protein and microbial protein outflow to the abomasum were unchanged, suggesting a species-specific effect of condensed tannins on bacteria in the rumen.

TI  == the binding and degradation of nisin by mixed ruminal bacteria.
AB  == we found that nisin catalyzed potassium efflux from glycolyzing streptococcus bovis jb1 cell suspensions and that the steady state concentration of residual potassium was dependent upon the amount of nisin added. the relationship between  nisin concentration and potassium depletion was a saturation function that had considerable cooperativity. by pre-incubating mixed ruminal bacteria with nisin and removing them prior to s. bovis jb1 addition, it was possible to estimate the ability of mixed ruminal bacteria to bind or degrade nisin. low concentrations of mixed ruminal bacteria did not bind or degrade all of the nisin in 6 h, but little nisin remained if the mixed ruminal bacteria were present at more than 50  microg protein ml(-1). because cell-free ruminal fluid (10% v/v) inactivated the  nisin in less than 2 h, and this inactivation could be counteracted by autoclaving, ultra-filtration or proteinase inhibitor, it appeared that there was an enzymatic degradation of nisin. mixed ruminal bacteria degraded nisin rapidly, but this degradation did not prevent potassium depletion from mixed ruminal bacteria. these latter results indicated that nisin binding was faster than nisin degradation. the idea that nisin binding could protect nisin from degradation was supported by the observation that intact nisin could be extracted from mixed ruminal bacteria. these observations support the hypothesis that bacteriocins can be used to modify ruminal fermentation, but further work will be needed to see if these peptides can be produced economically.

TI  == the effect of bovicin hc5, a bacteriocin from streptococcus bovis hc5, on ruminal methane production in vitro.
AB  == methane represents a loss of feed energy to ruminant animals, and nutritionists have sought methods of inhibiting ruminal methane production. when mixed ruminal  bacteria (approximately 400 mg protein ml(-1)) from a cow fed timothy hay were incubated in vitro with carbon dioxide and hydrogen (0.5 atm) for less than 8 h,  the first-order rate of methane production was 17 micromol ml(-1). semi-purified  bacteriocin from streptococcus bovis hc5 (bovicin hc5) inhibited methane production, by as much as 50%, and even a low concentration of bovicin hc5 (128 activity units (au) ml(-1)) caused a significant decrease. mixed ruminal bacteria that were transferred successively retained their ability to produce methane from carbon dioxide and hydrogen, and the first-order rate of methane production did not decrease. cultures that were treated with bovicin hc5 (128 au ml(-1)) gradually lost their ability to produce methane, and methane was not detected after four transfers. these latter results indicated that ruminal methanogens could not adapt and become resistant to bovicin hc5. when the chromosomal dna was amplified with 16s rdna primers specific to archaea, digested with restriction enzymes (hhai and haeiii) and separated on agarose gels, approximately 12 fragments were observed. dna from control and treated cultures (third transfer) had the same fragment pattern indicating bovicin hc5 was not selective. given the perception that the routine use of antibiotics in animal feeds should be avoided, bacteriocins may provide an alternative strategy for decreasing ruminal methane production.

TI  == effects of pneumoperitoneum on hemodynamic and systemic immunologic responses to  peritonitis in pigs.
AB  == background: experimental evidence supporting the safety of laparoscopic intervention during sepsis is limited. the purpose of this study was to evaluate  the effects of pneumoperitoneum on immunologic and hemodynamic responses to peritoneal sepsis. materials and methods: a porcine model of peritonitis was created using an intraperitoneal autologous fecal inoculum. pigs were then subjected to one of four procedures 24 h postinoculation (n = 6 per group): laparotomy, co(2) laparoscopy, helium laparoscopy, and anesthesia only (1.5% isoflurane in 100% o(2), mechanical ventilation). venous blood samples were obtained prior to inoculation, and at 24 (prior to procedure), 30, 48, 72, and 96 h postinoculation to determine white blood count (wbc) with differential, c-reactive protein (crp), tumor necrosis factor, and bacteremia. heart rate, end-tidal co(2) (etco(2)), mean arterial blood pressure (map), and arterial blood gas variables were also measured at baseline and every 30 min throughout the procedure. results: postoperative blood cultures confirmed systemic bacteremia in all groups at all time periods postinoculation. following inoculation, wbc, band  cell count, and crp remained elevated above baseline in all groups throughout the study (p < 0.01). however, no significant differences in these parameters were observed among groups. in the co(2) laparoscopy group, map, etco(2), and arterial pco(2) were increased above baseline, while ph was decreased throughout the procedure (p < 0.01). conclusions: in this animal model of peritonitis, co(2) pneumoperitoneum induced hypercapnia, acidemia, and systemic hypertension intraoperatively, without a discernable effect on systemic immune function.

TI  == factors affecting the antibacterial activity of the ruminal bacterium, streptococcus bovis hc5.
AB  == streptococcus bovis hc5 inhibits a variety of s. bovis strains and other gram-positive bacteria, but factors affecting this activity had not been defined. batch culture studies indicated that s. bovis hc5 did not inhibit s. bovis jb1 (a non-bacteriocin-producing strain) until glucose was depleted and cells were entering stationary phase, but slow-dilution-rate, continuous cultures (0.2 h(-1)) had as much antibacterial activity as stationary-phase batch cultures. because the activity of continuous cultures (0.2-1.2 h(-1)) was inversely related to the glucose consumption rate, it appeared that the antibacterial activity was  being catabolite repressed by glucose. when the ph of continuous cultures (0.2 h(-1)) was decreased from 6.7 to 5.4, antibacterial activity doubled, but this activity declined at ph values less than 5.0. continuous cultures (0.2 h(-1)) that had only ammonia as a nitrogen source had antibacterial activity, and large  amounts of trypticase (10 mg ml(-1)) caused only a 2.0-fold decline in the amount of hc5 cell-associated protein that was needed to prevent s. bovis jb1 growth. because s. bovis hc5 was able to produce antibacterial activity over a wide range of culture conditions, there is an increased likelihood that this activity could  have commercial application.

TI  == bovicin hc5, a bacteriocin from streptococcus bovis hc5.
AB  == previous work indicated that streptococcus bovis hc5 had significant antibacterial activity, and even nisin-resistant s. bovis jb1 cells could be strongly inhibited. s. bovis hc5 inhibited a variety of gram-positive bacteria and the spectrum of activity was similar to monensin, a commonly used feed additive. the crude extracts (ammonium sulfate precipitation) were inactivated by pronase e and trypsin, but the activity was resistant to heat, proteinase k and alpha-chymotrypsin. most of the antibacterial activity was cell associated, but it could be liberated by acidic nacl (100 mm, ph 2.0) without significant cell lysis. when glycolysing s. bovis jb1 cells were treated with either crude or acidic nacl extracts, intracellular potassium declined and this result indicated  the antibacterial activity was mediated by a pore-forming peptide. the peptide could be purified by hplc and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis indicated that it had a molecular mass of approximately 2440 da. the terminal amino acid sequence was vgxryasxpgxswkyvxf. the unnamed amino acid residues (designated by x) had approximately the same position as dehydroalanines found in some lantibiotics, but samples that were reduced and alkylated prior to edman degradation did not have cysteine residues. the only other bacteriocin that had significant similarity was the lantibiotic precursor of streptococcus pyogenes sf370, but the identity was only 55%. based on these results, the bacteriocin of s. bovis hc5 appears to be novel and the authors now  designate it as bovicin hc5.

TI  == what happened to the streptococci: overview of taxonomic and nomenclature changes.
AB  == since the division of the streptococcus genus into enterococci, lactococci, and streptococci in 1984, many changes in the nomenclature and taxonomy of the streptococcus genus have taken place. the application of genetic comparisons has  improved the proper classification of the different species. the lancefield system of serogrouping the streptococci by the expression of beta-hemolysis on blood agar plates is still very useful for the identification of streptococci for patient management. the lancefield grouping system cannot be used in itself for accurate identification of specific beta-hemolytic species, but it can be a useful part of the identification procedure. except for identification of the "streptococcus bovis group" of species and streptococcus suis, lancefield grouping is of little value in identification of the non-beta-hemolytic streptococci and related genera. in fact, identification of the non-beta-hemolytic species is problematic for conventional as well as commercially available identification procedures. a combination of conventional tests and specific chromogenic tests suggested by several investigators is presented and discussed. tables are included that suggest tests and procedures to guide investigators attempting to identify all the species.

AB  == aims: to investigate the activity response of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide  dismutase (sod) and glutathione peroxidase (gshpx) of the rumen bacterium streptococcus bovis following exposure to mercury(ii) chloride (hgcl(2) in the presence of plant antioxidants. methods and results: streptococcus bovis was grown with 0 or 5 microg ml(-1) of hgcl(2) alone or together with antioxidant substances (aos): seleno-l-methionine (se), alpha-tocopherol (alpha toc), beta-carotene (beta car), melatonin (mel). the activities of sod and ghpx were estimated in supernatants of disrupted bacterial cells. a significant decrease in the strep. bovis sod activity in the presence of hgcl(2) and tested aos, except mel, was observed. the gshpx activity of strep. bovis was under the same cultivation conditions nonsignificantly changed and a significant decrease in the gshpx activity was recorded only in the presence of beta car. conclusions: the positive effect of se, alpha toc and beta car on the elimination of environmental stress, evoked by mercury, in ruminal bacterium strep. bovis in vitro was documented. significance and impact of the study: the potential role of plant antioxidants in elimination of the environmental stress of ruminal bacteria evoked by heavy metals is discussed.

AB  == a study was conducted to determine whether bacterial direct-fed microbials (dfm)  could be used to minimize the risk of acidosis in feedlot cattle receiving high concentrate diets. six ruminally cannulated steers, previously adapted to a high  concentrate diet, were used in a double 3 x 3 latin square to study the effects of dfm on feed intake, ruminal ph, and ruminal and blood characteristics. steers  were provided ad libitum access to a diet containing steam-rolled barley, barley  silage, and a protein-mineral supplement at 87, 9, and 4% (dm basis), respectively. treatments were as follows: control, propionibacterium p15 (p15), and propionibacterium p15 and enterococcus faecium ef212 (pe). the bacterial treatments (10(9) cfu/g) plus whey powder carrier, or whey powder alone for control, were top-dressed once daily at the time of feeding (10 g/[steer/d]). periods consisted of 2 wk of adaptation and 1 wk of measurements. ruminal ph was  continuously measured for 6 d using indwelling electrodes. dry matter intake and  ruminal ph (mean, minimum, hours, and area ph < 5.8 or < 5.5) were not affected by treatment (p > 0.05). however, supplementation with p15 increased protozoal numbers (p < 0.05) with a concomitant increase in ruminal nh3 concentration (p <  0.01) and a decrease in the number of amylolytic bacteria (p < 0.05) compared with the control. streptococcus bovis, enumerated using a selective medium, was numerically reduced with supplementation of pe. although blood ph and blood glucose were not affected by dfm supplementation, steers fed pe had numerically lower concentrations of blood co2 than control steers, which is consistent with a reduced risk of metabolic acidosis. although the bacterial dfm used in this study did not induce changes in dmi or ruminal and blood ph, some rumen and blood variables indicated that the bacterial dfm used in this study may decrease the risk of acidosis in feedlot cattle.

AB  == the taxonomic dissection of the streptococcus bovis-streptococcus equinus group was carried out upon obtaining sequences for the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (soda) of the type strains of s. bovis, streptococcus caprinus, s. equinus, streptococcus gallolyticus, streptococcus infantarius, streptococcus macedonicus and streptococcus waius. the soda sequences of 29 streptococcal strains of animal and human origin that were related to s. bovis were also sequenced. a phylogenetic analysis of the soda sequences revealed that the s. bovis-s. equinus group comprises five different clusters that correspond to five  distinct species. the type strains of s. bovis and s. equinus were associated in  the same cluster, corresponding to the species s. equinus. the type strains of s. caprinus, s. gallolyticus, s. macedonicus and s. waius were associated in the same cluster, which defined a single species containing s. gallolyticus and its junior synonym s. caprinus, and s. macedonicus and its junior synonym s. waius. the two subspecies thought to constitute the species s. infantarius, namely s. infantarius subsp. infantarius and 's. infantarius subsp. coli', were located in  two distinct clusters. one of these clusters defined the species s. infantarius and included the type strain of s. infantarius subsp. infantarius. the other cluster defined 's. infantarius subsp. coli', leading to the proposal of its reclassification as the novel species streptococcus lutetiensis (nem 782t = cip 106849t). the remaining cluster comprised all of the strains previously identified as belonging to s. bovis biotype 11.2, leading to the proposal to reassign these strains to the novel species streptococcus pasteurianus (nem 1202t = cip 107122t). the results of the phylogenetic analysis were confirmed by dna-dna hybridization experiments, thus demonstrating that sequence databases of  defined dna targets, such as soda, may constitute a valuable alternative approach for modern bacterial systematics.

AB  == introduction: bacterial meningitis in adult patients, produced by streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae, is not common. case report: we report the case of a 74 year old male patient with meningitis and endocarditis due to streptococcus bovis (group d, not enterococcus), sensitive to penicillin (cmi< 0.1 mg/l), with no characteristic clinical or analytical discoveries. a gastrointestinal exploration revealed only diverticles in the colon and two lesions compatible with splenic infarction, observed by using computerised axial  tomography of the abdomen. the patient responded favourably to a four week course of antibiotics; he remained asymptomatic, afebrile and culture negative after the therapy was stopped. conclusions: in many previously reported cases, there is an  association with gastrointestinal illness, endocarditis or oral lesions. gram staining of the cerebrospinal fluid is usually negative and the neurological signs are often subtle. in the case of bacteraemia, endocarditis or s. bovis meningitis, the presence of an underlying pathology of the colon due to the frequent association between these processes must be ruled out. treatment with penicillin g is usually sufficient.

TI  == the bacteriocins of ruminal bacteria and their potential as an alternative to antibiotics.
AB  == beef cattle have been fed ionophores and other antibiotics for more than 20 years to decrease ruminal fermentation losses (e.g methane and ammonia) and increase feed efficiency, and these improvements have been explained by an inhibition of gram-positive ruminal bacteria. ionophores are not used to treat human disease, but there has been an increased perception that antibiotics should not be used as feed additives. some bacteria produce small peptides (bacteriocins) that inhibit  gram-positive bacteria. in vitro experiments indicated that the bacteriocin, nisin, and the ionophore, monensin, had similar effects on ruminal fermentation.  however, preliminary results indicated that mixed ruminal bacteria degraded nisin, and the ruminal bacterium, streptococcus bovis, became highly nisin-resistant. a variety of ruminal bacteria produce bacteriocins, and bacteriocin production has, in some cases, been correlated with changes in ruminal ecology. some ruminal bacteriocins are as potent as nisin in vitro, and resistance can be circumvented. based on these results, ruminal bacteriocins may  provide an alternative to antibiotics in cattle rations.

AB  == aims: in a rabbit caecal bacterium bifidobacterium pseudolongum, metabolites of pectin and glucose, and activities of enzymes involved in the degradation of pectin were assayed. simultaneously, activities of these enzymes were assayed in  a rumen pectinolytic strain of streptococcus bovis. methods and results: a strain b. pseudolongum p6 which grew best on pectin was selected among bifidobacteria isolated from the rabbit caecum. cultures of b. pseudolongum p6 grown on pectin produced significantly less formate, lactate and ethanol, and more acetate and succinate than cultures grown on glucose. no co2 production on pectin was observed. pectin macromolecule was degraded by extracellular pectinase (ec 3.2.1.15). cell extracts possessed the activity of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (kdpg) aldolase (ec 4.1.2.14). streptococcus bovis x4, possessed activity of exopectate lyase and pectinase, but not that of kdpg aldolase. conclusions: our results are consistent with the assumption that in b. pseudolongum p6 acidic products of pectin degradation are catabolized via a modified entner-doudoroff pathway, as shown previously in rumen pectin-utilizing  bacteria. the missing kdpg aldolase activity in strep. bovis x4 seems to be the reason for the absence of growth of this bacterium on pectin. significance and impact of the study: information on polysaccharide metabolism in bifidobacteria is fragmentary. this study extends the knowledge on pectin metabolism in intestinal bacteria.

AB  == streptococcus bovis is the rare cause of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in decompensated cirrhosis. s. bovis bacteremia has long been known to be associated with colon cancer. we describe seven patients and review the seven previous reports of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis patients with s. bovis infection. most of the patients had cirrhosis and presented with fever, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and jaundice. colonic adenomatous polyps with dysplastic change were found in 18.2% of the patients. the approach to this group of patients requires diagnostic paracentesis, blood cultures, ascitic fluid culture, and treatment with antimicrobial agents. intravenous penicillin is still the antimicrobial agent of first choice (mean minimum inhibitory concentration for penicillin = 0.05 microg/ml). s. bovis is an infrequent cause of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. the physician could make a case that colonoscopy is not needed because the patient is very sick and the possibility of gi pathology, especially colonic lesions, has been low. however, it may be that colonoscopy should be done if there are clinical suggestions to do so or the patient is well  enough to withstand surgery.

TI  == special issues in the management of infective endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci.
AB  == gram-positive cocci, mainly streptococci and staphylococci, continue to cause the majority of cases of infective endocarditis. among the streptococci causing ie, the long-standing predominance of oral or viridans-group streptococci has progressively faded, while the number of cases caused by "enteric streptococci" (streptococcus bovis and enterococci) has increased. while most oral streptococci and s. bovis strains remain fully sensitive to penicillin, nutritionally variant  streptococci--now renamed abiotrophia--and enterococci can exhibit resistance to  penicillin and/or glycopeptides that makes endocarditis more difficult to treat.  among the staphylococci causing endocarditis, the increasing proportion of coagulase-negative and methicillin-resistant strains observed in recent years has changed the approach to choice of antibiotic therapy. the purpose of this paper is to focus on some new aspects of the management of antibiotic therapy of ie due to streptococci and staphylococci, including recent developments such as once-daily aminoglycoside administration in ie, outpatient antibiotic therapy, and the evaluation of new antibiotics.

TI  == source of enterococci in a farmhouse raw-milk cheese.
AB  == enterococci are widely distributed in raw-milk cheeses and are generally thought  to positively affect flavor development. their natural habitats are the human and animal intestinal tracts, but they are also found in soil, on plants, and in the  intestines of insects and birds. the source of enterococci in raw-milk cheese is  unknown. in the present study, an epidemiological approach with pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis (pfge) was used to type 646 enterococcus strains which were isolated from a cheddar-type cheese, the milk it was made from, the feces of cows and humans associated with the cheese-making unit, and the environment, including the milking equipment, the water used on the farm, and the cows' teats. nine different pfge patterns, three of enterococcus casseliflavus, five of enterococcus faecalis, and one of enterococcus durans, were found. the same three clones, one of e. faecalis and two of e. casseliflavus, dominated almost all of the milk, cheese, and human fecal samples. the two e. casseliflavus clones were also found in the bulk tank and the milking machine even after chlorination, suggesting that a niche where enterococci could grow was present and that contamination with enterococci begins with the milking equipment. it is likely but unproven that the enterococci present in the human feces are due to consumption of the cheese. cow feces were not considered the source of enterococci in the cheese, as enterococcus faecium and streptococcus bovis, which largely dominated the cows' intestinal tracts, were not found in either the milk  or the cheese.

TI  == molecular characterization and expression of pyruvate formate-lyase-activating enzyme in a ruminal bacterium, streptococcus bovis.
AB  == to clarify the significance of the activation of pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl) by  pfl-activating enzyme (pfl-ae) in streptococcus bovis, the molecular properties and gene expression of pfl-ae were investigated. s. bovis pfl-ae was deduced to consist of 261 amino acids with a molecular mass of 29.9 kda and appeared to be a monomer protein. similar to escherichia coli pfl-ae, s. bovis pfl-ae required fe(2+) for activity. the gene encoding pfl-ae (act) was found to be polycistronic, and the pfl gene (pfl) was not included. however, the act mrna level changed in parallel with the pfl mrna level, responding to growth conditions, and the change was contrary to the change in the lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) mrna level. pfl-ae synthesis appeared to change in parallel with pfl synthesis. introduction of a recombinant plasmid containing s. bovis pfl and the pfl promoter into s. bovis did not affect formate and lactate production, which suggests that the activity of the pfl promoter is low. when the pfl promoter was replaced by the s. bovis ldh promoter, pfl was overexpressed, which  caused an increase in the formate-to-lactate ratio. however, when pfl-ae was overexpressed, the formate-to-lactate ratio did not change, suggesting that pfl-ae was present at a level that was high enough to activate pfl. when both pfl-ae and pfl were overexpressed, the formate-to-lactate ratio further increased. it is conceivable that ldh activity is much higher than pfl activity,  which may explain why the formate-to-lactate ratio is usually low.

TI  == study of the intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility of partial single base c-sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and its applicability for the identification of members of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the use of single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene (sbcs) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus streptococcus. for sbcs, only dd-ctp's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. the reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. the interlaboratory reproducibility proved  to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. sbcs did not differentiate between the closely related species s. constellatus and s. intermedius. also s. thermophilus and s. vestibularis as well as s. mitis and s. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. the previously reported heterogeneity within the species s. equinus was reflected by sbcs. for all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. in conclusion, single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene  could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to  automatize than full sequence determination.

TI  == comparison between streptococcus macedonicus and streptococcus waius strains and  reclassification of streptococcus waius (flint et at. 1999) as streptococcus macedonicus (tsakalidou et al. 1998).
AB  == two species of dairy streptococci, streptococcus waius and streptococcus macedonicus, were originally characterized by 16s-23s intergenic spacer sequence  analysis, random amplified polymorphic dna fingerprinting, pfge analysis and dna-dna reassociation experiments. all genetic data suggested that s. waius strains belong to the previously described species s. macedonicus. likewise, the  phenotypic characterization showed that strains of s. macedonicus and s. waius were highly related and easily differentiated from the closest phylogenetic neighbour, streptococcus bovis, principally by their failure to produce a blackening reaction in medium containing aesculin. the utilization of maltose and cellobiose by s. macedonicus/s. waius strains allowed their differentiation from  the most studied dairy species, streptococcus thermophilus. on the basis of genetic and phenotypic data s. macedonicus and s. waius species should be considered synonyms and s. macedonicus has the priority.

TI  == isolation from a shea cake digester of a tannin-degrading streptococcus gallolyticus strain that decarboxylates protocatechuic and hydroxycinnamic acids, and emendation of the species.
AB  == a facultatively anaerobic, mesophilic, non-motile, non-sporulating bacterium, designated strain b7, was isolated from an anaerobic digester fed with shea cake  rich in tannins and aromatic compounds, after enrichment on tannic acid. the coccoid cells (less than 2 microm in diameter) occurred in pairs or short chains  and stained gram-positive. strain b7 fermented a wide range of carbohydrates (cellobiose, fructose, galactose, glucose, lactose, maltose, mannitol, melibiose, raffinose and trehalose), grew optimally at ph 7.0 and had a g+c content of 40.4+/-0.3 mol%. strain b7 was closely related to streptococcus gallolyticus acm  3611t, a member of the streptococcus bovis rrna cluster, with a sequence similarity of 98% and a dna hybridization value of 86 mol%. isolate b7 hydrolysed tannic acid and decarboxylated gallic acid to pyrogallol, traits also observed in s. gallolyticus acm 3611t. in addition, both strains decarboxylated protocatechuic acid to catechol, p-coumaric acid to 4-vinylphenol, caffeic acid to 4-vinylcatechol and ferulic acid to 4-vinylguaiacol. an unsubstituted para-hydroxyl group on the benzene ring was required for decarboxylation. glucose addition markedly increased the conversion rate. as these traits were not described previously, emendation of the description of the species streptococcus  gallolyticus is proposed.

TI  == effects of exogenous ammonia or free amino acids on proteolytic activity and protein breakdown products in streptococcus bovis, prevotella albensis, and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens.
AB  == we studied in details the ammonia or free amino acids (aa) effects on proteolytic activity of three ruminal bacteria: enzymatic activities and protein breakdown products were measured at the end of the exponential growth phase. in streptococcus bovis the simultaneous uptake of ammonia and probably small peptides induced a decline in total proteolytic activity as a result of changes in endopeptidasic activities. with free aa, the tendency for the endopeptidasic activities to specialise was more evident and the total proteolytic activity decreased too. in prevotella albensis, the inhibition of proteolysis with free aa was linked to the disappearance of free endopeptidases, to the specialization of  cell-associated endopeptidases and to the decrease in exopeptidases. the decrease of proteolysis in p. albensis when ammonia was added was more difficult to interpret. with ammonia or aa butyrivibro fibrisolvens developed a distinct behavior of those expressed by the other species: the increase of the total proteolytic activity could be explained by a better balance of the endopeptidases expressed. it then clearly appeared that the expression of the proteolytic activities are linked to the nature and/or to the quantity of the nitrogen source. this leads each species to adopt its own nutritional strategy in order to adapt to the environmental conditions of the ruminal ecosystem.

TI  == development and application of quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay based on the abi 7700 system (taqman) for detection and quantification of mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis.
AB  == numerous reports have described diagnostic methods based on the polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) used to detect mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, the causative agent of johne's disease. the result of conventional pcr tests has been only qualitative, either positive or negative; it does not present any quantitative information about the number of the agents in the specimen. a quantitative pcr method (is900 taqman) was developed to measure the number of m.  a. paratuberculosis organisms present in field and clinical samples. the sensitivity of is900 taqman was 1 colony-forming unit (cfu) for m. a. paratuberculosis atcc 19698. the specificity of the method was determined by testing 14 mycobacterial species (m. abscessus, m. asiaticum, m. avium subsp. avium, m. bovis, m. fortuitum subsp. fortuitum, m. intracellulare, m. kansasii, m. marinum, m. phlei, m. scrofulaceum, m. simiae, m. smegmatis, m. terrae, and m. ulcerans) and 9 nonmycobacterial species (borrelia burgdorferi, chlamydia psittaci, ehrlichia canis, e. equi, e. risticii, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, streptococcus equi, and s. zooepidemicus). even at high cell numbers (10(5) cfu/reaction), most of the organisms tested negative for the is900 insertion element except m. marinum and m. scrofulaceum. this finding for m. scrofulaceum was consistent with previous reports that several m. scrofulaceum-like isolates were positive for is900. those isolates had 71-79% homology with m. a. paratuberculosis in the region of is900. when used in conjunction with the new liquid medium-based esp culture system ii for bovine clinical fecal samples, is900 taqman confirmed that the esp ii-positive samples contained 10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml of m. a. paratuberculosis. all of the 222 esp ii-positive and acid-fast bacilli-positive samples tested in this study were positive by is900 taqman. is900 taqman was also useful in the study of growth characteristics of 3 groups of m. a. paratuberculosis strains in bovine fecal samples from 3 shedding levels (heavy, medium, and low) based on cell numbers measured by herrold egg yolk (hey) agar culture. when cultured in esp medium, m.  a. paratuberculosis reached 10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml within 2 weeks for heavy shedders, 3-4 weeks for medium, and 6-8 weeks for low shedders. no significant growth was observed after up to 5 weeks of incubation for some of low shedders. no or extremely slow growth characteristic of low shedders might be a possible explanation for frequent false-negative results by hey. the detection time was dependent on the inoculum size and the growth rate of m. a. paratuberculosis. generation times were inversely proportional to the shedding level: 1-2 days for  medium and heavy shedders and >4 days for low shedders. is900 taqman could be a useful tool for determining viable cell counts by measuring changes in cell numbers over the incubation period.

AB  == the first objective of this study was to develop an immunohistochemical procedure for rapid detection of rhodococcus equi in impression smears from affected organs of foals on postmortem examination. the second aim was to demonstrate whether r.  equi can be detected in smears of tracheal exudates collected from the same foals using an immunohistochemical method. impression smears and cryostat and paraffin-embedded sections were made from the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes of three foals (a, b and c) that had died of respiratory disease caused by r. equi, and also from the caudal mesenteric lymph node of foal a. impression smears were made from the tracheal exudates of all foals. an affinity purified rabbit igg was used for the immunohistochemical demonstration of r. equi. this antibody  reacted with serotype 1 of r. equi in ouchterlony's immunodiffusion and in the passive haemagglutination test, but not with other serotypes or with streptococcus equi ssp. equi or staphylococcus aureus, and failed to give an immunohistochemical reaction with mycobacterium bovis or m. paratuberculosis. the immunohistochemical method proved to be of identical sensitivity to bacterial culture; moreover, from the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes of one foal, r. equi could only be detected by this method. r. equi was demonstrated in smears of the tracheal exudates of all three foals. the results of this study indicate that the immunohistochemical method may be used for the rapid detection of r. equi in  impression smears from the affected organs, especially abscesses, obtained postmortem, and possibly as a tool for diagnosing r. equi pneumonia in live foals by examining smears of tracheal aspirates.

TI  == discitis associated with pregnancy and spinal anesthesia.
AB  == discitis (inflammation of the intervertebral disk) most commonly develops as a rare complication of bacterial infection or chemical or mechanical irritation during spine surgery (1) with a postoperative incidence of 1%-2.8% (2). it is also a complication of discography-the intradiscal injection of saline or contrast material (3). the incidence of postdiscography discitis is 1%-4% (3); no cases have been reported when prophylactic antibiotics have been used, supporting the theory of bacterial contamination (3). although it is controversial whether discitis can be caused by an aseptic or infectious process, recent data suggest that persistent discitis is almost always bacterial (4). honan et al. (5) reported 16 cases of spontaneous discitis and reviewed another 52 patients from the literature. in their series, patients tended to have one or more comorbid conditions, such as diabetes, vertebral fracture, or a preexisting spine injury.  spontaneous discitis has also been associated with advanced age, iv drug abuse, iv access contamination, urinary tract infection, and immunocompromised states (5,6). no cases of infectious discitis associated with pregnancy and spinal anesthesia have been reported in the english literature. discitis presents as spasmodic pain in the back that may be referred to the hips or groin (7). the pain may radiate to the lower extremities. the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is  usually increased. radiological changes in discitis include narrowing of the intervertebral disk space, vertebral sclerosis, and erosion of the end plates. the best diagnostic measure may be magnetic resonance imaging (mri) or a combination of bone and gallium scanning (2). the mainstay for discitis treatment is pain control and antibiotics; surgical intervention is usually not required. complications of discitis include intervertebral fusion, epidural abscess, and paralysis. implications: this is a case report of a disk infection (discitis) caused by the bacteria, streptococcus bovis after spinal anesthesia for cesarean  delivery. s. bovis rarely causes discitis, and spinal anesthesia for labor and delivery has not been reported as a cause of discitis.

TI  == high prevalence of inducible erythromycin resistance among streptococcus bovis isolates in taiwan.
AB  == susceptibilities to 13 antimicrobial agents were determined by measurement of mics for 60 isolates of streptococcus bovis from blood cultures. thirty-eight isolates (63.3%) had high-level resistance to erythromycin (mics, >or=128 microg/ml). among the 38 erythromycin-resistant strains, 21 isolates (55%) had inducible resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (imls isolates) and 17 (45%) had constitutive resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (cmls isolates). tetracycline resistance was also found among all of the erythromycin-resistant strains. none of the strains displayed resistance to penicillin, chloramphenicol, or vancomycin. detection of erythromycin resistance  genes by pcr and sequencing indicated that all 17 cmls isolates were positive for the ermb gene and that 7 of 21 imls isolates carried the ermb gene and the remaining 14 imls isolates carried the ermt gene. sequence analysis of amplified  partial ermb fragments (594 bp) from s. bovis isolates revealed a 99.8% nucleotide identity and a 100% amino acid homology compared with the sequences from gene banks. the sequences of amplified fragments with primers targeted for ermc were shown to be very similar to that of ermgt (ermt) from lactobacillus reuteri (98.5% nucleotide identity). this is the first report to describe the detection of the ermt class of erythromycin resistance determinants in s. bovis.  the high rate of inducible erythromycin resistance among s. bovis isolates in taiwan was not reported before. the imls s. bovis isolates were shown to be heterogeneous by randomly amplified polymorphic dna analysis. these results indicate that the prevalence of inducible erythromycin resistance in s. bovis in  taiwan is very high and that most of the resistant strains carry the ermt or the  ermb gene.

AB  == five strains of proteolytic rumen bacteria were treated with condensed tannins (ct) purified from lotus pedunculatus and lotus corniculatus to investigate their effect on the growth of these bacteria in vitro. streptococcus bovis ncfb 2476, eubacterium sp. c124b, prevotella bryantii b14, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c, and clostridium proteoclasticum b316t were tested against 200, 400, and 600 microg ct x ml(-1) extracted from l. pedunculatus and l. corniculatus. in the absence of ct, all bacterial strains showed typical growth and reached maximum optical density (od) after 6-8 h of incubation in a plant protein medium. growth  of eubacterium sp., p. bryantii, and b. fibrisolvens was inhibited (p < 0.01-0.001) more by the ct from l. pedunculatus than by the ct from l. corniculatus. all strains continued to grow in the presence of 200 microg x ml(-1) of the ct from l. pedunculatus, but attained significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) lower maximum od600 values than (minus ct) controls, except for s. bovis. at 400  and 600 microg x ml(-1), the addition of ct from l. pedunculatus inhibited (p < 0.05-0.001) the growth of all bacterial strains tested compared with controls. the growth of eubacterium sp. and p. bryantii was stimulated for the first 4-6 h  of incubation (p < 0.001) by 200 microg x ml(-1) of ct from l. corniculatus, but  then declined leading to a significant difference in od values compared with the  controls. at 400 microg x ml(-1), the ct from l. corniculatus reduced (p < 0.05-0.01) the growth of all strains except s. bovis, while 600 microg x ml(-1) inhibited (p < 0.01-0.001) the growth of all strains. to study the mechanism of ct action, the degradation of the large subunit (lsu) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco; fraction 1 leaf protein) was followed after bacterial cells or rubisco were preincubated with ct  extracted from l. corniculatus and l. pedunculatus. both preincubations decreased lsu degradation, but they differed in their response to polyethylene glycol (peg) addition. addition of peg to ct-rubisco preincubations negated the effects of ct, while peg addition to ct-bacteria preincubations did not. this implies that the ct-bacterial interaction is stronger than the ct-rubisco interaction or the interaction is of a different type. also, l. pedunculatus ct reduced the degradation of the lsu to a greater extent than the ct from l. corniculatus when  preincubated with bacteria.

TI  == prevalence of liver disease in patients with streptococcus bovis bacteraemia.
AB  == background: the relationship between streptococcus bovis bacteraemia and gastrointestinal disease (mainly colon cancer) is well known. patients with advanced liver disease are prone to bacteraemia. less attention has been paid to  the association between liver disease and streptococcus bovis bacteraemia in the  literature. aims: to evaluate the prevalence of liver disease in patients with s. bovis bacteraemia. patients and methods: twenty-two episodes of s. bovis bacteraemia in 20 adults (13 males and seven females, with a median age of 61 years, range 32-94 years) were detected in a single hospital over a 7-year period. ten of them had endocarditis. patients' clinical records were reviewed, with special focus on underlying liver and gastrointestinal disease. results: eleven patients (55%) had a chronic liver disease. nine of them were cirrhotics.  ten patients had a history of chronic alcohol abuse, and four patients had hepatitis c virus antibodies (associated with alcohol abuse in three cases). large bowel disease was present in six out of 13 evaluable patients (adenocarcinoma in three cases). patients with liver disease were younger than patients without it. mortality related to s. bovis bacteraemia was particularly high among patients with advanced liver disease (child-pugh state c). bacteraemia recurred two times in one alcoholic cirrhotic, who was diagnosed as having a dukes-b colon cancer 4.5 years after the first episode of s. bovis bacteraemia. conclusions: in our area, s. bovis bacteraemia is frequently associated with chronic liver disease. liver disease may be a predisposing factor for s. bovis bacteraemia.

TI  == dextran acceptor reaction of streptococcus sobrinus glucosyltransferase gtf-i as  revealed by using uniformly 13c-labeled sucrose.
AB  == a sucrose glucosyltransferase gtf-i from cariogenic streptococcus sobrinus transferred the uniformly 13c-labeled glucosyl residue ([u-(13)c]glc) from [u-(13)c]sucrose to exogenous dextran t500 at the non-reducing-end, mostly by alpha-(1-->6) linkages and partially by alpha-(1-->3) linkages, as revealed by the 13c-(13)c nmr coupling pattern. with increasing amounts of [u-(13)c]sucrose,  transfer of [u-(13)c]glc to the alpha-(1-->3)-linked chain became predominant without increase in the number of chains. the transfer of [u-(13)c]glc to an isomaltopentaose acceptor occurred similarly to its transfer to t500. alpha-(1-->3)-branches in the [u-(13)c]dextran, specifically synthesized from [u-(13)c]sucrose by a streptococcus bovis dextransucrase, were not formed by gtf-i, as judged by the observation that a newly-formed alpha-1,3,6-branched [u-(13)c]glc was not detected, which could have been formed by transferring the unlabeled glc from sucrose to the internal alpha-(1-->6)-linked [u-(13)c]glc at c-3. the 13c-(13)c one-bond coupling constants (1j) were also recorded for the c-1--c-6 bond of the internal alpha-(1-->6)-linked [u-(13)c]glc and of the non-reducing-end [u-(13)c]glc.

TI  == optimisation of the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == this paper reviews currently established guidelines for the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis. endocarditis remains a life-threatening disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. primary prevention of endocarditis, whenever possible, is therefore very important. in an individual with endocarditis, rapid diagnosis and effective treatment are essential to good  patient outcome. the guidelines discussed here are largely based on those issued  by the american heart association. while most cases of endocarditis are not attributable to an invasive procedure, certain procedures are associated with bacteraemia by organisms commonly associated with endocarditis, and antibacterial prophylaxis is recommended before such procedures. patient cardiac conditions are stratified into high, moderate and negligible risk categories based on potential  outcome if endocarditis develops. for oral, dental, respiratory tract, and oesophageal procedures (most often associated with viridans streptococci) the standard antibacterial regimen is oral amoxicillin. for gastrointestinal and genitourinary procedures (most often associated with enterococci), parenteral antibacterials are most often recommended. for high-risk patients, intramuscular  or intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin (or vancomycin and gentamicin in penicillin-allergic individuals) is recommended. for moderate risk patients, an option of oral amoxicillin or parenteral ampicillin is offered. treatment of bacterial endocarditis is guided by identification of the causative micro-organism. approximately 80% of cases of endocarditis are due to the gram-positive cocci: streptococci and staphylococci. other gram-positive organisms include enterococci (predominantly enterococcusfaecalis and e. faecium) and the hacek group of organisms (haemophilus parainfluenzae, h. aphrophilus, actinobacillus [haemophilus] actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, and kingella kingae). in general, for uncomplicated cases of endocarditis due to penicillin-susceptible viridans streptococci or streptococcus bovis 4 weeks of benzylpenicillin (or ceftriaxone) is the preferred regimen for most patients aged >65 years. a 2-week course of treatment can be used when gentamicin is added, in patients at low risk for adverse events caused by gentamicin therapy. when endocarditis is caused by strains of viridans streptococci or s. bovis relatively resistant to penicillin, or by enterococci, both benzylpenicillin and gentamicin are recommended. for staphylococcal endocarditis on native heart valves, nafcillin or oxacillin with or without gentamicin is the preferred regimen. in prosthetic valve staphylococcal endocarditis, nafcillin (or oxacillin) with rifampicin and gentamicin is recommended. for all of the above situations, vancomycin is recommended for the patient allergic to penicillin (or methicillin). finally, consideration of out-of-hospital therapy in selected patients is discussed.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) compared to eleven other antimicrobial agents against streptococcal isolates, excluding streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the purpose of the study presented here was to determine the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared with that of 11 other antimicrobial agents (5 of them quinolones) against 400 isolates of beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci. the minimum inhibitory concentration values for gemifloxacin against 90% of the streptococci tested were as follows: lancefield groups a, c and g, 0.06 microg/ml; lancefield group b, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus bovis, 0.125 microg/ml; and streptococcus milleri, 0.03  microg/ml. resistance to penicillin, ampicillin and erythromycin was found mainly in the streptococcus mitis isolates; tetracycline showed variable results, and no vancomycin resistance was encountered. higher rates of ciprofloxacin resistance were identified in the streptococcus bovis, mitis and mutans isolates. in conclusion, gemifloxacin was the most active quinolone tested followed by trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, especially against isolates resistant to beta-lactam agents, macrolides and tetracycline.

TI  == the replicon of the cryptic plasmid psbo1 isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1.
AB  == the cryptic plasmid psbo1 (3904 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. psbo1 contained an open reading frame (orf) that is homologous to sequences encoding the replication protein (rep) in pefc1 (isolated from enterococcus faecalis), psk639 (staphylococcus epidermidis), pla103 (lactobacillus acidophilus), and pucl287 (tetragenococcus halophila). in addition, four 22-bp direct repeats (drs) were located upstream of the putative replication gene (rep) of psbo1. recombinant plasmids (psbe10 and psbe11) containing the drs and putative rep of psbo1 replicated in s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8 strains. this result  indicates that the putative rep encoded rep and that the replicon of psbo1 contained the drs and the rep. gel shift assays showed that the rep of psbo1 bound the 22-bp drs.

TI  == diet-dependent shifts in the bacterial population of the rumen revealed with real-time pcr.
AB  == a set of pcr primers was designed and validated for specific detection and quantification of prevotella ruminicola, prevotella albensis, prevotella bryantii, fibrobacter succinogenes, selenomonas ruminantium-mitsuokella multiacida, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus flavefaciens, ruminobacter amylophilus, eubacterium ruminantium, treponema bryantii, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and anaerovibrio lipolytica. by using these primers and the real-time pcr technique, the corresponding species in the rumens of cows for which the diet was switched from hay to grain were quantitatively monitored. the  dynamics of two fibrolytic bacteria, f. succinogenes and r. flavefaciens, were in agreement with those of earlier, culture-based experiments. the quantity of f. succinogenes dna, predominant in animals on the hay diet, fell 20-fold on the third day of the switch to a grain diet and further declined on day 28, with a 57-fold reduction in dna. the r. flavefaciens dna concentration on day 3 declined to approximately 10% of its initial value in animals on the hay diet and remained at this level on day 28. during the transition period (day 3), the quantities of  two ruminal prevotella dnas increased considerably: that of p. ruminicola increased 7-fold and that of p. bryantii increased 263-fold. on day 28, the quantity of p. ruminicola dna decreased 3-fold, while p. bryantii dna was still elevated 10-fold in comparison with the level found in animals on the initial hay diet. the dna specific for another xylanolytic bacterium, e. ruminantium, dropped 14-fold during the diet switch and was maintained at this level on day 28. the concentration of a rumen spirochete, t. bryantii, decreased less profoundly and stabilized with a sevenfold decline by day 28. the variations in a. lipolytica dna were not statistically significant. after an initial slight increase in s. dextrinosolvens dna on day 3, this dna was not detected at the end of the experiment. s. bovis dna displayed a 67-fold increase during the transition period on day 3. however, on day 28, it actually declined in comparison with the  level in animals on the hay ration. the amount of s. ruminantium-m. multiacida dna also increased eightfold following the diet switch, but stabilized with only  a twofold increase on day 28. the real-time pcr technique also uncovered differential amplification of rumen bacterial templates with the set of universal bacterial primers. this observation may explain why some predominant rumen bacteria have not been detected in pcr-generated 16s ribosomal dna libraries.

TI  == aggregation substance-mediated adherence of enterococcus faecalis to immobilized  extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  == aggregation substance (as) of enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), a sex pheromone plasmid encoded cell surface protein, mediates the formation of bacterial aggregates, thereby promoting plasmid transfer. the influence of pad1-encoded as, asa1, on binding to immobilized extracellular matrix proteins was studied. the presence of as increased enterococcal adherence to fibronectin more than eight-fold, to thrombospondin more than four-fold, to vitronectin more  than three-fold, and to collagen type i more than two-fold (p<0.001). in contrast, binding to laminin and collagen type iv occurred independently of as. adherence of the constitutively as expressing e. faecalis og1x(pam721) to immobilized fibronectin was found to be approximately five times higher than that of staphylococcus aureus cowan and approximately 30 times higher than that of streptococcus bovis. investigation of strains with various deletions within the structural gene of asa1 suggests that attachment to immobilized fibronectin is mainly mediated by amino acids within the variable region or by neighbouring residues. thus, as may promote adherence to injured epithelium and endothelium, where extracellular matrix proteins are exposed, thereby facilitating colonization and infection.

TI  == effect of hydrolysable and condensed tannins on growth, morphology and metabolism of streptococcus gallolyticus (s. caprinus) and streptococcus bovis.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus (s. caprinus) was resistant in vitro to at least 7% (w/v) tannic acid and 4% (w/v) acacia condensed tannin, levels 10-fold greater than those tolerated by s. bovis. growth of s. gallolyticus in liquid medium was  characterized by a lag period which increased, and a growth rate which decreased, with increasing tannin concentration. s. gallolyticus was also more tolerant to the presence of simple phenolic acid monomers than was s. bovis, but the lag period was still concentration dependent. gallate decarboxylase activity in s. gallolyticus was elevated in the presence of tannic acid or gallic acid but not with other phenolic acids. scanning electron microscopic analysis showed that both the size and shape of s. gallolyticus and s. bovis changed in response to tannin but only s. gallolyticus was surrounded by an extracellular polysaccharide matrix which accumulated in a tannin-concentration-dependent fashion. washing of  the cells to remove extracellular polysaccharide increased the lag period of s. gallolyticus in the presence of 1% (w/v) tannic acid from 4 h to 6 h. in contrast, increasing extracellular polysaccharide synthesis in s. bovis did not increase its tolerance to tannic acid. these data demonstrate that s. gallolyticus has developed a number of mechanisms to reduce the potential effect  of tannins on cell growth, and that these mechanisms provide the organism with a  selective advantage over s. bovis when grown in the presence of tannins.

TI  == 16s ribosomal dna sequence analysis distinguishes biotypes of streptococcus bovis: streptococcus bovis biotype ii/2 is a separate genospecies and the predominant clinical isolate in adult males.
AB  == we characterized 22 human clinical strains of streptococcus bovis by genotypic (16s rrna gene sequence analysis [microseq]; applied biosystems, foster city, calif.) and phenotypic (api 20 strep and rapid id32 strep systems (biomerieux vitek, hazelton, mo.) methods. the strains, isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid (csf), and urine, formed two distinct 16s ribosomal dna sequence clusters.  three strains which were associated with endocarditis urinary tract infection (uti), and sepsis clustered with the s. bovis type strain atcc 33317 (cluster 1); other closely related type strains were s. equinus and s. infantarius. nineteen strains clustered at a distance of about 2.5% dissimilarity to the s. bovis type  strain (cluster 2) and were associated with central nervous system (cns) disease  in addition to endocarditis, uti, and sepsis. all strains were distinct from s. gallolyticus. within cluster 2, a single strain grouped with atcc strain 43143 (cluster 2a) and may be phenotypically distinct. all the other strains formed a second subgroup (cluster 2b) that was biochemically similar to s. bovis biotype ii/2 (mannitol negative and beta galactosidase, alpha galactosidase, beta glucuronidase, and trehalose positive). the api 20 strep system identified isolates of cluster 2b as s. bovis biotype ii/2, those of cluster 1 as s. bovis biotype ii/1, and that of cluster 2a as s. bovis biotype i. there was an excellent correlation of biotype and genotype: s. bovis biotype ii/2 isolates form a separate genospecies distinct from the s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, and s. infantarius type strains and are the most common isolates in adult males.

TI  == the physiological and genetic diversity of bovine streptococcus bovis strains(1).
AB  == laboratory streptococcus bovis strains and isolates obtained from a steer fed increasing amounts of grain had similar growth characteristics, but they differed in their sensitivity to 2-deoxyglucose (2dg), a non-metabolizable glucose analog. the addition of 2dg decreased both growth rate (0.92+/-0.34 h(-1)) and growth yield (ranging from 25 to 63%), but these differences could not be correlated with diet. however, isolates from a steer fed a 90% grain diet were more prone to 2dg-dependent lysis than those from a hay diet (p<0.001). all s. bovis laboratory strains and isolates had an identical restriction fragment length polymorphism pattern, when their 16s rdna was digested with haeiii and hhai. however, when genomic box elements were amplified, 5-12 bands were observed, and the s. bovis isolates and laboratory strains could be grouped into 13 different box types. strains 26 and 581axy2 had the same box type, but the remaining laboratory strains did not form closely related clusters. strains jb1 and k27ff4 were most closely related to each other. most of the fresh isolates (24 out of 30) could be grouped into a single cluster (>90% dice similarity). this cluster contained isolates from all three diets, but it did not have any of the laboratory strains. the majority (90%) of the isolates obtained from the hay-fed steer exhibited the  same box type. because more box types were observed if grain was added to the diet, it appears that ruminal s. bovis diversity may be a diet-dependent phenomenon.

TI  == in vitro evidence for a bacterial pathogenesis of equine laminitis.
AB  == utilizing an in vitro laminitis explant model, we have investigated how bacterial broth cultures and purified bacterial proteases activate matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and alter structural integrity of cultured equine lamellar hoof explants. four gram-positive streptococcus spp. and three gram-negative bacteria all induced a dose-dependent activation of mmp-2 and mmp-9 and caused lamellar explants to separate. mmp activation was deemed to have occurred if a specific mmp inhibitor, batimastat, blocked mmp activity and prevented lamellar separation. thermolysin and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b (speb) both separated explants dose-dependently but only thermolysin was inhibitable by batimastat or induced mmp activation equivalent to that seen with  bacterial broths. additionally, thermolysin and broth mmp activation appeared to  be cell dependent as mmp activation did not occur in isolation. these results suggest the rapid increase in streptococcal species in the caecum and colon observed in parallel with carbohydrate induced equine laminitis may directly cause laminitis via production of exotoxin(s) capable of activating resident mmps within the lamellar structure. once activated, these mmps can degrade key components of the basement membrane (bm) hemidesmosome complex, ultimately separating the bm from the epidermal basal cells resulting in the characteristic  laminitis histopathology of hoof lamellae. while many different causative agents  have been evaluated in the past, the results of this study provide a unifying aetiological mechanism for the development of carbohydrate induced equine laminitis.

TI  == [streptococcus gallolyticus infections in racing pigeons, a literature review].
AB  == s. gallolyticus, formerly known as s. bovis is known since 1988 as a facultative  pathogen of racing pigeons. important clinical signs include acute mortality, inability to fly, lameness, weight loss and slimy green diarrhea. a pathognomonic sign at post mortem examination is the presence of well circumscribed areas of necrosis in the pectoral muscle. furthermore tenosynovitis of the supracoracoid muscle and arthritis of the knee, shoulder and hock can be observed. in one study s. gallolyticus septicaemia was diagnosed in 10% of necropsied pigeons. since s.  gallolyticus was also isolated from nearly 40% of clinical healthy pigeons it is  regarded as a facultative pathogen. various biotypes, serotypes and culture supernatant phenotypes can be distinguished. supernatant phenotypes are identified on the basis of the presence of either a t1, t2 or t3 protein triplet  and the presence or absence of an extracellular a protein. s. gallolyticus strains with a protein are highly virulent, while strains with only t3 or t2 protein are of moderately or low virulence respectively. fimbriae are only seen in highly virulent and some of the moderately virulent strains. possible virulence factors include survival in macrophages, adhesion to cells and toxin production. infection with serotype 1 and 2 induces some degree of protection against re-infection with serotype 1, which offers perspectives for the development of a vaccine. experimentally ampicillin, doxycycline and erythromycin have shown therapeutic effects. for the treatment of clinical cases the use of ampicillin is advocated, together with hygienic measures, such as the use of grid floors and avoiding overcrowding.

AB  == recent studies have shown that immunization with streptococcus bovis using freund's complete adjuvant (fca) may confer protection against lactic acidosis in sheep. the major objective of this study was to compare the antibody responses to s. bovis in a practically acceptable adjuvant (freund's incomplete adjuvant (fia); quila; dextran sulphate (dex); imject alum; or gerbu) and in fca. thirty-five sheep were randomly allocated to 7 treatment groups. six groups were  immunized with s. bovis in an adjuvant; the other group served as the non-immunization control. the primary immunization was administered intramuscularly on day 0. followed by a booster injection on day 28. immunization with fca induced the highest saliva and serum antibody responses. the saliva antibody concentrations in the fia and quila groups were significantly higher than those in the alum, dex and gerbu groups (p < 0.01). the serum antibody concentration in the fia group was significantly higher than those in the quila,  alum. dex and gerbu groups (p < 0.01). immunization enhanced the antibody level in faeces (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the different adjuvant groups (p > 0.05). seven and 14 days following booster immunization, the saliva antibody levels induced by quila and/or fia were comparable with the level stimulated by fca (p > 0.05). there was a strongly positive correlation (r2 = 0.770, p < 0.01) between the antibody concentrations in salival and serum. compared with the controls, a higher faecal dry matter content was observed in the animals immunized with either fca or quila. the change in faecal dry matter content was positively associated with the faecal antibody concentration (r2 = 0.441, p < 0.05). these results indicate that fia and quila were effective at inducing high levels of antibody responses to s. bovis, and suggest that either freund's incomplete adjuvant or quila may be useful for preparing a practically acceptable vaccine against lactic acidosis.

TI  == competition among three predominant ruminal cellulolytic bacteria in the absence  or presence of non-cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  == competition among three species of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria - fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1 and ruminococcus albus 7 - was studied in the presence or absence of the non-cellulolytic ruminal bacteria selenomonas ruminantium or streptococcus bovis. co-cultures were grown under either batch or continuous conditions and populations were estimated using species-specific oligonucleotide probes to 16s rrna. the three cellulolytic species co-existed in cellobiose batch co-culture, but inclusion of either sel. ruminantium or str. bovis yielded nearly a monoculture of the non-cellulolytic competitor. in cellobiose chemostats, r. albus completely dominated the triculture, but r. flavefaciens became predominant over f. succinogenes and r. albus when sel. ruminantium was co-inoculated into the chemostats. similar effects on competition were observed in the presence of str. bovis at a lower (0.021 h(-1)), but not at a higher (0.045 h(-1)) dilution rate. in cellulose batch co-cultures, r. albus was more abundant than both f. succinogenes and r. flavefaciens, regardless of the presence of the non-cellulolytic species. co-existence among the three cellulolytic species was observed in almost all cellulose chemostats, but sel. ruminantium altered the relative proportions of the cellulolytic species. r. albus and r. flavefaciens were found to produce inhibitors that suppressed growth of r. flavefaciens and f. succinogenes, respectively. these data indicate that interactions among cellulolytic bacteria,  while complex, can be modified further by non-cellulolytic species.

TI  == nisin resistance of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the growth of streptococcus bovis jb1 was initially inhibited by nisin (1 microm), and nisin caused a more than 3-log decrease in viability. however, some  of the cells survived, and these nisin-resistant cells grew as rapidly as untreated ones. to see if the nisin resistance was merely a selection, nisin-sensitive cells were obtained from agar plates lacking nisin. results indicated that virtually any nisin-sensitive cell could become nisin-resistant if the ratio of nisin to cells was not too high and the incubation period was long enough. isolates obtained from the rumen were initially nisin sensitive, but they also developed nisin resistance. nisin-resistant cultures remained nisin resistant even if nisin was not present, but competition studies indicated that nisin-sensitive cells could eventually displace the resistant ones if nisin was not present. nisin-sensitive, glucose-energized cells lost virtually all of their intracellular potassium if 1 microm nisin was added, but resistant cells retained potassium even after addition of 10 microm nisin. nisin-resistant cells were less hydrophobic and more lysozyme-resistant than nisin-sensitive cells. because the nisin-resistant cells bound less cytochrome c, it appeared that nisin was being excluded by a net positive (i.e., less negative) charge. nisin-resistant cells had more lipoteichoic acid than nisin-sensitive cells, and deesterified lipoteichoic acids from nisin-resistant cells migrated more slowly through a polyacrylamide gel than those from nisin-sensitive cells. these results indicated that lipoteichoic acids could be modified to increase the resistance of s. bovis  to nisin. s. bovis jb1 cultures were still sensitive to monensin, tetracycline, vancomycin, and bacitracin, but ampicillin resistance was 1,000-fold greater.

TI  == identification of bacteriocin-like inhibitors from rumen streptococcus spp. and isolation and characterization of bovicin 255.
AB  == streptococci obtained from rumen sources were tested for the production of antibacterial compounds using a deferred-antagonism plating assay. of 35 isolates tested, 7 were identified that inhibited the growth of other streptococci. none of the inhibitory activity was due to bacteriophage. three isolates, lrc0253, lrc0255, and lrc0476, were selected for further characterization. analysis of 16s ribosomal dna indicated that lrc0476 was a strain of streptococcus bovis, while isolates lrc0253 and lrc0255 are likely strains of streptococcus gallolyticus. the antibacterial compounds produced by these bacteria were protease sensitive, remained active in a ph range from 1 to 12, and did not lose activity after heating at 100 degrees c for 15 min. the inhibitory peptide from strain lrc0255 was purified using ph-dependent adsorption and desorption to bacterial cells, followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and reversed-phase chromatography and  gel filtration. the peptide was 6 kda, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. an oligonucleotide probe based on the n-terminal sequence of the purified peptide was used to identify the gene encoding the inhibitory peptide. the antibacterial peptide has characteristics that are very similar to those described for class ii bacteriocins of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == characterization of the cryptic plasmid psbo2 isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1 and construction of a new shuttle vector.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid designated psbo2 (3582 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. the psbo2 contained putative sites for a double-strand origin (dso), a small transcriptional repressor protein (cop), countertranscribed rnas (ctrnas),  and a replication protein (rep), which were similar to those from pmv158 and pls1, which were isolated from s. agalactiae, and pwvo1, isolated from lactococcus lactis. the putative single-strand origin (sso) of psbo2 was similar  to per341 and pst1, which were isolated from s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmid designated psbe2 was constructed to bind pecm184 vector and the dna fragment containing sso, dso, cop, ctrnas, and rep of psbo2. when psbe2 was introduced into s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8, the plasmids in the transformants had deleted the 160-bp fragment between sso and dso. this plasmid, designated psbe2a, was capable of transforming escherichia coli and s. bovis strains 12-u-1 and no8 on high frequency; therefore, psbe2a is an effective shuttle vector.

TI  == regulation of h(+)-atpase synthesis in response to reduced ph in ruminal bacteria.
AB  == the capacity of ruminal bacteria to regulate h(+)-atpase synthesis in response to reduced ph was investigated to explain acid tolerance. the activity of h(+)-atpase in streptococcus bovis, an acid-tolerant bacterium, was 2.2-fold higher at ph 4.5 than at ph 5.5. the increase in the amount of h(+)-atpase protein was similar, suggesting that the increase in h(+)-atpase activity is owing to the increase in h(+)-atpase synthesis. the level of atp-mrna at ph 4.5 was 2.5-fold higher than at ph 5.5, indicating that h(+)-atpase synthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level, responding to low ph. in ruminococcus albus, an acid-sensitive bacterium, h(+)-atpase activity, the amount of h(+)-atpase protein, and the level of atp-mrna at ph 7.0 were similar to the values at ph 6.0, the lowest ph permitting growth. this result suggests that r. albus is incapable of enhancing h(+)-atpase synthesis at low ph. thus, acid tolerance appeared to be related to the capacity to augment the synthesis of h(+)-atpase responding to low ph.

TI  == significance of fecal volatile fatty acids in shedding of escherichia coli o157 from calves: experimental infection and preliminary use of a probiotic product.
AB  == cattle have been recognized as a principal reservoir of escherichia coli o157:h7. this organism appears to be confined to the gastrointestinal tract and is shed in feces. a probiotic product containing lactic acid-producing streptococcus bovis lcb6 and lactobacillus gallinarum lcb 12 isolated from adult cattle was developed, and a preliminary experiment was conducted to evaluate its effect on the elimination of e. coli o157 from experimentally infected calves. eight 4-month-old holstein calves were orally challenged with e. coli o157 and the probiotic product was administered against four calves continued fecal shedding of e. coli o157 by the 7th day after infection. fecal shedding of e. coli o157 was completely inhibited and re-shedding was not detected in any of the animals.  remarkable increase of vfas, especially that of acetic acid in feces after the administration of probiotic bacteria correlated with the diminution of e. coli o157. four calves that had spontaneously ceased fecal shedding of e. coli o157 by the 7th day exhibited a high concentration of vfas in feces before and after experimental infection. although our results are preliminary and obtained from calves under limited conditions, the possible application of probiotic product to reduce fecal shedding of e. coli o157 from cattle is suggested.

TI  == emerging and reemerging pathogens.
AB  == from 1973 to 1995, 29 new and reemerging pathogenic microbes were recognized. however, in discussions about emerging infectious diseases, the focus is often on the clinical effects of the host-parasite relationship, rather than the examination of the biology of the pathogen. many of what we refer to as emerging  diseases are characterized better as 'diseases of human progress'. thus, the aerosolization of water has played an important role in the emergence of legionella pneumophila infections. new diseases are superimposed on endemic diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases, malaria and tuberculosis. in addition, many pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant to standard antimicrobial drugs, making treatment difficult and in some cases impossible. we summarize our experience on emerging parasitic diseases (primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, respiratory cryptosporidiosis, and diplogonoporiasis), and selected problems of bacterial resistance (mdr tuberculosis caused by mycobacterium bovis and macrolide-resistance mechanisms of streptococcus pneumoniae and s. pyogenes).

TI  == identification of corynebacterium bovis and other coryneforms isolated from bovine mammary glands.
AB  == bovine mastitis remains the most economically important disease in dairy cows. corynebacterium bovis, a lipid-requiring corynebacterium spp., is frequently isolated from the milk of infected mammary glands of dairy cows and is associated with reduced milk production. a total of 212 coryneform bacteria isolated from the milk of dairy cows were obtained from mastitis reference laboratories in the  united states and canada. all isolates had been presumptively identified as corynebacterium bovis based on colony morphology and growth in the presence of butterfat. preliminary identification of the isolates was based on gram stain, oxidase, catalase, and growth on unsupplemented trypticase soy agar (tsa), tsa supplemented with 5% sheep blood, and tsa supplemented with 1% tween 80. of the 212 isolates tested, 183 were identified as corynebacterium spp. based on preliminary characteristics. of the strains misidentified, one was identified as  a yeast, two as bacillus spp., 11 as enterobacteriaceae, 18 as staphylococci, one as a streptococcus spp., and one as an enterococcus spp. eighty-seven coryneforms were selected for identification to the species level by direct sequencing of the 16s rrna gene, the biolog system and the api coryne system. fifty strains were identified as c. bovis by 16s rrna gene similarity studies: the biolog and api coryne systems correctly identified 54.0 and 88.0% of these strains, respectively. the other coryneforms were identified as other corynebacterium spp., rhodococcus spp., or microbacterium spp. these data indicate that the coryneform bacteria isolated from bovine mammary glands are a heterogeneous group of organisms. routine identification of c. bovis should include gram-stain, cell  morphology, catalase production, nitrate reduction, stimulated growth on 1% tween 80 supplemented media, and beta-galactosidase production as the minimum requirements.

TI  == infective endocarditis in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis.
AB  == objective: to ascertain the predominant characteristics of patients receiving long-term dialysis who develop infective endocarditis (ie). patients and methods: we reviewed the records of all chronic hemodialysis patients who had ie at mayo clinic, rochester, minn, between 1983 and 1997. results: twenty episodes of ie occurred in 17 patients. one patient had 3 episodes of ie, and 1 patient had 2 episodes of ie; each episode was caused by a different organism. the mean +/- sd  age of our patients was 63 +/- 11 years; there were 13 males; 6 patients had diabetes mellitus; and the mean +/- sd duration of hemodialysis prior to ie was 24.2 +/- 20.5 months. this analysis included 10 episodes of ie (occurring in 9 patients) within the mayo clinic dialysis system during which time 223,358 hemodialysis treatments were delivered, giving a rate of 10 ie episode per 223,336 hemodialysis treatments. among all 20 ie episodes, there were 14 synthetic arteriovenous grafts, 4 permanent venous dialysis catheters, 2 temporary venous dialysis catheters, and 2 native arteriovenous fistulas (2 accesses in 2 patients), and access had been in place for a mean +/- sd of 15.9 +/- 18.6 months. the portal of infection was the hemodialysis access in 13 episodes of ie. the causative organisms for ie were staphylococcus aureus in 8 cases, enterococcus sp in 4 cases, viridans streptococcus in 3 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis in 2 cases, and 1 case each of streptococcus bovis, group g beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and aspergillus sp. the mitral valve was involved in 9 cases, the aortic valve was involved in 5 cases, and the tricuspid  and pulmonic valves were involved in 1 case each. patient survival (after the first episode of ie) was 71% at 30 days; 53% at 60 days; and 35% at 1 year. echocardiography was performed in 19 episodes of ie. the transthoracic echocardiogram was 62.5% sensitive and 40% specific for the presence of definite  or probable vegetations. univariate analysis for factors affecting 60-day survival show that presence of right-sided ie, vegetation size greater than 2.0 cm3, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and initial leukocyte count greater than 12.5 x 10(9)/l were poor prognostic factors. aortic valve involvement carried a better prognosis. conclusions: infective endocarditis in hemodialysis patients is relatively infrequent but has a high mortality. patients with synthetic intravascular dialysis angioaccess (synthetic grafts and venous catheters) are more likely to develop ie than patients with native arteriovenous fistulas. transesophageal echocardiography is a preferred echocardiographic study for suspected cases of ie. prolonged antibiotic therapy is needed for all patients, and close monitoring is needed for patients with right-sided ie, large vegetations, diabetes mellitus, and an elevated leukocyte count.

TI  == effects of thymol on ruminal microorganisms.
AB  == thymol (5-methyl-2-isopropylphenol) is a phenolic compound that is used to inhibit oral bacteria. because little is known regarding the effects of this compound on ruminal microorganisms, the objective of this study was to determine  the effects of thymol on growth and lactate production by the ruminal bacteria streptococcus bovis jb1 and selenomonas ruminantium hd4. in addition, the effect  of thymol on the in vitro fermentation of glucose by mixed ruminal microorganisms was investigated. neither 45 nor 90 microg/ml of thymol had any significant effect on growth or lactate production by s. bovis jb1, but 180 microg/ml of thymol completely inhibited growth and lactate production. in the case of s. ruminantium hd4, 45 microg/ml of thymol had little effect on growth and lactate production; however, 90 microg/ml of thymol completely inhibited growth of s. ruminantium hd4. thymol also decreased glucose uptake by whole cells of both bacteria. when mixed ruminal microorganisms were incubated in medium that contained glucose, 400 microg/ml of thymol increased final ph and the acetate to  propionate ratio and decreased concentrations of methane, acetate, propionate, and lactate. in conclusion, thymol was a potent inhibitor of glucose fermentation by s. bovis jb1 and s. ruminantium hd4. even though thymol treatment decreased methane and lactate concentrations and increased final ph in mixed ruminal microorganism fermentations of glucose, concentrations of acetate and propionate  were also reduced.

TI  == effects of ph and energy supply on activity and amount of pyruvate formate-lyase  in streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the enzyme system of pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl) in streptococcus bovis was investigated by isolating pfl and pfl-activating enzyme (pfl-ae) from s. bovis, flavodoxin from escherichia coli, and chloroplasts from spinach. in this study, the pfl and pfl-ae in s. bovis were found to be similar to those in e. coli, suggesting that the activating mechanisms are similar. the optimal ph of s. bovis pfl was 7.5, which is in contrast to the optimal ph of s. bovis lactate dehydrogenase, which is 5.5. the apparent k(m) of s. bovis pfl was 2 mm. the intermediates of glycolysis, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (dhap) and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (gap), were shown to inhibit pfl activity. the concentrations of intracellular dhap and gap in s. bovis ranged from 1.9 mm to less than 0.1 mm and from 0.6 mm to less than 0.05 mm, respectively, depending on the energy supply. the wide variations in dhap and gap levels indicated that pfl  activity is allosterically regulated by these triose phosphates in vivo. the amount of pfl protein, as determined by western blot analysis with polyclonal antibody, changed in parallel with the level of pfl-mrna, responding to the culture conditions. these observations confirm that pfl synthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level and support the hypothesis that s. bovis shifts the fermentation pathway from acetate, formate, and ethanol production to lactate production when the ph is low and when excess energy is supplied.

AB  == eighteen strains isolated from human specimens or from food products were characterized as atypical variants of mannitol-negative streptococcus bovis. they were tested for extended biochemical criteria, ribotyping and dna-dna hybridization in order to define their taxonomic status. these strains were demonstrated to constitute a dna relatedness group that includes strains of dna group 4 of farrow et al. (1984). comparative analysis of 16s rrna sequences demonstrated that these strains represent a new species which belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex and which has been provisionally named s. infantarius by bouvet et al. (1997). biotyping and ribotyping allowed differentiation of these strains from the aesculin-positive strains of s. bovis belonging to the previously described biotypes i, ii.1 and ii.2. the results of the ribotyping and hybridization assays demonstrated the presence of two different dna subgroups within the 18 strains. on the basis of these data, the names s. infantarius subsp. infantarius (aesculin-negative for five strains out of seven, including the type strain hdp 90056t = ncdo 599t) and  s. infantarius subsp. coli (aesculin-positive, reference strain hdp 90248 = ncdo  2620) are proposed as the names for these two subspecies within the s. infantarius species.

AB  == the addition of increasing physiological concentrations of ammonia or amino acids had distinct effects on the growth and proteolytic activity of streptococcus bovis jb1, prevotella albensis, and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens dsm3071. the growth of s. bovis and b. fibrisolvens was enhanced by nh(3) and aa, and that of p. albensis was reduced compared with a control with protein as the sole source of nitrogen. the proteolytic activity of s. bovis and p. albensis was reduced, but that of b. fibrisolvens was improved. nh(3) seemed to act mainly on the cell-associated fraction of the proteolytic activity, while the action of aa was  not specific. in the rumen the proteolytic activity of s. bovis and p. albensis would be optimal at low concentrations of nh(3) or aa (<0.05 and <0.27 g/l respectively). in contrast, b. fibrisolvens would need higher concentrations (0.5 g/l of nh(3) or 2.7 g/l of aa). it can be assumed that these bacteria will grow in different ecological niches.

AB  == the cell wall protein profiles of 56 isolates of streptococcus gallolyticus of differing virulence for pigeons were compared by sds-page. additionally, western  blot analysis was performed on the cell wall proteins of 14 strains using sera of pigeons, experimentally infected with a(+)t1 or a(-)t2 strains of s. gallolyticus. the profile of silver stained gels exhibited a complex array of 20-50 bands ranging from less than 6.5-210kda. a band with molecular mass of 114kda was only observed in isolates that belonged to the highly virulent a(+)t1, a(+)t2, a(+)t3 and a(-)t1 culture supernatant groups. a band with a slightly higher molecular mass (115kda) as well as a 207kda band were only detected in isolates that belonged to the moderately a(-)t3 or low a(-)t2 virulent culture supernatant groups. the 114 and 115kda band were recognised by all homologous and heterologous pigeon sera used whereas the 207kda band was only recognised by sera of pigeons infected with a a(-)t2 strain. these findings may indicate that the 114, 115 and 207kda bands are useful as additional virulence associated markers for pigeon s. gallolyticus strains.

TI  == immunization with streptococcus bovis protects against lactic acidosis in sheep.
AB  == lactic acidosis is a gastrointestinal disorder resulting from the rapid overgrowth of lactic acid-producing bacteria when ruminants are suddenly introduced to grain feed. the present study has investigated the ability of live  and killed bacterial vaccines to reduce lactic acidosis in sheep, via a stimulation of specific antibody production against lactic acid-producing bacteria. forage-fed sheep were immunized with live or killed streptococcus bovis sb-5 vaccine, with or without adjuvant, via intramuscular injection. after the primary immunization, three boosters were given at 2-4 week intervals. sheep were subsequently challenged by a sudden switch to a grain-based diet. following challenge, vaccinated sheep maintained significantly higher feed intake, and had  higher rumen ph, lower l-lactate concentrations, and less severe diarrhoea scores than non-vaccinated control sheep. higher rumen ph, lower mortality and less severe diarrhoea were found in the animals immunized with live vaccine compared to the animals immunized with killed vaccines. significant increases in mucosal and systemic antibody responses were observed after boosting; the s. bovis-specific antibody concentrations were significantly higher in samples of saliva, rumen fluid and serum from sheep immunized with live vaccine than with killed vaccines. these results demonstrate that lactic acidosis can be reduced by immunization against s. bovis, and that live sb-5 vaccine is effective in invoking mucosal as well as systemic antibody responses.

TI  == immunization with a streptococcus bovis vaccine administered by different routes  against lactic acidosis in sheep.
AB  == streptococcus bovis is an important lactic acid bacterium in the rumen, which contributes to the development of lactic acidosis. this study was designed to test the efficacy of immunization with s. bovis primed either intramuscularly (i.m.) or intraperitoneally (i.p. ) against lactic acidosis. forty-five wethers were allocated to three treatment groups. two groups were injected with a s. bovis vaccine by either the i.m. or i.p. route for primary immunization; both groups were further immunized by the same route(s) (oral and/or i.m.) for boosters. the third group was not immunized (control). antibody concentrations were measured in saliva prior to and following animals being fed a grain diet, and also in the rumen fluid, before the animals were suddenly introduced to a grain diet. the average antibody concentration in the animals of the i.m. group was higher than the i.p. group (p< 0.05). the antibody concentration in the rumen fluid of immunized sheep was higher than the control animals (p< 0.01). the difference in the rumen fluid antibody concentration between the i.m. and i.p. groups was not statistically significant (p> 0.05). in the i.m. group, there was  a significantly greater feed intake, higher rumen ph, lower diarrhoea scores, and less increase in blood packed cell volume following grain feeding than in the animals of the control group. the severity of diarrhoea and the increase of blood packed cell volume in the animals of the i. p. group were also less than in the animals of the control group. the results suggest that the risk of lactic acidosis can be reduced by immunization against s. bovis, and that the immunization primed i. m. is more effective than the immunization primed i.p.

AB  == 1+ were submitted for somatic cell counting (scc), bacteriological examination and to test for antibiotic susceptibility. the scc and germ-cell counts of monthly bulk-tank milk samples were available through dairy inspection and advisory services and milk production data of 567 herd-book cows were available from breeding associations. possible individual and environmental predictors of subclinical mastitis were identified using logistic models adjusted for clustering of the data at herd and cow levels. data were analyzed separately for  cows from 7 to 100 and from 101 to 305 days post partum. prevalences of subclinical mastitis at the quarter level were 21.2% for lactation period 7-100 days and 34.5% for 101-305 days post partum. the geometric mean scc in bulk-tank  milk samples was 85.6x10(3)cells/ml. samples at 7-100 and 101-305 days post partum were positive for staphylococcus aureus in 16.0 and 7.4%, for coagulase-negative staphylococci in 51.5 and 50.6%, for streptococcus agalactiae  in 0.0 and 0.8%, for other streptococci in 19.4 and 15.6%, for e. coli in 1.0 and 0.4%, and for corynebacterium bovis in 25.7 and 45.1%, respectively. risks of subclinical mastitis increased significantly with increasing days post partum and advancing age of cow. cows that were sampled when staying in alpine dairies had considerably higher risks of subclinical mastitis than cows staying in home barns. significantly lower risks of subclinical mastitis were observed in farms where cmt was performed regularly as a control measure. bacteria in milk from cows with mastitis exhibited antibiotic resistance at a comparable frequency as found previously in conventional farms.

TI  == promotion of intestinal carcinogenesis by streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the involvement of streptococcus bovis, an member of the human gut flora, in colorectal neoplastic diseases is an object of controversy. the aim of this study was to determine the effects of s.bovis and of antigens extracted from the bacterial cell wall on early preneoplastic changes in the intestinal tract. adult rats received i. p. injections of azoxymethane (15 mg/kg body weight) once per week for 2 weeks. fifteen days (week 4) after the last injection of the carcinogen, the rats received, by gavage twice per week during 5 weeks, either s.bovis (10(10) bacteria) or wall-extracted antigens (100 microg). one week after the last gavage (week 10), we found that administration of either s.bovis or of antigens from this bacterium promoted the progression of preneoplastic lesions through the increased formation of hyperproliferative aberrant colonic crypts, enhanced the expression of proliferation markers and increased the production of  il-8 in the colonic mucosa. our study suggests that s.bovis acts as a promoter of early preneoplastic lesions in the colon of rats. the fact that bacterial wall proteins are more potent inducers of neoplastic transformation than the intact bacteria may have important implications in colon cancer prevention.

TI  == protonmotive force regulates the membrane conductance of streptococcus bovis in a non-ohmic fashion.
AB  == because the dccd (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide)-sensitive, f-atpase-mediated, futile  atp hydrolysis of non-growing streptococcus bovis jb1 cells was not affected by sodium or potassium, atp hydrolysis appeared to be dependent only upon the rate of proton flux across the cell membrane. however, available estimates of bacterial proton conductance were too low to account for the rate of atp turnover observed in s. bovis. when de-energized cells were subjected to large ph gradients (2.75 units, or -170 mv), internal ph declined at a rate of 0.15 ph units s(-1). based on an estimated cellular buffering capacity of 200 nmol h+ (mg protein)(-1) per ph unit, h+ flux across the cell membrane (at -170 mv) was 108 mmol (g protein)(-1) h(-1). when potassium-loaded cells were treated with valinomycin in low-potassium buffers, initial k+ efflux generated membrane potentials in close agreement with values predicted by the nernst equation. these artificial membrane potentials drove h+ uptake, and h+ influx was counterbalanced by a further loss of cellular k+. flame photometry indicated that the rate of k+  loss was 215 (+/-26) mmol k+ (g protein)(-1) h(-1) at -170 mv, but the potassium-sensitive fluorescent compound cd222 indicated that this rate was only  110 (+/-44) mmol k+ (g protein)(-1) h(-1). as ph gradients or membrane potentials were reduced, the rate of h+ flux declined in a non-ohmic fashion, and all rates  were <25 mmol (g protein)(-1) h(-1) at a driving force of -80 mv. previous estimates of bacterial proton flux were based on low and unphysiological protonmotive forces, and the assumption that h+ influx rate would be ohmic. rates of h+ influx into s. bovis cells [as high as 9x10(-11) mol h+ (cm membrane)(-2) s(-1)] were similar to rates reported for respiring mitochondria, but were at least 20-fold greater than any rate previously reported in lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == the diversity and population densities of facultative anaerobic bacteria with the capacity to hydrate oleic acid and linoleic acid in the rumen of sheep and dairy  cows were determined. the screening of representative colonies, from rumen fluid  plated aerobically on a range of agar media, revealed that sheep rumen fluid contained hydration-positive strains of streptococcus, staphylococcus, enterococcus, lactobacillus and pediococcus, whereas cow rumen fluid contained hydration-positive strains of streptococcus, lactobacillus and staphylococcus. mean counts of facultative anaerobic bacteria in sheep and cattle rumen were log10 7.29 and log10 6.40, respectively, and were independent of diet. approximately 56% of facultative anaerobic bacteria were able to hydrate oleic and/or linoleic acid in anaerobic broth culture. for both sheep and cows, the most numerous hydration-positive isolates were strains of strep. bovis. the results, which are the first to show that pediococci have the capacity to hydrate unsaturated fatty acids, suggest that lactic acid bacteria are the major unsaturated fatty acid hydrating bacteria in the rumen.

TI  == infective endocarditis in a tertiary-care hospital in southern israel.
AB  == during the years 1980-1994, 84 patients were treated in our institution due to suspected infective endocarditis (ie). seventy-one of these episodes occurring in 71 patients, classified definite or possible according to the duke criteria, were retrospectively analyzed in this study. there were 52 cases of native valve endocarditis, 7 cases of early prosthetic valve endocarditis, and 12 cases of late prosthetic valve endocarditis. the incidence of ie did not change significantly during the study period. the overall mortality rate was 15%. only one case of drug addiction appeared in our series despite its growing frequency in israel. rheumatic heart disease remained the main underlying cardiac condition and streptococcus viridans remained the most common pathogen. streptococcus bovis was found to be a significant pathogen causing ie in our patient population, while staphylococcus aureus appeared to be less frequent. the duke criteria significantly classified a greater proportion of cases as definitive, as opposed  to the von reyn criteria. fewer cases were rejected by the duke criteria, especially culture-negative cases, and those without histopathological confirmation. application of the duke criteria permits a more consistent approach to the diagnosis of ie, even in a non-drug-addict patient population.

TI  == production of cytokines by monocytes, epithelial and endothelial cells activated  by streptococcus bovis.
AB  == there are numerous reports documenting the correlation between streptococcus bovis bacteraemia and endocarditis in conjunction with colonic diseases. the adherence of s. bovis to either buccal or intestinal epithelial cells seems to be the initial process in colonization and subsequent infection of the host, allowing further adhesion of s. bovis to either endothelial cells or extracellular matrix components which leads to infective endocarditis. bacterial  entry at tumour sites is further assisted by the local action of cytokines that promotes vasodilatation and increased capillary permeability. thus the ability of s. bovis to adhere to and to stimulate human cells may contribute to the pathogenicity of this bacteria. in the present study, we have shown the ability of s. bovis and wall-extracted antigens (wea) to adhere to human buccal (kb) or intestinal (caco-2) epithelial cell lines, to human saphenous vein endothelial cells, to human monocytic cell line (thp-1) and to extracellular matrix components (ecm) (fibronectin, collagen and laminin). the fixation of s. bovis on cells was followed by the synthesis of il-8 from all the cells except caco-2, whereas s. bovis wea was able to induce cytokine synthesis from all of them, showing the immunomodulatory effect of s. bovis and s. bovis wea on different cells.

TI  == feasibility of using total purines as a marker for ruminal bacteria.
AB  == a procedure for measuring total purine content of mixed ruminal bacteria was adapted for use in the determination of purines in pure cultures of ruminal bacteria. recovery of adenine and guanine, alone or in mixture, was quite variable. the problem was traced to solubility of the silver salt of adenine in the acid wash solution. when the precipitating solution was used as the wash, recovery of the purines was over 97%. recovery of a 1:1 mixture of adenine and guanine added to yeast rna was 100.6+/-3.2%. purine, protein, and bacterial concentrations were determined for 10 pure cultures of ruminal bacteria: butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, d16f, h10b, and h17c; fibrobacter succinogenes b21a; lachnospira multiparus d25e; lactobacillus lactis ard26e; prevotella ruminicola h15a; ruminococcus albus 7; ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b; and streptococcus bovis ard5d. the cv for the most-probable-number (mpn) assay (bacterial concentrations), purine analysis, and protein analysis were 55.86, 5.25 and 6.52%, respectively. considerable variation was found among bacterial species and strains when purine and protein concentrations were compared as the amount per individual cell. more consistent values were obtained when these components were  expressed on a dry matter basis. purine:protein ratios for the 10 pure cultures ranged from .023 to .1299, with a mean value of .0883. for samples of mixed bacteria separated from ruminal fluid, this ratio was found to average .0306, which is approximately one-third of the value for the pure cultures. the value determined for the mixed bacterial sample is similar to previously reported values. based on the ratio obtained with the pure cultures, the microbial protein flow out of the rumen has probably been overestimated in most previous reports. limited studies suggest that the samples of mixed ruminal bacteria used as a standard are probably contaminated with feed particles containing protein, which  results in lower purine:protein ratios.

TI  == physiological characterization of streptococcus bovis mutants that can resist 2-deoxyglucose-induced lysis.
AB  == streptococcus bovis jb1 does not normally lyse, but stationary phase lysis can be induced by including 2-deoxyglucose (2dg) in the growth medium. isolates deficient in glucose/2dg phosphotransferase activity (pts-) also lysed when 2dg was present (lys+) and this result indicated that 2dg phosphorylation via the pts was not an obligate requirement for 2dg-induced lysis. cells and cell walls from  2dg-grown cultures lysed faster when proteinase k was added, but glucose-grown cultures and cell walls were not affected. a lipoteichoic acid (lta) extract (aqueous phase from hot phenol treatment) from glucose-grown cells inhibited the  lysis of 2dg-grown cultures, but a similar extract prepared from 2dg-grown cells  was without effect. thin-layer chromatography and differential staining indicated that wild-type and lys+ pts- cells incorporated 2dg into lta, but lysis-resistant cultures (lys- pts+ and lys- pts-) did not. lta from lysis-resistant (lys- pts+ and lys- pts-) cells grown with glucose and 2dg also prevented 2dg-dependent lysis of the wild-type. lta could not inhibit degradation of cell walls isolated  from 2dg-grown cultures, but lta inhibited the lysis of micrococcus lysodeikticus (micrococcus luteus) cells that were exposed to supernatants from 2dg-grown s. bovis cultures. group d streptococci (including s. bovis) normally have an alpha-1,2 linked glucose disaccharide (kojibiose) in their lta, but kojibiose cannot be synthesized from 2dg. this observation suggested that the kojibiose moiety of lta was involved in autolysin inactivation. wild-type s. bovis had atp- as well as pep-dependent mechanisms of 2dg phosphorylation and one lysis-resistant phenotype (lys- pts-) had reduced levels of both activities. however, the lys- pts+ phenotype was still able to phosphorylate 2dg via atp and  pep and this result indicated that some other step of 2dg incorporation into lta  was being inhibited. based on these results, growth in the presence of 2dg appears to prevent synthesis of normal lta, which is involved in the regulation of autolytic enzymes.

AB  == recent studies have showed that immunisation with streptococcus bovis (sb-5) and  lactobacillus (lb-27) may confer protection against lactic acidosis in sheep and  cattle. the present study was designed to determine the degree of immunological cross-reactivity between sb-5 and eight other strains of streptococcus bovis; and between lb-27 and four other isolates of lactobacillus. the cross-reactivity index (cri, a low cri indicates a high degree of immunological cross-reactivity)  ranged from 7.3 to 56.1% between the strains of s. bovis (the encapsulated strains with cris ranging from 7.3 to 12.4%). for isolates of lactobacillus the cris ranged from 11.5 to 72.2%. the results indicate that all the isolates tested have a certain degree of immunological homology with sb-5 and lb-27, and suggest  that the vaccine may cross-react with a large number of strains of s. bovis and lactobacillus which may cause lactic acidosis. as most of the s. bovis strains in the rumen are encapsulated, the high degree of homology between sb-5 and encapsulated s. bovis strains further suggests that the vaccine containing sb-5 may be effective against a wide range of strains of s. bovis in sheep and cattle.

TI  == meningitis caused by streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae: a retrospective clinical study.
AB  == we reviewed the medical records of 26 patients (median age 62 years, range 5-76 years) admitted to our institution during 1978-98 with acute bacterial meningitis (abm) caused by streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae (comprising 1.9% of all patients with abm). 19 cases were community-acquired and 7 were nosocomial. 73% had comorbid or predisposing conditions and 73% had an identifiable extracerebral focus; only in 2 patients no comorbid disease, primary focus or predisposing condition was present. five patients had cerebral abscesses, and 5 had endocarditis. beta-haemolytic streptococci were grown in 14  cases (serotype a: 4, b: 5, c: 1, g: 4) and were predominant among patients with  endocarditis, whereas alpha- or non-haemolytic strains grew in 12 cases (s. mitis: 4, s. constellatus: 2, e. faecalis: 2, s. bovis: 1, unspecified: 3) and were predominant in patients with a brain abscess. staphylococcus aureus grew together with a streptococcus in 2 cases. blood culture was positive in 9 cases (35%). neurologic complications occurred in 11 patients (42%) and extraneurologic complications in 18 patients (69%). adverse outcomes occurred in 10 patients (38%), including 3 patients who died. occurrence of seizures at any time of disease was significantly associated with an adverse outcome; no other clinical or paraclinical features appeared to affect outcome.

TI  == binding of selected extracellular matrix proteins to enterococci and streptococcus bovis of animal origin.
AB  == thirty-three enterococcal strains and 10 streptococcus bovis strains were investigated for their protein-binding cell surface components. seven extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins were immobilized on difco latex beads to detect these components on the surface of all enterococcal strains and eight non-autoaggregating s. bovis strains by a particle agglutination assay (paa). twenty-three selected strains were also examined in microtiter plate assays. according to the absorbance readings (a(570nm)), 11 strains were classified as nonadherent (a(570nm) < 0.1), 10 strains as weakly adherent (0.1 < a(570nm) > 0.3), and 2 strains as strongly adherent (a(570nm) > 0.3) in these assays. a direct correlation was found between the values obtained in paa and a(570nm) readings of microtiter plate assays. binding of (125)i-labeled bovine lactoferrin to enterococci and streptococci was in the range of 6%-30% and of (125)i-labeled  human vitronectin in the range of 9%-33% to streptococci. the binding of(125)i-labeled ecm proteins to selected strains was much more effectively inhibited by sulfated carbohydrates than by non-sulfated hyaluronic acid, indicating the importance of the sulfate groups of these inhibitors. an inhibition effect of heparin on blf binding to four selected strains was higher in comparison with fucoidan in the microtiter plates. thirty-five out of 44 strains had agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes. however, these strains showed no ability to agglutinate bovine or sheep erythrocytes.

TI  == natural genetic transformation in the rumen bacterium streptococcus bovis jb1.
AB  == natural transformation of streptococcus bovis jb1 was demonstrated after development of competence in normal culture medium. transformation efficiencies were not significantly increased when heat-inactivated horse serum was added to the medium before growth. this is the first time that a resident rumen bacterial  species has been shown to be naturally transformable. transformation allowed the  acquisition of plasmids or integration of sequences into the chromosome. no transformation was observed in the presence of undiluted autoclaved or filter-sterilised ovine rumen fluid or filter-sterilised ovine saliva, suggesting that transformation in the ruminant digestive tract is a rare event, although transformation was observed in the presence of 1% and 0.5% filter-sterilised rumen fluid. the use of natural transformation of s. bovis should facilitate further molecular biological studies on this species.

TI  == genetic homogeneity and phage susceptibility of ruminal strains of streptococcus  bovis isolated in australia.
AB  == the genetic homogeneity of 37 strains of ruminal streptococci was investigated by comparing dna fragment profiles on agarose gels following restriction endonuclease digestion with hae iii, cfo i and msp i. thirty strains were indistinguishable from streptococcus bovis strains, 2b, h24 and ar3. the remaining three strains were similar but not identical to a ruminal strain of strep. intermedius (ar36). in addition, the susceptibility of these strains to infection by five bacteriophages was examined. three of the phages (phi sb02, phi sb03 and phi sb04) were specific to the strain of strep. bovis from which they were isolated, while phages 2bv and phi sb01 infected one and two strains, respectively, in addition to their primary host. it was concluded that although strep. bovis is relatively homogeneous genetically, broad host range phages appear to be uncommon with this bacterial species.

TI  == the ability of "low g + c gram-positive" ruminal bacteria to resist monensin and  counteract potassium depletion.
AB  == gram-negative ruminal bacteria with an outer membrane are generally more resistant to the feed additive, monensin, than gram-positive species, but some bacteria can adapt and increase their resistance. 16s rrna sequencing indicates that a variety of ruminal bacteria are found in the "low g + c gram-positive group," but some of these bacteria are monensin resistant and were previously described as gram-negative species (e.g., selenomonas ruminantium and megasphaera elsdenii). the activity of monensin can be assayed by its ability to cause potassium loss, and results indicated that the amount of monensin needed to catalyze half maximal potassium depletion (k(d)) from low g + c gram-positive ruminal bacteria varied by as much as 130-fold. the k(d) values for butyrivibrio  fibrisolvens 49, streptococcus bovis jb1, clostridium aminophilum f, s. ruminantium hd4, and m. elsdenii b159 were 10, 65, 100, 1020, and 1330 nm monensin, respectively. b. fibrisolvens was very sensitive to monensin, and it did not adapt. s. bovis and c. aminophilum cultures that were transferred repeatedly with sub-lethal doses of monensin had higher k(d) values than unadapted cultures, but the k(d) was always less than 800 nm. s. ruminantium and  m. elsdenii cells were highly resistant (k(d) > 1000 nm), and this resistance could be explained by the ability of these low g + c gram-positive bacteria to synthesize outer membranes.

TI  == proteolytic activities of the starch-fermenting ruminal bacterium, streptococcus  bovis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize the extracellular proteolytic activity of streptococcus bovis. strains keg, jb1, ncfb 2476, and k11.21.09.6c produced very similar large molecular weight (160-200 kda) extracellular proteases that were specifically inhibited by pmsf, a serine protease inhibitor.  further experiments with s. bovis keg indicated that cultures grown with casein as the sole added n source produced the greatest level of proteolytic activity, and the level of proteolytic activity was independent of growth rate. clarified ruminal fluid (crf) decreased proteolytic activity by 54% compared with cultures  grown with casein alone, and addition of exogenous peptides and carbohydrates (cho) to the crf further reduced the level of proteolytic activity by 44% and 52%, respectively. these results suggested that the proteolytic activity of s. bovis keg was modulated by available n source and that the proteolytic activity was present for reasons other than providing n for growth. the role of s. bovis in ruminal proteolysis requires further definition, but phenotypic similarity among some ruminal strains would suggest a common niche in ruminal proteolysis. the uniformity of proteolytic activities could make s. bovis a prime candidate for manipulation in ruminal proteolysis control strategies.

TI  == effect of virginiamycin on ruminal fermentation in cattle during adaptation to a  high concentrate diet and during an induced acidosis.
AB  == the objective of exp. 1 was to compare the effects of virginiamycin (vm; 0, 175,  or 250 mg x animal(-1) x d(-1)) and monensin/tylosin (mt; 250/ 90 mg x animal(-1) x d(-1)) on ruminal fermentation products and microbial populations in cattle during adaptation to an all-concentrate diet. four ruminally cannulated, holstein steers were used in a 4x4 williams square design with 21-d periods. steers were stepped up to an all-concentrate diet fed at 2.5% of bw once daily. ruminal ph, protozoal counts, and nh3-n and vfa concentrations generally were unaffected by vm or mt. mean counts of lactobacillus and streptococcus bovis were lower (p<.05) for vm-treated compared with control or mt-treated steers. both vm and mt prevented the increase in fusobacterium necrophorum counts associated with increasing intake of the high-concentrate diet observed in the control. the objective of exp. 2 was to compare the effects of vm and mt on ruminal ph, l(+) lactate and vfa concentrations, and f. necrophorum numbers during carbohydrate overload. six ruminally cannulated holstein steers were assigned randomly to either the control, vm (175 mg/d), or mt (250 + 90 mg/d) treatments. acidosis was induced with intraruminal administration of a slurry of ground corn and corn starch. the vm and mt premixes were added directly to the slurry before administration. carbohydrate challenge induced acute ruminal acidosis (ph was 4.36 and l (+) lactate was 19.4 mm) in controls by 36 h. compared with the controls, steers receiving vm or mt had higher (p<.05) ruminal ph, and the vm group had a lower (p<.05) l (+) lactate concentration. fusobacterium necrophorum  numbers initially increased in vm- and mt-administered steers. in the control steers, f. necrophorum was undetectable by 36 h. virginiamycin seemed to control  the growth of ruminal lactic acid-producing bacteria and, therefore, has the potential to moderate ruminal fermentation in situations that could lead to rapid production of lactic acid.

TI  == streptococcal meningitis in adult patients: current epidemiology and clinical spectrum.
AB  == streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae are a rare cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. we report 29 cases of streptococcal meningitis (1977-1997). the patients comprised 19 men and 10 women, with a mean age +/- standard deviation of 47 +/- 18 years. nine cases were secondary to neurosurgical procedures, seven to brain abscess, five to cerebrospinal fluid pericranial fistula, and three to endocarditis. causative microorganisms included the following: viridans group streptococci, 20 cases; anaerobic streptococci, 3; streptococcus agalactiae, 3; streptococcus bovis, 2; and streptococcus pyogenes,  1. four streptococcus mitis strains showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin (mic, 0.5-2 microg/ml). five patients (17%) died. the infection is increasing in  the hospital setting. streptococci resistant to penicillin should be considered in the empirical treatment of nosocomial meningitis. in cases of community-acquired infection, anaerobic streptococci or streptococci of the streptococcus milleri group should alert the clinician to the presence of an undiagnosed brain abscess, whereas oral streptococci of the viridans group suggest the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == immunisation against lactic acidosis in cattle.
AB  == the present study was designed to investigate the efficacy of control of lactic acidosis by immunisation against lactic acid-producing bacteria, streptococcus bovis and lactobacillus. ten steers were allocated to two treatment groups. one group was immunised with a vaccine containing s. bovis (strain sb-5) and lactobacillus (lb-27) cells, and the other was a non-immunised control group. the vaccine, using freund's complete adjuvant for primary immunisation and freund's incomplete adjuvant for boosters, was administered intramuscularly. after primary immunisation, boosters were given at 2 to 4 week intervals. both anti- s. bovis and anti- lactobacillus igg levels in saliva increased significantly (p < 0.01) after the 1st booster which were lower (p < 0.05) than the igg levels after the 2nd and 3rd boosters, but were not significantly different (p > 0.05) from the igg levels prior to a grain challenge (after the 4th booster). there were positive correlations between the anti- s.bovis and anti- lactobacillus igg in serum and saliva. compared with the control group, steers in the immunised group  had higher (p < 0.05) feed intakes, lower (p < 0.05) rumen concentrations of lactate and lower numbers of s. bovis and lactobacillus. three of the control animals were withdrawn from the grain challenge due to their rumen ph persisting  below 5.2, while only one animal in the immunised group was withdrawn. these results suggest that the risk of lactic acidosis can be reduced by immunisation against s. bovis and lactobacillus.

AB  == inflammations of the udder influence the amount of somatic cells and lactose as well as electrical conductivity in milk. they are often caused by bacterial agents. similar reactions are to be seen in relation to c-reactive protein (crp). the amount of crp in milk depends on concentration and characteristics of the agents and the phase of inflammation. we found a significant increase of crp in milk samples with streptococcus (sc.) uberis. there was no significant difference in crp concentrations in samples with coagulase positive staphylococcus spp. (cps) and bacteriological negative samples and such with corynebacterium (c.) bovis, micrococcus spp. and staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis. we only found high correlations to the amount of somatic sells and lactose as well as electrical conductivity in samples with sc. uberis. the results of our investigations show that crp may be a parameter for better understanding subclinical inflammations of udder.

AB  == thermophilic streptococci were isolated from biofilms on stainless steel samples  exposed to pasteurized skimmed milk and from dairy products from a dairy manufacturing plant. the phenotypic characters of these isolates were distinct from those of other thermophilic streptococci of dairy origin (streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus bovis). genotypic data [restriction endonuclease analysis, ribotyping, random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) profiles, dna-dna hybridization and g + c contents] support the classification of these isolates as a new species. the sequence of the 16s rrna was compared with that of 29 species  of streptococci and shown to be significantly different. the sequence of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region also differed from published sequences of closely related species. a fluorescent in situ hybridization probe prepared to a  specific part of the 16s rrna gene sequence was able to distinguish the unknown isolates from reference isolates of s. thermophilus and s. bovis. it is proposed  that these thermophilic streptococcal isolates from a dairy environment be classified in the genus streptococcus as a new species, streptococcus waius (from waiu, the new zealand maori word for milk). the type strain is 3/1t (= nzrcc 20100t).

TI  == structure and transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding pyruvate formate-lyase of a ruminal bacterium, streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the gene (pfl) encoding pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl) from streptococcus bovis was sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequence of pfl was similar to streptococcus mutans pfl, and included the conserved regions necessary for free-radical formation and a catalytic site. the pfl of s. bovis appeared to be a free-radical-containing enzyme because of its dioxygen sensitivity and its amino  acid sequence similarity with the escherichia coli enzyme. the pfl mrna of s. bovis was approximately 2.3 kb and was transcribed in a monocistronic fashion. when cells were grown in batch culture at ph 6.9, the level of pfl transcript increased as the growth phase changed from exponential growth to stationary phase. this result was in constrast to the previous observation that the level of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) mrna decreased during the later stages of growth. continuous culture experiments conducted at ph 6.9 under glucose-limited and ammonia-limited conditions revealed that pfl mrna was decreased by an excess supply of glucose, as well as by a high growth rate. on the contrary, ldh mrna increased when excess glucose was supplied and the growth rate was high. the amount of pfl mrna in cells was lower at ph 4.5 than ph 6.9, whereas the level of ldh mrna was higher at ph 4.5. this result was consistent with the amounts of pfl and ldh in cells and the proportion of formate and lactate produced. these results support the hypothesis that s. bovis regulates pfl and ldh synthesis at the transcriptional level in response to growth conditions.

AB  == alexomycin (pnu-82, 127) is a thiopeptide antimicrobial complex intended for veterinary practice that belongs to a series of cyclic peptides produced by streptomyces arginensis. mics against selected routine and fastidious clinical isolates of animal and human origin were determined by broth microdilution or agar dilution reference methods. alexomycin was active against gram-positive pathogens such as oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and  coagulase-negative staphylococci (260 strains; mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml), as well  as enterococcus species (95 strains; mic90, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml), and generally inactive against gram-negative aerobes. alexomycin had more potent activity against streptococcus bovis (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), s. agalactiae (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), corynebacterium species (mic90, 0.06-0.12 microgram/ml), and listeria monocytogenes (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). alexomycin activity was limited against bacillus species (mic90, 1 microgram/ml), neisseria  meningiditis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 32 micrograms/ml). this thiopeptide complex was also found to be stable at low concentrations (0.015-32 micrograms/ml) in mueller-hinton broth for up to 24 h, possesses static antimicrobial activity and  did not produce resistant mutants after multiple passages at subinhibitory drug concentrations. alexomycin seems to have potential for use as a feed additive to  increase feed efficiency and promote growth in poultry and swine as well as other applications against gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == ultrastructure of surface components of streptococcus gallolytics (s. bovis) strains of differing virulence isolated from pigeons.
AB  == virulence of streptococcus gallolyticus (s. bovis) strains isolated from pigeons  is associated with the presence of the extracellular proteins a, t1, t2 and t3. based on the presence or absence of these proteins, six supernatant-phenotypes are distinguished. experimental infection studies have indicated that strains belonging to the a-t1, a+t1, a+t2 and a+t3 groups are highly virulent for pigeons, strains belonging to the a-t3 groups are moderately virulent and a-t2 strains are of low virulence. in this study the surface structure of 15 pigeon s. gallolyticus strains representing high, moderate and low virulence supernatant-phenotypes was examined by electron microscopy. the presence of capsular material was determined by transmission electron microscopy after polycationic ferritin labelling and immunostabilization. capsules from cells labelled with polycationic ferritin were usually thicker than those from cells exposed to antiserum. the capsule of the virulent strains had a regular, continuous appearance whilst irregularity of the capsule was a characteristic of  the low virulence a-t2 strains. negative staining revealed the presence of fimbriae in all strains belonging to the high virulence a-t1, a+t1, a+t2 and a+t3 supernatant groups and in one strain of the moderately virulent a-t3 group. the fimbriae were thin, flexible structures with a diameter of approximately 3-4 nm and a length of up to 700 nm. fimbriae as described above were absent in two other a-t3 strains examined and in the low virulence a-t2 strains. results from this study indicate that morphological differences in surface structure exist among virulent and low virulence pigeon s. gallolyticus strains, and that the capsule and/or fimbriae are possibly involved in virulence.

AB  == to combat the increasing rates of penicillin resistance among pneumococci and viridans group streptococci, new gram-positive active agents are needed to avoid  the overuse of vancomycin. sch27899 is an everninomicin derivative with strong activity against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, and penicillin-resistant streptococci. this study tests the in vitro activity of sch27899 against 304 strains of streptococci and evaluates the  quality of the agar dilution, broth microdilution, disk diffusion, and etest methods for this antimicrobial agent. quality-control (qc) ranges for sch27899 are also proposed. sch27899 broth microdilution mics among the penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococci tested ranged from < or = 0.008-0.5 microgram/ml. organism groups with their respective mic90s were as follows: streptococcus pneumoniae (100 strains) and beta-haemolytic streptococci  (70 strains), 0.12 microgram/ml; streptococcus bovis (10 strains), 0.25 microgram/ml; and viridans group streptococci (124 strains), 0.5 microgram/ml. etest sch27899 mics correlated well with broth microdilution mics (92% +/- one log2 dilution, 98% +/- two log2 dilutions). agar dilution sch27899 mics correlated well with broth microdilution mics, but a shift toward slightly higher agar dilution mics was attributed to difficulties in reading trailing endpoints with this method. three concentrations (2.5, 5, and 10 micrograms) of sch27899 were used for the disk diffusion method with small inhibition zone diameters (range, 11 to 19 mm) and limited variation between diameters (+/- 2 mm) as a result, both products of this compound's high molecular weight and poor diffusion through agar mediums. proposed control ranges for sch27899 when testing s. pneumoniae atcc 49619 from a nine-center (30 tests per center) quality-control trial are < or = 0.016 to 0.032 microgram/ml for etest, and 0.008 to 0.032 microgram/ml for broth microdilution tests from an earlier study. because of the  limited diffusion ability and bacteriostatic nature of sch27899, mics should be read at 80% of inhibition with agar in vitro systems (etest, agar dilution), and  the disk diffusion method is not recommended.

TI  == [streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colonic involvement].
AB  == mcneal and blevins published the first report of streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis in 1945. in 1951, mccoy suggested, for the first time, that an association could exist between group d streptococcus infective endocarditis and  colon carcinoma; this association would be demonstrated later (1977) by klein and unquestionably confirmed by several posterior works. due to a clinical case of streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis, which we had the opportunity of diagnosing, a review is made of the existent literature about the association between infection by this agent and the presence of lesions in the colon. some recommendations are made in what respects the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis. finally, the implications and therapeutic strategies in these patients are discussed.

TI  == manipulation of ruminal fermentation with organic acids: a review.
AB  == the dicarboxylic acids aspartate, fumarate, and malate stimulate lactate utilization by the predominant ruminal bacterium, selenomonas ruminantium. malate stimulates lactate uptake by s. ruminantium more than does aspartate or fumarate, and it seems that malate and sodium are involved in stimulating lactate utilization by this bacterium. based on the ability of s. ruminantium to grow on  malate in the presence of extracellular hydrogen and produce succinate, malate may be acting as an electron sink for hydrogen in the succinate-propionate pathway used by s. ruminantium. incorporation of dl-malate into soluble starch and cracked corn fermentations with mixed ruminal microorganisms changed final ph, ch4, and vfa in a manner analogous to ionophore effects. when compared with either dicarboxylic acids or monensin alone, dicarboxylic acid plus monensin addition to cracked corn incubations stimulated the mixed ruminal microorganism fermentation to produce more propionate, less lactate, and increased final ph. reduced lactate concentrations in dicarboxylic acid- and monensin-treated incubations most likely represents an additive effect of decreased lactate production by monensin-sensitive bacteria (i.e., streptococcus bovis) and increased lactate utilization by the monensin-resistant s. ruminantium. the inclusion of malate as a feed additive into the diets of ruminants is currently not economically feasible; however, forages rich in organic acids might serve as  vehicles for providing malate to ruminants. when five alfalfa varieties and three bermudagrass hay varieties were surveyed for malate content, the concentration of malate in both plant species declined as maturity increased. however, after 42 d  of maturity, the concentration of malate in both forages ranged between 1.9 and 4.5% of the dm. these results suggest that the incorporation of forage varieties  that are high in malate may include malate economically into the diet and reduce  losses associated with ruminal acidosis.

AB  == a bacteriocin-like activity produced by enterococcus faecium bc25, isolated from  the the rumen of a cow, was partially purified and characterized. the active substance was prepared by ammonium sulfate and chloroform/methanol precipitation  of culture supernatant. the bacteriocin was a protein of molecular mass 17.5 kda. activity was inactivated by trypsin and proteinase k. the bacteriocin bc25 inhibited growth of amylolytic ruminal strains of streptococcus bovis, including  s. bovis ao 24/85. results showed that bacteriocine substance bc25 has a bacteriostatic effect when present in concentrations exceeding 125 au/ml. agar overlays and batch culture growth experiments proved that e. faecium bc25 was producing bacteriocin that inhibited the growth of s. bovis.

TI  == clinical and morphological characteristics in streptococcus bovis endocarditis: a comparison with other causative microorganisms in 177 cases.
AB  == aim: to compare the clinical and morphological characteristics of patients with streptococcus bovis endocarditis with those of patients with endocarditis caused  by other microorganisms. methods: 177 consecutive patients (streptococcus bovis,  22; other streptococci, 94; staphylococci, 44; other, 17) with definite infective endocarditis according to the duke criteria were included. all patients underwent transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography. in 88 patients, findings from surgery/necropsy were obtained. results: s bovis endocarditis was associated with older patients, with a higher mortality (p = 0.04), and with a higher rate of cardiac surgery (p < 0.001) than other microorganisms, although embolic events were observed less often (p = 0.02). pathological gastrointestinal lesions were detected in 45% of the patients. multiple valves were affected in 68% of the patients with s bovis endocarditis and in 20% of those with other organisms (p <  0.001). moderate or severe regurgitation occurred more often in s bovis endocarditis than with other microorganisms (p = 0.05). when surgery or necropsy  was performed, infectious myocardial infiltration of the left ventricle was confirmed histopathologically in 36% of the patients with s bovis endocarditis and in 10% of those with other organisms (p = 0.002). conclusions: s bovis endocarditis is a severe illness because of the more common involvement of multiple valves, and of the frequent occurrence of haemodynamically relevant valvar regurgitation and infectious myocardial infiltration.

TI  == hydration of linoleic acid by bacteria isolated from ruminants.
AB  == two strains of enterococcus faecalis isolated from the ovine rumen and known to hydrate oleic acid were shown to transform linoleic acid by hydration into two products. the products, identified as 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid and 13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid, were formed during stationary phase in yields of  13% and 6% respectively. yields increased to 22% and 14% when culture conditions  were optimised. to our knowledge, this is the first report of 13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid production by bacteria. during a search for further linoleic-acid-hydrating bacteria, a strain of streptococcus bovis isolated from bovine faeces and the ruminal strain s. bovis jb1 were found to hydrate linoleic acid. both strains formed only one product and the most rapid appearance occurred during exponential growth. the s. bovis product, identified as 13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid, formed in a yield of 28%. this study provides  the first information on linoleic acid hydration by ruminal bacteria.

AB  == fourteen patients (11 men and 3 women) with streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis have been observed by the infectious disease section of our department of clinical medicine between the years 1988-1998. the mean age was 63.2 years (range 35-85 years); 5 patients previously suffered valvular disease or had a valvular prosthesis, the infection involved the mitral valve in 6 patients, the aortic in 8, the prosthetic valve in 1. no patient developed cardiac failure or died during hospitalization; only 1 episode of major embolism  (spleen) was observed. no patient required cardiac surgery. all patients became afebrile after starting antibiotic treatment; no cases of streptococcus bovis relapse have been observed, during a six-month follow-up after antibiotics discontinuation, in 13 patients fully evaluated. the remaining patient was lost to follow-up. an underlying asymptomatic colonic neoplasm was diagnosed at colonoscopy in 7 of 11 evaluated patients. this study confirms that streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis is relatively benign, but it stresses the frequency  and potential severity of the associated colonic lesions, requiring colonoscopy and making the treatment of high risk lesion mandatory.

TI  == effects of laidlomycin propionate and monensin on glucose utilization and nutrient transport by streptococcus bovis and selenomonas ruminantium.
AB  == the objective of this study was to compare the effects of laidlomycin propionate  and monensin on cell growth, glucose fermentation, and glucose uptake in streptococcus bovis strain jb1 and selenomonas ruminantium strain hd4. experiments were also conducted to compare the effects of both ionophores on sodium-dependent serine transport and cell yield in s. bovis. batch cultures (500 ml) of each bacterium were grown on 3.6 g/l d-glucose in semidefined medium and treated with either 5 ppm monensin or 2 ppm laidlomycin propionate (n=2). cell growth was monitored by measuring optical density at 600 nm (od600). glucose and  l-lactate concentrations were measured using coupled enzyme assays. in s. bovis,  both monensin and laidlomycin propionate decreased od600, glucose utilization, and l-lactate production. neither ionophore had any effect on glucose utilization by s. ruminantium. [14c]glucose uptake between 5 and 30 min by both bacteria was  not altered by either ionophore. sodium-dependent [14c]serine uptake by s. bovis  was inhibited by monensin but not laidlomycin propionate. when s. bovis was grown in glucose-limited continuous culture (dilution rate=.10 h(-1)) at extracellular  ph 6.7, increasing concentrations of both ionophores decreased bacterial yield, and both ionophores were more potent at an extracellular ph of 5.7. however, monensin was a more potent inhibitor than laidlomycin propionate at ph 6.7 and 5.7. collectively, these results suggest that the ionophore laidlomycin propionate inhibits the gram-positive bacterium s. bovis in a manner similar to that of monensin, but, at the concentrations used in this study, laidlomycin propionate seems to be less potent than monensin in inhibiting serine uptake and  cell yield.

TI  == phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization of ruminal tannin-tolerant bacteria.
AB  == the 16s rrna sequences and selected phenotypic characteristics were determined for six recently isolated bacteria that can tolerate high levels of hydrolyzable  and condensed tannins. bacteria were isolated from the ruminal contents of animals in different geographic locations, including sardinian sheep (ovis aries), honduran and colombian goats (capra hircus), white-tail deer (odocoileus  virginianus) from upstate new york, and rocky mountain elk (cervus elaphus nelsoni) from oregon. nearly complete sequences of the small-subunit rrna genes,  which were obtained by pcr amplification, cloning, and sequencing, were used for  phylogenetic characterization. comparisons of the 16s rrna of the six isolates showed that four of the isolates were members of the genus streptococcus and were most closely related to ruminal strains of streptococcus bovis and the recently described organism streptococcus gallolyticus. one of the other isolates, a gram-positive rod, clustered with the clostridia in the low-g+c-content group of  gram-positive bacteria. the sixth isolate, a gram-negative rod, was a member of the family enterobacteriaceae in the gamma subdivision of the class proteobacteria. none of the 16s rrna sequences of the tannin-tolerant bacteria examined was identical to the sequence of any previously described microorganism  or to the sequence of any of the other organisms examined in this study. three phylogenetically distinct groups of ruminal bacteria were isolated from four species of ruminants in europe, north america, and south america. the presence of tannin-tolerant bacteria is not restricted by climate, geography, or host animal, although attempts to isolate tannin-tolerant bacteria from cows on low-tannin diets failed.

TI  == intracellular alpha-amylase of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == sequencing upstream of the streptococcus mutans gene for a ccpa gene homolog, regm, revealed an open reading frame, named amy, with homology to genes encoding  alpha-amylases. the deduced amino acid sequence showed a strong similarity (60% amino acid identity) to the intracellular alpha-amylase of streptococcus bovis and, in common with this enzyme, lacked a signal sequence. amylase activity was found only in s. mutans cell extracts, with no activity detected in culture supernatants. inactivation of amy by insertion of an antibiotic resistance marker confirmed that s. mutans has a single alpha-amylase activity. the amylase activity was induced by maltose but not by starch, and no acid was produced from  starch. s. mutans can, however, transport limit dextrins and maltooligosaccharides generated by salivary amylase, but inactivation of amy did  not affect growth on these substrates or acid production. the amylase digested the glycogen-like intracellular polysaccharide (ips) purified from s. mutans, but the amy mutant was able to digest and produce acid from ips; thus, amylase does not appear to be essential for ips breakdown. however, when grown on excess maltose, the amy mutant produced nearly threefold the amount of ips produced by the parent strain. the role of amy has not been established, but amy appears to be important in the accumulation of ips in s. mutans grown on maltose.

TI  == strategies that ruminal bacteria use to handle excess carbohydrate.
AB  == when ruminal bacteria have insufficient nitrogen and other nutrients, excess carbohydrate can be toxic. pure cultures that are nitrogen-limited can convert only some of the excess carbohydrate to intracellular polysaccharide, but this pool can be quickly saturated. fibrobacter succinogenes cultures that have excess cellobiose secrete glucose and cellotriose into the culture medium, and prevotella ruminicola produces methylglyoxal, a highly toxic substance that causes a dramatic decrease in viability. some ruminal bacteria (e.g., streptococcus bovis and selenomonas ruminantium) have mechanisms to decrease atp  production or spill the atp that has already been produced. these mechanisms of decreasing intracellular atp seem to protect the cell. most ruminal bacteria can  use ammonia as a nitrogen source, but amino nitrogen increases the growth efficiency of mixed ruminal bacteria. amino nitrogen-dependent improvements in growth efficiency can be explained by an increase in growth rate and a decrease in energy spilling. amino nitrogen is only beneficial if the rate of carbohydrate fermentation is rapid and carbohydrate is in excess.

AB  == the influence of peptides and amino acids on ammonia assimilation and de novo synthesis of amino acids by three predominant noncellulolytic species of ruminal  bacteria, prevotella bryantii b14, selenomonas ruminantium hd4, and streptococcus bovis es1, was determined by growing these bacteria in media containing 15nh4cl and various additions of pancreatic hydrolysates of casein (peptides) or amino acids. the proportion of cell n and amino acids formed de novo decreased as the concentration of peptides increased. at high concentrations of peptides (10 and 30 g/liter), the incorporation of ammonia accounted for less than 0.16 of bacterial amino acid n and less than 0.30 of total n. at 1 g/liter, which is more similar to peptide concentrations found in the rumen, 0.68, 0.87, and 0.46 of bacterial amino acid n and 0.83, 0.89, and 0.64 of total n were derived from ammonia by p. bryantii, s. ruminantium, and s. bovis, respectively. concentration-dependent responses were also obtained with amino acids. no individual amino acid was exhausted in any incubation medium. for cultures of p.  bryantii, peptides were incorporated and stimulated growth more effectively than  amino acids, while cultures of the other species showed no preference for peptides or amino acids. apparent growth yields increased by between 8 and 57%, depending on the species, when 1 g of peptides or amino acids per liter was added to the medium. proline synthesis was greatly decreased when peptides or amino acids were added to the medium, while glutamate and aspartate were enriched to a  greater extent than other amino acids under all conditions. thus, the proportion  of bacterial protein formed de novo in noncellulolytic ruminal bacteria varies according to species and the form and identity of the amino acid and in a concentration-dependent manner.

AB  == enterocin ccm 4231 is a bacteriocin with a broad antimicrobial spectrum produced  by the ruminal strain enterococcus faecium ccm 4231. its inhibitory effect towards enterococci, ent. faecium ef 26/42, staphylococci, streptococcus bovis ao 24/85 and escherichia coli, as well as towards listeria monocytogenes ohio strain, in the rumen fluid environment was studied during culture at 37 and 30 degrees c for 24 h and 20 days. enterocin ccm 4231 was added to the samples at a  concentration of 3200 au ml-1. the best inhibitory effect was noted against enterococci at both cultivation temperatures. a decrease in total cell count from 10(8) cfu ml-1/or 10(4) cfu ml-1 and from 10(5) cfu ml-1 to 10(1) cfu ml-1 was detected. addition of enterocin to the rumen fluid also inhibited staphylococci (from 10(5) cfu ml-1 to 10(4) cfu ml-1 and/or 10(3) cfu ml-1). gram-negative e. coli cells were inhibited at both cultivation temperatures (decrease from 10(6) cfu ml-1 to 10(1) cfu ml-1 at 37 degrees c, and from 10(7) cfu ml-1 to 10(5) cfu  ml-1 at 30 degrees c). enterococcus faecium ef 26/42 and streptococcus bovis ao 24/85, the strains growing in the rumen fluid, were the most sensitive to the addition of enterocin during the first 24 h of fermentation (decrease from 10(10) cfu ml-1 and 10(8) cfu ml-1 to 10(6) cfu ml-1 and 10(4) cfu ml-1). an antilisterial effect of the bacteriocin was also confirmed. further application of bacteriocin in ruminal ecology was indicated.

TI  == lack of surface receptors not restriction-modification system determines f4 phage resistance in streptococcus bovis ii/1.
AB  == the resistance of streptococcus bovis strain ii/1, the producer of sbvi restriction endonuclease, to f4 phage infection was demonstrated by the double-agar-layer method. despite the presence of restriction endonuclease sbvi which can cleave f4 phage dna to numerous fragments in vitro, the evidence that adsorption inhibition is the most important defence mechanism in phage resistance of s. bovis ii/1 strain was obtained by adhesion experiments in vivo. electron microscopy of phage-host mixtures showed many phage particles on the bacterial surface of phage-sensitive s. bovis 47/3 control strain in comparison with no phage particles seen on s. bovis ii/1 (phage-resistant) strain surface.

TI  == relationship between intracellular phosphate, proton motive force, and rate of nongrowth energy dissipation (energy spilling) in streptococcus bovis jb1.
AB  == when the rate of glucose addition to nongrowing streptococcus bovis cell suspensions was increased, the fermentation was homolactic, fructose-1,6-diphosphate (fdp) increased, intracellular inorganic phosphate (p(i)) declined, and the energy-spilling rate increased. atp and adp were not significantly affected by glucose consumption rate, but the decrease in p(i) was  sufficient to cause an increase in the free energy of atp hydrolysis (delta g'p). the increase in delta g'p was correlated with an increase in proton motive force  (delta p). s. bovis continuous cultures (dilution rate of 0.65 h-1) that were provided with ammonia as the sole nitrogen source also had high rates of lactate  production and energy spilling. when trypticase was added as a source of amino acids, lactate production decreased; a greater fraction of the glucose was converted to acetate, formate, and ethanol; and the energy-spilling rate decreased. trypticase also caused a decrease in fdp, an increase in p(i), and a decrease in delta p. the change in delta p could be explained by p(i)-dependent changes in the delta g'p. when p(i) declined, delta g'p and delta p increased. the ratio of delta g'p to delta p (millivolt per millivolt) was always high (> 4) at low rates of energy spilling but declined when the energy-spilling rate increased. based on these results, it appears that delta p and the energy-spilling rate are responsive to fluctuations in the intracellular p(i) concentration.

AB  == strain differentiation of staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, and candida species was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii followed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. rea of 19 methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates and 19 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolates revealed 8, and 14 patterns, respectively. fifty-three isolates of s. epidermidis were divided into 39 groups on the basis of rea pattern. rea patterns obtained from different strains of the same species were more similar than those  from different staphylococcus species. a total of 67 patterns were noted among 215 s. pneumoniae isolates. there was some correlation between the rea patterns and serotypes. in addition, all 61 isolates showing the pattern 6 (serotype 19) were penicillin-resistant. sixteen isolates of e. coli o157 and 18 isolates of e. coli o25 were analyzed by rea with haeiii. among 14 epidemiologically unrelated e. coli o157:h7 isolates, rea patterns were either identical or differed only by  a few fragment bands. rea patterns of 7 isolates of heat stable enterotoxin producing e. coli o25 from an outbreak were identical. eight distinct rea patterns were noted among 7 toxigenic c. difficile strains, and one to two strains were included in each group. candida strains belonging to different six candida species were analysed by rea. all c. albicans isolates (148 strains) showed one to four bright bands ranging from 4 to 8kb in size, and these strains  were divided into 37 groups according to the rea patterns. each candida strain showed species-specific rea patterns. twenty-one isolates of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were analyzed by pcr with primer complementary to the inverted repeat of is6110(is6110-pcr). the results of pcr of 19 m. tuberculosis isolates and 2 m. bovis bcg isolates revealed 15 patterns, and 1 pattern, respectively. our results demonstrated that rea of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii was a useful tool for strain differentiation. by comparing the species-specific rea patterns of reference strains, clinical isolates of candida  and staphylococci could be identified to the species level if they could not be identified by routine biochemical methods. because is6110-pcr is simple and rapid to perform, it seems to be a good screening method to differentiate m. tuberculosis strains.

TI  == a review of bloat in feedlot cattle.
AB  == improvements in feedlot management practices and the use of various feed additives have reduced, but not eliminated, the occurrence of bloat in feedlot cattle. feedlot bloat reduces the profitability of production by compromising animal performance and more directly by causing fatalities. in feedlots, bloat is associated with the ingestion of large amounts of rapidly fermented cereal grain  and destabilization of the microbial populations of the rumen. an abundance of rapidly fermented carbohydrate allows acid-tolerant bacteria (e.g., streptococcus bovis and lactobacillus spp.) to proliferate and produce excessive quantities of  fermentation acids. as a result, ruminal ph becomes exceedingly low, and this impairs rumen motility. further, the excessive production of mucopolysaccharide or "slime" increases the viscosity of ruminal fluid and stabilizes the foam implicated in frothy feedlot bloat. although protocols have been developed to treat feedlot bloat, the most profitable approach is to use management strategies to reduce its likelihood. amount of roughage, grain processing techniques, selection of cereal grain (e.g., corn, barley, and wheat), dietary adaptation periods, and various additives (e.g., ionophores) can influence the occurrence of bloat in feedlot cattle. successful management of these factors depends on a thorough understanding of the behavioral, dietary, and microbial events that precipitate bloat in feedlot cattle.

TI  == ruminal microbial and fermentative changes associated with experimentally induced subacute acidosis in steers.
AB  == we used six ruminally cannulated steers in a two-period crossover design to study ruminal fermentative and microbial changes associated with induced subacute acidosis. steers were adapted to either an 80% alfalfa hay (hay-adapted)- or corn grain (grain-adapted)-based concentrate diet. after feed was withheld for 24 h, steers were overfed with an all-grain diet at 3.5 x nem daily for 3 d. ruminal contents and jugular blood samples were collected before withholding feed and at  0 and 12 h daily for 3 d during the overfeeding period. ruminal samples were analyzed for ph, lactate, vfa concentrations, and counts of total anaerobic, amylolytic, lactic acid-producing and -fermenting bacteria, and ciliated protozoa. blood samples were analyzed to assess acid-base status. ruminal ph declined to a range of 5.5 to 5.0 with increased vfa concentrations, but normal lactate concentrations (<5 mm) were indicative of subacute acidosis. total viable and amylolytic bacterial counts were higher (p < .05) in grain-adapted than hay-adapted steers. anaerobic lactobacilli counts increased over time (p < .01) in both groups and were generally higher in grain-adapted than hay-adapted steers. lactate-utilizing bacteria were initially greater in grain-adapted than hay-adapted steers and increased over time in both groups following grain challenge. total ciliates were initially higher (p < .05) in grain-adapted than hay-adapted steers and decreased after 48 h in both groups. blood acid-base changes were minimal. bacterial changes associated with subacute acidosis resemble those reported during adaptation to grain feeding, and the decline in ciliated protozoa may be the only microbial indicator of a potentially acidotic condition in the rumen.

TI  == the ability of 2-deoxyglucose to promote the lysis of streptococcus bovis jb1 via a mechanism involving cell wall stability.
AB  == the non-metabolizable glucose analog, 2-deoxyglucose (2-dg), decreased the growth rate and optical density of streptococcus bovis jb1 20%, but it had an even greater effect on stationary phase cultures. control cultures receiving only glucose (2 mg/ml) lysed very slowly (<5% decline in optical density in 48 h), but cultures that had been grown with glucose and 2-dg (2 mg/ml each) lysed much faster (>85% decline in optical density in 48 h). cultures that were treated with inhibitors that decreased intracellular atp (sodium fluoride, nigericin, and valinomycin or tetrachlorosalicylanilide) or membrane potential (sodium fluoride, nigericin, and valinomycin, tetrachlorosalicylanilide, or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) did not promote lysis. 2-dg had its greatest effect when it was added at inoculation. if 2-dg was added at later times, less lysis was observed, and cells that were given 2-dg just prior to stationary phase were unaffected. cells  that were grown with glucose and 2-dg were more susceptible to cell wall-degrading enzymes (lysozyme and mutanolysin) than cells that had been grown  only with glucose, but sublethal doses of penicillin during growth did not promote lysis after the cells had reached stationary phase. the idea that 2-dg might be affecting autolytic activity was supported by the observation that cultures washed and resuspended in fresh medium with or without 2-dg lysed at a slower rate than cultures that were not centrifuged or were resuspended in the culture supernatant.

TI  == clinical mastitis in dairy cattle in ontario: frequency of occurrence and bacteriological isolates.
AB  == the objective of this study was to describe the frequency of occurrence of clinical mastitis in dairy herds in ontario. the study group consisted of 65 dairy farms involved in a 2-year observational study, which included recording all clinical mastitis cases and milk sampling of quarters with clinical mastitis. lactational incidence risks of 9.8% for abnormal milk only, 8.2% for abnormal milk with a hard or swollen udder, and 4.4% for abnormal milk plus systemic signs of illness related to mastitis were calculated for 2840 cows and heifers. overall, 19.8% of cows experienced one or more cases of clinical mastitis during  location. teat injuries occurred in 2.1% of lactations. standard bacteriology was performed on pretreatment milk samples from 834 cows with clinical mastitis. the  bacteria isolated were staphylococcus aureus (6.7%), streptococcus agalactiae (0.7%), other streptococcus spp. (14.1%), coliforms (17.2%), gram-positive bacilli (5.5%), corynebacterium bovis (1.7%), and other staphylococcus spp. (28.7%). there was no growth in 17.7% of samples, and 8.3% of samples were contaminated. clinical mastitis is a common disease in dairy cows in ontario; approximately 1 in 5 cow lactations have at lease one episode of clinical mastitis. there is, however, considerable variation in the incidence of clinical  mastitis among farms. the majority of 1st cases of clinical mastitis occur early  in lactation, and the risk of clinical mastitis increases with increasing parity. environmental, contagious, and minor pathogens were all associated with cases of  clinical mastitis.

AB  == an intracellular alpha-amylase from streptococcus bovis 148 was purified and characterized. the enzyme was induced by maltose and soluble starch and produced  about 80% maltotriose from soluble starch. maltopentaose was hydrolyzed to maltotriose and maltose and maltohexaose was hydrolyzed mainly to maltotriose by  the enzyme. maltotetraose, maltotriose, and maltose were not hydrolyzed. this intracellular enzyme was considered to be a maltotriose-producing enzyme. the enzymatic characteristics and hydrolysis product from soluble starch were different from those of the extracellular raw-starch-hydrolyzing alpha-amylase of strain 148. the deduced amino acid sequence of the intracellular alpha-amylase was similar to the sequences of the mature forms of extracellular liquefying alpha-amylases from bacillus strains, although the intracellular alpha-amylase did not contain a signal peptide. no homology between the intracellular and extracellular alpha-amylases of s. bovis 148 was observed.

AB  == interdependency among udder quarters with subclinical mastitis was evaluated on 150 farms using a total of 35,828 udder quarters. the occurrence of high somatic  cell count (scc) (> 250,000 cells/ml) in 0, 3, and 4 quarters occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. for all bacterial species, intramammary infection in 0, 2, 3, or 4 quarters of the same cow occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. intramammary infection and high scc were found less often in front quarters than in rear quarters. high scc and intramammary infection occurred more often in right front quarters than in left front quarters. high scc in diagonal quarters occurred at a lower rate than expected. corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus had the highest intraclass correlation within herd. streptococcus uberis had a very low intraclass correlation within herd. the intraclass correlation within cow for the natural logarithm of scc was 0.47. corynebacterium bovis and strep. agalactiae had the highest intraclass correlation within cow, and streptococcus dysgalactiae had the lowest. analytical methods were proposed to manage the problem of interdependence and its effect on the design or evaluation of field studies on subclinical mastitis.

TI  == [infection by strongyloides stercoralis in the county of safor, spain].
AB  == background: strongyloides stercoralis is an endemic nematode in tropical and subtropical regions, but almost unknown in spain. patients and methods: in order  to know some epidemiological, clinical and analytic features of this infection in our area (la safor, valencia), we performed a prospective study for 19 months. through the search for the parasite in feces of patients with eosinophilia, we identified 37 subjects who were studied at diagnosis and 4 months later. results: thirty-three patients (89%) were currently, or had been agricultural workers, and thirty had worked barefooted and/or had drunk contaminated irrigation water. twenty-three patients (62%) had a chronic or immunosuppressive diseases, and two  of them on steroid treatment, developed a disseminated strongyloidiasis. thirteen patients (35%) were asymptomatic; the rest had clinical manifestations attributed s. stercoralis, mainly digestive. two of the patients with disseminated strongyloidiasis also had concomitant bacterial infections by streptococcus bovis, streptococcus faecalis and enterobacter sp. at diagnosis, besides eosinophilia, 86.5% had raised levels of ige. four months later treatment, the number of eosinophils was normal and ige levels significantly decreased. the diagnostic yield of parasitic study of feces was increased with the number of samples examined. thiabendazole achieved erradication of the parasite in 35 patients, and the other two died because of disseminated strongyloidiasis. conclusions: the presence of eosinophilia in patients from rural areas with subtropical climate should raise suspicion about infection by s. stercoralis, which, although sometimes is asymptomatic, may cause systemic bacterial infections in cases of hyperinfestation, specially when glucocorticoid treatment  is given.

TI  == activity of h(+)-atpase in ruminal bacteria with special reference to acid tolerance.
AB  == batch culture experiments showed that permeabilized cells and membranes of ruminococcus albus and fibrobacter succinogenes, acid-intolerant celluloytic bacteria, have only one-fourth to one-fifth as much h(+)-atpase as megasphaera elsdenii and streptococcus bovis, which are relatively acid tolerant. even in the cells grown in continuous culture at ph 7.0, the acid-intolerant bacteria contained less than half as much h(+)-atpase as the acid-tolerant bacteria. the amounts of h(+)-atpase in the acid-tolerant bacteria were increased by more than  twofold when the cells were grown at the lowest ph permitting growth, whereas little increase was observed in the case of the acid-intolerant bacteria. these results indicate that the acid-intolerant bacteria not only contain smaller amounts of h(+)-atpase at neutral ph but also have a lower capacity to enhance the level of h(+)-atpase in response to low ph than the acid-tolerant bacteria. in addition, the h(+)-atpases of the acid-intolerant bacteria were more sensitive to low ph than those of the acid-tolerant bacteria, although the optimal phs were similar.

TI  == association between management practices, dairy herd characteristics, and somatic cell count of bulk tank milk.
AB  == objective: to determine whether particular dairy management practices and herd characteristics were associated with somatic cell count (scc) of bulk tank milk.  design: analysis of records. sample population: milk samples collected from 59,435 cows housed in 843 dairy herds between march 1992 and june 1994. procedure: results of bacterial culture of milk samples and data on farm housing, sanitation, milking system, and management were collected. multiple regression analysis was used to determine sources of variation in bulk tank milk scc among herds. results: prevalence of streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus  mastitis was associated with bulk tank milk scc. in herds free of s agalactiae mastitis, prevalence of s aureus and corynebacterium bovis mastitis were important. for herds without s agalactiae mastitis, use of sawdust bedding was associated with a decrease in scc and a dirty loose housing area was associated with an increase. increased milk production, repeated mastitis control visits, and use of particular predip compounds were significantly associated with reduced scc in all herds, regardless of whether any cows in the herd had s agalactiae mastitis. in herds with s agalactiae mastitis, use of iodine (certain concentrations), chlorhexidine, peroxide, or sodium chlorite-lactic acid as a predip was associated with a decrease in scc. only use of sodium chlorite-lactic  acid predip was significantly associated with a decrease in scc in herds without  s agalactiae mastitis. clinical implications: important factors associated with bulk tank milk scc were prevalence of s agalactiae and s aureus mastitis, careful application of particular predip compounds, avoiding a dirty loose housing area,  and use of a service to regularly monitor prevalence of mastitis in the herd.

AB  == the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin was compared with that of other widely  used antibiotics against 355 strains isolated from patients with endocarditis. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution method. quinupristin/dalfopristin was inhibitory at 1 mg/l for all coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 36) and for the majority of staphylococcus aureus strains (n = 87). the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against 186 viridans streptococci  was somewhat dependent on the species, with mic50s ranging from 0.5 to 2 mg/l, being least active against streptococcus bovis and most active against streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis. for the staphylococci, quinupristin/dalfopristin was as active against erythromycin-susceptible as erythromycin-resistant strains. viridans streptococci showed a slight but significant correlation between sensitivity to erythromycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. it is concluded that quinupristin/dalfopristin has the potential to treat serious infections such as endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci.

TI  == peptidases of the rumen bacterium, prevotella ruminicola.
AB  == prevotella (formerly bacteroides) ruminicola is a numerous rumen bacterium which  plays a significant role in the metabolism of proteins and peptides in the rumen. measurement of the hydrolysis of synthetic aminopeptidase substrates by sonicated extracts and whole cells of different species of rumen bacteria indicated that p. ruminicola had the greatest range and specific activity of dipeptidyl peptidases  among the species tested. streptococcus bovis hydrolysed some dipeptidyl peptidase substrates to a lesser extent, and several species broke down ala2-p-nitroanilide, including ruminobacter amylophilus, ruminococcus spp. and veillonella parvula. dipeptidyl peptidases, which cleave dipeptides from the amino-terminus of longer peptides, were much more active than aminopeptidases removing single amino acids in p. ruminicola. ion-exchange chromatography of sonicated extracts of p. ruminicola m384 revealed at least four distinct activities: one hydrolysed ala2-p-nitroanilide, valala-p-nitroanilide, ala4and ala5; another was an o2-sensitive activity hydrolysing glyarg-4-methoxynapthylamide, argarg-4-methoxynaphthylamide, gly5 and valglyserglu, similar to dipeptidyl peptidase type i dpp-1); a third hydrolysed glypro-p-nitroanilide and glypro-4-methoxynapthylamide and was similar to dipeptidyl peptidase type iv xdpp-4); a fourth broke down lysala-4-methoxynaphthylamide. all of the enzymes, and particularly those active  against ala2-p-nitroanilide and glypro-p-nitroanilide, were inhibited by serine protease inhibitors, and all except dpp-4 were inhibited by edta. both dpp-1 and  the enzyme hydrolysing lysala-4-methoxynaphthylamide were inhibited strongly by iodoacetate. dpp-4 was inhibited completely by diprotin a. competitive inhibition experiments suggested that dpp-1 was less important than the other enzymes in the breakdown of peptide mixtures.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the effect of natural udder infection with minor pathogens on subsequent natural infection with major pathogens. sample population: 7 dairy  herds with low bulk milk somatic cell count. procedure: during a 20-month prospective study, milk samples were collected from diary cows at regular intervals and from quarters with clinical signs of mastitis. incidence of intramammary infection was calculated in uninfected quarters and in quarters infected with minor pathogens. a within-cow, matched case-control analysis was used to evaluate the effect of minor pathogens on subsequent infection with major pathogens. results: quarters infected with minor pathogens had higher somatic cell count than did uninfected quarters. in quarters infected with corynebacterium bovis, the rate of infection with major pathogens was lower, whereas in quarters infected with coagulase-negative micrococcaceae, the rate of  infection with major pathogens was higher than that in uninfected quarters. from  the within-cow comparison, it appeared that, in quarters infected with minor pathogens, infection with major pathogens was significantly lower than that in comparable control quarters not infected with minor pathogens. conclusions: minor pathogens have a protective effect against infection with major pathogens. the protective effect of c bovis against subsequent infection with major pathogens appears to be greater than the effect of coagulase-negative micrococcaceae.

TI  == emergence of vancomycin resistance in the genus streptococcus: characterization of a vanb transferable determinant in streptococcus bovis.
AB  == streptococcus bovis nem760 was isolated from a stool swab collected on admission  from a patient as surveillance for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. strain nem760 was identified as s. bovis by conventional biochemical methods and partial sequence analysis of its 16s rrna. this strain was resistant to a low level of vancomycin (mic, 64 micrograms/ml) but was susceptible to teicoplanin (mic, 1 micrograms/ml), and vancomycin induced resistance to both glycopeptides. the presence of a vanb-related gene in nem760 was demonstrated in a pcr assay which enabled specific amplification of a 635-hp internal segment of vanb. sequence analysis of the corresponding pcr product revealed that it was highly homologous  (96% identity) to the prototype vanb sequence of enterococcus faecalis v583. the  vanb resistance of determinant of s. bovis nem760 was transferred by conjugation  to e. faecalis and enterococcus faecium at a similar frequency of 2 x 10(-5) per  donor. smai-digested genomic dnas of independently obtained transconjugants of e. faecalis and e. faecium were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern hybridization with a vanb dna probe. the electrophoretic and hybridization patterns obtained with all transconjugants of the same species were indistinguishable and revealed vanb-containing chromosomal insertions of approximately 100 kb. these results suggest that the genes mediating vanb-type resistance in s. bovis nem760 are part of large transferable genetic elements. the results presented in the report demonstrate for the first time the role of streptococci in the dissemination of vancomycin resistance among gram-positive bacteria.

(ab titers were > or = 1/512 and igm > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients  1 year later). heterologous ab: in spite of statistically significant difference  found in sie versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256)  is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. conclusions: the utility of homologous ab for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. on the contrary for heterologous ab, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.

TI  == catabolite regulation in a diauxic strain and a nondiauxic strain of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == streptococcus bovis jb1 utilized glucose preferentially to lactose and grew diauxically, but s. bovis 581axy2 grew nondiauxically and used glucose preferentially only when the glucose concentration was very high (greater than 5  mm). as little as 0.1 mm glucose completely inhibited the lactose transport of jb1. the lactose transport system of 581axy2 was at least tenfold less sensitive  to glucose, and 1 mm glucose caused only a 50% inhibition of lactose transport. both strains had phosphotransferase systems (ptss) for glucose and lactose. the glucose ptss were constitutive, but little lactose pts activity was detected unless lactose was the energy source for growth. jb1 had approximately threefold  more glucose pts activity than 581axy2 (1600 versus 600 nmol glucose (mg protein)-1(min)-1. the glucose pts of jb1 showed normal michaelis menten kinetics, and the affinity constant (ks) was 0.12 mm. the glucose pts of 581axy2  was atypical, and the plot of velocity versus velocity/substrate was biphasic. the low capacity system had a ks of 0.20 mm, but the ks of the high capacity system was greater than 6 mm. on the basis of these results, diauxic growth is dependent on the affinity of glucose enzyme ii and the velocity of glucose transport.

AB  == the effect of levucell sc, a strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae marked as a feed  additive for ruminants, was investigated in vitro on lactate metabolism by the ruminal bacteria streptococcus bovis and megasphaera elsdenii. the coculture between 10(7) live cells x ml(-1) of sc and a streptococcus bovis strain in the presence of glucose reduced lactate production by the bacterial strain. live yeast cells were able to compete with streptococcus bovis for glucose utilization in strictly anaerobic conditions, so less glucose was available for the bacterium. sc also stimulated l-lactate utilization by a strain of m. elsdenii. the effect depended on the concentration of yeast cells added. bacterial growth and fermentation end-product concentrations were also increased in the presence of sc. some amino acids and vitamins, but not dicarboxylic acids, stimulated the  bacterial specific activity of l-lactate uptake. sc was able to provide amino acids to m. elsdenii. in a coculture of streptococcus bovis and m. elsdenii on glucose, the reduction of lactate concentration was improved by sc, the same trend being observed when maltose or soluble starch were used as carbon and energy source. these results indicate that sc can be a very useful tool to reduce lactate accumulation in vitro during fermentation of soluble sugars.

TI  == use of fura-2/am to measure intracellular free calcium in selenomonas ruminantium.
AB  == this paper describes a procedure for loading the acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 (fura-2/am), and the subsequent measurement of the concentration of intracellular free ca2+ ([ca2+]i) in selenomonas ruminantium (s. ruminantium) using this technique. to ascertain the optimal loading conditions, the effect was examined on the loading of fura-2/am of ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (edta), lysozyme, pluronic f127 alone, or the simultaneous application of edta and pluronic f127. individual administration of either edta, lysozyme or pluronic f127 did not produce an optimal loading of fura-2/ am. the co-application of pluronic f127 and bovine serum albumin after treatment with edta increased the ratio of the fluorescence due to excitation at 340 nm to that at 380 nm (r340/380) markedly, with a high signal intensity for intracellular fura-2, indicating that adequate loading had been obtained. using the present loading method, it was found that the resting free [ca2+]i of s. ruminantium was 48.1 +/- 2.2 nm (n = 6). this is approximately one half that found in escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus bovis and eucaryote cells. this is the first measurement of free [ca2+]i using fura-2/am in the gram-negative strict anaerobe s. ruminantium.

TI  == purification and characterization of a malic enzyme from the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis atcc 15352 and cloning and sequencing of its gene.
AB  == malic enzyme (ec 1.1.1.39), which catalyzes l-malate oxidative decarboxylation and pyruvate reductive carboxylation, was purified to homogeneity from streptococcus bovis atcc 15352, and properties of this enzyme were determined. the 2.9-kb fragment containing the malic enzyme gene was cloned, and the sequence was determined and analyzed. the enzymatic properties of the s. bovis malic enzyme were almost identical to those of other malic enzymes previously reported. however, we found that the s. bovis malic enzyme catalyzed unknown enzymatic reactions, including reduction of 2-oxoisovalerate, reduction of 2-oxoisocaproate, oxidation of d-2-hydroxyisovalerate, and oxidation of d-2-hydroxyisocaproate. the requirement for cations and the optimum ph of these unique activities were different from the requirement for cations and the optimum ph of the l-malate oxidative decarboxylating activity. a sequence analysis of the cloned fragment revealed the presence of two open reading frames that were 1,299  and 1,170 nucleotides long. the 389-amino-acid polypeptide deduced from the 1,170-nucleotide open reading frame was identified as the malic enzyme; this enzyme exhibited high levels of similarity to malic enzymes of bacillus stearothermophilus and haemophilus influenzae and was also similar to other malic enzymes and the malolactic enzyme of lactococcus lactis.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500) against a large collection of infrequently isolated or tested species.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500, synercid) is a parenteral streptogramin combination antimicrobial that possesses a synergistic and often bactericidal action against many grampositive species. in this study, a collection of 1270 uncommonly isolated or tested strains were evaluated for susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin using agar dilution minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) methods described in the national committe for clinical laboratory standards. the greatest antimicrobial activity observed for quinupristin/dalfopristin was against staphylococci, streptococci, the pathogenic neisseria, legionella spp., lactobacillus spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90 range, 0.5-2 micrograms/ml). marginal activity (mic90s, 4 to 8 micrograms/ml) was identified for the rarer enterococci, leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp., and streptococcus bovis. against haemophilus parainfluenzae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium spp., and prevotella spp., the streptogramin was inactive. although no susceptible breakpoint has been approved  for quinupristin/dalfopristin, three possible breakpoints (< or = 1, < or = 2, or < or = 4 micrograms/ml) were evaluated. acceptance of the lower breakpoints (< or = 1 or < or = 2 micrograms/ml) would limit quinupristin/dalfopristin use to staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, and legionella spp. these results markedly expand the understanding of the usable spectrum of quinupristin/dalfopristin.

TI  == the effect of amino nitrogen on the energetics of ruminal bacteria and its impact on energy spilling.
AB  == the predominant ruminal bacteria that were obtained from a 10(8) dilution of ruminal fluid could be maintained as a mixed population for long periods as long  as the bacteria were provided with a complex mixture of carbohydrates. growth of  predominant ruminal bacteria in carbohydrate-limited, ammonia-excess, continuous  cultures (0.07/h) had a low requirement for maintenance energy, but the nongrowth energy dissipation of ammonia-limited, carbohydrate-excess, predominant ruminal bacteria was approximately 10-fold higher (0.96 vs. 0.09 mg of hexose equivalent/mg of protein per h, respectively). mathematical derivations indicated that this additional nongrowth energy dissipation could be accommodated by an energy spilling function that was independent of the growth rate. peptides and amino acids had little impact on the yield of carbohydrate-limited, ammonia-excess, continuous cultures (0.07/ h), but amino n greatly increased the  growth rate and yield of excess-energy batch cultures. the change in growth rate  and yield that was dependent on amino n indicated that the energy-excess batch cultures had the same capacity to spill energy as did the ammonia-limited, carbohydrate-excess, predominant ruminal bacteria (0.80 vs. 0.86 mg of hexose equivalent/mg of protein per h, respectively). when the energy-excess batch cultures were provided with amino n, the growth rate increased, the difference in anabolic and catabolic rates was smaller, and less energy was spilled.

TI  == rapid identification of streptococcus and enterococcus species using diffuse reflectance-absorbance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and artificial neural networks.
AB  == diffuse reflectance-absorbance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-ir) was used to analyse 19 hospital isolates which had been identified by conventional means to one enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, streptococcus bovis, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes. principal components analysis of the ft-ir spectra showed that this 'unsupervised' learning method failed to form six  separable clusters (one of each species) and thus could not be used to identify these bacteria base on their ft-ir spectra. by contrast, artificial neural networks (anns) could be trained by 'supervised' learning (using the back-propagation algorithm) with the principal components scores of derivatised spectra to recognise the strains from their ft-ir spectra. these results demonstrate that the combination of ft-ir and anns provides a rapid, novel and accurate bacterial identification technique.

TI  == a role for fructose 1,6-diphosphate in the atpase-mediated energy-spilling reaction of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the amount of atp produced by streptococcus bovis was larger than the amount that could be attributed to growth and maintenance, and even glucose-limited continuous cultures used atp inefficiently (spilled atp). rapid-dilution-rate cultures always spilled more atp than those growing at slow dilution rates, but rates of atp spilling could also be enhanced by amino acid deprivation (with only ammonia as a nitrogen source). energy spilling and intracellular atp were not correlated, but energy spilling was always greatest when the rate of lactate production was high. the relationship between lactate production and energy spilling was supported by the observation that amino acid deprivation increased lactate production and atp spilling. the lactate production rate of nongrowing (energy-spilling) s. bovis cells was fructose 1,6-diphosphate (fdp) dependent, and previous work showed that the lactate dehydrogenase of s. bovis was activated by fdp (m. j. wolin, science 146:775-777, 1964). the role of fdp in energy spilling was supported by the observation that the membrane-bound atpase of s. bovis could be stimulated by fdp. fdp decreased the k(infm) for atp by as much as fivefold. other glycolytic intermediates could not stimulate the atpase of washed membrane preparations, and fdp had no effect on soluble atpase activity.

TI  == detection and localization of peptidases in lactococcus lactis with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: pepn1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase pepn, pept1-5 against a tripeptidase pept and pepd1-3 against a dipeptidase pepd. these monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. a number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. pept1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kda protein in lactobacillus delbrueckii,  while pept1 and pept2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of streptococcus thermophilus and clostridium fervidus. of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against pepn, only pepn3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kda protein in escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against pepn3 cross reacted with 80 kda proteins of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii, and str. bovis, but not of esch. coli. of the three monoclonal antibodies against pepd, only pepd1 and pepd2 cross reacted with 40 kda proteins  of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii and str. bovis. all pepn, pepd and pept antibodies  reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of lc. lactis subsp. cremoris wg2. however, lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other lc. lactis subspecies since only pept1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. immunogold labelling of lc. lactis wg2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that pepn, pepd and pept were located intracellularly. the intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.

TI  == the prevalence of mastitis in primiparous heifers in eleven waikato dairy herds.
AB  == the objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of mastitis among primiparous heifers at calving and at drying off in 11 waikato dairy herds during the 1993-94 dairy production season. duplicate quarter milk samples were collected aseptically from 458 heifers within 5 days after calving for bacteriological analysis. mastitis was diagnosed in at least one quarter in 35.6% of these heifers. coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from 21.8% of the heifers. the prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci varied between herds from 4.3% to 44.8%. environmental streptococci caused mastitis in 12.2% of  heifers, ranging from 5.6% to 24.1% between herds. streptococcus uberus was the pathogen identified most frequently at calving and accounted for more than 90% of the streptococcal isolates. staphylococcus aureus and coliforms were isolated from less than 1% of samples. clinical mastitis was observed in 8.1% of heifers at calving; environmental streptococci were isolated from 67.6% of these clinical clinical cases. only 2.8% of heifers developed clinical mastitis during lactation and environmental streptococci were isolated from 38.5% of these cases. the prevalence of mastitis among 428 of the heifers at drying off was 64.7%; a 1.8 fold increase during lactation. corynebactetium bovis was isolated from 43% of heifers at drying off even though it was not isolated from any heifers at calving. during the season, the prevalence of staphylococcus aureus mastitis increased to 2.8% while mastitis caused by environmental streptococci declined to 2.8%. the prevalence of environmental mastitis pathogens decreased during lactation while contagious pathogens increased in each of the 11 herds. ineffective post-milking teat sanitation probably contributed to the increase in  mastitis caused by contagious pathogens. specific factors were not determined that affected the variation in prevalence between herds.

TI  == purification and properties of extracellular glucosyltransferase from streptococcus bovis.
AB  == eight streptococcus bovis strains were classified into 3 types on the basis of isoelectric point (pi) and molecular mass (m(r)) of extracellular glucosyltransferase. strains atcc 9809, 35034 and 43143 produced glucosyltransferase of pi 3.7 and m(r) 165 kda; strains atcc 15351, 27960 and 33317 produced glucosyltransferase of pi 4.1 and m(r) 140 kda; strains atcc 43085 and 43144 did not produce any glucosyltransferase. the glucosyltransferase form s. bovis 9809 was purified by bio-gel hydroxyapatite chromatography and deae-toyopearl chromatography. the s. bovis 9809 glucosyltransferase was immunologically identical with the other 5 s. bovis glucosyltransferases and not  related to mutants streptococcal glucosyltransferases. the specific activity, the optimum ph and the km value for sucrose were 17.9 u/mg protein, 6.0 and 5.0 mm, respectively. the first 11 n-terminal amino acid residues of the glucosyltransferases were detsavtltre, and the region was hydrophilic. the glucosyltransferases from s. bovis 9809 and 3317 synthesized from sucrose 1, 6-alpha-d-glucan with 9 and 2 mol%, 1, 3, 6-alpha-branched glucose, respectively.

TI  == inducer expulsion is not a determinant of diauxic growth in streptococcus bovis.
AB  == when streptococcus bovis jb1 was repeatedly transferred in a medium that contained the non-metabolizable glucose analog, 2-deoxyglucose, it lost its phosphotransferase system (pts) for glucose but was still able to take up glucose via a facilitated diffusion mechanism. the wild type (jb1) had an inducible enzyme ii lactose, but the mutant (jb1(2dg)) had a constitutive lactose pts. jb1(2dg) was no longer able to exclude lactose when it was provided with glucose, but it retained its ability to expel a non-metabolizable lactose analog. because  jb1(2dg) could utilize glucose and lactose simultaneously and grow in a non-diauxic fashion, it appeared that inducer expulsion was not an important catabolite regulatory mechanism. based on these results, inducer expulsion may be an artifact of non-metabolizable sugars.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (up-pcr) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. a  universal protocol of preparation of pcr samples from cultures representing escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. the bands of up-pcr  products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. the applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the dna bands obtained for different strains. three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis produced very similar dna banding patterns. they comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. the dna profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each  other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. the method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == breakdown of peptides from a casein hydrolysate by rumen bacteria. simultaneous study of enzyme activities and physicochemical parameters.
AB  == the breakdown of a pancreatic hydrolysate of casein (tryptone) by an inoculum of  ruminal mixed bacteria was studied in vitro. peptides were degradated at 33% after 5 h. the dipeptidyl aminopeptidase type 1 (dap-1), exoaminopeptidase and leucine aminopeptidase (lap) like activities were measured using, respectively, gly-arg-mna, ala-pna and leu-pna as substrates. while the total proteolytic activity remained stable throughout peptide breakdown, the dap-1 already present  at the beginning of fermentation increased until two times its early activity. this peptidase activity is a major index for the presence of prevotella ruminicola. a peak of exoaminopeptidase and lap activities were observed at 3 h incubation. this latter activity, which was associated with the production of lactate after 3 h, suggested that streptococcus bovis was present in the environment. with the use of high-performance size exclusion chromatography (hpsec), the size of the peptides during their breakdown could be measured, showing that high molecular weight peptides (4 to 2 kda) were apparently more rapidly broken down to the profit of small-sized peptides (< 0.5 kda), which increased. these degradation abilities were closely linked to dap-1 activity. separation of tryptone peptides by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) showed that more hydrophilic peptides disappeared than hydrophobic peptides. moreover, a few peaks eluting for one in the hydrophilic area and for the others in the hydrophobic area resisted the bacterial breakdown. in contrast, amino acid profiles indicated that hydrophobic amino acids were not  taken up significantly faster than the hydrophobic amino acids by mixed ruminal bacterial.

AB  == several in vitro techniques have been developed, which are able to quantify the bactericidal activity of a determined antibacterial drug against an infective agent. the serum bactericidal rate (sbr) is proposed as a complementary technique for the determination of the "killing curve", the serum bactericidal test or the  minimal bactericidal concentration. sbr takes into account the most advantageous  features of both of them. sbr is based on quantifying at different times the survival of the bacterial inoculum exposed to the patient's serum. thus, bactericide speed is evaluated in the first hours of contact with the microorganism (as in the "killing curve"), but taking into account drug concentrations which have been reached by the patient (as in the serum bactericidal test). preliminary assays suggest that sbr may have greater capacity to discriminate an infectious agent in answer to different therapeutic schemes than other determinations, although prospective studies are required to evaluate  its predictive value.

AB  == the association of colorectal carcinoma and septicemia or endocarditis by streptococcus bovis is well known. nonetheless, other localizations of infection  by streptococcus bovis have not been associated with colorectal carcinoma. the case of association of colon neoplasm with infection by streptococcus bovis localized in the surgical wound of resection of a prostate adenoma by the transvesical route carried out four months previously is presented. possible intraoperative bacteremia colonizing the surgical wound due to colic compression  during surgery may have been the cause. this localization of infection by streptococcus bovis should be taken into account in screening of colorectal carcinoma.

TI  == differentiation of ruminal and human streptococcus bovis strains by dna homology  and 16s rrna probes.
AB  == streptococcus bovis is commonly present in the rumen, but strains of s. bovis have also occasionally been isolated from human blood or fecal samples. studies were undertaken with 16s rrna gene sequences and dna hybridizations to define the genetic relationships between these two groups of strains. ruminal strains were found to yield genomic dna restriction endonuclease digest patterns different from human strains when either the 16s rrna gene amplified from ruminal s. bovis  strain jb1 or a conserved universal 23s rrna fragment was used as probes. a dna probe based on the v1 region of the 16s rrna of s. bovis jb1 was found to hybridize to dnas of other ruminal s. bovis strains (k27ff4, 21-09-6c, five new ruminal isolates, and weak hybridization was found with dnas from s. bovis 33317  (type strain), s. equinus 9812, and six other ruminal isolates. no hybridization  occurred with strains representing different major human biotypes/homology groups (43143, 43144, 27960, v1387). all ruminal s. bovis strains had a guanosine plus cytosine dna content of 37.4-38.8 mol% and, based on dna-dna genomic hybridizations, could be separated into two homology groups, one of which included s. equinus 9812 and s. bovis 33317. both ruminal groups had less than 38% dna homology to the human strains, indicating ruminal strains are clearly two separate species distinct from the human strains.

TI  == a gene-targeting suicide vector for streptococcus bovis.
AB  == a gene-targeting suicide vector for streptococcus bovis has been constructed using the escherichia coli/streptococcus shuttle plasmid, pmu1328, and a region derived from the broad host-range, gram-positive transposon, tn916. this suicide  plasmid replicates autonomously in e. coli, but not in strep. bovis or strep. bovis tn916. under positive selection, the plasmid was shown to integrate into strep. bovis tn916 chromosomal dna at a frequency of 3 x 10(-8) cell-1 and was stably maintained for at least 100 generations in the absence of selection. this  is the first report of a recombination system in ruminal bacteria. the ability to target genes, knock out specific functions or introduce novel genes into these micro-organisms will allow ruminal species to be manipulated and may eventually lead to improved animal production.

TI  == regulation of the lactose phosphotransferase system of streptococcus bovis by glucose: independence of inducer exclusion and expulsion mechanisms.
AB  == streptococcus bovis had a diauxic pattern of glucose and lactose utilization, and both of these sugars were transported by the sugar phosphotransferase system (pts). lactose catabolism was inducible, and s. bovis used the tagatose pathway to ferment lactose. since a mutant that was deficient in glucose pts activity transported lactose as fast as the wild-type, it appeared that s. bovis has separate enzyme iis for glucose and lactose. the nonmetabolizable glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose (2-dg) was a noncompetitive inhibitor of methyl beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (tmg) transport, and cells that were provided with either glucose or 2-dg were unable to transport tmg or lactose. because the glucose-pts-deficient mutant could ferment glucose, but could not exclude tmg, it appeared that enzyme iiglc rather than glucose catabolism per se was the critical feature of inducer exclusion. cells that had accumulated tmg as tmg 6-phosphate expelled free tmg when glucose was added, but 2-dg was unable to cause tmg expulsion. the glucose-pts-deficient mutant could still expel tmg in the presence of exogenous glucose. membrane vesicles also exhibited glucose-dependent tmg exclusion and tmg expulsion. membrane vesicles that were electroporated with phosphoenolpyruvate (pep) and hpr retained tmg for more than 3 min, but vesicles  that were electroporated with pep plus hpr and fructose 1,6-diphosphate (fdp) (or glycerate 2-phosphate) lost their ability to retain tmg. because fdp was able to  trigger the atp-dependent phosphorylation of hpr, it appeared that inducer expulsion was mediated by an fdp-activated protein kinase.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

TI  == identification of proteolytic rumen bacteria isolated from new zealand cattle.
AB  == the protease activities of 212 strains of rumen bacteria isolated from new zealand cattle grazing pasture were measured. thirty-seven per cent of strains had activity greater than or equal to the proteolytic rumen bacterium prevotella  ruminicola and 43 of these isolates were identified by morphology, carbon source  utilization, gram stain, biochemical tests and fermentation end-product analysis. hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the strains formed four clusters: cluster a contained 26 strains and clustered with a reference strain of streptococcus bovis; cluster c contained three strains and clustered with a reference strain of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, while clusters b (10 strains) and  d (three strains) did not cluster with any of the remaining rumen bacterial type  strains. further tests identified strains of cluster b as eubacterium budayi, while cluster d strains most closely resembled b. fibrisolvens and were described as b. fibrisolvens-like. an unclustered strain, c21a, was identified as p. ruminicola. the significance of these proteolytic bacterial populations is discussed in relation to protein breakdown in new zealand ruminants.

TI  == intracellular survival and multiplication of virulent and less virulent strains of streptococcus bovis in pigeon macrophages.
AB  == the intracellular fate of pigeon s. bovis strains ingested by macrophages was studied in vivo and in vitro. during in vivo experiments, histological and electron microscopical examinations demonstrated numerous cocci, which appeared to be actively multiplying, within splenic macrophages of pigeons experimentally  inoculated with a highly virulent s. bovis serotype 1 strain. in pigeons inoculated with a low virulence serotype 3 strain, intracellular cocci were only  occasionally observed. for in vitro experiments, pigeon peritoneal macrophages were inoculated with a s. bovis serotype 1 or serotype 3 strain and incubated. following an initial decrease, an increase in the number of intracellular bacteria was observed in tests performed with the s. bovis serotype 1 strain, demonstrating intracellular multiplication. macrophages in these experiments had  all died after 7 h of incubation, possibly indicating that the intracellular replication of s. bovis resulted in the release of substances toxic for macrophages. in experiments performed with the s. bovis serotype 3 strain, the number of intracellular bacteria continuously decreased, reflecting killing of organisms. significant changes in the number of adhering macrophages in s. bovis  serotype 3 inoculated cultures were not observed. these results indicate s. bovis in pigeons is a facultative intracellular bacterium and intracellular multiplication may be involved in virulence.

TI  == cellodextrin efflux by the cellulolytic ruminal bacterium fibrobacter succinogenes and its potential role in the growth of nonadherent bacteria.
AB  == when glucose or cellobiose was provided as an energy source for fibrobacter succinogenes, there was a transient accumulation (as much as 0.4 mm hexose equivalent) of cellobiose or cellotriose, respectively, in the growth medium. nongrowing cell suspensions converted cellobiose to cellotriose and longer-chain  cellodextrins, and in this case the total cellodextrin concentration was as much  as 20 mm (hexose equivalent). because cell extracts of glucose- or cellobiose-grown cells cleaved cellobioise and cellotriose by phosphate-dependent reactions and glucose 1-phosphate was an end product, it appeared that cellodextrins were being produced by a reversible phosphorylase reaction. this conclusion was supported by the observation that the ratio of cellodextrins to cellodextrins with one greater hexose [n/(n + 1)] was approximately 4, a value similar to the equilibrium constant (keq) of cellobiose phosphorylase (j. k. alexander, j. bacteriol. 81:903-910, 1961). when f. succinogenes was grown in a cellobiose-limited chemostat, cellobiose and cellotriose could both be detected,  and the ratio of cellotriose to cellobiose was approximately 1 to 4. on the basis of these results, cellodextrin production is an equilibrium (mass action) function and not just an artifact of energy-rich cultural conditions. cellodextrins could not be detected in low-dilution-rate, cellulose-limited continuous cultures, but these cultures had a large number of nonadherent cells.  because the nonadherent cells had a large reserve of polysaccharide and were observed at all stages of cell division, it appeared that they were utilizing cellodextrins as an energy source for growth.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == identification of intracellular amylase activity in streptococcus bovis and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis has been demonstrated to produce an extracellular amylase activity. we previously reported on the cloning of a gene from s. bovis encoding for what was initially believed to be the extracellular amylase. dna sequence analyses indicated that the amylase produced by the cloned  gene did not match the n-terminus amino acid sequence of the purified extracellular amylase and contained no apparent leader sequence for secretion. analyses of crude extracts demonstrated the presence of an intracellular amylase  in s. bovis jb1 that differed in molecular weight (56,000) from that of the extracellular amylase (70,000). the 56,000 molecular weight amylase was identical to the amylase produced by escherichia coli containing the cloned amylase gene. low levels of intracellular amylase activity were also detected in other strains  of s. bovis and also streptococcus salivarius. introduction of the plasmid pva838 containing the cloned amylase gene into s. bovis and s. sanguis resulted in enhanced intracellular amylase production by both organisms. the amylase gene has been sequenced, and analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence for the amylase indicates a high degree of similarity with secreted amylases from bacillus species.

AB  == streptococcus bovis jb1, prevotella ruminicola b(1)4, selenomonas ruminantium z108, fibrobacter succinogenes s85 and anaerovibrio lipolytica 5s were incubated  with either 14c-peptides (mol. wt, 200-1000) or 14c-amino acids to compare their  rates of uptake and metabolism. in experiment 1, the bacteria were grown and incubated in a complex medium, but no uptake of 14c-labelled substrates occurred. when casein digest was omitted, uptake rates of 14c-peptides were different (p <  0.01) with each species, but nil for 14c-amino acids. in experiment 2, to minimize the effects of non-radiolabelled peptides and amino acids, defined and semi-defined media were used. patterns of 14c-peptide uptake resembled those of experiment 1. the 5-min rate for strep. bovis jb1 was almost twice that of p. ruminicola b(1)4, though by 15 min they were similar and threefold greater than other species; that of a. lipolytica 5s was especially low. incubations with 14c-amino acids resulted in a wide range (p < 0.01) of uptake rates; after 5 min  p. ruminicola b(1)4 possessed the lowest and strep. bovis jb1 the highest, but after 15 min, that of sel. ruminantium z108 was even higher. all bacteria, with the exception of p. ruminicola b(1)4, assimilated 14c-amino acids faster (p < 0.01) than 14c-peptides. only strep. bovis jb1 and p. ruminicola b(1)4 were capable of extensively metabolizing 14c-peptides, but all five species metabolized 14c-amino acids; there was evidence of substantial degradation and some synthesis. calculations suggest that peptides could supply up to 43%, and amino acids 62% of the n requirements of rumen bacteria.

AB  == pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa), a cell-surface protein present on all strains of pneumococci, has been shown to elicit protective antibody responses in mice in the absence of capsular polysaccharide. whereas pspa is polymorphic, considerable cross-reactivity and cross-protection have been demonstrated among pspa proteins of pneumococci exhibiting different capsular and pspa serotypes. a  gene segment encoding the nonrepetitive variable nh2-terminal portion of pspa has been cloned into three distinct recombinant bacille calmette-guerin (rbcg) vectors, allowing for expression of pspa as a cytoplasmic or secreted protein, or a chimeric exported membrane-associated lipoprotein. all rbcg-pspa strains elicited comparable anti-pspa elisa titers, ranging from 10(4) to 10(5) (reciprocal titers) in both balb/c and c3h/hej mice. however, protective responses were observed only in animals immunized with the rbcg-pspa vaccines expressing pspa as a secreted protein or chimeric exported lipoprotein. in addition, anti-pspa immune sera elicited by the rbcg vaccines passively protected x-linked immunodeficient mice from lethal challenge with the highly virulent, encapsulated wu2 strain of streptococcus pneumoniae and two additional virulent strains exhibiting heterologous pspa and capsular serotypes. these studies confirm previous pspa immunization studies showing cross-protection against heterologous serotypes of s. pneumoniae and demonstrate a potential for rbcg-based pspa vaccines to elicit protective humoral responses against pneumococcal disease in humans.

TI  == positive inotropic effect of streptococcus faecalis in isolated cardiac muscle.
AB  == infective endocarditis is caused by bacterial colonization of the endocardium. because endocardium modulates mechanical performance of subjacent myocardium, we  studied acute effects of bacteria on isolated cardiac muscle and on the functional role of the endocardium. bacteria, grown in broth at 37 degrees c, were added at increasing concentrations (10(2) to 10(6) bacteria/ml) to cat papillary muscles in krebs-ringer solution (1.25 mm ca2+, 35 degrees c). the endocardial surface was damaged by exposing muscles to a stream of dry air for 30 s. streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis induced significant increases in total peak isometric twitch tension (tt) and maximal velocity of unloaded shortening (vmax) and significant decreases in time to tt (tttt) and time to half isometric  twitch tension decline (rt 1/2), both before and after removal of endocardial endothelium. this response could also be elicited with bacterial filtrate, after  boiling the filtrate or after extracting the polysaccharides from it with kio4. increasing ca2+ concentrations progressively reduced the response to the filtrate. propranolol slightly, although not significantly, diminished the effects on tt and vmax while abolishing the effects on tttt and on rt 1/2. by contrast, streptococcus bovis and staphylococcus aureus did not affect tt or vmax but induced a slight but significant decrease in tttt at the highest concentration of bacteria. accordingly, the filtrate of strep. faecalis induces a positive inotropic effect. the active component is neither a protein nor a polysaccharide, and its effect may be partly beta-adrenoceptor mediated. strep. bovis and staph. aureus have negligible acute effects on contractility.

AB  == groups of 20, 20 and 10 pigeons were intravenously inoculated with 1 x 10(9) cfu  of a streptococcus bovis serotype 1, 2 and 3 strain, respectively. groups which received the highly virulent serotypes 1 or 2 strains were treated with antibiotics starting from 2 days post inoculation in order to prevent the development of clinical signs. pigeons inoculated with the low virulence s. bovis serotype 3 strain were left untreated. another group of 10 non-inoculated pigeons was used as challenge control. four weeks later, pigeons were challenged intravenously with s. bovis serotype 1. morbidity after challenge infection was 19%, 36% and 70% in groups previously inoculated with serotypes 1, 2 and 3, respectively, whereas it was 100% in the control group. results demonstrate that  pigeons developed significant protective immunity to s. bovis serotype 1 septicaemia following infection with s. bovis serotype 1 and 2 strains but not after infection with the serotype 3 strain. protection did not correlate with the presence of antibodies as detected in elisa.

TI  == [clinical significance of bacteremia caused by streptococci of the viridans group].
AB  == background: the viridans group streptococcus (svg) include species which may have different pathogenic capacity. this study was aimed at evaluating the clinical significance of bacteremia by different species of svg. patients and methods: one hundred ninety-four clinical records of patients with blood culture(s) isolation  (hemoline/biomerieux) of svg (api 20 strep/biomerieux) over 9 years were reviewed with criteria of clinical significance being established and the results analyzed by the chi square test. results: the most frequent species of svg isolated were:  s. sanguis ii (29.4%), s. mitis (27.3%) and s. anginosus (12.9%). with regard to  the criteria established, 36% of the isolates were clinically significant, associating s. anginosus with significant bacteremia (p = 0.001) and s. mitis with non significant bacteremia (p = 0.04). more than half of the isolations of s. anginosus, s. bovis, s. mutans and s. adjacens were clinically significant with this rate being lower in the remaining species (s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, s. salivarius and s. acidominimus). the significant isolations correspond with endocarditis (s. sanguis ii being responsible for 44%; p = 0.05). in 54.3% of the cases followed by abscesses or other localized infections and severe sepsis in patients with a solid or hematologic tumor with a mortality of 20%. the endocarditis/other disease relation was: greater for the existence of endocarditis for s. sanguis ii, s. sanguis i, s. mutans, s. bovis and s. adjacens; similar in both diseases for s. mitis, and greater for the existence of a non endocardic disease for s. anginosus. conclusions: in this series the isolation of svg group was clinically significant in 36% of cases with a probability of clinical significance and disease association related to the species isolated of svg.

TI  == nutrient transport by ruminal bacteria: a review.
AB  == fermentation pathways have been elucidated for predominant ruminal bacteria, but  information is limited concerning the specific transport mechanisms used by these microorganisms for c, energy, and n sources. in addition, it is possible that changes in ruminal environmental conditions could affect transport activity. five carrier-mediated soluble nutrient transport mechanisms have been identified in bacteria: 1) facilitated diffusion, 2) shock sensitive systems, 3) proton symport, 4) na+ symport, and the 5) phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pep-pts). several regulatory mechanisms are also involved at the cell membrane to coordinate utilization of different sugars. recent research has shown that predominant ruminal bacteria are capable of transporting soluble nutrients by several of the mechanisms outlined above. megasphaera elsdenii, selenomonas ruminantium, and streptococcus bovis transport glucose by the pep-pts, and s. ruminantium and s. bovis also possess pep-pts activity for disaccharides. glucose pts activity in s. bovis was highest at a growth ph of 5.0, low glucose concentrations, and a dilution rate of .10 h-1. the cellulolytic ruminal bacterium fibrobacter succinogenes uses a na+ symport mechanism for glucose transport that is sensitive to low extracellular ph and ionophores. sodium also stimulated cellobiose transport by f. succinogenes, and there is evidence for a proton symport in the transport of both arabinose and xylose by s. ruminantium. a chemical gradient of na+ seems to play an important role in aa transport in several ruminal bacteria. studying nutrient transport mechanisms in ruminal bacteria will lead to a better understanding of the ruminal fermentation.

TI  == alternative strategies of 2-deoxyglucose resistance and low affinity glucose transport in the ruminal bacteria, streptococcus bovis and selenomonas ruminantium.
AB  == streptococcus bovis and selenomonas ruminantium grew in the presence of the glucose analog, 2-deoxyglucose (2-dg), but the cells no longer had high affinity  glucose transport. in s. bovis, 2-dg resistance was correlated with a decrease in phosphoenolpyruvate (pep)-dependent glucose phosphotransferase (pts) activity. the 2-dg-selected s. bovis cells relied solely upon a low affinity, facilitated diffusion mechanism of glucose transport and a 2-dg-resistant glucokinase (atp-dependent). the glucokinase activity of s. ruminantium was competitively inhibited by 2-dg, and the 2-dg selected cells continued to use pep-dependent pts as a mechanism of glucose transport. in this latter case, the 2-dg selected cells switched from a mannosephosphotransferase (enzyme ii) that phosphorylated glucose, mannose, and 2-dg, but not alpha-methylglucose to a glucosephosphotransferase (enzyme ii) that phosphorylated glucose and alpha-methylglucoside but not 2-dg or mannose. the glucosephosphotransferase (enzyme ii) had a very low affinity for glucose and the transport kinetics were similar to the facilitated diffusion system of s. bovis.

TI  == streptococcus bovis infections in pigeons: virulence of different serotypes.
AB  == in a first experiment, the relative virulence for pigeons of 5 strains of s. bovis was assessed by experimental inoculations. two s. bovis serotype 1 strains, one serotype 2 strain and two serotype 3 strains were examined. one of the serotype 1 strains and the serotype 2 strain were isolated from pigeons that died from septicaemia. the other strains were isolated from cloaca samples of healthy  pigeons. for each strain, 10-20 pigeons were intravenously inoculated with 1 x 10(9) cfu. morbidity after infection with the serotype 1 and 2 strains varied between 75% and 90%. disease signs included inability to fly, lameness, emaciation, production of slimy, green droppings, polyuria and sudden death. in groups of pigeons inoculated with the serotype 3 strains, morbidity was 0% and 6%, respectively. results demonstrate that serotype 3 strains are less virulent for pigeons than serotype 1 and 2 strains. in a second experiment, bacteriological and histological examinations were performed on organs of pigeons serially killed between 1 and 10 days after experimental inoculation with an s. bovis serotype 3 strain of low virulence. results were compared with results of studies carried out with a highly virulent serotype 1 strain. notwithstanding bacterial spread and replication in various organs of inoculated pigeons, clinical disease was not observed and histological lesions were scarce and of limited extent.

AB  == streptococcus suis was the most frequent streptococcus spp. in pig tonsils, followed by the beta-haemolytic porcine 'equisimilis' ecovar of strep. dysgalactiae. the intestinal streptococcal flora was composed of strep. bovis, strep. hyointestinalis and strep. suis. many of these intestinal strep. suis belonged to a beta-glucuronidase-negative biotype which is infrequent in lesions. nearly half of the strains presumptively identified as strep. alactolyticus produced acid from lactose. this species was not found in tonsils and intestines  but was about equally prevalent as strep. hyointestinalis in pig faeces and rectal swabs. other streptococci were rare in this material. enterococci were much less frequently identified than streptococci in tonsils and faeces. in intestinal samples enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, ent. hirae and ent. cecorum were most frequently found. in faeces ent. faecium was the most prevalent enterococcus. the characteristics of the less well known species strep. alactolyticus and strep. hyointestinalis are described in detail, and guidelines  for their differentiation from strep. bovis and strep. suis given.

AB  == physiological concentrations [< 11 mm] of formate do not violate the metabolism of s. bovis and m. elsdenii. a significant inhibition is caused by concentrations of 22 and 44 mm. in this case the process of ammonia formation in s. bovis is inhibited more pronouncedly. peculiar effects of formate (11 mm) on ldh, fdh, aconitase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, fumarase, l-mdh and malic-enzyme have been stated. the changes show that it enhances assimilation of sugars fermented to lactate in s. bovis, in contrast to m. elsdenii, where it activates the utilization of lactic acid. during the log-phase s. bovis utilized only 11.5% of  [14c] h2o2, whereas m. elsdenii uses 33.4% of it. the major amount of the label is transferred from intracellular inclusions to nucleic acids (in s. bovis--74.7%, in m. elsdenii--87%) and then incorporated into low molecular substances (23.5 and 11.9%, respectively), the rest being incorporated into proteins and lipids.

AB  == influence of bacteriophages of streptococcus bovis on microbial activity in the rumen was investigated in experiments on cows. main elements of the mechanism of  bacteriophage action on the microflora have been detected. the daily feeding with bacteriophages results in productive infection of sensitive to them rumen bacteria and is associated with increasing bacteriophage concentration in the rumen contents, lower number and activity of amylolytic bacteria, higher cellolytic activity and increased number of bacteria utilizing xylan, cellobiose  and xylose. the fermentation is usually shifted to a higher production of propionate and butyrate at the expense of lower acetate. the regulating action of a single bacteriophage feeding on the rumen microflora and its metabolic activity stops on the fifth day. daily introduction of bacteriophages into the ration of cows under moderate or high levels of feed increases the milk fat by 0.1-0.3%.

TI  == substrate preference in a strain of megasphaera elsdenii, a ruminal bacterium, and its implications in propionate production and growth competition.
AB  == the niah 1102 strain of megasphaera elsdenii utilized lactate in preference to glucose when the two substrates were present. even when lactate was supplied to cells fermenting glucose, the cells switched substrate utilization from glucose to lactate and did not utilize glucose until lactate decreased to a low concentration (1 to 2 mm). since substrate utilization was shifted gradually without intermittence, typical diauxic growth was not seen. the cyclic amp content did not rise markedly with the shift in substrate utilization, suggesting that this nucleotide is not involved in the regulation of the shift. it was unlikely that propionate was produced from glucose, which was explicable by the fact that lactate racemase activity dropped rapidly with the exhaustion of lactate and cells actively fermenting glucose did not possess this enzyme. a coculture experiment indicated that m. elsdenii niah 1102 is overcome by streptococcus bovis jb1 in the competition for glucose, mainly because m. elsdenii niah 1102 is obliged to utilize lactate produced by s. bovis jb1; i.e.,  glucose utilization by m. elsdenii niah 1102 is suppressed by the coexistence of  s. bovis jb1.

TI  == binding of radiolabeled monensin and lasalocid to ruminal microorganisms and feed.
AB  == gram-negative, ionophore-resistant ruminal bacteria and gram-positive, ionophore-sensitive species bound similar amounts of [14c]lasalocid, but neither  group bound large amounts of [14c]monensin. membrane vesicles also bound more lasalocid than monensin (p < .05). the binding was first-order at low cell or vesicle concentrations and saturable at high cell or vesicle densities. streptococcus bovis was inhibited by both monensin and lasalocid (5 microm), but  cells that were re-incubated in medium lacking ionophore grew rapidly. lasalocid-treated cells grew very slowly when they were resuspended in fresh medium. based on these results, it seemed that lasalocid had a higher affinity for bacterial membranes than monensin. mixed bacteria, however, bound nearly equal amounts of [14c]monensin and [14c]lasalocid (p > .05). monensin binding was greatly reduced when the mixed ruminal bacteria were pretreated with tris+edta (p < .05), but tris+edta did not affect the binding of lasalocid. mixed ruminal protozoa always took up more lasalocid than monensin (p < .05), but feed particles bound equal amounts of [14c]lasalocid and [14c]monensin (p > .05). based on the binding capacity of mixed ruminal bacteria, ruminal protozoa, and feed particles, there would be little free ionophore in ruminal fluid.

TI  == energy-spilling reactions of streptococcus bovis and resistance of its membrane to proton conductance.
AB  == glucose-excess cultures of streptococcus bovis consumed glucose faster than the amount that could be explained by growth or maintenance, and nongrowing chloramphenicol-treated cells had a rate of glucose consumption that was 10-fold  greater than the maintenance rate. because n,n-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an inhibitor of the membrane-bound f1f0 atpase, eliminated the nongrowth energy dissipation (energy spilling) without a decrease in atp and the rate of energy spilling could be increased by the protonophore 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide, it appeared that a futile cycle of protons through the cell membrane was responsible for most of the energy spilling. when the rate of energy spilling was decreased gradually with iodoacetate, there was only a small decrease in the phosphorylation potential (delta g'p) and the theoretical estimate of h+ per atp decreased from 4.2 to 3.6. on the bases of this ratio of h+ to atp and the rate of atp production, the flux of protons (amperage) across the cell membrane was directly proportional to the rate of energy spilling. amperage values estimated from delta g'p were, however, nearly twice as great as values which were estimated from the heat production (delta h)  of the cells [amperage = (0.38 x wattage)/delta p]. the last comparison indicated that only a fraction of the delta g of atp hydrolysis was harvested by the f1f0 atpase to pump protons. both estimates of amperage indicated that the resistance  of the cell membrane to proton conductance was inversely proportional to the log  of the energy-spilling rate.

TI  == influence of yucca shidigera extract on ruminal ammonia concentrations and ruminal microorganisms.
AB  == an extract of the desert plant yucca shidigera was assessed for its possible benefit in ruminal fermentation. the extract bound ammonia in aqueous solution when concentrations of ammonia were low (up to 0.4 mm) and when the extract was added at a high concentration to the sample (20%, vol/vol). the apparent ammonia-binding capability was retained after autoclaving and was decreased slightly following dialysis. acid-precipitated extract was inactive. no evidence  of substantial ammonia binding was found at higher ammonia concentrations (up to  30 mm). when y. shidigera extract (1%, vol/vol) was added to strained rumen fluid in vitro, a small (6%) but significant (p < 0.05) decrease in ammonia concentration occurred, apparently because of decreased proteolysis. inclusion of y. shidigera extract (1%, vol/vol) in the growth medium of the rumen bacterium streptococcus bovis es1 extended its lag phase, while growth of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens sh13 was abolished. the growth of prevotella (bacteroides) ruminicola b(1)4 was stimulated, and that of selenomonas ruminantium z108 was unaffected. protozoal activity, as measured by the breakdown of 14c-leucine-labelled s. ruminantium in rumen fluid incubated in vitro, was abolished by the addition of 1% extract. the antimicrobial activities were unaffected by precipitating tannins with polyvinylpyrrolidone, but a butanol extract, containing the saponin fraction, retained its antibacterial and antiprotozoal effects. saponins from other sources were less effective against protozoa than y. shidigera saponins. y. shidigera extract, therefore, appears unlikely to influence ammonia concentration in the rumen directly, but its saponins have antimicrobial properties, particularly in suppressing ciliate protozoa, which may prove beneficial to ruminal fermentation and may lead indirectly to lower ruminal ammonia concentrations.

AB  == the live attenuated mycobacterium bovis strain bacille calmette-guerin (bcg) is still widely used as a vaccine against tuberculosis and therefore offers potential advantages as a safe, live vaccine vehicle for the expression and delivery of protective recombinant antigens. as an attenuated intracellular bacterium residing in macrophages, bcg would seem to be particularly suited for eliciting cellular responses and not humoral responses. efforts to improve the potential for recombinant bcg (rbcg) vaccines to elicit protective humoral responses were undertaken by developing vectors systems which export or secrete foreign antigens. expression of the ospa antigen of borrelia burgdorferi, as a chimaeric membrane-associated lipoprotein, resulted in high-titred protective humoral responses when compared to cytoplasmic or secreted expression of ospa. expression of the pspa antigen of streptococcus pneumoniae as a secreted or membrane-associated lipoprotein by rbcg did not result in higher-titred humoral responses in comparison to pspa expressed cytoplasmically but apparently improved the quality of protective pspa specific antibodies. based on these pre-clinical studies, rbcg vaccines for lyme and pneumococcal diseases are being developed for clinical trials in humans. the potential for eliciting mucosal responses to antigens delivered by rbcg was also investigated. nasal immunization was superior at eliciting substantial lasting mucosal responses at multiple mucosal sites and  also resulted in systemic responses comparable to those obtained with parenteral  immunization.

TI  == the adherence of three streptococcus bovis strains to cells of rumen epithelium primoculture under various conditions.
AB  == three streptococcus bovis strains were tested in biotype assay and examined for the adherence to cells of rumen epithelium primoculture. the adherence pattern of ruminal streptococci in phosphate buffered saline at ph values ranging from 4.1 to 8.5 was determined. our isolates of streptococcus bovis strains adhered best at ph 7.0-7.3. to characterize the adhesive determinants, the bacterial cells were exposed to various treatments. protease treatment dramatically decreased the adherence of all streptococcus bovis strains, thus suggesting that the determinants responsible for the adherence are largely proteinaceous. carbohydrates could be also significantly involved in the active sites of bacterial surface because metaperiodate-treated cells adhered much more poorly than control, sodium iodate-treated cells. addition of carbohydrates (lactose, maltose and saccharose) had no significant effect on the adherence of streptococcus bovis strains although a slight decrease in the adhesion was detected.

TI  == effect of extracellular lactate on growth of rumen lactate producers.
AB  == the addition of na-lactate (50-150 mmol/l) to media with glucose had only marginal effect on the growth of rumen lactate-producing bacteria at ph between 6.5 and 5.8. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was somewhat more sensitive to external lactate than streptococcus bovis, lactobacillus fermentum and selenomonas ruminantium. it can be concluded that rumen lactate producers, which proliferate  at the onset of rumen lactic acidosis, are not influenced by the lactate accumulation, except some non-specific osmotic effects.

TI  == serological investigation into the association between streptococcus bovis and colonic cancer.
AB  == aims: to determine if there was an increase in antibody titre to streptococcus bovis in patients with colonic cancer, and if this might be a useful marker of the presence for colonic cancer. methods: serum samples from 16 patients and 16 age matched controls were tested by immunoblot and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) against antigen preparations from two strains of s bovis and one strain of enterococcus faecalis. results: no distinction between cancer patients  and controls could be made using immunoblots. elisa did show an increase in antibodies to s bovis, but there was a greater increase in antibodies to e faecalis. the increase in antibody titres was greatest with antigens which had been treated with periodate, and was therefore thought not to be caused by antibody to the shared group d carbohydrate antigen. conclusion: it may be possible to construct a test for the detection of colonic cancer based on the detection of antibody to s bovis or e faecalis, though considerable further development of this concept is required.

AB  == the alpha-amylase genes of streptococcus bovis 148 were cloned in escherichia coli mc1061, using pbr322. the recombinant plasmids were classified into two groups on the basis of their restriction maps. southern blot analysis did not show homology between the two types of alpha-amylase genes, and the two alpha-amylase genes existed on the chromosomal dna of s. bovis 148. the enzymatic properties and n-terminal amino acid sequences of the two purified enzymes produced by the cloned e. coli strains were quite different from each other. particularly, one alpha-amylase (amy i) was adsorbed on raw corn starch and hydrolyzed raw corn starch, and another (amy ii) was not adsorbed on raw corn starch and did not hydrolyze raw corn starch. amy i was considered to be the same as the extracellular alpha-amylase of s. bovis 148 in raw starch absorbability, ability to hydrolyze raw corn starch, enzymatic characteristics, n-terminal amino acid sequence, and mode of action on soluble starch. amy ii showed a unique pattern of oligosaccharide production from soluble starch compared with the extracellular alpha-amylase of s. bovis 148. amy ii was suggested to be an intracellular alpha-amylase of s. bovis 148.

AB  == streptococcus bovis is a normal inhabitant of the rumen but has been implicated as a causative agent for ruminal lactic acidosis and related problems. while rarely isolated from humans, s. bovis has been identified as a causative agent for endocarditis, meningitis, and septicemia. recent reports have also suggested  a correlation between human colonic carcinoma and increased levels of s. bovis. identification of s. bovis strains of human origin has been problematic because of variations in results of biochemical tests compared with results for ruminal strains. we have tested a cloned amylase gene from the ruminal strain s. bovis jb1 as a potential dna probe for rapid and accurate identification of s. bovis strains from all sources. dnas from strains identified as s. bovis, of both human and ruminal origin, were found to hybridize with the probe under stringent conditions. the probe also hybridized with variants of s. bovis that did not grow on starch. the probe did not hybridize with dna isolated from other bacteria of human colonic and ruminal origin, including bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ruminicola, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and enterococcus faecalis but  did demonstrate hybridization with streptococcus salivarius.

TI  == the glutamine cyclotransferase reaction of streptococcus bovis: a novel mechanism of deriving energy from non-oxidative and non-reductive deamination.
AB  == streptococcus bovis deaminated glutamine by a mechanism that did not involve glutaminase. since pyroglutamate and ammonia were the only end-products, it appeared that glutamine deamination was catalyzed by a cyclotransferase reaction. stationary s. bovis cells had essentially no intracellular atp or membrane potential (delta psi), however, when they were provided with glutamine, intracellular atp and delta psi increased to 0.52 mm and 158 mv, respectively. when glutamine-energized cells were treated with n,n-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (dccd, 150 microm), there was an even greater increase in intracellular atp (> 5-fold) and the delta psi was dissipated. because toluene-treated cells produced  atp from adp and pi, it did not appear that the cell membrane was directly involved in glutamine-dependent atp generation. the rate of ammonia production was directly proportional to the glutamine concentration, but the stoichiometry of atp to ammonia was always 1 to 1. based on these results, it appeared that glutamine was deaminated by glutamine cyclotransferase which was coupled to atp formation. the membrane bound atpase then used the atp to create a delta psi.

TI  == effect of amino acids on the heat production and growth efficiency of streptococcus bovis: balance of anabolic and catabolic rates.
AB  == streptococcus bovis jb1 grew nearly twice as fast (0.9 versus 1.6 h-1) and had a  40% greater growth yield (18 versus 12.5 mg of protein per mmol of glucose) when  an ammonia-based medium was supplemented with amino acids, but the glucose consumption rate (88 mumol mg of protein-1 h-1) and specific rate of heat production (2.1 mw/mg of protein) were unaffected. amino acid availability had little effect on the catabolic rate, but the specific heat decreased 40% (8.8 to  5.2 j/mg of protein). these growth rate-dependent changes in metabolic efficiency were fivefold greater than the maintenance energy. chloramphenicol (100 mg/l), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, caused a gradual decrease in anabolic (growth) rate, but there was little change in the rate of glucose consumption and the specific heat increased. when growth was inhibited by iodoacetate, the catabolic  and anabolic rates both declined and there was not increase in specific heat. on  the basis of these results, the benefit of amino acid supplementation was largely explained by the balance of anabolic and catabolic rates. when amino acids were available, the anabolic and catabolic rates were more closely matched and less energy was spilled as heat.

TI  == [the characteristics of the regulation of lysine biosynthesis in streptococcus bovis].
AB  == the effect of threonine and methionine on the growth of and lysine synthesis in streptococcus bovis st. a024/85 was studied. the character and the degree of manifestation of growth and regulation effects of these amino acids depend on their contents in the fermentation medium. the target in the regulation of lysine biosynthesis is aspartate kinase, whose synthesis is controlled by threonine and  methionine. lysine excretion was stimulated by the addition of a low concentration of dimethylsulfoxide in the medium during fermentation.

TI  == comparison of fluorescent gentamicin-thallous-carbonate and kf streptococcal agars to enumerate enterococci and fecal streptococci in meats.
AB  == two selective and differential media were compared for their abilities to enumerate enterococci and fecal streptococci in pork, beef, and poultry products. counts obtained on kf streptococcal (kf) agar were compared with counts obtained  on fluorescent gentamicin-thallous-carbonate (fgtc) agar. reactions of 13 known enterococcal species were also observed. all 13 species of enterococci as well as streptococcus bovis and streptococcus equinus grew equally well on fgtc agar. kf  streptococcal medium allowed growth of most species of enterococci but not s. bovis and s. equinus. quantitative comparisons between the two media inoculated with pure cultures of known species of enterococci revealed equivalent plate counts following incubation. however, when meat samples were plated, counts on fgtc agar were consistently and significantly higher than counts on kf agar for all sample sources.

TI  == scleral flap necrosis and infectious endophthalmitis after cataract surgery with  a scleral tunnel incision.
AB  == background: long scleral tunnel dissection techniques have been developed for cataract surgery incisions. these incisions reduce postoperative astigmatism and  keratorefractive instability. if fashioned correctly, the internal lip of the incision produces a tight seal to the anterior chamber, permissible of sutureless surgery. the behavior of such a wound during intraocular infection is unknown. methods: the authors describe two elderly patients in whom postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis was accompanied by infectious scleritis, infectious sclerokeratitis or keratitis, and rapid scleral flap necrosis. one of the patients had a painless disease process. results: intraocular isolates of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus equinus were recovered from the two patients, respectively. management was complicated by loss of tectonic integrity  that followed scleral flap necrosis, by impaired vitreoretinal visualization associated with rapidly progressive sclerokeratitis or keratitis, and by bacterial scleritis in the base of the scleral flap. no light perception was retained in either eye. conclusion: scleral tunnel incisions create a potential abscess cavity. although a rare occurrence, postoperative endophthalmitis in such an eye may present major surgical and therapeutic problems intrinsic to the wound design.

TI  == identification and characterization of the proba operon of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == a genomic dna library of the rumen bacterium streptococcus bovis was constructed  in escherichia coli, and recombinant plasmids able to complement proa and prob mutations of the host were found. southern hybridization and restriction analysis showed that a 3.5-kb fragment of s. bovis dna contained two genes, organized in an operon and coding for enzymes functionally similar to the glutamyl phosphate reductase-glutamyl kinase enzyme complex that in e. coli catalyzes the first step of proline biosynthesis. complementation of the e. coli mutations was observed with the fragment inserted in both orientations, which suggested that the s. bovis proba operon was transcribed from its own promoter. genetic and biochemical data suggested that the proline biosynthetic pathway of s. bovis is similar to the one previously characterized for e. coli.

AB  == the occurrence and antibiotic-resistance spectrum of some strains of rumen streptococci were investigated in calves of four age categories in the milk diet  period at 1-3, 4-7, 8-14 days of age and 6-8 weeks of age. more than 75% of the strains isolated from the calves of all age categories were resistant to more than one tested antibiotic (tetracycline, neomycin, erythromycin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol). the average number of streptococci isolated from the ingesta of calves during the period of observation was 10(5) per ml. the per cent of resistant strains showed an increasing trend from birth to the age of 8-14 days (tab. i). the occurrence of resistant strains in 6-8 week calves was even lower than in the calves of the youngest age category. a four-marker type of resistance (41.6-50%) prevailed within 14 days of age. two-marker types of resistance (42.6%) occurred most frequently in the calves of the oldest age category. tab. ii shows the spectrum of resistant strains. tetracycline-resistant amylolytic strains of streptococcus bovis were selected from among the isolated strains to be used as donor strains in conjugation experiments. successful resistance transmission was observed in solid-surface conjugation. the transmission frequency ranged within the transconjugate values of 10(-3) to 10(-5) per donor cell within the species (tab. iii). a chromosomally rifampicin-resistant strain of streptococcus bovis bm114 was used as a recipient as it did not contain any plasmids and was sensitive to the tested antibiotics. agarose-gel electrophoresis was used to visualize the presence of plasmid dna in donor strains (fig. 1).

TI  == prevention of bovine mastitis by a premilking teat disinfectant containing chlorous acid and chlorine dioxide.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a premilking teat disinfectant for the prevention of mastitis in dairy cows under natural exposure  conditions. predipping was compared with a negative control using a split udder experimental design. all teats were dipped after milking with the same teat dip.  percentage of quarters newly infected by major mastitis pathogens was 34% lower in quarters with teats predipped and postdipped than in quarters with teats postdipped only. new imi by streptococcus uberis and staphylococcus aureus were significantly lower in quarters with teats predipped and postdipped than in quarters with teats postdipped only. differences in incidence of clinical mastitis between treatment groups approached significance. predipping and postdipping were no more effective against gram-negative bacteria, coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, and corynebacterium bovis than postdipping only. no chapping or irritation of teats was observed, and no adverse effects were noted using the test product as a premilking and postmilking teat disinfectant. results of this study suggest that predipping and then postdipping  with the test product was a more effective procedure against major mastitis pathogens than postdipping only.

AB  == the effect of salinomycin (2.5 mg/l) on the in vitro growth of streptococcus bovis strain atcc 9809, on its catabolism of glucose and on its anabolism of lactic acid was compared with that of monensin (5.0 mg/l). in control cultures containing no ionophore, glucose consumption and lactic acid production were completed concomitantly with maximal growth which was reached after 2 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. no further growth of s. bovis was observed within 2 h after the addition of one or the other ionophore to exponentially growing cultures. glucose consumption and lactic acid production continued for 6 h after  the addition of monensin and for 8 h after the addition of salinomycin. as observed in cultures without ionophore, glucose was totally consumed and lactic acid was stoichiometrically produced in cultures grown in the presence of one or  the other ionophore. thus, salinomycin and monensin inhibited bacterial growth but not fermentation of glucose by s. bovis.

AB  == there is good evidence that the bacterial and fungal probiotics are effective in  the manipulation of rumen development and function. the effects of adherent streptococcus bovis preparations were manifested by significant increase of adherent s. bovis bacteria and alpha amylase activity in the rumen wall of young  ruminants. fungal probiotics based on saccharomyces cerevisiae and aspergillus oryzae are rapidly gaining acceptance as a means of improving productivity in adult ruminants. however, fungal probiotics may also have a complementary role to bacterial probiotics in young animals. dietary yeast improved performance of calves and lambs in terms of feed intake and live weight gain and aspergillus foetidus was effective in altering rumen fermentation in newly weaned lambs.

TI  == regulation and cloning of the gene encoding amylase activity of the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis.
AB  == streptococcus bovis is an important starch-degrading ruminal bacterium that has been implicated as being important in the etiology of a number of ruminal pathologies associated with diets high in grains. previous studies with s. bovis  have shown that amylase production was influenced by the growth substrate, but the nature of this regulation was not determined. the current study was conducted to better describe the regulatory phenomena and gain a better understanding of the molecular characteristics of this activity. nutritional experiments demonstrated that the presence of starch or the starch-derived disaccharide maltose was required for maximum amylase production. subsequent time-course experiments showed that amylase synthesis was induced by maltose and repressed by glucose, cellobiose, and fructose, while inulin and lactose had little effect on  enzyme accumulation. the effects of the added antibiotics rifampin and tetracycline were consistent with transcriptional control of amylase synthesis. analysis of s. bovis cells grown on glucose or maltose showed that they contained similar low levels of cyclic amp, indicating that it was unlikely that regulation of amylase synthesis was mediated through a mechanism involving this nucleotide.  the amylase gene from s. bovis jb1 was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli.  the amylase produced in e. coli was of lower molecular weight than that synthesized by s. bovis and had catalytic characteristics different from those of s. bovis amylase. when the gene was introduced back into s. bovis jb1, only one form of amylase activity was detected, indicating that the entire gene was present on this insert. the use of the amylase gene as a genetic probe for identification of s. bovis strains is discussed.

TI  == culture media for enterococci and group d-streptococci.
AB  == lancefield group d-streptococci are contaminants of various food commodities, especially those of animal origin. they encompass the new genus enterococcus comprising 13 known species and some species of streptococci which have their habitat in the intestine of animals, e.g. streptococcus bovis, suis and equinus.  the serologically based grouping may no longer constitute the best definition for streptococci from the food chain. food hygiene monitoring systems using enterococci as indicators need reliable methods for selective cultivation and identification of marker strains. up to now more than 100 modifications of selective media have been described for isolating streptococci or enterococci from various specimens. the selection of a medium requires either experience or consultation. it depends on the kind of specimen, the method of cultivation (plate count or membrane filter) and whether or not the habitat is heavily contaminated with other organisms. the choice of media is made more difficult as  commercial versions of the same culture medium may vary in recipe and/or performance from producer to producer. therefore, reviewing the literature may help in the choice of medium and confirmation tests. the selectivity and productivity of some commonly used or cited media are reported here, partly based on our own experience: citrate azide tween carbonate agar (catc), kanamycin aesculin azide agar (kaa) and m-enterococcus agar (me) including earlier results  with aesculin bile azide agar (aba), and thallous acetate tetrazolium glucose agar (titg). no medium was completely selective for all group d-streptococci or for all enterococci but some media were highly selective for a single enterococcus species, e.g., for e. faecalis which serves as indicator of human pollution. confirmatory tests must be carried out when experience in the evaluation procedure is limited. selective media for enterococci should be used only after or while checking in parallel their selectivity and productivity against appropriate test organisms.

AB  == streptococcus bovis (s. bovis) endocarditis has been increasing over recent decades, especially among the senile population. a 74-year-old man presented with intermittent fever for two months. he had a past history of aortic dissection and underwent a bentall operation one year before admission. a janeway lesion was noted on his right hand and six blood cultures grew s. bovis. he was treated with penicillin-g, 3 microu intravenously, every six hours, and became afebrile three  days later. a colonofiberoscopy was carried out despite the absence of any gastrointestinal symptoms, and a 2 x 2 cm mass was found at the cecum, with pathologic proof of adenocarcinoma. the patient died from a massive intracranial  hemorrhage on the 23rd hospital day. review of the literature revealed an intimate association between s. bovis bacteremia (or endocarditis) and underlying colonic neoplasia. failure to be aware of the possible consequences of this combination may lead to detrimental patient prognosis. we strongly advise that every patient presenting with bacteremia or endocarditis due to this organism, even if they are free from gastrointestinal symptoms, should undergo a thorough lower gastrointestinal investigation to rule out colonic neoplasia.

TI  == tannin-protein complex-degrading enterobacteria isolated from the alimentary tracts of koalas and a selective medium for their enumeration.
AB  == tannin-protein complex (t-pc)-degrading enterobacteria (t-pcde) were isolated from the feces and from a layer of bacteria attached to the cecal wall of koalas. the t-pcde were facultatively anaerobic, gram-negative, pleomorphic, nonmotile bacilli. the bacteria were also oxidase and catalase negative and resistant to vancomycin, reduced nitrates to nitrites, and grew on macconkey agar. growth on tannin-treated agar media showed a distinctive clear zone around the colony. from these observations, a selective agar plate medium (vancomycin- and tannin-treated wilkins-chalgren anaerobe agar) was developed to enumerate t-pcde isolated from the feces of koalas. this medium was highly selective in the enumeration of the fecal t-pcde and inhibited the growth of concomitant t-pc-degrading streptococcus bovis. the t-pcde were isolated from 10 of the 12 captive koalas studied; in 8 of these 10 koalas, the facultatively anaerobic bacterial flora was dominated (more  than 60%) by t-pcde. viable numbers of t-pcde were, in most of the animals, much  larger (more than 100 times) than the numbers of t-pc-degrading s. bovis, suggesting that t-pcde played a more active role in digesting t-pc in the alimentary tracts of koalas.

TI  == etiology and antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream streptococcus sp.
AB  == 249 episodes of streptococcus bacteraemia in hospitalized patients were evaluated for both clinical and microbiological features. specification of the isolates demonstrated that infective endocarditis was predominantly associated with streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus bovis whereas streptococcus pyogenes and  streptococcus milleri were the most common cause of local and/or systemic infections. in vitro-susceptibility tests towards 9 selected antibiotics proved that beta-lactam antibiotics are potent compounds for the treatment of streptococcus sp. with the exception of enterococci; that ampicillin turned out to be highly effective against enterococci; and that vancomycin may be regarded as a potent alternative in the treatment of streptococcal infections.

TI  == microflora of the pouch of the koala (phascolarctos cinereus).
AB  == microflora of the pouch epithelium of 17 female koalas (phascolarctos cinereus) were examined in relation to their current reproductive status and recent reproductive history. no microbial growth was observed in pouch swabs from 13 of  17 (76%) koalas, including four females without young, seven with pouch young and two with back young (i.e. permanently emerged from the pouch). growth of bacteria or yeasts was observed in pouch swabs from four koalas, each of which had experienced mortality of its pouch young during the current breeding season. seven species of microorganisms were isolated, including pseudomonas aeruginosa,  serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. based on the absence of microflora in the majority of females examined, we propose that the pouch epithelium normally provides a hostile environment for microbial colonization.

AB  == the efficacy and safety of a 4-week course of intravenous teicoplanin (500 mg every 12 h for the first 2 days and 10 mg/kg of body weight every 24 h thereafter) in the treatment of streptococcal native valve endocarditis in 20 patients were evaluated. all blood isolates were inhibited by a concentration of  0.12 micrograms of teicoplanin per ml. serum bactericidal activity levels were measured 1/2 and 24 h after antibiotic infusion on days 5 to 7 of therapy in 19 patients, and titers of greater than or equal to 1:32 and greater than or equal to 1:8, respectively, were obtained with 17 patients (89%). on the other hand, for two patients who were infected with teicoplanin-tolerant streptococcus bovis, serum bactericidal activity levels of less than 1:2 were found. of 20 patients, 4 were excluded from further analysis because of protocol violation or prosthetic valve infection. of the remaining 16 patients, 6 did not complete teicoplanin therapy because of early death (1 patient) or drug fever (5 patients). among patients who developed drug fever, three who discontinued teicoplanin by day 15 were switched to penicillin therapy, whereas the remaining two, who discontinued  teicoplanin on day 22 and 25, respectively, did not receive any further therapy and have shown no relapse during the follow-up. of 10 patients who completed trial therapy, 9 were cured and 1 relapsed. it is concluded that a 4-week course  of high-dose teicoplanin may be a useful regimen for home treatment of selected cases of streptococcal native valve endocarditis. however, drug fever and infection with teicoplanin-tolerant s. bovis may be factors of concern with this  therapeutic approach.

TI  == [septic arthritis due to streptococcus bovis].
AB  == a 47-year-old man presented with arthritis of the right shoulder and spondylodiscitis by streptococcus bovis. this microorganism is a frequent cause of endocarditis and has been associated with gastrointestinal neoplasm, mainly carcinoma of the colon; however up to the present it had not been described as an causal agent of septic arthritis. the studies carried out on the patient permitted the exclusion of the existence of a digestive neoplasm and endocarditis. despite a prolonged evolution prior to treatment with elevated doses of penicillin g and not requiring surgical drainage, the evolution was good and no destructive lesions were produced in the shoulder joint. hematogenous infections (in this case septic arthritis) by streptococcus bovis may present in  patients without gastrointestinal diseases or endocarditis, possibly have a low damage to skeletal structures and respond adequately to conventional treatment with penicillin g.

TI  == interaction of ruminal bacteria in the production and utilization of maltooligosaccharides from starch.
AB  == the degradation and utilization of starch by three amylolytic and one nonamylolytic species of ruminal bacteria were studied. pure cultures of streptococcus bovis jb1, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, and bacteroides ruminicola d31d rapidly hydrolyzed starch and maltooligosaccharides accumulated. the major starch hydrolytic products detected in s. bovis cultures were glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose. in addition to these oligosaccharides, b. fibrisolvens cultures produced maltopentaose. the products of starch hydrolysis by b. ruminicola were even more complex, yielding glucose through maltotetraose,  maltohexaose, and maltoheptaose but little maltopentaose. selenomonas ruminantium hd4 grew poorly on starch, digested only a small portion of the available substrate, and generated no detectable oligosaccharides as a result of cultivation in starch containing medium. s. ruminantium was able to grow on a mixture of maltooligosaccharides and utilize those of lower degree (less than 10) of polymerization. a coculture system containing s. ruminantium as a dextrin-utilizing species and each of the three amylolytic bacteria was developed to test whether the products of starch hydrolysis were available for crossfeeding to another ruminal bacterium. cocultures of s. ruminantium and s. bovis contained large numbers of s. bovis but relatively few s. ruminantium and exhibited little  change in the pattern of maltooligosaccharides observed for pure cultures of s. bovis. in contrast, s. ruminantium was able to compete with b. fibrisolvens and b. ruminicola for these growth substrates. when grown with b. fibrisolvens, s. ruminantium grew to high numbers and maltooligosaccharides accumulated to a much  lesser degree than in cultures of b. fibrisolvens alone. s. ruminantium-b. ruminicola cultures contained large numbers of both species, and maltooligosaccharides never accumulated in these cocultures.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the effect of ph on the heat production and membrane resistance of streptococcus  bovis.
AB  == non-growing cultures of streptococcus bovis jb1 which were incubated in 2-[n-moropholino] ethane-sulfonic acid (mes)-phosphate buffer (ph 6.8) and glucose (2 g/l) produced heat at a rate of 0.17 mw/mg protein, and this rate was  proportional to the enthalpy change of the homolactic fermentation. since the growth-independent heat production could be eliminated by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (dccd), an inhibitor of f1f0 atpases, it appeared that virtually all of the energy was being used to counteract proton flux through the  cell membrane. when the ph was decreased from 6.8 to 5.8, heat production and glucose consumption increased, the electrical potential (delta psi) declined, the chemical gradient of protons (z delta ph) increased, and there was a small increase in total protonmotive force (delta p). further decreases in ph (5.8 to 4.5) caused a marked decrease in heat production and glucose consumption even though there was only a small decline in membrane voltage. based on the enthalpy  of atp (4 kcal or 16.8 kj/mol), it appeared that 38% of the wattage was passing through the cell membrane. the relationship between membrane voltage and membrane wattage or glucose consumption was non-linear (non-ohmic), and it appeared that the resistance of the membrane to current flow was not constant. based on the electrical formula, resistance = voltage2/wattage and resistance = voltage/amperage, there was a marked increase in membrane resistance when the ph  was less than 6.0. the increase in membrane resistance at low ph allowed s. bovis to maintain its membrane potential and expend less energy when its ability to ferment glucose was impaired.

TI  == cloning and expression of an amylase gene from streptococcus bovis in escherichia coli.
AB  == an amylase gene was identified in a streptococcus bovis 033 lambda gtwes lambda b genomic library. using a starch overlay and a congo red-iodine staining procedure, amylase positive clones could be identified by zones of clearing. ten  amylase positive clones were identified using this procedure. the clone chosen for further study, lambda sba105, contained an insert of approximately 7.5 kb. the insert was mapped, and subcloning localized the amylase gene to a region of approximately 3.1 kb. cloning of the 3.1 kb amylase fragment into puc18 in both orientations revealed that the amylase gene was transcribed from its own promoter. amylase activity was expressed by the escherichia coli subclones and was found to be largely associated with the cytoplasmic fraction. southern hybridization of genomic dna from the amylolytic strains, s. bovis 033, s. bovis  077, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 194 and 195 revealed a single hybridizing band in  s. bovis 033 dna only. this indicates that the amylase gene from s. bovis may differ from the amylases of these other amylolytic bacteria.

TI  == effect of growth conditions on the streptococcus bovis phosphoenolpyruvate glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == four strains of the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis were surveyed for phosphoenolpyruvate (pep) and atp-dependent phosphorylation of glucose and the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose. all four strains had high rates of glucose phosphorylation with either phosphoryl donor, but 2-deoxyglucose activity was much higher in the presence of pep. these results provide evidence for a pep-dependent glucose phosphotransferase system in these bacteria. mannose  and 2-deoxyglucose inhibited pep-dependent phosphorylation of glucose by s. bovis jb1 by 50 and 38%, respectively, whereas alpha-methylglucoside had little effect. mannose was a competitive inhibitor of pep-dependent phosphorylation of glucose with an inhibition constant of 2.8 mm, and pep-dependent activity in cells grown  in batch culture was optimal at ph 7.2. when s. bovis jb1 was grown in continuous culture, pep-dependent phosphorylation of glucose and 2-deoxyglucose was highest  in cells grown at a dilution rate of .10/h and at low glucose concentrations. phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent activity was optimum at a growth ph of 5.0 for cells grown in medium that contained less than 6.0 g/liter of glucose. these data indicate that pep-dependent glucose phosphotransferase system activity can be influenced depending on the growth conditions used to culture s. bovis. furthermore, these results suggest that environmental conditions within the rumen will affect how glucose is transported by s. bovis.

AB  == twenty-nine strains of 14 species of rumen bacteria were screened for their ability to hydrolyse ala2, ala5, glyarg-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide (glyarg-mna) and leu-mna. several species, notably megasphaera elsdenii, were active against ala2, and a smaller number, including bacteroides ruminicola, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, ruminococcus flavefaciens, lachnospira multipara and ruminobacter amylophilus, broke down ala5. streptococcus bovis had an exceptionally high leucine arylamidase activity. however, only ba. ruminicola hydrolysed glyarg-mna. further investigation revealed that only ba. ruminicola and bu. fibrisolvens hydrolysed ala5 to ala3 and ala2, with little ala4 being produced, in a manner similar to rumen fluid. the activity of ba. ruminicola against synthetic peptidase substrates, including glyarg-mna, lysala-mna, argarg-mna, glypro-mna, leuval-mna, and ala3-p-nitroanilide, was similar to that of rumen fluid, whereas  the activity of bu. fibrisolvens was quite different. since the main mechanism by which peptides are broken down in the rumen is similar to dipeptidyl aminopeptidase type i, for which glyarg-mna is a diagnostic substrate, it was concluded that ba. ruminicola was the most important single species in peptide breakdown in the rumen.

TI  == enumeration by a miniaturized method of escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis and enterococci as indicators of the origin of faecal pollution of waters.
AB  == counts of escherichia coli, faecal streptococci and enterococci were made on faecal specimens from human and animal origin and urban raw sewage waters, with microtiter plates containing selective substances. escherichia coli was more numerous than faecal streptococci and enterococci in 80% of the samples regardless of the origin. consequently the use of the ratio e. coli/faecal streptococci to distinguish human from animal origin of faecal pollution is questionable. enterococcus faecalis was predominant in human and poultry faeces,  streptococcus bovis was typical of the bovine faeces and to a lesser extent also  of pig faeces whereas enterococcus durans, ent. hirae and ent. faecium did not characterize any faecal source. streptococcus bovis could be distinguished in the microtiter plate by its inability to reduce triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (ttc)  in the medium.

TI  == phage resistance and altered growth habit in a strain of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == bacteriophage (phi sb01) of streptococcus bovis, isolated from pooled rumen fluid of cattle, was a small siphovirus of morphotype b1. it contained double-stranded  dna of length 30.9 kb, which was digested by the restriction endonucleases, ecori, hindiii, and pvuii. bacteria which survived phi sb01 infection (strain 2bar) grew in long chains (100-200 cells), ultimately forming large clumps of cells. this growth habit was in distinct contrast to that of the parent host strain which grew predominantly in the form of single cells or diplococci. strain 2bar was genetically stable, resistant to phi sb01 attack, and the observed differences in the growth characteristics of the parent strain and 2bar indicated that cells of 2bar were more adherent. in the rumen ecosystem, the selection of phage-resistant bacteria with altered growth characteristics may be a factor in modifying bacterial phenotypes, and thus increasing variability among bacteria which are closely related genetically.

AB  == the protein, hpr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts) in bacteria, was purified from streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. the purified preparation gave only one band  when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pi = 4.85). however, electrophoresis in tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by pep in the presence of enzyme i of the pts or by atp with the hpr kinase. homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained  by preparative electrophoresis. each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the  doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. the electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees c for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees c for several months. both hpr proteins catalyzed in vitro the pep-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with  a preparation of hpr containing both forms of the protein. both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from pep to the other specific pts proteins  known in s salivarius. rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. the presence of the 2 forms of hpr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of s salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. a doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (s mutans, s sobrinus, s sanguis, s thermophilus, s  bovis, s rattus) and also in l lactis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == resistance of streptococcus bovis to acetic acid at low ph: relationship between  intracellular ph and anion accumulation.
AB  == streptococcus bovis jb1, an acid-tolerant ruminal bacterium, was able to grow at  phs from 6.7 to 4.5, and 100 mm acetate had little effect on growth rate or proton motive force across the cell membrane. when s. bovis was grown in glucose-limited chemostats at ph 5.2, the addition of sodium acetate (as much as  100 mm) had little effect on the production of bacterial protein. at higher concentrations of sodium acetate (100 to 360 mm), production of bacterial protein declined, but this decrease could largely be explained by a shift in fermentation products (acetate, formate, and ethanol production to lactate production) and a decline in atp production (3 atp per glucose versus 2 atp per glucose). yatp (grams of cells per mole of atp) was not decreased significantly even by high concentrations of acetate. cultures supplemented with 100 mm sodium acetate took  up [14c]acetate and [14c]benzoate in accordance with the henderson-hasselbalch equation and gave similar estimates of intracellular ph. as the extracellular ph  declined, s. bovis allowed its intracellular ph to decrease and maintained a relatively constant ph gradient across the cell membrane (0.9 unit). the decrease in intracellular ph prevented s. bovis from accumulating large amounts of acetate anion. on the basis of these results it did not appear that acetate was acting as an uncoupler. the sensitivity of other bacteria to volatile fatty acids at low ph is explained most easily by a high transmembrane ph gradient and anion accumulation.

TI  == a rapid method for identification of mycobacterium species by polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis of soluble cell proteins.

TI  == a re-assessment of bacterial growth efficiency: the heat production and membrane  potential of streptococcus bovis in batch and continuous culture.
AB  == glucose-limited, continuous cultures (dilution rate 0.1 h-1) of streptococcus bovis jb1 fermented glucose at a rate of 3.9 mumol mg protein-1 h-1 and produced  acetate, formate and ethanol. based on a maximum atp yield of 32 cells/mol atp (stouthamer 1973) and 3 atp/glucose, the theoretical glucose consumption for growth would have been 2.1 mumol mg protein-1 h-1. because the maintenance energy requirement was 1.7 mumol/mg protein/h (russell and baldwin 1979), virtually all  of the glucose consumption could be explained by growth and maintenance and the yatp was 30. glucose-limited, continuous cultures produced heat at a rate of 0.29 mw/mg protein, and this value was similar to the enthalpy change of the fermentation (0.32 mw/mg protein). batch cultures (specific growth rate 2.0 h-1)  fermented glucose at a rate of 81 mumol mg protein-1 h-1, and produced only lactate. the heat production was in close agreement with the theoretical enthalpy change (1.72 versus 1.70 mw/mg protein), but only 80% of the glucose consumption  could be accounted by growth and maintenance. the yatp of the batch cultures was  25. nitrogen-limited, glucose-excess, non-growing cultures fermented glucose at a rate of 6.9 mumol mg protein-1 h-1, and virtually all of the enthalpy for this homolactic fermentation could be accounted as heat (0.17 mw/mg protein). the nitrogen-limited cultures had a membrane potential of 150 mv, and nearly all of the heat production could be explained by a futile cycle of protons through the cell membrane (watts = amperes x voltage where h+/atp was 3).(abstract truncated  at 250 words)

AB  == a 59-year-old chronic alcoholic male, with no cardiac past history, was hospitalised with septicemia 5 months after the endoscopic removal of 2 benign intestinal polyps. the diagnosis of tricuspid endocarditis was possible only 2 months later on the basis of echocardiography requested because of the onset of a tricuspid systolic murmur. blood cultures revealed the presence in succession of  streptococcus d fecalis then bovis. antibiotics, changed several times because of the onset of complications (allergy, agranulocytosis), failed to deal with the problem of infection as shown by the development of several septic pulmonary emboli which finally resulted in total tricuspidectomy with neither immediate nor secondary valve replacement. the authors use this clinical case to review the characteristics of tricuspid endocarditis, the incidence of which is on the increase in certain etiological contexts (staphylococcal endocarditis in drug addicts or secondary to central vascular lines). they stress that the clinical picture is often confusing since the murmur of tricuspid incompetence is absent in 2/3 of cases. echocardiography must therefore be requested routinely in all septicemias, thus enabling earlier diagnosis and assessment of the risk of pulmonary embolism (risk if vegetation greater than 10 mm). the nature of the organism responsible may be suggestive of certain etiologies. thus malignant disease of the colon should be sought if the bacterium is a streptococcus d bovis. apart from antibiotics, treatment must include effective anticoagulation to decrease the risk of embolic recurrence.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the glucose phosphotransferase system (pts) of streptococcus bovis could not account for the glucose consumption of exponential cultures, and the kinetics of  glucose transport were biphasic. a pts-deficient mutant lost the high-affinity, low-capacity system but retained its ability to take up glucose at high substrate concentrations. the low-affinity, high-capacity system did not require a proton motive force or atp and could not be driven by an artificial membrane potential in the presence or absence of sodium. since low-affinity transport was directly proportional to the external substrate concentration and exhibited counterflow kinetics, it appeared that a facilitated-diffusion mechanism was responsible for  glucose transport at high substrate concentrations.

AB  == the data obtained for the first time in our studies indicate that the production  of antibodies to group a streptococcal polysaccharide (a-ps), one of the cross-reacting streptococcal antigens, may suppress delayed hypersensitivity (dh) to microbial antigens. the existence of sharply pronounced correlation between the suppression of dh and the presence of antibodies to the rhamnose area of a-ps in the blood of balb/c mice immunized with the pepsin-treated culture of group a  streptococci has been shown. the suppression of dh is absent in the immunized animals of the same group whose blood contains antibodies to the determinant, specific for a-ps. as revealed in this study, the effect of the suppression of antigen-specific cytotoxicity linked with dh to bcg antigens can be reproduced by mixing lymph node cells taken from these two groups of the animals. the data thus obtained are possibly linked with the activation of nonspecific t suppressors in  the production of antibodies to the rhamnose determinants of a-ps in the animals  immunized with streptococci. the mechanism of the newly discovered phenomenon is  discussed.

AB  == patients with streptococcus bovis bacteraemia are at high risk of harbouring an asymptomatic colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps. it is therefore important to differentiate to a species level any group d streptococci grown in blood cultures. colonoscopy is the preferred method of screening these patients and high dose penicillin is the antibiotic of choice.

TI  == effect of ionophores and ph on growth of streptococcus bovis in batch and continuous culture.
AB  == batch cultures (ph 6.7) of streptococcus bovis jb1 were severely inhibited by 1.25 and 5 microm lasalocid and monensin, respectively, even though large amounts of glucose remained in the medium. however, continuous cultures tolerated as much as 10 and 20 microm, respectively, and used virtually all of the glucose. although continuous cultures grew with high concentrations of ionophore, the yield of bacterial protein decreased approximately 10-fold. when ph was decreased from 6.7 to 5.7, the potency of both ionophores increased, but lasalocid always caused a larger decrease in yield. the increased activity of lasalocid at ph 5.7  could largely be explained by an increased binding of the ionophore to the cell membrane. because monensin did not show an increased binding at low ph, some other factor (e.g., ion turnover) must have been influencing its activity. there  was a linear increase in lasalocid binding as the concentration increased, but monensin binding increased markedly at high concentrations. based on the observations that (i) s. bovis cells bound significant amounts of ionophore (the  ratio of ionophore to cell material was more important than the absolute concentration), (ii) batch cultures responded differently from continuous cultures, and (iii) ph can have a marked effect on ionophore activity, it appears that the term "minimum inhibitory concentration" may not provide an accurate assessment of microbial growth inhibition in vivo.

TI  == the triad of streptococcus bovis bacteremia, colonic pathology, and liver disease.
AB  == the association of streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colon carcinoma has been  reported previously in small series in the medical, but not surgical, literature. although the fecal carriage rate of s. bovis increases with colonic pathology, no explanation exists for the development of bacteremia in these cases. to explore the possible contribution of hepatic dysfunction to the development of portal and systemic bacteremia, the incidence of both colonic pathology and liver disease or dysfunction was determined in 92 patients with s. bovis endocarditis and/or bacteremia. colonic and liver evaluation had been undertaken in 47% and 93% of patients, respectively. among these patients, colonic pathology was identified in 51%, and liver disease or dysfunction was documented in 56%. either the underlying colonic disease or alterations in hepatic secretion of bile salts or immunoglobulins may promote the overgrowth of s. bovis and its translocation from the intestinal lumen into the portal venous system. a compromised hepatic reticuloendothelial system may then contribute to the development of s. bovis septicemia and subsequent endocarditis. we conclude that s. bovis bacteremia is an indication to the clinician of the possibility of underlying liver disease as  well as colon pathology.

TI  == agalactosyl igg, antibodies to heat shock proteins, and acute rheumatic fever.
AB  == in rheumatoid arthritis an increased proportion of the n-linked oligosaccharides  on serum igg terminate with n-acetylglucosamine (agalactosyl igg). it has recently been shown that group a streptococcal cell wall peptidoglycan/polysaccharide complex may be used to raise monoclonal antibodies which bind to this glycoform of igg. patients with rheumatoid arthritis also have increased levels of antibody to the 65 kd and 70 kd families of heat shock proteins, particularly to a bacterial (mycobacterium bovis) homologue of heat shock protein hsp65. streptococci must contain similar heat shock proteins. acute rheumatic fever follows infection with group a streptococci, and these organisms  might theoretically evoke antibody to heat shock proteins or changes in the levels of agalactosyl igg, which is antigenically cross reactive with their cell  walls. it is shown here that serum samples from patients with acute rheumatic fever do not differ from those from normal children by these criteria.

TI  == protein g-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for anti-mpb70 antibodies in bovine tuberculosis.
AB  == mpb70 is a highly species specific protein which is secreted from mycobacterium bovis during culture. to investigate whether antibodies against mpb70 can be used as an indicator of infection with m. bovis, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  was developed, based on the use of biotinylated protein g, to provide a common indicator for antibody formation in different species. during experimental infection with m. bovis in cattle, a characteristic pattern of anti-mpb70 antibody production was observed with an initial flat plateau followed by a marked rise 18 to 20 weeks after infection. skin testing with bovine tuberculin purified protein derivative (ppd), which was shown to contain antibody-reactive mpb70, was a potent stimulator of antibody production in infected animals. in experimentally infected cattle, we observed an inverse relationship between antibody activity and delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test reactions. in natural m. bovis infections, skin testing with ppd was also a potent stimulator of anti-mpb70 formation. comparison between the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to mpb70 and that for antibodies to the widely cross-reacting m. bovis bcg antigen 85b in animals with m. bovis, mycobacterium avium, mycobacterium paratuberculosis, and corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis infections showed that formation of antibody to mpb70 was highly specific for infection with m. bovis. the use of an mpb70-containing ppd preparation for skin testing followed by this anti-mpb70 assay is a highly specific indicator of m. bovis infection. adjustment of the test conditions is expected to provide an increased  sensitivity of the procedure for the diagnosis of natural m. bovis infections.

TI  == atpase-dependent energy spilling by the ruminal bacterium, streptococcus bovis.
AB  == when the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis was grown in batch culture with glucose as the energy source, the doubling time was approximately 21 min and the  rate of bacterial heat production was proportional to the optical density (1.72 microw/micrograms protein). if exponentially growing cultures were treated with chloramphenicol, there was a decline in heat production, but the rate was greater than 0.30 microw/micrograms protein even after growth ceased. since there was no  heat production after glucose depletion, this growth-independent energy dissipation (spilling) was not simply due to endogenous metabolism. stationary cells which were washed and incubated in nitrogen-free medium containing an excess of glucose produced heat at a rate of 0.17 microw/micrograms protein. monensin and tetrachlorosalicylanilide (tcs), compounds which facilitate an influx of protons, caused a more than 2-fold increase in heat production. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (dccd) virtually eliminated growth-independent heat production regardless of the mode of growth inhibition. because dccd had little effect on the glucose phosphotransferase system, it appeared that the combined action of proton influx and the membrane bound f1f0 proton atpase was responsible for energy spilling.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine an influence of udder infection on milk chloride level and on milk productivity of cows of black and white race. bacteriological analysis was performed by bacterial isolation from milk collected in sterile conditions from single lobes of mammary gland. the study was aimed to  detect the following bacteria: streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces pyogenes, enterobacteriaceae rods, corynebacterium bovis, and micrococcus sp. milk chloride level was determined by burette method in 1250 milk samples collected from entire udder. milk productivity was determined on the day  of bacterial isolation. statistical analysis of the results of the study on udder infection, milk chloride level, and milk productivity of mammary gland did reveal lack of a simple correlations between those parameters and in the indirect manner indicated an influence of inappropriate maintenance conditions of tested cows on  the health condition of their udder. it seems possible that alkalosis and acidosis in cows, taken into consideration in discussion section, could constitute a factor influencing the frequency of mastitis incidence.

TI  == factors influencing the adherence of strains of streptococcus bovis and escherichia coli isolated from ruminal epithelium.
AB  == two strains of streptococcus bovis (a1 and a5) and one strain of escherichia coli (0141:h28) isolated from the surface of bovine ruminal mucous epithelium were examined for adherence to isolated and cultured ruminal epithelial cells. the e.  coli adhered to the target cell by means of fimbriae, which had several common properties with type 1 common fimbriae and caused mannose-sensitive haemagglutination. the a1 strain of s. bovis was devoid of fimbriae and its adherence to the epithelial surface was not inhibited by treatment with sugars or phenol-treated bacterial membrane from the same organism. it was therefore postulated that the bacterial glycocalyx of the s. bovis organisms acted as ligand. the extent of bacterial adherence depended on the state of differentiation of the target cell in both the isolated and the cultured ruminal  cell systems. the receptors for both adherent bacterial species were in all probability associated with the glycocalyx of the target cells.

AB  == ten herds with low somatic cell counts in bulk milk had an incidence of clinical  mastitis of only 2.2 per 100 cows whereas 10 other herds with similarly low cell  counts had an incidence of 53.6 per 100 cows. the major pathogens in the herds with a high incidence were escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus and the coagulase-negative staphylococci. the percentage of uninfected quarters in the herds with a high incidence of clinical mastitis was 21.4 per cent compared with 12.2 per cent in the herds with a low incidence of clinical mastitis. the prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci, corynebacterium bovis and micrococcus species was higher in the herds with a low incidence of clinical mastitis. there was a significant linear relationship between the percentage of uninfected quarters and the incidence of clinical mastitis in the herds with a high incidence of clinical mastitis. in herds with a low incidence of clinical mastitis significantly less teat disinfection after milking was practised. the results suggest that infections with minor pathogens tend to protect cows against mastitis, and that teat disinfection after milking may increase the percentage of uninfected quarters and lead to an increased risk of clinical mastitis in herds with low somatic cell counts in bulk milk.

TI  == non-proton-motive-force-dependent sodium efflux from the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis: bound versus free pools.
AB  == growing cells of streptococcus bovis jb1 had a sodium content of 1,125 nmol/mg of protein and, based on a ratio of cell volume to protein of 4.3 microliters/mg, the apparent intracellular sodium concentration was more than 240 mm. much of this sodium could not be removed by water washing even if cells were boiled or treated with the pore-forming ionophore, gramicidin, but it could be exchanged for potassium. stationary cultures had a 2.6-microliters volume per milligram of  protein and a total sodium content of 410 mm. when stationary cultures were energized with glucose at ph 6 to 8, sodium (more than 200 mm) was expelled within 2 min, and it appeared that growing cells had a very small pool of free intracellular sodium. sodium-proton antiport activity could not be demonstrated with a sodium pulse, and the protonophore sf6847, valinomycin, and the h+-atpase  inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (dccd) had little effect on sodium efflux, even though these inhibitors greatly reduced the proton-motive force. sf6847, valinomycin, and dccd had little effect on intracellular atp, but iodoacetate, an inhibitor of glycolysis, decreased atp as well as sodium efflux. stationary cells from sodium-deficient medium expelled little sodium after glucose addition and had 35% more atp than stationary cells which were grown in sodium medium and expelled sodium. an artificial electrochemical gradient of sodium was able to drive atp synthesis in stationary cells, and this atp formation was not sensitive to dccd. these results indicated that bacteria could have a significant pool of bound sodium and that sodium expulsion from s. bovis was directly coupled to atp  hydrolysis.

TI  == rapid identification of streptococcus bovis by using combination constitutive enzyme substrate hydrolyses.
AB  == several studies have documented the association of blood and rectal-culture positivity for streptococcus bovis with gastrointestinal neoplasia, especially colonic carcinoma. conventional methods using bile-esculin hydrolysis, salt tolerance, and sugar fermentations to differentiate s. bovis from other streptococci are laborious, slow, and relatively expensive. commercially available systems are costly and require at least 24 to 48 h of incubation. a rapid identification procedure for s. bovis and related bacteria was developed. the method uses a reagent containing two hydrolyzable substrates, p-nitrophenyl-alpha-d-galactopyranoside and 4-methylumbilliferyl-beta-d-glucoside, in the presence of 2.5% sodium deoxycholate. this combination test, performed with a rapid assay for l-pyrrolidonyl-aminopeptidase, could distinguish s. bovis, streptococcus equinus, enterococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, and the viridans group streptococci  in culture within 30 min. twelve species of the genera streptococcus and enterococcus were tested. the rapid method correlated well with conventional techniques. the reagents are readily available, inexpensive, and easy to make and can be stored in the refrigerator for at least 6 months.

TI  == classification and identification of the viridans streptococci.
AB  == this review traces the history of the human, nonhemolytic, or viridans, streptococci and describes improvements in their taxonomy wrought by study of their biochemical profiles and analysis of their nucleic acids. the goal was to define species on the basis of genetic relationships and to describe these species by their phenotypic characteristics so that they can be easily identified. this method has resulted in the division of some species. streptococcus mutans has been divided into four species, two of which are common  in humans. three more mutans group species are indigenous to animals. conversely, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, and "s. milleri" have been combined under s. anginosus. s. mitis (or "s. mitior") can be well-defined and includes s. sanguis  ii. there is genetic heterogeneity within s. sanguis, but the species is usually  easy to identify. there is also some heterogeneity in s. bovis, but most human isolates are genetically related. discussions of the taxonomy of these species are accompanied by descriptions of the characteristics by which these streptococci can be identified. among these species are potential pathogens which should be suspected in cases of endocarditis and purulent infections of liver, brain, and other tissues.

AB  == aerococci are only occasionally isolated from urinary tract specimens. a 4-month' survey revealed 29 patients suspected of urinary tract infection (uti), from whom an aerococcus-like organism (alo) was isolated in significant numbers from urinary tract specimens and singly in 11 cases. approximately 0.8% of all urinary tract specimens examined during the period yielded growth of alo. the median age  of patients was 75 years. half of the patients were found to have conditions predisposing to uti. 9 of 11 patients without indwelling catheter, having alo isolated in pure culture from the urine, showed one or more typical signs of uti  (fever, dysuria and/or pollakisuria and pyuria). a phenotypic comparison was made between 29 strains of alo and 6 related organisms, including aerococcus viridans, streptococcus faecium, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus  group q and streptococcus group r. alo and a. viridans showed many similarities,  but, owing to characteristic differences with regard to colony morphology, biochemical reactions and antibiotic susceptibility pattern, the strains were easily separated.

TI  == transport of glutamine by streptococcus bovis and conversion of glutamine to pyroglutamic acid and ammonia.
AB  == streptococcus bovis jb1 cells energized with glucose transported glutamine at a rate of 7 nmol/mg of protein per min at a ph of 5.0 to 7.5; sodium had little effect on the transport rate. because valinomycin-treated cells loaded with k and diluted into na (ph 6.5) to create an artificial delta psi took up little glutamine, it appeared that transport was driven by phosphate-bond energy rather  than proton motive force. the kinetics of glutamine transport by glucose-energized cells were biphasic, and it appeared that facilitated diffusion was also involved, particularly at high glutamine concentrations. glucose-depleted cultures took up glutamine and produced ammonia, but the rate of transport per unit of glutamine (v/s) by nonenergized cells was at least 1,000-fold less than the v/s by glucose-energized cells. glutamine was converted  to pyroglutamate and ammonia by a pathway that did not involve a glutaminase reaction or glutamate production. no ammonia production from pyroglutamate was detected. s. bovis was unable to take up glutamate, but intracellular glutamate concentrations were as high as 7 mm. glutamate was produced from ammonia via a glutamate dehydrogenase reaction. cells contained high concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate and nadph that inhibited glutamate deamination and favored glutamate formation. since the carbon skeleton of glutamine was lost as pyroglutamate, glutamate formation occurred at the expense of glucose. arginine deamination is often used as a taxonomic tool in classifying streptococci, and it had generally been assumed that other amino acids could not be fermented. to our  knowledge, this is the first report of glutamine conversion to pyroglutamate and  ammonia in streptococci.

TI  == evaluation of teicoplanin for treatment of endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci in 20 patients.
AB  == teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic similar to vancomycin, was evaluated for the treatment of bacterial endocarditis in an open multicenter study from may 1985 to august 1987. a total of 20 patients with positive blood culture endocarditis received teicoplanin once daily as a mean intravenous injection of 7.3 mg/kg of body weight (range, 4.8 to 10.6 mg/kg); in 17 patients, teicoplanin  was combined with another antibiotic, usually an aminoglycoside. the mean duration of therapy was 28 days (range, 7 to 66 days). the diagnosis of endocarditis was confirmed by echocardiography or anatomical findings in 15 patients and established on the basis of clinical manifestations plus positive blood cultures in 5 patients. the tricuspid valve was involved in 11 of the 20 patients. isolates from blood were 12 staphylococcus aureus, 1 staphylococcus hominis, 1 micrococcus sedentarius, 1 enterococcus faecalis, 3 streptococcus bovis, and 2 nongroupable streptococcus sp. at the end of therapy, bacterial eradication was achieved in 17 of 20 patients (85%), and a favorable clinical outcome had occurred in 14 of 17 evaluable patients (82%). of these 14 patients,  one relapsed 4 months after the end of treatment. thus, teicoplanin was effective in 13 of 17 patients (76%). mean peak levels of teicoplanin in serum were lower,  23.1 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml, in patients who failed than in those who were cured (45.8 +/- 8.4 micrograms/ml). side effects occurred in 7 of 20 patients (35%), and required premature discontinuation of teicoplanin in 3 patients. these side effects were fever in three patients, rash in three patients, hearing loss in two patients, and increased serum transaminase levels in two patients. this study demonstrates the efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of endocarditis and the need for achieving peak levels in serum close to 40 micrograms/ml. teicoplanin should now be further evaluated in endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci means of controlled comparative study with standard therapy.

TI  == more monensin-sensitive, ammonia-producing bacteria from the rumen.
AB  == two monensin-sensitive bacteria which utilized carbohydrates poorly and grew rapidly on amino acids were isolated from the bovine rumen. the short rods (strain sr) fermented arginine, serine, lysine, glutamine, and threonine rapidly  (greater than 158 nmol/mg of protein per h) and grew faster on casein digest containing short peptides than on free amino acids ().34 versus 0.29 h(-1)). gelatin hydrolysate, an amino acid source containing an abundance of long peptides, was unable to support growth or ammonia production, but there was a large increase in ammonia production if strain sr was cocultured with peptidase-producing ruminal bacteria (bacteroides ruminicola or streptococcus bovis). cocultures showed no synergism with short peptides. strain sr washed out  of continuous culture ().1 h(-1)) at ph 5.9. the irregularly shaped organisms (strain f) deaminated glutamine, histidine, glutamate, and serine rapidly (greater than 137 nmol/mg of protein per min) and grew faster on free amino acids than on short peptides ().43 versus 0.21 h(-1)). when strain f was provided with  casein or gelatin hydrolysate and cocultured with peptidase-producing bacteria, there was a more than additive increase in ammonia production. strain f grew in continuous culture (0.1 h(-1)) when the ph was as low as 5.3. the irregularly shaped cells and short rods were present at less than 10(9)/ml in vivo, but they  ahd very high specific activities of ammonia production (greater than 310 nmol of ammonia/mg of protein per min) and could play an important role in ruminal amino  acid fermentation.

TI  == a physiological classification of viridans streptococci by use of the api-20strep system.
AB  == physiological reactions of viridans streptococci were examined by the api-20strep system and a selection of conventional tests. cluster analysis of these results produced a classification similar to a taxonomic scheme based on that of colman and williams. the organisms could be divided into the six recognised species--streptococcus mutans, s. bovis, s. mitior, s. sanguis, s. salivarius and s. milleri. analysis confirmed that s. mitior and s. sanguis can be distinguished in the api-20strep test by hydrolysis of arginine but not by dextran production.  although s. mutans, s. mitior and s. sanguis can be divided into two further subgroups, the taxonomic significance of this is unclear. with this means of classification, most organisms could be identified easily by a small number of tests. api-20strep is convenient for performing physiological tests on viridans streptococci, but the information provided by the manufacturers in regard to identification and nomenclature is in need of revision.

TI  == bacteremia with streptococcus bovis and streptococcus salivarius: clinical correlates of more accurate identification of isolates.
AB  == two biotypes of streptococcus bovis can be identified by laboratory testing and can be distinguished from the phenotypically similar organism streptococcus salivarius. we assessed the clinical relevance of careful identification of these organisms in 68 patients with streptococcal bacteremia caused by these similar species. s. bovis was more likely to be clinically significant when isolated from blood (89%) than was s. salivarius (23%). there was a striking association between s. bovis i bacteremia and underlying endocarditis (94%) compared with that of s. bovis ii bacteremia (18%). bacteremia with s. bovis i was also highly  correlated with an underlying colonic neoplasm (71% of patients overall, 100% of  those with thorough colonic examinations) compared with bacteremia due to s. bovis ii or s. salivarius (17% overall, 25% of patients with thorough colonic examinations). we conclude that careful identification of streptococcal bacteremic isolates as s. bovis biotype i provides clinically important information and should be more widely applied.

TI  == dna probe for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == effects of the ionophores monensin and tetronasin on simulated development of ruminal lactic acidosis in vitro.
AB  == a continuous coculture of four ruminal bacteria, megasphaera elsdenii, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus bovis, and lactobacillus sp. strain lb17,  was used to study the effects of the ionophores monensin and tetronasin on the changes in ruminal microbial ecology that occur during the onset of lactic acidosis. in control incubations, the system simulated the development of lactic  acidosis in vivo, with an initial overgrowth of s. bovis when an excess of glucose was added to the fermentor. lactobacillus sp. strain lb17 subsequently became dominant as ph fell and lactate concentration rose. both ionophores were able to prevent the accumulation of lactic acid and maintain a healthy non-lactate-producing bacterial population when added at the same time as an excess of glucose. tetronasin was more potent in this respect than monensin. when tetronasin was added to the culture 24 h after glucose, the proliferation of lactobacilli was reversed and a non-lactate-producing bacterial population developed, with an associated drop in lactate concentration in the fermentor. rises in culture ph and volatile fatty acid concentrations accompanied these changes. monensin was unable to suppress the growth of lactobacilli; therefore, in contrast to tetronasin, monensin added 24 h after the addition of glucose failed to reverse the acidosis. numbers of lactobacilli and lactate concentrations remained high, whereas ph and volatile fatty acid concentrations were low.

AB  == quarter samples (n = 6,328) of mammary secretions were collected from 160 cows during physiologic transitions of the udder to determine the frequency of isolation of mastitis-causing pathogens and the incidence of new intramammary infections (imi) during the nonlactating period. none of the cows in the herd was infected with streptococcus agalactiae, and the prevalence of staphylococcus aureus was low. cows were not treated with antibiotics at cessation of milking. a threefold increase in the percentage of quarters infected with major mastitis-causing pathogens developed from late lactation to early involution. coliforms and streptococci other than str agalactiae accounted for 94% of major pathogen infections. the number of quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci increased slightly from late lactation to early involution, whereas the number of quarters infected with corynebacterium bovis decreased markedly. major pathogens caused 101 of 153 imi at parturition and greater than 90% were caused by streptococci and coliforms. at parturition, 51 of 52 minor pathogen imi were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. during early lactation, there was a marked decrease in quarters infected with major pathogens; however, the number of quarters with major pathogen imi during early lactation was 2.3 times higher than the number of quarters infected before cessation of milking. the number of quarters with minor pathogen imi during early lactation was the same as at parturition, but a marked decrease in quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci and a marked increase in c bovis imi developed from parturition to early lactation.

AB  == a monensin-sensitive ruminal peptostreptococcus was able to grow rapidly (growth  rate of 0.5/h) on an enzymatic hydrolysate of casein, but less than 23% of the amino acid nitrogen was ever utilized. when an acid hydrolysate was substituted for the enzymatic digest, more than 31% of the nitrogen was converted to ammonia  and cell protein. coculture experiments and synergisms with peptide-degrading strains of bacteroides ruminicola and streptococcus bovis indicated that the peptostreptococcus was unable to transport certain peptides or hydrolyze them extracellularly. leucine, serine, phenylalanine, threonine, and glutamine were deaminated at rates of 349, 258, 102, 95, and 91 nmol/mg of protein per min, respectively. deamination rates for some other amino acids were increased when the amino acids were provided as pairs of oxidized and reduced amino acids (stickland reactions), but these rates were still less than 80 nmol/mg of protein per min. in continuous culture (dilution rate of 0.1/h), bacterial dry matter and ammonia production decreased dramatically at a ph of less than 6.0. when dilution rates were increased from 0.08 to 0.32/h (ph 7.0), ammonia production increased while production of bacterial dry matter and protein decreased. these rather peculiar kinetics resulted in a slightly negative estimate of maintenance energy  and could not be explained by a change in fermentation products. approximately 80% of the cell dry matter was protein. when corrections were made for cell composition, the yield of atp was higher than the theoretical maximum value. it is possible that mechanisms other than substrate-level phosphorylation contributed to the energetics of growth.

TI  == sodium-dependent transport of neutral amino acids by whole cells and membrane vesicles of streptococcus bovis, a ruminal bacterium.
AB  == streptococcus bovis jb1 cells were able to transport serine, threonine, or alanine, but only when they were incubated in sodium buffers. if glucose-energized cells were washed in potassium phosphate and suspended in potassium phosphate buffer, there was no detectable uptake. cells deenergized with 2-deoxyglucose and incubated in sodium phosphate buffer were still able to transport serine, and this result indicated that the chemical sodium gradient was capable of driving transport. however, when the deenergized cells were treated with valinomycin and diluted into sodium phosphate to create both an artificial membrane potential and a chemical sodium gradient, rates of serine uptake were fivefold greater than in cells having only a sodium gradient. if deenergized cells were preloaded with sodium (no membrane potential or sodium gradient), there was little serine transport. nigericin and monensin, ionophores capable of  reversing sodium gradients across membranes, strongly inhibited sodium-dependent  uptake of the three amino acids. membrane vesicles loaded with potassium and diluted into either lithium or choline chloride were unable to transport serine,  but rapid uptake was evident if sodium chloride was added to the assay mixture. serine transport had an extremely poor affinity for sodium, and more than 30 mm was needed for half-maximal rates of uptake. serine transport was inhibited by an excess of threonine, but an excess of alanine had little effect. results indicated that s. bovis had separate sodium symport systems for serine or threonine and alanine, and either the membrane potential or chemical sodium gradient could drive uptake.

AB  == a variety of species of ruminal bacteria were screened for the ability to grow in starch-containing medium and produce amylase. of those tested, the highest levels of amylase were produced by streptococcus bovis jb1 and ruminobacter amylophilus  h18. other strains that grew well on starch and produced amylase included butyrivibrio fibrisolvens a38 and 49 and bacteroides ruminicola 23 and b14. varying the carbohydrate source provided for growth resulted in changes in the growth rate and level of amylase produced by these strains. all strains grew rapidly in starch-containing medium, and the rates of growth were generally more  rapid than those observed for maltose-grown cultures. for s. bovis jb1, b. ruminicola 23 and b14, and b. fibrisolvens 49 and a38, amylase was produced when  growth was on maltose or starch, but this activity was greatly reduced in glucose-grown cultures. the distribution of amylolytic activity between cellular  and extracellular fractions was sometimes affected by the carbohydrate provided for growth. if s. bovis jb1 and b. fibrisolvens 49 were grown on starch, amylase  was largely associated with cell pellets; however, if grown on maltose these strains produced activities that were almost entirely present in the extracellular fluid fractions. although not as dramatic, a similar shift in the location of amylase activities was noted for the two b. ruminicola strains when grown on the same substrates. growth on maltose or starch had little influence on either the predominantly cell-associated activity of b. fibrisolvens a38 or the activity of r. amylophilus h18, which was equally divided between cell pellet and extracellular fluid fractions.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == differentiation of ruminal bacterial species by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using egg yolk antibodies from immunized chicken hens.
AB  == cross-reactivity among four species of ruminal bacteria was examined by using egg yolk antibodies from immunized leghorn laying hens and an enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay. the effects of the four species on the hens were compared on various days postimmunization. hens injected with the same bacterial species had similar apparent antibody levels over the entire postimmunization period, but only bacteroides ruminicola b1(4) and selenomonas ruminantium d antigens elicited early increases in apparent antibody levels during weeks 2 and 3. antibody cross-reactivity was greatly reduced by week 2, except for antibodies against streptococcus bovis jb1.

TI  == effects of source and washing of erythrocytes on growth of bacterial pathogens from the bovine mammary gland.
AB  == effects of source and washing of rbc on quantitative growth and hemolytic zone sizes of common bacterial pathogens of the bovine mammary gland were evaluated. blood samples used to prepare the blood agar media were obtained from 10 adult dairy cows, 10 dairy calves, and 10 sheep. hemolytic zone sizes produced by staphylococcus aureus were significantly (p less than 0.01) larger on blood agar  prepared with washed rbc than on blood agar prepared with nonwashed rbc, regardless of rbc source. with the exception of corynebacterium bovis, growth of  all bacteria was equivalent or significantly higher on medium prepared with washed rbc, compared with that on medium prepared with nonwashed rbc, regardless  of rbc source. significantly higher numbers of c bovis (p less than 0.01) and streptococcus agalactiae (p less than 0.01) were isolated on medium prepared with washed cow rbc. significantly higher numbers of str uberis (p less than 0.01) and s aureus (p less than 0.05) were isolated on medium prepared with washed sheep rbc and washed calf rbc, respectively. growth of escherichia coli was not affected by the rbc source. seemingly, rbc used in the preparation of medium should be washed. the source of rbc, as well as inter-animal variation, also should be considered in the quality control of medium.

TI  == bmy-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

TI  == partial characterisation of the inhibitory substances produced by streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  == the production of inhibitory substances was sought by deferred antagonism. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, but no detectable bacteriocin.  actinomycetes and neisseria pharyngis were particularly susceptible to the lethal action of hydrogen peroxide. streptococcus milleri produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocin-like substances. s. oralis strains were inhibited by the bacteriocin-like products of strains of streptococcus bovis, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius. inhibition was due neither to complete bacteriophage nor to fermentation end-products. extracellular polysaccharides formed during growth could not protect sensitive strains from the effect of hydrogen peroxide or bacteriocin-like substances.

TI  == the bacteria responsible for ureolysis in artificial dental plaque.
AB  == the origin of ureolytic activity in artificial-mouth plaques was established by assessing the contribution to plaque ureolytic activity of the isolated bacteria. to overcome losses of ureolytic activity caused by the unstable presence of urease in oral bacteria, ureolytic bacteria were isolated from an exceptionally active plaque (1 mumol nh3/min per mg protein) in which 63 per cent of the flora  was ureolytic. after their ability to metabolize urea was stabilized, 13 ureolytic bacteria remained: seven strains of streptococcus salivarius, one streptococcus bovis, two staphylococcus epidermidis and three staphylococcus haemolyticus. their urease activity, measured after growth into stationary phase, was reproducible and strain specific with a 20-fold range within each genus. the  mean ureolytic activity of each species, when weighted by its calculated incidence in the original plaque, accounted for 40 per cent of the total plaque ureolytic activity. however, these values for urease levels were only a small fraction of the bacterial ureolytic potential. urease per mg cell protein measured during the growth cycle of a selected strep. salivarius, and staph. epidermidis, varied 10-fold, and reached much higher activities (i.e. 6-8 mumol nh3/min per mg of cell protein) than under the growth conditions that were used to assess the contribution of these species to total plaque ureolysis. thus urea  metabolism in artificial plaque was due mainly to strep. salivarius, with a small contribution from staph. epidermidis. the presence of further unidentified species of ureolytic oral bacteria need not be invoked.

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

AB  == in order to assess the species distribution and the antibiotic susceptibility of  viridans streptococci in various human infections, we reviewed 164 cases of viridans streptococcal bacteremia seen at the national taiwan university hospital between may 1981 and april 1987. the organisms were isolated from 83 patients with endocarditis. among 81 nonendocarditis patients, only 54 had clinically recognizable foci of suppurative inflammation. mainly based on api 20 strep system of species identification, s. sanguis ii accounted for 24.4%; s. mitis, 20.7%; s. sanguis i, 20.1%; and s. milleri 2, 11.6% of the 164 cases studied. of  83 endocarditis patients, 27.7% were s. sanguis i; 21.7%, s. sanguis ii; and 16.9%, s. mitis. in nonendocarditis bacteremia with known suppurative lesions, 3  most often isolated organisms were s. sanguis ii (24.0%), s. mitis (24.0%), and s. milleri 2 (24.0%). in nonendocarditis bacteremia without suppurative infection, the most frequent isolates were s. sanguis ii (33.3%) and s. mitis (25.9%). in terms of relative frequency between endocarditis and nonendocarditis  cases, s. mutan, s. sanguis i, and s. bovis had the highest frequency ratio of 7:1, 3.5:1, and 1.5:1, respectively. all isolates were susceptible to penicillin  g, ampicillin, and cephalothin. tetracycline resistance, however, were observed in 35.4% of the isolates; oxacillin resistance, 11.0%; and erythromycin resistance, 9.1%.

TI  == effects of potassium ion concentrations on the antimicrobial activities of ionophores against ruminal anaerobes.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of monensin and lasalocid against representative strains of ruminal bacteria were evaluated in medium containing three different concentrations of potassium (1.3, 7.9, or 23.3 mm). the growth of eubacterium ruminantium was inhibited by low concentrations of ionophores (less than or equal to 0.16 mg/liter), while the strain of streptococcus bovis tested was resistant to high concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) at all potassium concentrations tested. the mics of the ionophores for strains of bacteroides succinogenes, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens and for one strain of bacteroides ruminicola increased with increasing potassium concentrations in the medium. high concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) decreased the maximum cell yields or increased the lag times or both in cultures of one strain of bacteroides ruminicola and two strains of selenomonas ruminantium but did not completely inhibit the growth of these organisms. increased potassium concentrations in the medium (from 7.9 to 23.3 mm) decreased the lag times or increased the cell yields or both when these three strains were grown in ionophore-containing medium, while the activities of lasalocid and monensin against these organisms were enhanced in the medium containing low potassium concentrations (1.3 mm). the data from this study suggest that extracellular potassium concentrations may influence the antimicrobial activities of ionophores in the rumen.

TI  == transport and phosphorylation of disaccharides by the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis.
AB  == toluene-treated cells of streptococcus bovis jb1 phosphorylated cellobiose, glucose, maltose, and sucrose by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. glucose phosphorylation was constitutive, while all three disaccharide systems were inducible. competition experiments indicated that separate phosphotransferase systems (enzymes ii) existed for glucose, maltose, and sucrose. [14c]maltose transport was inhibited by excess (10 mm) glucose and to a lesser extent by sucrose (90 and 46%, respectively). [14c]glucose and [14c]sucrose transports were not inhibited by an excess of maltose. since [14c]maltose phosphorylation in triethanolamine buffer was increased 160-fold as  the concentration of pi was increased from 0 to 100 mm, a maltose phosphorylase (km for pi, 9.5 mm) was present, and this activity was inducible. maltose was also hydrolyzed by an inducible maltase. glucose 1-phosphate arising from the maltose phosphorylase was metabolized by a constitutive phosphoglucomutase that was specific for alpha-glucose 1-phosphate (km, 0.8 mm). only sucrose-grown cells possessed sucrose hydrolase activity (km, 3.1 mm), and this activity was much lower than the sucrose phosphotransferase system and sucrose-phosphate hydrolase  activities.

TI  == factors affecting the rate of breakdown of bacterial protein in rumen fluid.
AB  == 1. the cellular proteins of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, lactobacillus casei, megasphaera elsdenii, selenomonas ruminantium and streptococcus bovis were labelled by growth in the presence of l-[14c]leucine, and the breakdown of labelled protein was measured in incubations of these bacteria with rumen fluid to which unlabelled 5 mm-l-leucine was added. the rate of protein breakdown was estimated from the rate of release of radioactivity into acid-soluble material. 2. protein breakdown occurred at different rates in different species. the mean rates for b. fibrisolvens, l. casei, m. elsdenii, sel. ruminantium and str. bovis were 28.6, 18.1, 17.7, 10.5 and 5.3%/h respectively in samples of strained rumen  fluid (srf) with different protozoal populations. rates of 3%/h or less were found in srf from ciliate-free sheep or in faunated srf from which protozoa had been removed by centrifugation. further removal of mixed rumen bacteria had little effect. suspensions of washed protozoa degraded bacterial protein at rates which were of the same order as those found in srf. 3. the rate of breakdown of bacterial protein in different samples of srf tended to increase as the numbers of small entodiniomorphid protozoa increased. the numbers of larger entodiniomorphs and holotrichs had no obvious influence on this rate. 4. autoclaved and u.v.-treated bacteria were generally no different from live bacteria in their susceptibility to breakdown in srf from faunated sheep, indicating that endogenous protein turnover was not a significant cause of bacterial protein catabolism. 5. the rate of bacterial protein breakdown was unrelated to the proteolytic activity of srf. 6. it was concluded that predation  by small protozoa is by far the most important cause of bacterial protein turnover in the rumen, with autolysis, other lytic factors and endogenous proteolysis being of minor importance.

AB  == twenty-seven quarters of 18 lactating dairy cows were inoculated intramammarily with 3.6 x 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu) of a strain of streptococcus uberis isolated from a cow with clinical mastitis. before quarters were inoculated, 22 were considered as naturally colonized with corynebacterium bovis, and 5 were considered bacteriologically negative. streptococcus uberis was isolated from all quarters within 2 days after inoculation, and all quarters developed clinical mastitis by 3 days after inoculation. mastitis was acute, and most cows had increased rectal temperatures. the number of somatic cells increased significantly (p less than 0.05), and milk production decreased significantly. in many cows, rectal temperatures remained increased, and str uberis was isolated from infected glands after intramammary and systemic antimicrobial treatments were given. a decreased number (110 cfu) of the same strain of str uberis caused  equally severe mastitis in 3 quarters colonized with c bovis and in 1 bacteriologically negative quarter in 2 cows. streptococcus uberis was isolated from all inoculated quarters, and all quarters developed clinical mastitis by 2 days after inoculation. two quarters colonized with c bovis and 2 bacteriologically negative quarters were inoculated once with 25 cfu and once with 240 cfu of a different strain of str uberis (atcc 27958). streptococcus uberis was never isolated from inoculated quarters, and changes in milk yield or  number of somatic cells were not observed.

TI  == a proposed mechanism of monensin action in inhibiting ruminal bacterial growth: effects on ion flux and protonmotive force.
AB  == streptococcus bovis, a gram-positive ruminal bacterium, was unable to grow in the presence of monensin. when monensin (5 mg/liter) was added to actively growing cultures, there was an immediate decrease in growth rate, and within 3 h no further growth was observed. glucose utilization and lactate production continued for another 8 h even though growth had ceased. monensin caused a decrease (p less than .05) in intracellular k+, a decrease (p less than .05) in intracellular ph and an increase (p less than .05) in intracellular na+. the net exchange of k+ for na+ and h+ via monensin was driven by the difference in concentration of k+ and na+ across the cell membrane. non-treated cells maintained a 70-fold gradient (inside higher) for k+, while the na+ gradient was only 2.7-fold (inside higher). previous models were based on a reverse mechanism whereby monensin would drive an efflux of na+ from ruminal bacteria, and were not supported by experimental measurements of intracellular na+ and k+.

TI  == growth inhibition of mastitis pathogens by long-chain fatty acids.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, and corynebacterium bovis were tested for sensitivity to long-chain fatty acids predominant in teat canal keratin. antibacterial activity of free fatty acids on  each bacterial species was measured after 12 and 24 h in chemically defined media. polyene c18:2 and c18:3 acids were bactericidal to each species at less than or equal to 10(5) ng/ml-1. the most bacteriostatic saturated fatty acids were c12 and c14. streptococcus agalactiae growth was inhibited more by fatty acids after 24 h than after 12 h. no incubation time effect on growth responses of other species was determined. polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate had a neutralizing effect on the bactericidal activity of polyene acids on c. bovis. corynebacterium bovis were unable to grow in synthetic media containing individual free fatty acids as the sole source of preformed fatty acids. a relationship between bacterial species commonly isolated from bovine teat canals  with resistance to fatty acids predominant in keratin was not evident.

TI  == ruminal microbial development in conventionally or early-weaned calves.
AB  == eight bull calves (four holsteins and four ayrshire calves with mean birth weight of 38.8 kg) were ruminally cannulated at 3 d of age and allocated to one of two weaning programs. all calves were fed colostrum for 3 d after birth and milk until weaning. calves in the conventional-weaning program were fed a starter diet from 3 d of age and weaned at 6 wk of age. in the early-weaning program, calves were fed a highly palatable pre-starter diet from 3 d of age until they consumed  227 g/d, and then fed a mixture of pre-starter (227 g) and starter diet ad libitum. calves in this group were weaned at 4 wk of age. ruminal samples were collected at 3 and 7 d, then weekly thereafter through 8 wk and at 10 and 12 wk of age to assess microbial activity. calves in the early-weaned group had a higher concentration of total ruminal volatile fatty acids at an earlier age than the calves in the conventional-weaning program. this was accompanied by a trend toward higher lactate concentrations and lower ruminal ph in the early-weaned group during their first 4 wk of age. lactate and ammonia concentrations decreased with calf age. the total anaerobic bacterial counts increased slightly  with calf age, whereas streptococcus bovis and facultative bacterial populations  decreased with calf age. amylolytic, proteolytic, lactobacilli, lactate-utilizers, cellulolytic and methanogenic bacterial populations increased  progressively in both groups. cellulolytic and methanogenic bacteria were present in both groups at 3 d of age. no protozoa were detected in calves of either group. in general, the most significant changes in bacterial populations and metabolic activity in both groups occurred between 4 and 6 wk of age. although calves in both groups had similar patterns of bacterial development, calves in the early-weaning program tended to have high ruminal microbial activity at an earlier age than the conventionally weaned calves.

TI  == human choriogonadotropin-like material in bacteria of different species: electron microscopy and immunocytochemical studies with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
AB  == immunocytochemical studies using antisera to whole human choriogonadotropin (hcg), to its alpha- and beta-subunits and to the cooh-terminal peptide of hcg beta, and two monoclonal antibodies to hcg beta, demonstrated expression of hcg-like material, its individual subunits and/or fragments in nine bacterial strains. seven of these were isolated from patients with cancer and were definitely identified as streptococcus faecalis (three strains), staphylococcus haemolyticus (two strains) and staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli (single strains). the other two strains were cell-wall-deficient (cwd) variants,  one identified as streptococcus bovis, isolated from the blood of a patient with  a fever of unknown origin and a possible brain abscess. the other was a gram-negative diphtheroid isolated from the urine of a pregnant woman, which during the period of study reverted to a gram-positive corynebacterium identified as a 'c. ulcerans' strain and expressed the hcg-like factor only during its phase as gram-negative diphtheroid. electron microscopy of these nine strains (including negative controls of strains of the same species subjected to the same immunocytochemical analyses and under identical cultural conditions) revealed morphological alterations in the bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic material and/or bizarre forms of reproduction in six of the nine strains expressing hcg-like material including the two cwd variants. collectively, these results provided evidence that (1) hcg-producing bacteria isolated from patients with overt cancer are not a new and unique species as claimed by others, and (2) there is a close resemblance between the bacterial protein and the human trophoblastic  hormone, based on immunochemical recognition of different parts of the hcg molecule.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == 1. bacteriological analysis revealed that 30% of quarters contained coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium bovis, or streptococci. 2. as involution progressed, somatic cell counts, percent protein, ph, and concentrations of serum albumin, lactoferrin, and immunoglobulin g increased while percent fat, concentrations of citrate, and the citrate to lactoferrin molar ratio decreased. 3. mammary secretion from infected quarters had significantly higher numbers of somatic cells, percent polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and ph, but lower percentage lymphocytes, fat, and lactoferrin concentrations compared to uninfected quarters. 4. results suggest intramammary infection altered normal secretion composition during bovine involution and lactogenesis. 5. lower levels of antibacterial components in bovine mammary secretion during the peripartum period may have reduced the natural defense potential of the gland.

TI  == seasonal changes in the cecal microflora of the high-arctic svalbard reindeer (rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus).
AB  == the dominant cecal bacteria in the high-arctic svalbard reindeer were characterized, their population densities were estimated, and cecal ph was determined in summer, when food quality and availability is good, and in winter,  when it is very poor. in summer the total culturable viable bacterial population  was (8.9 +/- 5.3) x 10(8) cells ml-1, whereas in winter it was (1.5 +/- 0.7) x 10(8) cells ml-1, representing a decrease to 17% of the summer population density. of the dominant species of cultured bacteria, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens  represented 23% in summer and 18% in winter. streptococcus bovis represented 17%  in summer and 5% in winter. bacteroides ruminicola represented 10% in summer and  26% in winter. in summer and winter, respectively, the proportion of the viable population showing the following activities was as follows: fiber digestion, 36 and 48%; cellulolysis, 10 and 6%; xylanolysis, 33 and 48%; and starch utilization, 77 and 71%. the most abundant cellulolytic species in summer was butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, representing 62% of the total cellulolytic population, and in winter it was ruminococcus albus, representing 80% of the total cellulolytic population. the most abundant xylanolytic species in summer was butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and in winter it was bacteroides ruminicola, representing 59 and 54% of the xylanolytic isolates in summer and winter, respectively. the cecal bacterial of the svalbard reindeer have the ability to digest starch and the major structural carbohydrates of the diet that are not digested in the rumen. the cecum in these animals has the potential to contribute very substantially to the digestion of the available plant material in both summer and winter.

TI  == phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of hexoses by ruminal bacteria: evidence for the phosphotransferase transport system.
AB  == six species of ruminal bacteria were surveyed for the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep)-dependent phosphorylation of glucose. selenomonas ruminantium hd4, streptococcus bovis jb1, and megasphaera elsdenii b159 all showed significant activity, but butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, bacteroides succinogenes s85, and bacteroides ruminicola b1(4) showed low rates of pep-dependent phosphorylation and much higher rates in the presence of atp. s. ruminantium hd4, s. bovis jb1, and m. elsdenii b159 also used pep to phosphorylate the nonmetabolizable glucose  analog 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-dg). rates of 2-dg phosphorylation with atp were negligible for s. bovis jb1 and m. elsdenii b159, but toluene-treated cells of s. ruminantium hd4 phosphorylated 2-dg in the presence of atp as well as pep. cell-free extracts of s. ruminantium hd4 used atp but not pep to phosphorylate glucose and 2-dg. since pep could serve as a phosphoryl donor in toluene-treated  cells but not in cell-free extracts, there was evidence for membrane and hence phosphotransferase system involvement in the pep-dependent activity. the atp-dependent phosphorylating enzymes from s. ruminantium hd4 and s. bovis jb1 had molecular weights of approximately 48,000 and were not inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate. based on these criteria, they were glucokinases rather than hexokinases. the s. ruminantium hd4 glucokinase was competitively inhibited by 2-dg and mannose, sugars that differ from glucose in the c-2 position. since 2-dg was a competitive inhibitor of glucose, the same enzyme probably phosphorylates both sugars. the s. bovis jb1 glucokinase was not inhibited by either 2-dg or mannose and had a higher km and vmax for glucose.

AB  == the ability of recombinant murine interferon-gamma (rmuifn-gamma) to activate murine macrophages with or without several biological response modifiers (brm), including synthetic muramyl dipeptide derivatives (mdps), was investigated. mouse peritoneal macrophages were activated by rmuifn-gamma alone to the cytostatic state, but not the cytolytic state. other brm as well as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps), including a lyophilized preparation of an attenuated strain of streptococcus hemolyticus, a cell wall skeleton of bacillus calmette-guerin and synthetic mdps, were highly active in generating the synergism with rmuifn-gamma. macrophages were endowed with the cytolytic activities by combinations of rmuifn-gamma and mdp-lys(l18); the combination of 100 u/ml of rmuifn-gamma with 10 ng/ml of mdp-lys(l18) was sufficient to induce cytolytic activities in macrophages. the synergism was observed when the macrophages primed with rmuifn-gamma were treated with lps or mdp-lys(l18), but not when the sequence of treatment was reversed. the cytotoxicity of macrophages  induced by rmuifn-gamma with mdp-lys(l18) was suppressed by priming with mdp-lys(l18). the suppressive effect was also observed by priming with lps in combinations of rmuifn-gamma and lps. the reason for the suppression of macrophage activation by priming with lps and mdp-lys(l18) is at present unknown.

TI  == comparison of the effect of antibiotic dry cow teat canal and intramammary dry cow therapy of dairy cows on the prevalence of teat canal and intramammary infections at calving.
AB  == the specific therapy of bacterial colonization of the teat canals of dried-off dairy cows by means of small amounts (33 mg/0.25 ml and 14 mg/0.1 ml) of a procain benzyl penicillin-dihydrostreptomycin sulphate combination has been investigated. of 36 teat canals treated with 0.25 ml antibiotic preparation each, 24 (66.6%) were infected at the beginning of the dry period, whereas at its termination only 7 (19.4%) showed bacteriologically positive swab cultures. by treating a further 43 quarters with 0.1 ml quantities of an antibiotic preparation each, the prevalence of infection dropped from 32.5% to 14%. untreated controls (20 quarters) showed no significant change. cultures of teat canal swabs were generally twice as sensitive for indicating the presence of bacteria compared to foremilk sample cultures. staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated organism, followed by streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium bovis and staphylococcus epidermidis.

TI  == [splenic abscess disclosing endocarditis].
AB  == a 54 year old man, hospitalised for thoraco-abdominal pain resulting from a septicemia which gives positive hemocultures for streptococcus d bovis, is diagnosed to have a splenic abscess which will require splenectomy. at the same time, an endocarditis develops and gets worse, with auriculo-ventricular blockade and, especially, major aortic insufficiency, which is the cause of death by a brutal and massive pulmonary oedema. in the progression of an endocarditis, the occurrence of a splenic abscess, primary localisation of the initial septicemia or the secondary of an arterial septic embolism, is a rare contingency compared to the frequency of splenomegaly or splenic infarction: less than 2 percent of the cases in the literature. this very atypical and exceptional case serves as a  reminder, on the one hand, of the diagnostic inadequacy of echocardiography which cannot visualise vegetation in the course of progressive endocarditis, and, on the other, of the prognostic importance of auriculoventricular blockade in septal and aortic endocardial lesions.

AB  == experimental challenge procedures were used to study infectivity and virulence of corynebacterium bovis. challenge procedures using staphylococcus aureus (newbould 305) and streptococcus agalactiae (mcdonald 44) were used to study effects of corynebacterium bovis infections on superinfection with major pathogens. rate of  infection under experimental challenge conditions was significantly greater with  corynebacterium bovis than previously observed for staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus agalactiae. principal location of corynebacterium bovis colonization appeared to the teat canal region, although the organism was isolated from 75% of the teat cisterns by puncture technique. quarters with corynebacterium bovis infections were more resistant to infection by staphylococcus aureus than bacteriologically negative quarters. quarters infected with corynebacterium bacterium bovis were approximately 8.5-fold more susceptible to streptococcus agalactiae infection than negative quarters. somatic cell counts were doubled in negative quarters that developed corynebacterium bovis infections; the geometric mean was 2.4 x 10(5).

TI  == antibiotic activity of an isocyanide metabolite of trichoderma hamatum against rumen bacteria.
AB  == a metabolite of trichoderma hamatum, 3-(3-isocyanocyclopent-2-enylidene)propionic acid, was tested for its effects on growth of and carbohydrate metabolism in 11 strains of functionally important rumen bacteria. to standardize the biological activity of this unstable metabolite, a rapid, aerobic disc diffusion assay was developed using escherichia coli atcc 11775. in an anaerobic broth dilution assay using a medium lacking rumen fluid and containing a soluble carbohydrate, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the metabolite which completely inhibited growth of the rumen bacteria for 18 h at 39 degrees c was generally less than 10  micrograms x ml-1; however, the minimum inhibitory concentrations for megasphaera elsdenii b159 and streptococcus bovis pe(1)8 were 10-25 and 25-64 micrograms x ml-1, respectively. in general, the gram-negative strains were more sensitive than the gram positive. the minimum inhibitory concentration for bacteroides ruminicola 23 grown with glucose was 1 micrograms x ml-1; for b. ruminicola ga33  (glucose), b. succinogenes s85 (cellobiose), and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 24 (maltose), it was 2 microgram x ml-1. when added to a cellulose-containing rumen  fluid medium, 1-4 micrograms x ml-1 of the metabolite delayed cellulose hydrolysis by b. succinogenes s85, ruminococcus albus 7, and r. flavefaciens fd1  for up to 4 days, and 6-7 micrograms x ml-1 prevented hydrolysis for at least 1 month. in the presence of the metabolite, the proportion of acetate produced from soluble carbohydrate by the majority of strains increased, but with some strains  net production of acetate decreased relative to production of other acidic fermentation products.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro growth of mastitis-associated streptococci in bovine mammary secretions.
AB  == cell-free, fat-free mammary secretions were tested in vitro for ability to support growth of streptococci associated with mastitis. secretions were obtained prior to drying off, during the dry period, at calving, and during lactation from four cow treatment groups. treatment groups were dry cow therapy, dry cow therapy and mammary glands subjected to induced inflammation 7 d post-drying-off, no dry  cow therapy and no induced inflammation, no dry cow therapy but mammary glands subjected to induced inflammation. growth of streptococcus uberis, streptococcus  faecalis, and streptococcus agalactiae in secretions from nonlactating glands was unaffected by induced inflammation. growth of streptococcus bovis was significantly inhibited in secretion obtained 14 d after induced inflammation. dry cow therapy had no effect on streptococcal growth in secretion obtained 7 d after therapy. streptococcal growth was greatest in secretions from involuted glands, and there was little or no evidence for growth inhibitory factors in cell-free, fat-free secretions obtained during the dry period. milk from lactating glands inhibited streptococcal growth, and the inhibitory factor was presumptively identified as lactoperoxidase. apolactoferrin, immunoglobulin, or both had little effect on streptococcal growth.

TI  == regulation of lactate production in streptococcus bovis: a spiraling effect that  contributes to rumen acidosis.
AB  == when streptococcus bovis was grown in batch culture with 6 g/l glucose at ph 6.7, maximum specific growth rate was 1.47 h(-1), and lactate was the primary fermentation product. in continuous culture at ph 6.7 and growth rate equal to .10 h(-1), little lactate was formed, and formate, acetate, and ethanol accounted for most of the product. when extra-cellular ph decreased to 4.7, intra-cellular  ph declined to 5.4, and organisms switched back to lactate production. intracellular concentration of fructose 1,6-diphosphate of batch culture cells was greater than 12 mm, a concentration that allowed maximal lactate dehydrogenase activity. when streptococcus bovis was grown in continuous culture  at ph 6.7, intracellular fructose-l,6-diphosphate declined to .4 mm, a concentration which gave little lactate dehydrogenase activity at ph 6.5 or greater. decreasing ph of continuous culture to 4.7 increased intracellular fructose-1,6-diphosphate concentration to .8 mm. this concentration was still limiting if lactate dehydrogenase was assayed at ph 6.5, but nearly maximal activity was obtained when enzyme was assayed at ph 5.5. the small increase in fructose-l,6-diphosphate and decreased requirement of lactate dehydrogenase for fructose-l,6-diphosphate under acidic assay conditions, accounted for increased lactate production during low ph (4.7) continuous culture. these and other aspects of lactate regulation by streptococcus bovis are discussed as factors leading to rumen acidosis. this pattern of regulation also helps to explain why rumen acidosis is difficult to reverse.

TI  == seasonal changes in the ruminal microflora of the high-arctic svalbard reindeer (rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus).
AB  == the dominant rumen bacteria in high-arctic svalbard reindeer were characterized,  their population densities were estimated, and ruminal ph was determined in summer, when food quality and availability are good, and in winter, when they are poor. in summer the total cultured viable population density was (2.09 +/- 1.26)  x 10(10) cells ml-1, whereas in winter it was (0.36 +/- 0.29) x 10(10) cells ml-1, representing a decrease to 17% of the summer population density. on culture, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens represented 22% of the bacterial population in summer and 30% in winter. streptococcus bovis represented 17% of the bacterial population in summer but only 4% in winter. methanogenic bacteria were present at 10(4) cells ml-1 in summer and 10(7) cells ml-1 in winter. in summer and winter,  respectively, the proportions of the viable population showing the following activities were as follows: starch utilization, 68 and 63%; fiber digestion, 31 and 74%; cellulolysis, 15 and 35%; xylanolysis, 30 and 58%; proteolysis, 51 and 28%; ureolysis, 40 and 54%; and lactate utilization, 13 and 4%. the principal cellulolytic bacterium was b. fibrisolvens, which represented 66 and 52% of the cellulolytic population in summer and winter, respectively. the results indicate  that the microflora of the rumen of svalbard reindeer is highly effective in fiber digestion and nitrogen metabolism, allowing the animals to survive under the austere nutritional conditions typical of their high-arctic habitat.

TI  == molecular genetics of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b  (mls) in streptococci.
AB  == resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (mls phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. genes coding for mls resistance are located on plasmids and one mls resistance transposon has been described. mls resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (mdal) that code either for mls or for both mls and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci  of groups a, b, c, d (streptococcus faecalis) and g. these plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). one smaller non-conjugative mls resistance plasmid has been isolated from str. sanguis (4.5 mdal). in group d (str. faecalis, str. faecium) streptococci, mls resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). these multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. the mls resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of str. faecalis, are located on  a transposon of 3.3 mdal, tn917. hybridization studies, with mls determinants as  probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne mls resistance sequences. elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including mls) in streptococci of groups a, b, c, d (str. bovis), f,  g, str. pneumoniae, str. mitis, str. sanguis and str. milleri. strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid dna. in some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. such elements, from str. pyogenes and str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.

TI  == comparison of single doses of amoxicillin or of amoxicillin-gentamicin for the prevention of endocarditis caused by streptococcus faecalis and by viridans streptococci.
AB  == recent recommendations for the prophylaxis of endocarditis in humans have advocated single doses or short courses of antibiotic combinations (beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside) for susceptible patients in whom enterococcal bacteremia might develop or for patients at especially high risk of developing endocarditis  (e.g., patients with prosthetic cardiac valves). we tested the prophylactic efficacy (in rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations) of single doses of amoxicillin plus gentamicin against challenge with various streptococcal strains  (two strains of streptococcus faecalis, one of streptococcus bovis, and three of  viridans streptococci); we then compared this efficacy with that of single doses  of amoxicillin alone. successful prophylaxis against all six strains was achieved with single doses of both amoxicillin alone and amoxicillin plus gentamicin. this protection, however, was limited, for both regimens, to the lowest bacterial-inoculum size producing endocarditis in 90% of control rats and was not extended to higher inocula by using the combination of antibiotics. we concluded  that a single dose of amoxicillin alone was protective against enterococcal and nonenterococcal endocarditis in the rat, but that its efficacy was limited and could not be improved by the simultaneous administration of gentamicin.

TI  == changing pattern of infective endocarditis.
AB  == there has been a significant trend toward an increase in the age of patients with endocarditis, and it seems likely that the age of these patients will continue to increase as the population ages. the proportion of patients with endocarditis who have rheumatic heart disease as an underlying lesion has decreased from about 40  percent in patients studied from 1950 to 1970 to about 25 percent in more recent  series, and this trend will probably continue. prosthetic valves and degenerative heart disease will undoubtedly become increasingly important underlying heart lesions in patients with endocarditis. another large group of patients with infective endocarditis have no diagnosable underlying heart disease and comprise  an increasing proportion of patients with endocarditis. because of the aging of the population, more streptococcus bovis and enterococcal endocarditis should be  expected. with more prosthetic valves and with the aging of the population, more  staphylococcal endocarditis should be anticipated. economic forces will probably  result in earlier discharge from the hospital, with either shorter courses of therapy or completion of therapy at home and perhaps more valve replacements.

TI  == bacteriological methods for distinguishing between human and animal faecal pollution of water: results of fieldwork in nigeria and zimbabwe.
AB  == bacteriological techniques have traditionally been used to detect faecal pollution of drinking water supplies. recently, methods have been developed to distinguish between human and animal faecal pollution in temperate climates. the  present study assessed the applicability and practicality of these methods in tropical countries. fieldwork in nigeria and zimbabwe has shown that animal faecal pollution can reliably be identified by the detection and enumeration of rhodococcus coprophilus using modified m3 agar, whereas human faecal contamination can be identified by the detection of sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria. each of these organisms was detected only in the faeces of the type (human or animal) that it was meant to indicate. although streptococcus bovis has been used in the past in mainly temperate countries to distinguish animal from human faecal contamination, the present study has shown that this organism is not a reliable indicator of animal pollution in the tropics because it was excreted by a proportion of the human population in both nigeria and zimbabwe. water sources known to be contaminated by human or animal excreta were  examined for these indicator organisms. the results correlated with the results obtained from examining human and animal faecal specimens for these organisms. the role of these bacteriological methods in water pollution control programmes is discussed.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

AB  == streptococcus bovis h13/1 was grown in a glucose-limited chemostat. a concomitant increase in dilution rate and glucose supply per unit time caused both an increase in lactate production per mole of glucose fermented and a linear increase in growth yield over the dilution rate range 0.052 to 0.141/h. when the  dilution rate was increased with no change in glucose supply per unit time there  was a reduction in lactate production and an increase in that of acetate and ethanol coinciding with a non-linear increase in growth yield. ymaxglu = 38.6 and a maintenance coefficient, ms = 0.290 mmol/l glucose/g cells/h were calculated. the results also suggested an interaction between the formate and co2 pools.

TI  == evaluation of a rapid latex agglutination test for identification of group d streptococci.
AB  == the serostat latex agglutination test (scott laboratories, inc., fiskesville, r.i.) for identification of group d streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group d streptococci (s. faecalis, 74; s. bovis, 24; s. durans, 3; s. faecium, 9) and 65  viridans streptococci (s. anginosus-constellatus, 2; streptococcus mg, 15; s. sanguis ii, 14; s. mitis, 7; s. mutans, 5; s. salivarius, 8; s. sanguis i, 8; s.  acidominimus, 1; s. morbillorum, 2; s. pneumoniae, 3). all strains of group d streptococci were bile-esculin positive. serostat reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of s. sanguisii and 1 strain of streptococcus mg (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 s. bovis, 8 s. faecalis, 1 s. durans, and 6 s. faecium strains (22.7% of all group d streptococci tested). when considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, serostat is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group d streptococci.

TI  == efficacy of an iodine backflush for preventing new intramammary infections.
AB  == efficacy of an iodine backflush system for reducing new intramammary infection was tested in two 11-wk trials. forty cows in each trial were paired by breed, age, stage of lactation, and intramammary infection status. each pair was assigned randomly either to a group milked with clusters that were reverse flushed with water, 25 ppm iodine, water and air or to a group milked with clusters receiving no backflush treatment between cows. backflushing clusters reduced infections caused by corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-positive staphylococci in both trials. however, backflushing clusters produced no clear advantage for reducing new infections with coagulase-negative staphylococci, gram-negative bacilli, or streptococci (species other than streptococcus agalactiae). no differences in somatic cell counts between experimental groups were observed. teat cup liners and teat ends were swabbed after 120 and 1200 milkings/liner. total microbial counts were significantly greater for liners that were not backflushed than from backflushed liners at each swabbing. however, no differences were significant between groups for mean teat end microbial counts in either trial.

TI  == compositions and characteristics of strains of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == streptococcus bovis strains jb1, 26, 581axy2, 21096c, and 45s1 grew on glucose, maltose, starch, sucrose, cellobiose, and lactose. none of these strains grew on  xylose or ribose, but arabinose was a suitable energy source for strains 2109c and k27ff4. all strains grew at 45 degrees c, but incubation at 50 degrees c prevented growth. growth was permitted in 2% sodium chloride, but 6.5% sodium chloride was inhibitory. doubling times ranged from 24 to 27 min, and final ph on glucose was approximately 4.6. none of the strains had a requirement for amino acids, and growth was rapid in media containing glucose salts and b vitamins. there was no ammonia production from arginine. all strains showed aminoendopeptidase activity, but there was considerable strain variation. strain  7h4, reported as streptococcus bovis, was noticeably different from the other six strains. it had a doubling time that was more than four times as long, and it grew poorly on starch or in the absence of an amino acid source. six-and-a-half percent sodium chloride was not inhibitory, and it produced ammonia from arginine. cell morphology was coccoid rather than ovoid. based on these criteria, classification of strain 7h4 as streptococcus bovis seemed doubtful. other experiments with strain 7h4 indicated that streptococcus bovis was devoid of diaminopimelic acid. in these experiments strain 7h4 contained significant diaminopimelic acid. the six streptococcus bovis strains all contained diaminopimelic acid as well, but concentration varied.

TI  == effect of media and blood on the antimicrobial activity of cephalosporins on serogroup d streptococci: a review.
AB  == the influence of culture medium on in vitro of selected cephalosporins on on group d streptococci was investigated by agar diffusion and broth dilution methods. the activity of cephalothin, cefamandole, and cefoperazone were not substantially influenced by the type of culture medium used, but cefuroxime, ceftizoxime, cefotaxime (ctx), cefmenoxime, and ceftriaxone varied markedly with  both the commercial brand and the blood content of the broth used. the differences were more likely to occur in some mueller-hinton media, particularly  when supplemented with 5% lysed sheep blood, and resulted in susceptible results  instead of the resistant results that were obtained with these same media without blood. some strains of streptococcus faecalis showed these discrepancies, but s.  bovis did not. the influence of the media on in vitro activity suggests a complex interaction between some cephalosporins, media components, and organisms. the cephalosporins that were affected by media share an identical moiety at the 7-acyl position (cefuroxime is slightly different); this structure is not shared  by those cephalosporins that were not affected, however. it is possible that this structure may play a part in the phenomenon.

TI  == behaviour of campylobacter sputorum subspecies mucosalis in gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  == gnotobiotic pigs were dosed orally with campylobacter sputorum subspecies mucosalis, either alone, or combined with rotavirus or non-pathogenic escherichia coli and streptococcus bovis to study the behaviour of c s mucosalis in defined conditions, to assess intracellular parasitism of enterocytes by c s mucosalis, and if possible to establish an experimental model of porcine intestinal adenomatosis. c s mucosalis colonised the gut of gnotobiotic pigs, persisting for up to 47 days after infection, but did not induce adenomatosis. despite evidence  of limited penetration of the mucosa up to two days after infection, the majority of c s mucosalis remained in the gut lumen. rotavirus did not enhance invasion of enterocytes by c s mucosalis. the presence of e coli and s bovis caused an increase in the total numbers of c s mucosalis in the gut, but did not affect their distribution. thus c s mucosalis was largely non-pathogenic in gnotobiotic  pigs.

TI  == isolation and identification of adherent epimural bacteria during succession in young lambs.
AB  == successive changes in aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts and changes in the generic composition of the epimural community in lambs from 1 to 10 weeks were determined. bacterial culture counts revealed a predominantly anaerobic community, with the mean anaerobic count being 1.4 x 10(7) cfu/cm2 of tissue surface. the aerobic count was highest at 1 week of age and declined significantly thereafter to a mean of 1.8 x 10(4) cfu/cm2, thus representing only 0.13% of the mean anaerobic count after week 1. of the 345 strains isolated anaerobically at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks of age, 47, 32, 12, 32, 2, and 5% were capable of growth in a partially reduced medium, indicating a reduction in the number of facultative anaerobes with time. the majority of isolated strains were identified as belonging to genera commonly isolated from rumen contents. in  some instances, however, strains did not correspond to previously described species, and some genera were present in proportions different from those expected in rumen fluid. at three of the sampling times, one genus was dominant,  constituting 45 to 55% of the isolates. these dominant isolates were streptococcus bovis, bacteroides sp., and an anaerobic streptococcus sp. for weeks 1, 2, and 10, respectively. during the transition period (weeks 4 to 8), two or more groups were codominant.

TI  == the uptake and utilization of entodinium caudatum, bacteria, free amino acids and glucose by the rumen ciliate entodinium bursa.
AB  == washed suspensions of entodinium bursa were incubated anaerobically with entodinium caudatum, ten species of bacteria and a yeast. the rate of uptake and  digestion of these micro-organisms was investigated. protozoa grown in vivo did not engulf proteus mirabilis or klebsiella aerogenes but rapidly took up bacillus megaterium. selenomonas ruminantium, torulopsis glabrata and streptococcus bovis, although only the last was digested with release of soluble material into the medium. protozoa grown in vitro engulfed each of the bacteria tested, taking up megasphaera elsdenii and proteus mirabilis most rapidly. individual bacterial species and mixed rumen bacteria were engulfed more rapidly (up to 20 times) by protozoa grown in vivo than those grown in vitro, although the latter digested over 80% of the b. megaterium, escherichia coli and p. mirabilis taken up. labelled ent. caudatum was extensively digested after engulfment by ent. bursa. some of the digestion products were released into the medium but individual amino acids were transferred as such from ent. caudatum protein to ent. bursa protein.  engulfed bacteria and polysaccharide granules were transferred intact from one protozoon to the other. free amino acids were also taken up intact from the medium into protozoal protein but there was little biosynthesis of amino acids from glucose. when available for engulfment ent. caudatum was quantitatively a much more valuable source of amino acids for protein synthesis by ent. bursa than free amino acids or bacteria.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of streptococcus bovis to six antibiotics.
AB  == a recent report of two isolates of streptococcus bovis resistant to killing by low levels of penicillin g prompted this study of the in vitro susceptibility of  100 clinical isolates of s bovis to six antibiotics. using a microdilution method, we found the minimum bactericidal concentrations for 99% of the isolates  to be as follows: penicillin g, 0.5 microgram/ml; methicillin, 16 micrograms/ml;  ampicillin, 0.5 microgram/ml; cephalothin, 2 micrograms/ml; clindamycin, 2 micrograms/ml; and vancomycin, 2 micrograms/ml. the high-level resistance of s bovis to penicillin g previously described was not seen. this study suggests that penicillin g can still prove effective in treating most infections caused by s bovis, including infective endocarditis, and that cephalothin and vancomycin are  useful alternative agents.

TI  == measurement of microbial alpha-amylases with p-nitrophenyl glycosides as the substrate complex.

AB  == quarter foremilk samples (1,574) were collected for bacteriological analysis from 40 cows during late lactation, early involution, prior to parturition, parturition, and during early lactation. six of 160 quarters were infected with major pathogens during late lactation. twelve new infections occurred during early involution. twenty-two quarters were infected at parturition. of these infections, 12 occurred after early involution, and 10 infections that originated during early involution persisted throughout the dry period. during early lactation, 21 major pathogen infections were observed. nine occurred after calving, and 12 persisted from parturition. most major pathogen infections (93.8%) were caused by coliforms and streptococcal species other than streptococcus agalactiae. numbers of streptococcal infections were highest at parturition and early lactation. numbers of quarters infected with coliforms were similar during early involution, parturition, and early lactation. coagulase negative staphylococcal infections increased during the dry period, whereas corynebacterium bovis infected quarters decreased. udder infections were few in cows completing first or second dry periods. the incidence of udder infection was highest in cows completing third or later dry periods.

TI  == within herd comparison of teat dipping and dry cow therapy with only selective dry cow therapy in six herds.
AB  == a within herd comparison of teat dipping and dry cow therapy (full treatment) with only selective dry cow therapy (partial treatment) was carried out in six commercial dairy herds for a two year period. in four herds, the incidence of clinical mastitis was 2 to 12 per cent higher in the partial treatment group. in  another herd, in which the pattern of clinical mastitis isolates was unusual in that minor pathogens were isolated from 30 per cent of mastitis cases, the incidence was 43 per cent higher in the partial treatment group. in the remaining herd the incidence was 10 percent higher in the full treatment group. streptococcus uberis mastitis was more common in the partial treatment groups of  five herds; coliform mastitis was more common in the full treatment groups of two herds and similar in both groups in the other herds. high rates of coliform mastitis were associated with poor herd environmental conditions but this was not true for strep uberis mastitis. rates of staphylococcus aureus and strep dysgalactiae mastitis were low in all herds. the level of major pathogen infection in cows completing the trial in all herds increased in the partial treatment group from 5 per cent of quarters at the start to 12 per cent at the finish of the trial. in the full treatment group, however, there was only a small increase in this level. in contrast, levels of corynebacterium bovis infection increased by 17 per cent in both treatment groups. continued use of teat dipping  and dry cow therapy was associated with a higher rate of coliform mastitis in two of the three herds where there were poor standards of hygiene and husbandry.

TI  == purification and properties of pyruvate kinase from streptococcus sanguis and activator specificity of pyruvate kinase from oral streptococci.
AB  == it was found that pyruvate kinases with two different regulatory characteristics  were distributed among oral streptococci. the pyruvate kinases of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus bovis were activated by glucose 6-phosphate, whereas the enzymes of both streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis were activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. pyruvate kinase  (ec 2.7.1.40) from s. sanguis nctc 10904 was purified, giving a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the enzyme had a molecular weight of 250,000 to 260,000 and consisted of four identical subunits.  whereas the pyruvate kinase from s. mutans was completely dependent on glucose 6-phosphate (k. abbe and t. yamada, j. bacteriol. 149:299-305, 1982), the enzyme  from s. sanguis was activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. in the presence of 0.5 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the saturation curves for the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and adp, were hyperbolic, and the km values were 0.13 and 0.30 mm, respectively. without fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, saturation curves for both substrates were sigmoidal. gdp, idp, and udp could replace adp. like the enzyme from s. mutans, the enzyme from s. sanguis required a divalent cation, mg2+ or mn2+, and a monovalent cation, k+ or nh4+, for activity, and it was strongly inhibited by pi. when the concentration of pi was increased, the half-saturating concentration and hill coefficient for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate  increased. the remarkable fluctuation of intracellular levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate observed in the cells growing under glucose limitation and nitrogen limitation implies that the intracellular concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, in cooperation with that of pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity in s. sanguis in vivo.

TI  == studies on the mechanism of intrinsic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in group d streptococci.
AB  == six penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) were detected in clinical isolates of each one of three group d streptococci: streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis and s. faecium. when examined in whole organisms, the pbps of s. faecium, the most penicillin-resistant species of group d streptococci, generally had lower affinities for the antibiotic than those of s. faecalis (intermediate penicillin  resistance), which in turn were of lower affinity than those of s. bovis (penicillin-sensitive). on the other hand, no quantitative correlation could be established between the binding of penicillin to any one pbp or group of pbps, and the penicillin mic value for the corresponding micro-organism. examination of the amounts of antibiotic bound and the rates of binding to pbps of equal numbers of protoplasts and whole bacteria of s. faecalis and s. faecium, indicated that there was no permeability barrier to benzylpenicillin in the cell walls of these  species. the lower antibacterial effectiveness of cephalothin compared with ampicillin in group d streptococci was paralleled by the higher concentrations of cephalothin needed in competition assays to inhibit the lower molecular size pbps of these bacteria.

TI  == the clinical significance of streptococcal species isolated from cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococci are often isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (csf); however, the significance of such isolates is poorly understood. in  order to clarify the clinical significance of isolating these organisms from csf, we did a retrospective analysis of 43 patients, from whom eight different species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci were recovered. eight patients (19%) had significant infections based on bacteriologic, laboratory, and clinical findings. significant infections were associated with s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. intermedius, s. faecalis, and s. bovis. thirty-five patient isolates (81%) from csf were considered as contaminants, with s. mitis being the most frequently isolated organism (49%). direct gram stain of csf sediment, csf glucose concentration, and csf cell differential were clearly abnormal in most patients with significant infections, in contrast to patients with streptococci isolated as contaminants. cultures of the lumbar puncture skin site yielded streptococci and other bacteria, suggesting a possible reservoir for contaminants.

TI  == detection and partial characterization of antibacterial factor(s) in alveolar lining material of rats.
AB  == intracellular killing of staphylococcus aureus by alveolar macrophages is known to be enhanced by exposure to alveolar lining material. because this material may have a role in pulmonary host defenses, we have studied its effect on pneumococci and other nonstaphylococcal organisms. alveolar lining material from rats caused  rapid killing and lysis of pneumococci. the antipneumococcal activity was localized to the surfactant-containing fraction of the fluid and was not affected by trypsin. phospholipid extracts of the surfactant fraction or purified lamellar bodies killed pneumococci. lysis of pneumococci by the surfactant fraction appeared to be mediated by a detergent-like activation of pneumococcal autolysin, in that bacteriolysis was prevented by substitution of ethanolamine for choline in pneumococcal cell walls, and a pneumococcal transformant that lacked autolysin was not lysed. the surfactant fraction readily killed pneumococci containing ethanolamine or the autolysin-defective transformant, and studies with tritiated  methyl-d-glucose loading and release showed that killing was associated with increased bacterial cell membrane permeability. bactericidal activity (without lysis) was observed with several nonpneumococcal gram-positive bacteria, including streptococcus viridans, unspeciated respiratory streptococci, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and bacillus species. purified diacylphospholipids had no antibacterial activity, however, a lysophospholipid, palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine, had many properties resembling the surfactant-containing fraction of lavage, including autolysin-mediated pneumococcal lysis, altered cell membrane permeability, and antibacterial activity against several gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == the ecology of the streptococci.
AB  == all species of streptococci are divided into several groups according to the ecological niches they occupy. members of the lactic acid group are found only in the plant environment and the dairy. members of the pyogenic group and the buccal and intestinal residents of the subthermophilic group are found in intimate association only with homeothermic hosts. members of the virulent pyogenic group, such asstreptococcus pyogenes, s. equi, ands. infrequens, are restricted to single hosts-the human, the horse, and the pig-whereas others, such ass. agalactiae can be found in several hosts. the intestinal dwellers of the subthermophilic group,s. bovis ands. equinus, occur in several animal species and are not isolated from other sources. the superficially homogeneouss. faecalis of  the "enteric" group may actually consist of a group specifically restricted to the human host, and of a second group distributed among wild animals, insects, and plants. the latter group differs from the human type by the ability to hydrolyze starch and to produce a rennin-proteolytic type of curd in milk.streptococcus faecium is widely distributed in both the homeothermic and poikilothermic environments, but no properties which differentiate the sources are known.streptococcus faecium biot.casseliflavus has been isolated only from insects and plants.streptococcus uberis occurs on the bovine lips and skin. unidentified streptococci from all environments vary widely in properties. many resembles. lactis, s. faecalis, ands. faecium.

TI  == influence of plant phenolic acids on growth and cellulolytic activity of rumen bacteria.
AB  == isolated rumen bacteria were examined for growth and, where appropriate, for their ability to degrade cellulose in the presence of the hydroxycinnamic acids trans-p-coumaric acid and trans-ferulic acid and the hydroxybenzoic acids vanillic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. ferulic and p-coumaric acids proved to be the most toxic of the acids examined and suppressed the growth of the cellulolytic strains ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and bacteroides succinogenes when included in a simple sugars medium at concentrations of >5 mm. the extent of cellulose digestion by r. flavefaciens and b. succinogenes but not r. albus was also substantially reduced. examination of rumen fluid from sheep maintained on dried grass containing 0.51% phenolic acids  showed the presence of phloretic acid (0.1 mm) and 3-methoxyphloretic acid (trace) produced by hydrogenation of the 2-propenoic side chain of p-coumaric and ferulic acids, respectively. the parent acids were found in trace amounts only, although they represented the major phenolic acids ingested. phloretic and 3-methoxyphloretic acids proved to be considerably less toxic than their parent acids. all of the cellulolytic strains (and streptococcus bovis) showed at least  a limited ability to hydrogenate hydroxycinnamic acids, with ruminococcus spp. proving the most effective. no further modification of hydroxycinnamic acids was  produced by the single strains of bacteria examined. however, a considerable shortfall in the recovery of added phenolic acids was noted in media inoculated with rumen fluid. it is suggested that hydrogenation may serve to protect cellulolytic strains from hydroxycinnamic acids.

AB  == experimental infections in root canals with streptococcus faecalis ss. liquefaciens (strep-mc4). actinomyces bovis (act-mc6) and bacteroides oralis (bact-mc3) were studied in four immunized and five nonimmunized monkeys. the immunization was performed using antigens of the homologous strains. the antibody level was checked by gel diffusion. in 56 root canals of the immunized animals and 60 root canals of the nonimmunized animals, viable cells of the three bacterial strains were enclosed in equal amounts of various combinations. after 6 months, samples from the root canals were subjected to qualitative and quantitative bacteriologic analyses and the apical area was radiographically and  histologically examined. the analyses revealed no significant difference between  the two groups of monkeys, although the viable cell recovery was slightly higher  in most of the root canals of nonimmunized monkeys. the cell proportion of the strains within the different bacterial combinations was equal in root canals of the two groups of animals. the radiographic and histologic examinations revealed  no significant difference between the two groups of animals regarding the number  of teeth with periapical lesions. the radiographic examination, however, showed a more distinct limitation of the process in the immunized than in the nonimmunized monkeys. histologically the lesions were more encapsulated and had a sparser cell infiltration in immunized than in nonimmunized monkeys. in the latter, inflammatory cells had often infiltrated the bone. mixed infections gave a more severe periapical reaction than single strain infections in both animal groups.

AB  == lasalocid, monensin or thiopeptin was administered intraruminally each at .33, .65 or 1.3 mg/kg body weight and evaluated for its effectiveness in preventing experimentally induced lactic acidosis in cattle. four rumen-fistulated cattle were used for each dosage level and the design was a 4 x 4 latin square with each animal receiving lasalocid, monensin, thiopeptin or no antibiotic. acidosis was induced by intraruminal administration of glucose (12.5 g/kg body weight). control cattle exhibited the typical drop in rumen ph and concurrent increases in l(+) and d(-) lactate concentrations commonly observed in cases of lactic acidosis. alkali reserves were depleted in the control cattle as evidenced by a decrease in blood bicarbonate and a negative shift in base excess. in all three trials, cattle given lasalocid had higher rumen ph and lower lactate concentrations than did control cattle or cattle given monensin or thiopeptin. cattle given monensin had a significantly higher rumen ph and a lower lactate concentration than the controls only at the .65 and 1.3 mg/kg body weight dosages, whereas thiopeptin was effective only at the 1.3-mg dosage. concentrations of total vfa in rumen fluid decreased in the controls but remained unchanged in cattle given antibiotics. a significant reduction in the molar proportion of acetate and an increase in the molar proportion of propionate were  observed in the rumen fluid of the cattle given antibiotics. colony counts of streptococcus bovis and lactobacillus were significantly reduced in rumen fluid of cattle given 1.3 mg antibiotic/kg body weight. counts of lactate-utilizing bacteria increased in both control cattle and cattle given antibiotics. cattle given antibiotics showed no evidence of lacticacidemia, hemoconcentration or change in acid-base balance.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == the association of remote streptococcus bovis bacteremia with colonic neoplasia.
AB  == we prospectively studied five patients with a remote history of streptococcus bovis bacteremia who had not previously been evaluated for colonic pathology. this study was prompted by several reports of concomitant neoplasia in patients with recent s. bovis bacteremia. the patients were studied at a mean of 32 months after bacteremia. despite the absence of other signs or symptoms suggestive of bowel disease, a negative test for occult blood in stool and a negative fecal culture for s. bovis, two patients were found to have neoplastic polyps of the colon. these findings suggest that the risk of colonic neoplasia in patients with remote s. bovis septicemia is similar to that found in patients with recent bacteremia, but evaluation of a larger group of these patients will be necessary  to establish this risk.

TI  == vancomycin therapy for infective endocarditis.
AB  == the use of vancomycin is increasing for the treatment of serious life-threatening staphylococcal and other bacterial infections, including infective endocarditis,  in patients who are allergic to the penicillins. the literature through 1978 reveals approximately 55 cases of infective endocarditis treated with vancomycin  alone or with combined antibiotic therapy. many of these 55 patients were treated by different clinicians, were given variable regimens of therapy, received other  therapy before vancomycin, had associated valve replacement; various amounts of data were provided for the reported cases. a summary of these reports indicates a cure in 48 (87%) of the 55 patients. recent in vitro and in vivo animal and patient data indicate that vancomycin alone or as part of combined therapy is bactericidal and curative in patients allergic to penicillin for infective endocarditis caused by staphylococci and streptococci-both enterococcal and nonenterococcal (streptococcus bovis and viridans group streptococci) infections. in this study, 10 patients with infective endocarditis were treated with vancomycin or combined therapy; seven were cured. five of the 10 patients with infective endocarditis caused by viridans streptococci were cured with combined vancomycin-streptomycin given in short-term therapy for two weeks.

TI  == the antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. stable l-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial l-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). streptococcus  pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus bovis, viridans group streptococcus, enterococcus, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species, and lactobacillus species. antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against s. aureus, s. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans streptococcus. the combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against s. aureus.

TI  == degradation of protein by mixed cultures of rumen bacteria: identification of streptococcus bovis as an actively proteolytic rumen bacterium.
AB  == mixed cultures of rumen bacteria were inoculated into anaerobic buffer solutions  containing mixed carbohydrates, casein and ammonia, and rates of bacterial growth, protein degradation, ammonia formation or utilization and lactate production were determined. bacterial growth rate was varied by the provision of  excess carbohydrate (one large dose at the onset of the incubation) or limited carbohydrate (small doses every hour or every 2 hr). when carbohydrate was limited, growth rate was slow, the extent of protein degradation was small and lactate did not accumulate in the fermentation vessels. lactate production and protein degradation were also negligible during the initial phases of the high carbohydrate, fast growth rate incubations, but large increases in each were seen after 3 hours. microscopic examination of the fast growth incubations revealed large numbers of small ovoid cells similar to streptococcus bovis, while tha slow growth incubations exhibited a variety of morophological types and very few small ovoid cells. because the lactic acid and morphological data suggested that proliferation of s. bovis might be responsible for rapid proteolysis, effects of  gram-positive antibiotics were examined. when compared against a fast growth control, both thiopeptin (5 ppm) and monensin (5ppm) were found to decrease protein degradation, but the inhibition by thiopeptin (50%) was greater than that by monensin (13%). the ratios of protein degraded to bacteria protein synthesized were .659, .362 and .628 for the control, thiopeptin and monensin treatments, respectively. actively proteolytic strains of s. bovis were isolated from fast growth incubations, and subsequent experiments showed that the ratio of protein degraded to bacterial protein synthesized was approximately 1.50. collectively, the data indicate that s. bovis is a very proteolytic rumen bacterium.

TI  == rumen bacterial competition in continuous culture: streptococcus bovis versus megasphaera elsdenii.
AB  == streptococcus bovis and megasphaera elsdenii were grown in continuous culture with maltose as the limiting substrate at dilution rates of 0.36, 0.22, and 0.12  h. after each steady-state turnover, the ph was decreased by adding concentrated  hcl to the medium reservoir. relative counts of the two species at each dilution  rate indicated that when the ph was high (6.6 to 6.0), higher dilution rates selected for a higher ratio of s. bovis to m. elsdenii. at intermediate ph (6.0 to 5.4), higher dilution rates once again selected for greater numbers of s. bovis in relation to m. elsdenii, but the increase in s. bovis numbers was much less at the 0.36-h dilution rate. decreasing the ph below 5.4 caused the ratio of s. bovis to m. elsdenii to increase greatly, and no m. elsdenii cells were seen below ph 5.1. the ratio of the two species could be explained by their relative affinities for maltose if ph was greater than 6.0, but the lower relative numbers of s. bovis in the 0.36-h, intermediate-ph (6.0 to 5.4) incubations could not. analysis of lactate production by s. bovis in pure culture showed that l-lactate  was produced only if the ph was less than 5.2 at dilution rates of 0.22 and 0.12  h and less than 6.0 at a rate of 0.36 h. the lower numbers of s. bovis relative to m. elsdenii in the incubations with a dilution rate of 0.36 h and intermediate ph thus could be explained by utilization of l-lactate by m. elsdenii. the very high numbers of s. bovis at ph less than 5.4 were consistent with the greater tolerance of this organism to low ph.

TI  == mannitol agar for microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis.
AB  == a medium containing mannitol (mannitol agar) was developed and evaluated as a tool for the microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis. mannitol agar supported  growth of all important bacterial mastitis pathogens (staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and pseudomonads) except corynebacterium pyogenes. color change around colonies in the agar permitted the differentiation of pathogenic from nonpathogenic staphylococci. most staphylococcus aureus strains and some staphylococcus epidermidis strains produced yellow zones. these yellow zone-producing strains (mannitol fermenters) of staphylococci were obtained from  quarters with significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) somatic cell counts (scc) in the milk, as compared with uninfected quarters and, therefore, would be considered pathogens. mannitol-negative strains of s epidermidis (those with red  zones) were obtained from quarters with scc similar to those of uninfected quarters. the streptococci could be divided into 2 groups on the basis of color change around the colonies: streptococcus agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, and group g streptococci produced red zones; str uberis, str bovis, and enterococci produced yellow zones. pathogenic streptococci (str agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, str uberis, and group g streptococci) were obtained from quarters with scc significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than those of uninfected quarters. streptococcus bovis and enterococci were obtained from quarters with scc similar  to those of uninfected quarters and were considered nonpathogenic. pathogenic streptococci were found in much higher concentration than nonpathogenic streptococci and could be differentiated on that basis.

TI  == isolation and presumptive identification of adherent epithelial bacteria ("epimural" bacteria) from the ovine rumen wall.
AB  == one hundred sixty-one strains of adherent bacteria were isolated under anaerobic  conditions from four sites on the rumen epithelial surface of sheep fed hay or a  hay-grain ration. before isolation of bacteria, rumen tissue was washed six times in an anaerobic dilution solution, and viable bacteria suspended in the washings  were counted. calculation indicated that unattached bacteria would have been removed from the tissue by this procedure, but a slow and progressive release of  attached bacteria also occurred. nevertheless, a wide range of characteristic morphological types remained associated with the epithelium as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. most of these types were represented among the isolates. characterization and presumptive identification of the isolates showed  that 95.0% belonged to previously described genera of functionally significant rumen bacteria, including butyrivibrio sp. (31.1%), bacteroides sp. (22.4%), selenomonas ruminantium (9.9%), succinivibrio dextrinosolvens (8.7%), streptococcus bovis (8.1%), propionibacterium sp. (4.3%), treponema sp. (3.1%), and eubacterium sp., lachnospira multiparus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.5%  each). eight isolates (5.0%) were not identified. l. multiparus was recovered only from hay-fed animals; all other genera were obtained from animals fed either ration. all s. bovis strains and two strains each of bacteroides sp. and butyrivibrio sp. were aerotolerant; all other strains were strictly anaerobic. bacteria representing the gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic flora associated with rumen wall tissue (r. j. wallace, k.-j. cheng, d. dinsdale, and e. r. orskov, nature (london) 279:424-426, 1979) were therefore not recovered by the techniques used; instead a different fraction of the adherent population was isolated. the term "epimural" is proposed to describe the flora associated with the rumen epithelium.

TI  == effects of lasalocid or monensin on lactate-producing or -using rumen bacteria.

TI  == studies on streptococci. i. distribution of fecal streptococci in man.
AB  == to understand the significance to the host of streptococci as part of the intestinal microflora, we first tried to investigate the distribution of human fecal streptococci on the species level. of the selective media compared, kmn agar was more effective than the other media for the isolation of streptococci from human feces. we made an effort to improve streptococcal classification. especially we used utilization of 1% pyruvate, 1% arginine, and 1% citrate for differentiation between streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium. in a tellurite tolerance test, s. faecalis was distinguished more clearly from s. faecium in the medium containing 0.16 or 0.32% tellurite. we devised methods of presumptive identification of fecal streptococci from the results of the characteristics of 1,442 isolates. these methods enabled us to identify many strains rapidly. different results in the distribution of species of streptococci between children and adults were observed. s. faecalis and s. faecium were isolated constantly from both groups. s. bovis and s. avium were isolated frequently from the feces of children. on the other hand, "viridans" streptococci, e.g. s. salivarius, s. mitis and s. mg-intermedius were present at a high frequency in, and no s. avium  could be isolated from, the feces of adults.

TI  == the isolation of streptococci from human faeces.
AB  == three selective media were designed for isolation of streptococci from faeces. samples of faeces from twelve normal adults were suspended and serially diluted in saline or broth saline, and equal volumes of each dilution were spread and incubated on the media. the number of colonies of each different type which developed was counted and one colony of each type was subcultured and identified. altogether, streptococci of 13 taxa were found. s. faecium, s. mutans, s. milleri, s. faecalis and s. mitior were each found in over half the samples. lancefield group b and g streptococci, s. bovis ii, an atypical strain of s. bovis i, s. cremoris, s. durans and a dextran-positive strain of s. mitior were each present in 1 or 2 samples. individual samples contained 2-7 (mean 4.6) streptococcal taxa, and total viable counts of streptococci of 3 x 10(3)-3 x 10(8) (geometric mean 7 x 10(5)) per g. the significance of these findings is discussed.

TI  == skin test reactivity and in vitro responses to microbes and microbial antigens.
AB  == in the present study the relationships between skin reactivity, leucocyte migration inhibitory factor (lif) production and lymphocyte transformation in healthy volunteers and newborns were investigated. lif synthesis was assessed by  the two-step agarose migration method and cellular proliferation by the incorporation of iododeoxyuridine. the following soluble antigens and whole microbes were used: purified protein derivative of tuberculin (ppd), bacille calmette-guerin (bcg), streptokinase-streptodornase (sk-sd), streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, group a, dermatophytin o (do) and candida albicans. the results indicated a significant correlation between skin reactivity and in vitro  tests with soluble antigens and that, of the in vitro tests used, lymphocyte transformation correlated better with skin test than lif production. furthermore, soluble antigens gave better correlations with skin tests than whole microbes. experiments with cord blood cells demonstrated that they did not respond to antigens but were activated by whole microbes. thus the whole microbes appear to  contain mitogenic components.

TI  == tumor-immunotherapeutic efficacy of serratia marcescens polyribosomes.
AB  == the ability of polyribosomes, obtained from several bacterial species, to suppress the development of cutaneous sad2 fibrosarcomas in dba/2 mice were evaluated. suppression of tumor appearance depended upon the tumor load at the time of treatment, dose of polyribosomes, and species source of polyribosomes, with serratia marcescens being superior to escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, mycobacterium bovis (pasteur), mycobacterium smegmatis, and propionibacterium acnes (formerly corynebacterium parvum). a single injection of  5 or 50 microgram of serratia polyribosomes at the tumor site 72 hr after the intradermal administration of 1.5 x 10(3) sad2 cells resulted in 66 to 95% survival. all untreated animals expired within 50 days. tumor suppression occurred at both flank and footpad sites. presensitization with polyribosomes and incorporation of polyribosomes into adjuvant were not required for the tumor-suppressive effect. treatment of serratia polyribosomes with rnase or pronase reduced the number of survivors. endotoxin was not detectable with the limulus amebocyte lysate assay.

TI  == control of wheat-induced lactic acidosis in sheep by thiopeptin and related antibiotics.
AB  == thiopeptin, thiopeptin-like antibiotics and penicillin were shown previously to be highly active in vitro against streptococcus bovis, the microorganism believed to be responsible for the initiation of ruminal lactic acidosis. the purpose of this work was to determine the efficacy of these antibiotics in preventing lactic acidosis in lambs challenged by intraruminal administration of ground wheat. lambs, which were fasted and then given ground wheat at 40 g/kg body weight, showed dramatic increases in rumen and plasma lactate over the 30-hr experimental period. rumen lactate increased from .2 to peak levels of approximately 150 mumoles/ml by 8 to 10 hr after wheat administration. plasma lactate increased after rumen lactate was elevated and lambs succumbed when plasma levels exceeded  15 mumoles/ml. ruminal volatile fatty acids were greatly reduced as rumen lactate increased. over half of the lambs given ground wheat died within 30 hours. thiopeptin given as a single dose completely prevented lactic acidosis by reducing rumen lactate 80 to 90%. in addition, thiopeptin permitted "normal" rumen fermentation to continue as indicated by a significant increase in volatile fatty acids. the minimum effective dose of thiopeptin to control acute lactic acidosis was .18 mg/kg body weight. other members of the thiopeptin class, including sulfomycin, sporangiomycin, siomycin and taitomycin, prevented lactic acidosis in a manner similar to thiopeptin. penicillin, however, inhibited ruminal volatile fatty acid production as well as lactate synthesis. in addition, the effective period for penicillin in the rumen was only 8 to 16 hr, after which lactate fermentation was reestablished. thus, thiopeptin and thiopeptin-like antibiotics, but not penicillin, appear to provide prophylactic treatment against lactic acidosis in sheep.

AB  == ninety-three episodes of culture-positive endocarditis occurred in 88 patients in the years 1970 to 1979. streptococci caused two-thirds of the cases, with streptococcus mitior and streptococcus sanguis most common. among the group d streptococci, streptococcus bovis was much more common than streptococcus faecalis. staphylococci accounted for a quarter of the episodes. streptococcal endocarditis was commonest in the elderly, whereas staphylococcal endocarditis occurred at all ages. degenerative heart disease was the underlying cardiac factor in nearly half the streptococcal cases, but staphylococci most often affected normal heart valves. when prosthetic valves were infected endocarditis of early onset was staphylococcal but that of late onset was streptococcal. narcotic abuse was a common cause of staphylococcal endocarditis, second only to  surgical wound infection following valve replacement. streptococci affected the mitral and aortic valves equally but the staphylococci more usually involved mitral or tricuspid valves. the overall mortality was 36 per cent but was much higher for staphylococcal than streptococcal endocarditis.

TI  == mutagenic activation of an antischistosomal drug by enteric streptococcus sps in  vitro and in vivo.
AB  == previous studies have shown that a new antischistosomal drug, 4-isothiocyano-4'-nitro diphenylamine (cgp 4540, amoscanate), is not mutagenic in vitro, but the urines of animals treated with this drug have mutagenic activity.  mutagenicity can be eliminated by coadministration of some antibacterial agents and is not demonstrable in germ-free animals. the present study describes attempts to isolate and identify intestinal microorganisms responsible for the mutagenic activation of amoscanate. streptococcus equinus, isolated from the intestinal tract of mice, as well as some other species of streptococcus, were found to produce mutagenic activation of amoscanate when introduced into animals  pretreated with antibacterial agents. similarly, incubation of these strains with amoscanate in vitro resulted in the formation of a mutagenic product.

TI  == streptococcus bovis meningitis in a neonate.

AB  == runoff from a cow-calf pasture in eastern nebraska was monitored for total coliforms (tc), fecal coliforms (fc), and fecal streptococci (fs) during 1976, 1977, and 1978. bacteriological counts in runoff from both grazed and ungrazed areas generally exceeded recommended water quality standards. the fc group was the best indicator group of the impact of grazing. rainfall runoff from the grazed area contained 5 to 10 times more fc than runoff from the fenced, ungrazed area. there was little difference in tc counts between the two areas, but fs counts were higher in runoff from the ungrazed area and reflected the contributions from wildlife. recommended bacteriological water quality standards, developed for point source inputs, may be inappropriate for characterizing nonpoint source pollution from pasture runoff. the fc/fs ratio in pasture runoff  was useful in identifying the relative contributions of cattle and wildlife. ratios below 0.05 were indicative of wildlife sources and ratios above 0.1 were characteristic of grazing cattle. occasions when the fc/fs ratio of diluted cattle waste exceeded one resulted from differential aftergrowth and die-off between fc and fs. the fc/fs ratio and percentage of streptococcus bovis in pasture runoff are useful indicators for evaluating the effectiveness of livestock management practices for minimizing bacterial contamination of surface  water. the importance of choice of medium for the enumeration of fs in runoff derived from cattle wastes is discussed.

AB  == the adherence of 18 strains of streptococci to sections of normal canine and human aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves and to canine interatrial septum was compared in an in vitro system. quantitative measurements of adherence ratios were performed by two independent methods. adherence ratios for streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. bovis, and group d streptococci were higher (0.0058-0.0101) than for the other streptococcal strains studied (0.0025-0.0041). with the exception of group d streptococci, adherence ratios for each bacterial strain were similar with the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valve sections. adherence ratios with normal human and canine valve leaflets were similar, but adherence ratios with interatrial septum were lower than with normal valve sections. adherence ratios for glucan-positive and glucan-negative strains of streptococci with normal and with damaged aortic valve leaflets were also compared. the adherence ratios of the glucan-positive streptococci (s. mutans, s. sanguis, and s. bovis) and one glucan-negative enterococcal strain (kg-3) were approximately five times higher with damaged aortic valves (0.039-0.051) than with normal aortic valves (0.009-0.010). for glucan-positive strains, adherence ratios with normal aortic leaflets were similar when bacteria were grown in media which contains or lacks sucrose. in striking contrast, growth of the glucan-positive strains in medium which lacks sucrose, with resultant deficiency  of glucan production, decreased the adherence ratios with damaged aortic valve leaflets to those found with normal aortic leaflets. treatment of glucan-positive strains with dextranase resulted in a decrease in their adherence ratios to levels seen with bacteria grown in medium lacking sucrose, but the higher adherence ratios could be restored in the presence of exogenous dextran.it is concluded that glucan production is one quantitatively important factor that contributes to the greater adherence of glucan-positive streptococci to damaged rather than to normal aortic heart valve leaflets. however, glucan production is  not the only factor that determines preferential adherence of streptococci to damaged heart valves, because glucan-negative strains may also show some degree of increased adherence to damaged valves. thus, bacterial glucan production is one of the factors that could contribute to the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == immunological method to differentiate between antigens of tubercle bacilli, other mycobacterial species, and non-acid-fast bacteria.
AB  == sera from rabbits immunized with sonicates of mycobacterium bovis bcg were passed through an immunoadsorbent made of a soluble bcg extract to make partially purified antibodies to bcg. these antibodies were in turn used to prepare an immunoadsorbent through which the bcg extract was passed. the partially purified  antigenic material was radiolabeled and subjected to electrophoresis in acrylamide gels. one of the radiolabeled fractions isolated (bcg-c) was found to  bind to antibodies to bcg and h37rv, but not to antibodies in sera from rabbits immunized with other mycobacterial species or nocardia asteroides. the reaction between bcg-c and the partially purified antibodies to bcg was inhibited by small amounts of different bcg antigens. cultures obtained from 25 patients with tuberculous diseases, other bacterial cultures, and various bacterial extracts were tested for their capacity to inhibit this reaction. each of 13 mycobacteria  identified as m. tuberculosis inhibited this reaction. equivalent numbers of 12 strains of mycobacteria other than m. tuberculosis and high concentrations of other bacterial extracts did not inhibit, indicating that determinants of bcg present in m. tuberculosis were not detected in the other mycobacteria or in non-acid-fast bacteria. the use of sequential purification procedures could be of potential clinical value in quickly differentiating between m. tuberculosis and a variety of other mycobacteria.

AB  == attention has recently been drawn to the association of digestive carcinoma and streptococcus bovis endocarditis. the authors studied 130 records of patients with endocarditis and an association with a digestive tumour (3 neoplasms, one villous tumour) was found in four. streptococcus bovis was demonstrated in one case, streptococcus faecalis in two and streptococcus durans in one. the association of carcinoma and subacute endocarditis would thus seem to not solely  relate to digestive commensual organisms. the question of common factors favourising carcinoma and endocarditis is raised.

TI  == treatment of bacterial endocarditis with vancomycin.
AB  == five patients with bacterial endocarditis who were allergic to penicillin were treated successfully with vancomycin. the causative microorganisms were streptococcus bovis, s faecalis, s agalactiae, s intermedius, and staphylococcus  aureus. except for the strain of s faecalis, vancomycin was bactericidal against  these organisms at easily achievable serum concentrations. to insure a bactericidal serum titer of 1:8 or greater, streptomycin was added in the therapy of the case caused by s faecalis. there was no toxicity from vancomycin therapy in our patients except for mild phlebitis at the infusion site. vancomycin appears to be an effective alternative to penicillin in individuals with endocarditis due to susceptible organisms. vancomycin in combination with an aminoglycoside may be appropriate therapy for enterococcal endocarditis.

AB  == we have studied the ability of various bacteria to stimulate human lymphocytes to produce leukocyte migration inhibitory factor (lif). mononuclear cells from adult and cord blood as well as purified t and b lymphocytes were stimulated with killed bacteria. the culture supernatants were tested for the presence of lif by  the agarose migration method. all nine bacterial strains tested activated unseparated mononuclear cells and b lymphocytes but not t cells to produce lif. lif was also present in cord blood cell cultures suggesting that the stimulation  of lymphocytes was polyclonal rather than antigenic. therefore, we propose that one of the physiologic functions of b lymphocyte lymphokines might be to form part of the nonspecific defense mechanisms against microbial invasion.

TI  == infective endocarditis caused by streptococcus bovis resistant to the lethal effect of penicillin g.
AB  == penicillin g alone is generally recommended for the treatment of infective endocarditis caused by streptococcus bovis because clinical isolates of s bovis are represented as being uniformly and markedly susceptible to penicillin g. however, two strains of s bovis recovered from two patients with bacterial endocarditis were resistant to the lethal effect of penicillin g. combination therapy, cefazolin sodium and gentamicin sulfate in patient 1 and penicillin g and gentamicin in patient 2, was necessary; synergy, as manifested by lethal activity against the infecting strains, was demonstrated in the laboratory. we stress the need to determine the minimal lethal concentration of penicillin g for clinical isolates of s bovis. until such information is available, particularly in life-threatening infections, combination drug therapy, consisting of an aminocyclitol added to a beta-lactam antimicrobic, should be used.

TI  == effects of heavy metals and other trace elements on the fermentative activity of  the rumen microflora and growth of functionally important rumen bacteria.
AB  == the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of essential and non-essential trace elements were tested on the rumen microflora using the rate of fermentation in vitro as the assay. the elements (and the concentration causing 50% inhibition) in decreasing order of toxicity were hg2+ (20 microgram/ml), cu2+ (21 microgram/ml), cr6+ (70 microgram/ml), se4+ (73 microgram/ml), ni2+ (160 microgram/ml), cd2+ (175 microgram/ml), as3+ (304 microgram/ml) and as5+ (1610 microgram/ml). the elements tested that were either weak or noninhibitory at concentrations greater than 400 microgram/ml included zn2+, cr2+, fe2+, mn2+, pb2+, and co2+. methylmercury was as inhibitory as mercuric chloride to the fermentation. when the inhibitory effect of cd2+ was tested on separated bacterial and protozoal fractions, it was more inhibitory to the bacteria. the inhibitory effects of trace elements were also determined for a number of axenic  cultures of rumen bacteria. the bacteria which most frequently exhibited the greatest sensitivity were bacteroides succinogenses, ruminococcus albus, bacteroides amylophilus, and eubacterium ruminantium. those often exhibiting intermediate sensitivities included butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, selenomonas ruminantium, and megasphera elsdenii, while streptococcus bovis was very refractory to all elements tested. rumen fluid provided a modest protective effect for the bacteria.

AB  == potassium tellurite media gave the highest detrimental effects on the generation  number of all tested faecal streptococci species. this applies to all investigated vehicles. however, drastic tellurite effects became more conspicuous with certain vehicles than with others. this is particularly true with acid and alkaline foods and water, especially with strains like streptococcus bovis, str.  faecium, and str. durans. again, tellurite becomes more influencial with regard to old cells rather than young cells in the logarithmic phase. on the other hand, the use of thallous acetate as a concentration agent secured better results than  either the tellurite or azide almost with all tested vehicles. yet, sodium azide  may be regarded as holding an intermediate position between tellurite and thallous acetate in terms of vehicles, streptococcus species, and age of pollution. a lower number of generation resulted with all tested faecal streptococci species, using liquid media bearing more than one concentrating agent. this applied to water and milk examination.

AB  == the gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. although there was a significantly higher count of escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. there were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. lactobacillus fermentum, l. acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius, s. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. l. fermentum  and s. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. the weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there  may be gastric stasis. the gastric ph was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of  age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. in weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between ph and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and  also a positive correlation between ph and number of e. coli. these correlations  suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in  the regulation of gastric ph in weaned pigs. three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting hcl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, ph  < 3.5). in sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. in weaned scouring pigs there was  a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. there was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.

TI  == infective endocarditis caused by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == members of the viridans group of streptococci are the commonest causes of bacterial endocarditis. however, streptococcus mutans, a member of this group associated with dental caries which might be expected to be commonly associated with endocarditis, has only rarely been reported. this is possibly because of difficulties in isolation and identification. differing blood culture media may affect the chances of isolation of these organisms, and, though brain-heart infusion, thiol, tryptic soy, and glucose-brain infusion broths have all proved satisfactory, subcultures may require increased co2 concentrations for growth. plemorphism in the resultant colonies and in the individual organisms may give rise to a hazardous misinterpretation of this appearance as contamination. strep. mutans and the similarly penicillin sensitive strep. bovis may be differentiated  from the penicillin resistant enterococci by their lincomycin sensitivity and intolerance of 6-3 per cent sodium chloride. precise differentiation of streptococci in bacterial endocarditis is of value both epidemiologically and in  the management of the disease.

AB  == streptococcal endocarditis has been well recognized for decades and over the years investigators at the new york hospital have defined many of the diagnostic  and therapeutic modalities currently employed in patients with this disease. in this study, speciation of the viridans streptococci has provided new insights into the relative frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of these organisms. indeed, recent studies also suggest that s. milleri endocarditis is associated with a high incidence of suppurative complications and that patients with s. bovis endocarditis may have a significant incidence of underlying but asymptomatic lower gastrointestinal malignancies. further studies correlating viridans streptococcal species with other clinical and laboratory parameters of endocarditis should provide additional insights into this disease.

TI  == enhancement of antileukemic effect in combination of 5-fluorouracil and ok-432.
AB  == ok-432, a streptococcal preparation with potent antitumor activity, has been evaluated for its efficacy in experimental and clincal trials. this preparation,  however, was ineffective against mouse l1210 leukemia in all treatment schedules. the results of this study indicate that treatments with ok-432 and nucleic acid antimetabolites, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-fu), exert a synergistic effect against l1210 leukemia probably in conjunction with the immunologic defenses of the host. this therapeutic synergism was to some extent dependent on the dose level of 5-fu and was not produced against the 5-fu-resistant l1210 subline. in mice pre-treated with ok-432 prior to the leukemia implantation, there was no synergistic effect as a result of post-treatment with 5-fu. when bdf mice had previously received x-ray irradiation or administration of corticosteroids, the synergism could not be expected either. comparative combination therapy with bcg  or group c streptococcus resulted in failure to produce therapeutic synergism in  this system.

TI  == tetrahydrofolate-dependent biosynthesis of ribothymidine in transfer ribonucleic  acids of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == trimethoprim, an inhibitor that prevents tetrahydrofolate-dependent transmethylation reactions inbacteria, was used in a comparative study to discriminate between two possible biosynthetic pathways, either the s-adenosylmethionine or the tetrahydrofolate-dependent formation of ribothymidine (rt) in transfer ribonucleic acids (trna's) of several strains of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. rt-deficient trna's accumulate in trimethoprim-treated gram-positive streptococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus,  corynebacterium bovis, arthrobacter albidus, and all examined bacillaceae, except bacillus stearothermophilus. the rt-deficient rt-deficient trna's accept the methyl moiety from s-adenosylmethionine in vitro, with extracts from escherichia  coli (wild type) as a source of methylating enzymes; 90% of the incorporated methyl groups are present in rt. trimethoprim does not inhibit the biosynthesis of rt in trna of gram-negative enterobacteriaceae, rhizobium lupini, and pseudomonadaceae, suggesting that the rt-specific trna methyltransferases of these gram-negative strains use s-adenosylmethionine as coenzyme.

TI  == streptococci and aerococci associated with systemic infection in man.
AB  == a collection of 820 isolates of streptococci and aerococci from human blood or internal organs was classified by means of a set of cultural and biochemical tests. of these, 719 (712 streptococci and 7 aerococci) were from patients believed to be suffering from a systemic infection: endocarditis 317; a purulent  lesion in an internal organ ("purulent disease") 152; bacteriaemia 250. the endocarditis streptococci included members of all recognisable taxa, but only certain of these were common: streptococcus sanguis, 16-4%; dextran-positive and  usually mannitol-fermenting strains of s. bovis (s. bovis i), 15-1%; s. mutans, 14-2%; s. mitior, 13-2%. streptococci of the "alpha-haemolytic" taxa (s. sanguis, s. mitior and related strains) formed only 44-8% of the total. when the percentage frequency of streptococcal taxa among the endocarditis and "non-endocarditis" isolates was compared, the dextran-forming taxa (s. mutans, s. bovis i, s. sanguis, and dextran-positive streptococci otherwise resembling s. mitior) all had higher "endocarditis : non-endocarditis" ratios than did any of the non-dextran-producing taxa. endocarditis increased in frequency with age, and showed an excess of males over females up to the age of 65 years. in young patients (less than 35 years), "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci predominated; with increasing age, the proportion of other streptococci increased progressively but  the absolute numbers of isolations of "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci did not fall. infections with s. mutans were prominent in the age-group 35-54 years and with s. bovis i at ages greater than or equal to 55 years. a history of previous  heart disease was more often obtained in endocarditis due to "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci than in other streptococcal endocarditis. the streptococcus most often isolated from purulent lesions in internal organs was s. milleri (29-3%). it was associated with brain abscess, meningitis, pleural empyema and a variety of intra-abdominal abscesses. the only common predisposing factor in endocarditis was previous heart damage. in other systemic streptococcal diseases, other general or local predisposing causes could be observed, mainly in infections with the "pyogenic" groupable streptococci, the enterococci and s. milleri.

AB  == forty-eight strains of streptococcus bovis were tested for induction with mitomycin c. eleven inducible strains were found and the lysates of all 11 contained bacteriophage-like particles. the lysate of one strain also contained large numbers of particles which closely resembled polyheads. eight of the lysates produced zones of inhibition on indicator strains and viable bacteriophages were detected in six lysates. the sources of the s. bovis were ovine and bovine rumen fluid (23 strains), ovine and bovine feces (5 strains), blood cultures from human endocarditis (8 strains), and a wide variety of other sources (12 strains). only 1 of 23 rumen s. bovis strains was lysogenic, which suggests that lysogenic s. bovis strains are not an important source of bacteriophages in the rumen.

TI  == effects of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on cross walls of cocci.
AB  == cultures of staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and streptococcus bovis were incubated on membrane filters on agar containing antibiotics at one-third to one-fourth the minimal inhibitory concentration for the particular bacterial strain. s. aureus was grown in the presence of oxacillin, cephaloridine, or lincomycin. n. gonorrhoeae and s. bovis were grown in the presence of penicillin. the membranes were then incubated in drug-free agar, after which viability was determined and the cells were examined by electron microscopy. s. aureus exposed  to oxacillin and cephaloridine grew into cells two to seven times larger than normal that contained thick multiple cross walls. s. aureus exposed to lincomycin grew into cells 1.5 to 2 times larger than normal, with multiple thick cross walls and periheral cell walls twice the normal thickness. n. gonorrhoeae cells exposed to penicillin were slightly larger than normal and had cross walls that were up to eight times thicker than normal. after transfer to drug-free agar, cells became smaller, and some normal organisms could be seen. s. bovis incubated in the presence of penicillin grew into filaments that contained no cross walls.  two hours after the return to drug-free agar, filaments with cross walls as well  as normal cells were observed. exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin did not affect the growth of the peripheral cell wall of s. aureus, n. gonorrhoeae, or s. bovis, but appeared to inhibit lysis of cross walls in s. aureus and n. gonorrhoeae and to inhibit the synthesis of cross walls in s. bovis; that is, the rates of peripheral and cross wall formation differed in their susceptibility to penicillin. these facts suggest that peripheral growth and cross wall formation in cocci are separable processes.

TI  == frothy feedlot bloat in cattle: production of extracellular polysaccharides and development of viscosity in cultures of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == streptococcus bovis was cultured in a synthetic medium with three concentrations  of sucrose. initial viscosity of the media was 1.5 centipoise (cp). after incubation for 8 h, the viscosity of the medium with 0.5% sucrose was unchanged,  that with 3% sucrose had increased to 8 cp, and that with 6% sucrose to 112 cp. similar results were found with a rumen fluid medium. a slimy material, responsible for increased viscosity of these cultures, was digested by dextranase. the material appeared as a complex system of intercellular fibers when viewed under the electron microscope after freeze-etching. with proteins and other polymers released from lysed bacteria, this slimy material may contribute directly to increased viscosity and foam formation. in addition to these intercellular fibers, each cell was surrounded by a fibrous capsule that was not  digested by dextranase. this capsule stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate, but not with ruthenium red. the amount of capsular material produced was similar whether the media contained 0.5, 3.0, or 6% sucrose.

TI  == streptoccus mutans dextransucrase: purification, properties, and requirement for  primer dextran.
AB  == we attempted to purify dextransucrase from s mutans strain 6715 to investigate its properties and determine if multiple species of the enzyme existed. it was concluded that the properties of this enzyme such as the ph (5.5), temperature (37 c) optimum, and km for sucrose (3 mm) are very similar to those reported for  s sanguis, s bovis, s mutans strain omz-176 isozymes, s mutans strain gs-5, and the single dextransucrase purified from s mutans strain hs-6. the ief enzyme preparation consisted of two enzyme species, possibly differing in their ability  to synthesize different dextran linkages. the minor enzyme activity demonstrated  a strict primer dependency. similarly, primer dependency has been reported for dextransucrases from s mutans, s sanguis, and l mesenteroides. s mutans strain 6715 dextransucrase also showed both the insertion and stepwise mechanisms for dextran synthesis. sucrose was the sole glucose donor, whereas dextran was a specific, highly efficient glucose acceptor. the complex primer kinetics are not  fully understood at this time and require further investigation. without linkage  analysis of the products of our enzymes, we can only postulate that each enzyme has a different function in the synthesis of interresidue and interchain alpha1-3 and alpha1-6 bonds. insoluble dextran synthesis may involve a special enzyme mechanism characteristic of s mutans. this synthesis would require both enzymes,  possibly in some aggregated form, with one enzyme synthesizing endogenous primer  dextran. this endogeneous primer or some cell wall polysaccharide could stimulate both enzymes to rapidly synthesize heterogeneously linked insoluble dextran.

TI  == regulation of lactate dehydrogenase and change of fermentation products in streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus mutans jc 2 produced mainly lactate as a fermentation product when  grown in nitrogen-limited continuous culture in the presence of an excess of glucose and produced formate, acetate, and ethanol, but no lactate, under glucose-limited conditions. the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) in these cultures were of the same order of magnitude, and the activity of ldh was completely dependent on fructose-1,6-diphosphate (fdp). the intracellular level of fdp was high and the level of phosphoenolpyruvate (pep) was low under the glucose-excess conditions. in the glucose-limited cultures, all glycolytic intermediates studied, except pep, were low. s. mutans fil, which had an fdp-independent ldh and similar levels of glycolytic intermediates as s. mutans jc2, produced mainly lactate under glucose-excess or under glucose-limited conditions. ldh of streptococcus bovis atcc 9809 was dependent on fdp for activity at a low concentration of pyruvate but had a significant activity without fdp at a high concentration of pyruvate. this strain also produced mainly lactate both under glucose-excess and glucose-limited conditions. the levels and  characteristics of these ldhs were not changed by the culture conditions. these results indicate that changes in the intracellular level of fdp regulate ldh activity, which in turn influences the type of fermentation products produced by  streptococci. pep, adenosine 5'-monophosphate, adenosine 5'-diphosphate, and inorganic phosphate significantly inhibited ldh activity from s. mutans jc 2 and  may also participate in the regulation of ldh activity in other streptococci.

AB  == seventy-four strains of streptococcus bovis and 35 strains of enterococci (streptococcus faecalis and its varieties, streptococcus faecium and streptococcus durans), most of which were isolated from patients with endocarditis, were tested for their susceptibility to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, cephalothin, vancomycin, methicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, and gentamicin. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined by a microtiter broth dilution technique. all of these organisms are group d streptococci, but the s. bovis strains are not enterococci. on the basis  of both mic and mbc, the s. bovis strains were much more susceptibile in general  to antibiotics then were the enterococcal strains. for the s. bovis strains, the  lowest mics were obtained with penicillin, ampicillin, and erythromycin, and the  lowest mbcs with penicillin and ampicillin. although these antibiotics were also  the most active against the enterococci, the mics and mbcs were much higher than  obtained with the s. bovis strains. gentamicin was the most active aminoglycoside. on the basis of in vitro susceptibility results, the s. bovis strains resemble the viridans streptococci rather than enterococci.

TI  == shared antigens between heterologous bacterial species.
AB  == sera from normal rabbits were shown to have antibodies that bound radiolabeled test antigens derived from many taxonomically unrelated bacteria. sera from rabbits that had been immunized with sonically treated material of 12 different bacteria, including m. bovis strain bcg, had antibodies that bound not only radiolabeled homologous test antigens but also radiolabeled antigens from many unrelated bacteria. binding by normal and immunized sera to radiolabeled test antigens was inhibited by homologous unlabeled test antigens but not by substances such as bovine serum albumin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sheep erythrocytes, and endotoxin. the broad range of shared or cross-reactivity among  antigens in bacteria may explain the presence of antibodies to many bacteria in sera from normal humans and previously unimmunized experimental animals. the presence of these antibodies raises the question whether resistance to many bacterial infections may be partly due to immune mechanisms, whether cellular or  humoral, that have been stimulated by unrelated bacteria.

AB  == streptococcus bovis and butyrivibrio sp. were labeled with thymidine-methyl-(3)h, washed, and resuspended in rumen fluid or rumen fluid fractions obtained from holstein and jersey cows fed alfalfa hay once daily. factors affecting the lytic  activity found in untreated rumen fluid were examined. day to day variation and differences before and after feeding were observed for the same cow. there were also differences between cows on the same day. for a given rumen fluid, the rate  of release of label was roughly proportional to the number of labeled cells present over a 100-fold range in concentration. removal of protozoa largely abolished the lytic action of fresh rumen fluid for s. bovis, but some soluble lytic activity remained. mixed rumen protozoa added to media containing labeled s. bovis caused label to appear in solution. in a sample of rumen fluid containing 4.3 x 10(4) protozoa/ml 5.2% of the s. bovis population were destroyed by protozoa per hr. the mean rate of destruction for 12 runs on whole rumen fluid was 8.7% per hr with a standard deviation of 6.05. parallel experiments with butyrivibrio indicated that soluble lytic factors were more important for this organism. they could be destroyed by autoclaving and were generated when viable rumen bacteria were resuspended in autoclaved rumen fluid. the lysis of s. bovis  and butyrivibrio, at equal cell densities, by mixed rumen protozoa was compared in 30% rumen fluid media, and butyrivibrio appeared to be more readily lysed than s. bovis.

TI  == arginine biosynthesis by streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the pathway of arginine biosynthesis in streptococcus bovis was studied by radioactive tracer techniques. cells were grown anaerobically with (14)co(2) in a synthetic medium containing nh(4) (+) as the sole nitrogen source except for the  trace present in nitrogen-containing vitamins. the protein fraction isolated from the labeled cells was acid-hydrolyzed, and (14)c-arginine was isolated from the protein hydrolysate by ion-exchange chromatography. the carboxyl carbon of the isolated arginine was removed with arginine decarboxylase, and the guanidino carbon was removed by simultaneous arginase-urease degradation. by manometric measurement and liquid scintillation counting of the co(2) released by enzymatic  degradation, 50% of the label was found in the carboxyl carbon and 50% in the guanidino carbon. specific radioactivity determinations indicated that growth on  (14)co(2) resulted in twice as much label in arginine as with aspartate, glutamate, or lysine. these results are consistent with a glutamate --> ornithine --> citrulline pathway of arginine biosynthesis in s. bovis and provide further evidence for the synthesis of glutamate via the tricarboxylic acid cycle reactions from citrate through alpha-ketoglutarate.

TI  == a transglucosylase of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == 1. a transglucosylase has been separated from the alpha-amylase of streptococcus  bovis by chromatography of the cell extract on deae-cellulose. 2. the transglucosylase can synthesize higher maltodextrins from maltotriose, but maltose, isomaltose and panose do not function as donors. 3. iodine-staining polysaccharide may be synthesized from maltotriose provided that glucose is removed. synthesis from maltohexaose results in dextrins of sufficient chain length to stain with iodine, but again maltodextrins of longer chain length are formed when glucose is removed from the system. 4. the transglucosylase degrades  amylose in the presence of a suitable acceptor, transferring one or more glucosyl residues from the non-reducing end of the donor to the non-reducing end of the acceptor. with [(14)c]glucose as acceptor the maltodextrins produced were labelled in the reducing glucose unit only. 5. the acceptor activities of 25 sugars have been compared with that of glucose. maltose has 50%, methyl alpha-glucoside has 15%, isomaltose and panose each has 8% and sucrose has 6% of  the accepting efficiency of glucose. mannose and sorbose also had detectable activity. with the exception of maltose all these sugars produced a different series of dextrins from that obtained with glucose. 6. it was concluded that s. bovis transglucosylase transfers alpha-(1-->4)-glucosidic linkages in the same manner as d-enzyme, but some differences in specificity distinguish the two enzymes. unlike d-enzyme, s. bovis transglucosylase can transfer glucosyl units,  producing appreciable amounts of maltose both during synthesis from maltotriose and during transfer from amylose to glucose. 7. no evidence was found that the transglucosylase was extracellular. the enzyme is cell-bound, and is released by  treatment of the cells with lysozyme and by suspension of the spheroplasts in dilute buffer. 8. the transglucosylase may be responsible for the storage of intracellular iodophilic polysaccharide that occurs when the cells are grown in the presence of suitable carbohydrate sources.

AB  == 1. the cell-bound alpha-amylase of streptococcus bovis has been isolated from other carbohydrases in the cell extract by chromatography on deae-cellulose. the  enzyme has been compared with the extracellular alpha-amylase produced by this organism. 2. the two amylases had similar action patterns on amylose, the main product being maltotriose with smaller amounts of maltose and a little glucose. 3. the cell-bound amylase hydrolysed maltopentaose and maltohexaose at a similar  rate to the hydrolysis of amylose. maltotetraose was hydrolysed six times more slowly, and maltotriose 280 times more slowly, than amylose. 4. studies with end-labelled maltodextrins revealed that the cell-bound alpha-amylase preferentially hydrolysed the third linkage from the non-reducing end, liberating maltotriose. the linkage at the reducing end of maltotriose was more easily hydrolysed than the other. 5. egg-white lysozyme and the extracellular enzymes of streptomyces albus lysed the cell walls of streptococcus bovis, releasing amylase into the medium. in the presence of 0.6 m-sucrose 10% of the maximal amylase activity was released by lysozyme. suspension of the spheroplasts in dilute buffer caused the rupture of the cytoplasmic membrane and the liberation of amylase. 6. a sensitive method for determining the ability of amylases to degrade starch granules is described.

(a. &. m. college of texas, college station). utilization of sulfur compounds by streptococcus bovis. j. bacteriol. 82:724-728. 1961.-two strains of streptococcus bovis utilize a variety of compounds as their only source of sulfur, yet exert a definite selectivity in their nutritional requirements for this element. among sulfur-containing amino acids and related compounds, cystine and cysteine support excellent growth, but cysteic acid and cysteine sulfinic acid do not; methionine is completely inactive as an only sulfur source, but growth is provided by lanthionine, djenkolic acid, allo-cystathionine, homocystine, homocysteine, and glutathione. several organic sulfur compounds other than amino acids are effective sulfur sources, among which are thioglycolate, thiomalate, thiourea, and thiouracil. in contrast, thiodiglycolate, thiodiglycol, and (phenylthio) acetic acid fail to support growth. of the inorganic sulfur sources tested, sulfide and thiosulfate are utilized, but sulfite and sulfate are not; it thus appears that the state of oxidation is a critical factor in the utilization of sulfur by these strains of s. bovis. a complex amino acid mixture, without sulfur-containing amino acids, produces more rapid and reproducible growth than either arginine or ammonium acetate when used as a nitrogen source for testing the sulfur compounds. growth rates are frequently better when the sulfur sources are autoclaved than when they are sterilized by filtration, although the qualitative responses to the compounds are generally similar.

TI  == nutrition of streptococcus bovis in relation to dextran formation.
AB  == barnes, isabel j. (cornell university, ithaca, n. y.), h. w. seeley, and p. j. vandemark. nutrition of streptococcus bovis in relation to dextran formation. j.  bacteriol. 82:85-93. 1961.-three nutritional types of streptococcus bovis were encountered. minimal media for their growth are described. transferable growth in defined media was always accompanied by dextran production and the nutrition for  dextran production could not be distinguished from the minimal nutritional requirements of the organism for growth. measurable, free co(2) was evolved from  a complex medium during the growth of s. bovis. several compounds were found to replace partially the co(2) requirement of the species. when fractured cell preparations containing s. bovis dextran were employed as antigens, rabbits failed to yield sera which would precipitate s. bovis or leuconostoc dextrans.
