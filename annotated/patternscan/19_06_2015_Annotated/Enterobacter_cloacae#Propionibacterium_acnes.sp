TI  == infectious prosthetic hip joint loosening: bacterial species involved in its aetiology and their antibiotic resistance profiles against antibiotics recommended for the therapy of implant-associated infections.
AB  == reliable microbiological diagnosis along with surgery and prolonged antibiotic therapy are key elements in the management of prosthetic-joint infections (pjis). the purpose of this study was to characterize antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria involved in the aetiology of pjis. a total of 33 bacterial isolates cultured from 31 patients undergoing exchange of total hip prostheses were analyzed. the diagnostic approach toward isolation of prosthesis- associated microorganisms included sonication of retrieved implants and conventional cultures of periprosthetic tissues and synovial fluid. the in vitro resistance profiles of bacterial isolates were determined in relation to antibiotics recommended for the therapy of pjis using the disc diffusion method, e-tests((r)) and broth microdilution system. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) were predominant microorganisms followed by staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, and propionibacterium acnes. twenty out of 30 and 12 out of 30 staphylococcal isolates were methicillin- and multi-drug resistant,  respectively. only two isolates were rifampicinresistant. all staphylococci were  susceptible to glycopeptides and linezolid. this paper stresses the pathogenic role of staphylococci in patients suffering from implant loosening and reports high methicillin- and multidrug-resistance rates in these bacteria. hence, antimicrobial susceptibility tests of individual bacterial isolates must always be performed to guide selection of the optimal therapeutic option.

TI  == poor utility of serum interleukin-6 levels to predict indolent periprosthetic shoulder infections.
AB  == background: infection after shoulder arthroplasty can present a diagnostic challenge. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of serum interleukin-6 (il-6) levels in diagnosis of periprosthetic infection in patients  undergoing revision shoulder arthroplasty. methods: we prospectively enrolled 69  patients who underwent revision shoulder arthroplasty at one institution. all patients underwent a standard preoperative and intraoperative workup for infection, which included shoulder aspirate culture, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, c-reactive protein level, tissue culture, and frozen section analysis. in addition, serum levels of il-6 were measured preoperatively in all patients. infection classification was divided into 4 groups, (1) definite, (2) probable, (3) possible, and (4) no infection, on the basis of previously reported criteria  using intraoperative cultures and preoperative and intraoperative findings of infections. results: of the 69 patients, 24 were classified as having a definite  or probable infection. propionibacterium acnes was the offending organism for the majority of these cases (20 of 24, 83%). il-6 was not a sensitive marker of infection for these patients (sensitivity: 3 of 24, 12%; specificity: 3 of 45, 93%). the sensitivity of serum il-6 was lower compared with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (sensitivity: 10 of 24, 42%; specificity: 37 of 45, 82%) and c-reactive protein level (sensitivity: 11 of 24, 46%; specificity: 42 of 45, 93%). for the non-p. acnes cases (1 staphylococcus aureus, 1 enterobacter cloacae, 2 coagulase-negative staphylococcus species), the sensitivity of il-6 was 25% (1 of 4). conclusion: serum il-6 is not an effective marker for diagnosis of infection in shoulder arthroplasty. on the basis of this large prospective study, we do not recommend its use as a preoperative diagnostic test in patients  undergoing revision shoulder arthroplasty.

TI  == elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == microbial contamination of hematopoietic progenitor cell grafts-incidence, clinical outcome, and cost-effectiveness: an analysis of 735 grafts.
AB  == background: screening of progenitor cell grafts (marrow, peripheral blood, and cord blood) for microbial contamination is required by the standards of aabb. clinical sequelae from infusion of these contaminated grafts, however, is uncommon. study design and methods: a retrospective analysis of 735 consecutive marrow and peripheral blood progenitor cell harvests between 1998 and 2003 was performed. analysis included incidence, clinical outcome, and cost outcomes of positive blood cultures and antibiotic therapy. results: thirty-three of 735 (4.5%) harvests were contaminated. the incidence of microbial contamination varied with the source of the graft (4 of 26 [15%] were cord blood, 8 of 177 [4.5%] were marrow, and 21 of 532 [3.9%] were peripheral blood). coagulase-negative staphylococcus (n=22) and propionibacterium acnes (n=8) were most frequently isolated. potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated in 6 of  735 (0.81%) grafts (methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 4; methicillin-resistant s. aureus, 1; and enterobacter cloacae, 1). the estimated total cost of surveillance was approximately $81,585. the cost of vancomycin therapy in 4 patients who received prophylactic antibiotic therapy was approximately $10,000. no adverse sequelae followed infusion of contaminated grafts. conclusion: clinical sequelae following infusion of microbially contaminated progenitor cells is extremely rare. prophylactic empiric antibiotics may be unnecessary. routine microbial surveillance of progenitor cell grafts is a low-yield procedure.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == validation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  == background: bacterial detection of platelet (plt)-rich-plasma (prp)-derived plts  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. this study validated the bact/alert for use in testing pooled prp-derived plts with nine contaminating organisms. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two prp-derived plt pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 cfus/ml). four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 ml was plated onto blood agar. results: all organisms (excluding p. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respective). p. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively). with e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. this was most notable with s. viridans where  the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. conclusions: this study validates the use of the bact/alert system for the detection of bacteria in prp-derived plts in a pooled format. overall, the use of the bact/alert system allowed the detection of pooled prp-derived plts inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 cfus per ml in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding p. acnes).

TI  == evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in plt components.
AB  == background: a microbial detection system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux [formerly organon teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in plts. the recovery of nine organisms seeded into plts with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. the use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis plt  units to 10 and 100 cfus per ml. replicate samples (4 ml) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. results: all organisms (with the exception of p. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 cfus/ml). in aggregate (with the exception of p. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). in all cases,  the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. p. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with  the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 cfus/ml), respectively. the narrower bottle  neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. conclusions: these data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.

TI  == evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  == background: an automated bacterial culture system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. the recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella  oxytoca, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens,  streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu per ml. samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. results:  all organisms, except p. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 cfu/ml) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 cfu/ml) hours. p. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 cfu/ml) or 66.0 (100 cfu/ml) hours. the 10-fold increase in inoculum  was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. the aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours)  between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p <  0.001), respectively. conclusion: no difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. the new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == pancreatic fluid collections: diagnostic and therapeutic implications of percutaneous drainage guided by ultrasound.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of the present study is to assess the usefulness of biochemical and bacteriological analysis of the pancreatic fluid obtained at percutaneous drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts and abscesses guided by ultrasound. methodology: the study population was comprised of 65 patients, aged  21-79 years: 18 with abscesses and 47 with pseudocysts. in all cases the etiological factor of pancreatic fluid collections was acute pancreatitis. microbiological (both of aerobic and anaerobic flora), biochemical (including alpha 2-macroglobulin) and cytological analysis of aspirated fluid was performed. duration of percutaneous drainage in pseudocysts was 10-40 days (mean 18 +/- 12)  and in abscesses 21-56 days (mean 32 +/- 19). results: complete resolution of pancreatic fluid collections was obtained in 54 (83%) patients, among them in 40  (85.1%) with pseudocysts and in 14 (77.7%) with abscesses, which was confirmed in follow-up ultrasound and/or computed tomography one year after the catheter was removed. mild complications of this procedure observed in 17 (26.1%) patients were managed without catheter removal. a variety of organisms were cultured from  pancreatic fluid, e. coli being the most prevalent. enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus saccharolyticus, propionibacterium acnes and bacteroides fragilis were also isolated. cytologic analysis of the aspirate revealed no atypical cells. the level of alpha 2-macroglobulin in the pancreatic fluid was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients with successful pancreatic drainage as compared to the remaining group.  conclusion: percutaneous drainage represents a safe therapeutic method that also  provides additional criteria for the management of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == head-space gas-liquid chromatographic analysis for presumptive identification of  bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  == a total of 445 strains of common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were analyzed for their volatile microbial metabolites by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. the bacteria were incubated for 24 or 48 h in blood-containing trypticase soy or lombard-dowell glucose broth before being analyzed by automatic head-space injection. from the chromatographic pattern obtained, the majority of klebsiella  pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococci,  bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium nucleatum and propionibacterium acnes could be characterized. the head-space technique developed provides a rapid, direct and easily-performed means for presumptive identification of bacteria found in blood  culture.
