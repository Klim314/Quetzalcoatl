TI  - [Illumina sequencing 16S rRNA tagging reveals diverse vaginal microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze and compare vaginal microbiomes in healthy women at child-bearing ages and patients with bacterial vaginosis (BV). METHODS: A total of 74 vaginal swabs of the vaginal fornix were collected from 37 BV patients and 37 healthy women. BV status was assessed according to Amsels clinical criteria for all the subjects and confirmed using Gram-stain criteria (Nugent scores). Genomic DNA of the samples was extracted for amplifying the 16S rRNA V6 hypervariable region by PCR and pyrosequencing by Illumina. BIPES, UCHIME, TSC and GAST were employed to analyze the information of the species from the samples. RESULTS: Lactobacillus was the predominant species in healthy women (more than 95%), including mainly L. iners and L. crispatus, with a small quantity of Gardnerella, Granulicatella, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Escherichia and other genus. The alpha diversity was significantly increased in 30 BV patients (P<0.001), and beta diversity also changed obviously shown by decreased Lactobacillus (varying from 45% to 1%, consisting mainly of L. iners) or even absence Lactobacillus in 6 cases, with increased relative abundance of Gardnerella, Prevotella, Granulicatella, Anaerococcus, Parvimonas, Peptoniphilus.harei, Peptostreptococcus, and Dialister. Different from previous data, 7 BV cases showed a predominance of the rare species L.gasseri and L.acidophilus (75% to 50%). CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus is the predominant vaginal species in healthy women (mainly L. iners and L. crispatus) co-existing with many other bacteria and a variety of microorganisms. Lactobacillus is significantly decreased and even absent in most of BV patients, and some cases show the predominance of the rare species L.gasseri and L.acidophilus.
TI  - Development of 16S rRNA-based probes for the identification of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  - Fluorescent probes targeted at 16S rRNA were designed for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus stomatis (Pana134), Parvimonas micra (Pamic1435), Finegoldia magna (Fmag1250), Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (Pnasa1254), Peptoniphilus ivorii (Pnivo731), Peptoniphilus harei (Pnhar1466), Anaerococcus vaginalis (Avag1280) and Anaerococcus lactolyticus (Alac1438), based on the 16S rRNA sequences of reference strains and 88 randomly chosen clinical isolates. These strains were also used for validation of the probes. Application of the probes to an additional group of 100 clinical isolates revealed that 87% of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) could be identified with this set of probes. The 16S rRNAs of 13 clinical isolates that could not be identified were sequenced. Most of these isolates were GPAC that were not targeted by the probes. No clinical isolates of Pn. asaccharolyticus were encountered. Near full-length sequences were obtained from 71 of 101 (n = 88 + 13) sequenced clinical isolates. Of these, 25 showed <98% similarity with the homologues of the closest established species. The Fmag1250, Pamic1435, Pnhar1466, Pana134, Pnasa1254 and Pnivo731 probes allowed reliable identification and hybridised with all corresponding isolates. The Avag1280 and Alac1438 probes failed to hybridise with two isolates and one isolate, respectively, because of intra-species variation. However, overall, the set of probes yielded fast and reliable identification for the majority of clinical isolates.
TI  - Rapid identification of Gram-positive anaerobic coccal species originally classified in the genus Peptostreptococcus by multiplex PCR assays using genus- and species-specific primers.
AB  - Here, a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex PCR assay for identifying 14 Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) species originally classified in the genus Peptostreptococcus (Anaerococcus hydrogenalis, Anaerococcus lactolyticus, Anaerococcus octavius, Anaerococcus prevotii, Anaerococcus tetradius, Anaerococcus vaginalis, Finegoldia magna, Micromonas micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, Peptoniphilus harei, Peptoniphilus indolicus, Peptoniphilus ivorii and Peptoniphilus lacrimalis) is reported. Fourteen type strains representing 14 GPAC species were first identified to the genus level by multiplex PCR (multiplex PCR-G). Since three of these genera (Finegoldia, Micromonas and Peptostreptococcus) contain only a single species, F. magna, M. micros and P. anaerobius, respectively, these organisms were identified to the species level directly by using the multiplex PCR-G. Then six species of the genus Anaerococcus (A. hydrogenalis, A. lactolyticus, A. octavius, A. prevotii, A. vaginalis and A. tetradius) were further identified to the species level using multiplex PCR assays (multiplex PCR-Ia and multiplex PCR-Ib). Similarly, five species of the genus Peptoniphilus (Pn. asaccharolyticus, Pn. harei, Pn. indolicus, Pn. ivorii and Pn. lacrimalis) were identified to the species level using multiplex PCR-IIa and multiplex PCR-IIb. The established two-step multiplex PCR identification scheme was applied to the identification of 190 clinical isolates of GPAC species that had been identified previously to the species level by 16S rRNA sequencing and phenotypic tests. The identification obtained from multiplex PCR assays showed 100 % agreement with 16S rDNA sequencing identification, but only 65 % (123/190) agreement with the identification obtained by phenotypic tests. The multiplex PCR scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of GPAC species. It will permit a more accurate assessment of the role of various GPAC species in infection and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.
TI  - Proposal of the genera Anaerococcus gen. nov., Peptoniphilus gen. nov. and Gallicola gen. nov. for members of the genus Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - Members of genus Peptostreptococcus have previously been found to be distantly related to the type species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, on the basis of 16S rDNA sequence similarities. They were divided into three major phylogenetic groups, and their peptidoglycan structure and biochemical traits differed between groups. The reclassification of the species of these three groups into three new genera, Peptoniphilus gen. nov., Anaerococcus gen. nov. and Gallicola gen. nov., is proposed. The genus Peptoniphilus gen. nov. includes the following butyrate-producing, non-saccharolytic species that use peptone and amino acids as major energy sources: Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus comb. nov. (type species), Peptoniphilus lacrimaris comb. nov., Peptoniphilus harei comb. nov., Peptoniphilus indolicus comb. nov. and Peptoniphilus ivorii comb. nov. The genus Anaerococcus gen. nov. contains the saccharolytic, butyrate-producing species Anaerococcus prevotii comb. nov. (type species), Anaerococcus tetradius comb. nov., Anaerococcus lactolyticus comb. nov., Anaerococcus hydrogenalis comb. nov., Anaerococcus vaginalis comb. nov. and Anaerococcus octavius sp. nov. The genus Gallicola gen. nov. contains a single species, Gallicola barnesae comb. nov.
