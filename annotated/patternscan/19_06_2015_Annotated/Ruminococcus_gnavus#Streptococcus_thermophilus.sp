TI  == impact of the metabolic activity of streptococcus thermophilus on the colon epithelium of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == the thermophilic lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus is widely and traditionally used in the dairy industry. despite the vast level of consumption of s. thermophilus through yogurt or probiotic functional food, very few data are available about its physiology in the gastrointestinal tract (git). the objective of the present work was to explore both the metabolic activity and host response  of s. thermophilus in vivo. our study profiles the protein expression of s. thermophilus after its adaptation to the git of gnotobiotic rats and describes the impact of s. thermophilus colonization on the colonic epithelium. s. thermophilus colonized progressively the git of germ-free rats to reach a stable  population in 30 days (10(8) cfu/g of feces). this progressive colonization suggested that s. thermophilus undergoes an adaptation process within git. indeed, we showed that the main response of s. thermophilus in the rat's git was  the massive induction of the glycolysis pathway, leading to formation of lactate  in the cecum. at the level of the colonic epithelium, the abundance of monocarboxylic acid transporter mrnas (slc16a1 and slc5a8) and a protein involved in the cell cycle arrest (p27(kip1)) increased in the presence of s. thermophilus compared with germ-free rats. based on different mono-associated rats harboring two different strains of s. thermophilus (lmd-9 or lmg18311) or weak lactate-producing commensal bacteria (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and ruminococcus gnavus), we propose that lactate could be a signal produced by s. thermophilus and modulating the colon epithelium.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria secrete metabolites retaining anti-inflammatory properties after intestinal transport.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria have a beneficial effect on intestinal inflammation. in this study, we have examined the effect of lactic acid and commensal gram positive (+) bacteria conditioned media (cm) on tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) release and the mechanisms involved. methods: lipopolysaccharide (lps) induced tnf-alpha secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the thp-1 cell line was monitored in the presence or absence of bacteria cm obtained from two probiotic strains, bifidobacterium breve (bb) and streptococcus thermophilus (st), and three commensal bacterial strains (bifidobacterium bifidum, ruminococcus gnavus, and unidentified streptococcus). bb and st bacteria cm were allowed to cross filter grown intestinal epithelial cell monolayers (ht29-19a) to assess intestinal transport of active bacterial products. these products were characterised and their effect on lps binding to thp-1 cells and nuclear factor kappa b (nf kappa b) activation assessed. results: dose dependent inhibition of lps induced tnf-alpha secretion was noted for both probiotic bacteria cm (64% and 71% inhibition for bb and st, respectively) and to a lesser extent commensal bacteria cm (21-32% inhibition). active products from bb and st were resistant to digestive enzymes and had a molecular mass <3000 da.  their inhibitory effect was preserved after transepithelial transport across intestinal cell monolayers, mainly in inflammatory conditions. lps-fitc binding to thp-1 cells and nf kappa b activation were significantly inhibited by bb and st cm. conclusion: b breve and s thermophilus release metabolites exerting an anti-tnf-alpha effect capable of crossing the intestinal barrier. commensal bacteria also display a tnf-alpha inhibitory capacity but to a lesser extent. these results underline the beneficial effect of commensal bacteria in intestinal homeostasis and may explain the role of some probiotic bacteria in alleviating digestive inflammation.
