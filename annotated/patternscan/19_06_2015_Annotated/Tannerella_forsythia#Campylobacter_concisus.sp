TI  == shifts in campylobacter species abundance may reflect general microbial community shifts in periodontitis progression.
AB  == background: oral campylobacter species have been found to be associated with periodontitis progression. while the etiological significance of campylobacter rectus is quite established, the association of c. gracilis, c. concisus, and c.  curvus with health or disease remains contradictory. objectives: this study hypothesizes that the proportion of species within the campylobacter genus rather than the absolute abundance of a single species is a suitable indicator for periodontitis progression. design: subgingival plaque from 90 periodontitis patients and gingival sulcus fluid of 32 healthy individuals were subjected to a  newly developed nested pcr approach, in which all campylobacter spp. were amplified simultaneously. the resulting mixture of 16s-rrna-gene-amplicons were separated by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (sscp) gel electrophoresis, followed by sequencing and identification of excised bands and relative quantification of band intensities. in all samples, the abundance of selected periodontitis marker species was determined based on dna hybridization on a microarray. results: the highly prevalent campylobacter community was composed of varying proportions of c. rectus, c. gracilis, c. concisus, and c. curvus. cluster analysis based on sscp-banding pattern resulted in distinct groups which in turn coincided with significant differences in abundance of established periodontitis marker species (tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum) and progression. conclusions: the shift  in the campylobacter community composition seems to display the general microbial community shift during clinical progression in a simplified manner. the focus on  members of the campylobacter in this study suggests that this genus can be an indicator of ecological changes in the subgingival oral microflora.

TI  == the association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in brazilian adults with hiv: a multilevel analysis.
AB  == background: this study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load (hvl) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with hiv. methods: thirty-seven individuals with hiv were divided into two groups: 1) detectable hvl (n = 15); and 2) undetectable hvl (n = 22). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, fisher exact test, and mann-whitney u test were used to compare groups. multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between hvl and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. results: of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable hvl group than undetectable hvl group (p <0.001). these species included actinomyces naeslundii  ii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and candida  albicans. significant associations between detectable hvl and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for a. naeslundii i, actinomyces gerencseriae, c. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythia, and dialister pneumosintes. conclusion: detectable plasmatic hvl in individuals with hiv was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as p. nigrescens, t. forsythia, and e. corrodens, as well as c. concisus, c. gingivalis, and d. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.
