TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial evaluation of guanylsulfonamides.
AB  == a series of guanylsulfonamides, 2-amino-9-[2-substituted-4-(4-substituted piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenyl]-1,9-dihydropurin-6-ones, was synthesized by adopting reductive aminoformylation of 2-amino-5-nitro-6-[4-(piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenylamino]-3h-pyrimidin- 4-one and subsequent intramolecular ring condensation as key steps. all the guanylsulfonamides were assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activities against klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus faecalis, and their antifungal activities against aspergillus flavus, aspergillus niger, and candida albicans. of the guanylsulfonamides, 13e and 13f displayed better antibacterial activities  than that of norfloxacin against the bacterial strains s. aureus and s. faecalis  except 13f against s. faecalis, which exhibited the activity similar to that of norfloxacin. against the fungal strains a. flavus and a. niger, 13g and 13h showed similar activities to that of griseoflavin-16 except 13h against a. niger, which displayed a profound drop in the activity compared to that of griseoflavin-16. the remarkable inhibition of the growth of the bacterial and fungal strains makes these substances promising microbial agents.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

TI  == abdominal aortitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes: a  case report and review.
AB  == endovascular infections are 1 cause of fever of unknown origin. we describe a diagnostically challenging case of cryptogenic abdominal aortitis from streptococcus pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes. a 72-year-old male presented with epigastric pain, fevers, and chills. a computed tomography scan demonstrated enlargement and ulceration of the distal abdominal aorta, prompting urgent vascular surgery. intraoperative tissue cultures grew s. pneumoniae and e. aerogenes and gatifloxacin was administered for 6 weeks. spontaneous abdominal aortitis is uncommon and usually due to a single pathogen. this is the second reported case of polymicrobial infectious aortitis and to date, enterobacter has  only been reported in infected aortic grafts. clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for infectious aortitis as the mortality, if only treated medically, approaches 100%.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica).
AB  == the goal of the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained  in various geographic regions in the usa and canada. forty-one medical centres (30 from the usa and 11 from canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. susceptibility testing was determined using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) microdilution method. resistance breakpoints used were those published by the nccls, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/ml), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (smx/tmp) (resistant > or = 4 microg/ml), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or =  4 microg/ml) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/ml). of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the usa and 24.9% (496) were collected from canada. the mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. the most common organisms were escherichia coli (57.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), enterococcus spp. (6.6%), proteus mirabilis (5.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), citrobacter spp. (2.7%), staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), klebsiella spp. (1.2%), enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to smx/tmp, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. for the 1142 e. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, smx/tmp 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. for all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 e. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in us compared with canadian medical centres. this study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in us versus canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == use of pharmacodynamic end points in the evaluation of gatifloxacin for the treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == the relationship between drug exposure and the time course of antimicrobial effect at the primary infection site for acute maxillary sinusitis has not previously been explored. this single-center, open-label study quantified the time course of sinus sterilization, described gatifloxacin exposure at the infection site, and posed the hypothesis that the use of continuous and quantitative time-related end points may allow for better characterization of drug effect with fewer patients than traditional clinical trial approaches. of the 12 enrolled patients, 10 were clinically evaluable, from whom 7 pathogens were isolated: 4 streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 staphylococci, and 1 enterobacter aerogenes. the median predicted 24-h area under the curve (auc) in sinus aspirates and plasma samples was 54.7 mg x h/l and 30.1 mg x h/l, respectively. the median 24-h auc ratio for sinus aspirates and plasma samples was 1.51 (range, 0.88-2.23). for patients infected with pneumococci, the median time to sinus sterilization was 50 h. the use of quantitative time-related end points may be useful in evaluating the efficacy of antimicrobial agents with fewer patients.

TI  == neonatal sepsis and meningitis in haiti.
AB  == the aim of the study was to determine the etiology of meningitis and sepsis in the newborn at the state university hospital of haiti and evaluate the susceptibility 'in vitro' of the pathogens to the antibiotics commonly used. this was a prospective case series study over a 10-month period (may 1997-february 1998) of 42 newborns with sepsis and/or meningitis. besides the clinical signs, a positive blood culture and/or a positive culture of cerebrospinal fluid was present in each case. gram-negative bacteria were most commonly found as a cause  of early onset sepsis, with enterobacter aerogenes as the most common agent. there were no such difference between gram-negative and gram-positive in late onset sepsis. group b streptococcus was associated with neonatal meningitis (44 per cent of cases) which was more related to gram-positive bacteria (66 per cent). risk factors were vaginal discharge and dysuria in mothers, and low apgar  score in newborns. thirty-three per cent of the pathogens found, among them klebsiella pneumoniae, were resistant 'in vitro' to ampicillin and gentamycin. all were susceptible to amikacin. enterobacter aerogenes is an important pathogen in the etiology of early onset sepsis in the newborn at the state university hospital of haiti, while group b streptococcus is the leading cause of meningitis in that age group. resistance to gentamycin should be taken into consideration for the treatment of sepsis and meningitis in the newborn.

AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by e test.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by e test. we found that the mic(50) and mic(90) values against all members of the enterobacteriaceae family except serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (mic range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. the susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, although serratia and acinetobacter exhibited more or  less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (mic(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. the ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. we propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these  three fluoroquinolones in treating enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). these data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa), as  well as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and policy in belgium.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide, also in belgium. a few examples to illustrate this problem: s. pneumoniae are becoming increasingly resistant to penicillin and erythromycin; resistance of s. pyogenes to erythromycin is increasing year-by-year; salmonella and campylobacter are becoming more and more  resistant to the fluoroquinolones. in hospitals, the problem of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus appears to be decreasing, but two clones of ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter aerogenes are spreading throughout the belgian hospitals. antibiotic resistance has become a serious health care issue both in hospitals and in the community. the popular press has termed some of the multiresistant organisms "killer bugs" or "superbugs". infection with such organisms has been associated with treatment failures, higher morbidity and mortality and increased costs. in this paper, we will review the problems of antibiotic resistance in the community setting. we will briefly discuss those pathogens with important consequences of morbidity and mortality in the community, such as: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, neisseria meningitidis, the enteric pathogens salmonella and campylobacter, and the urinary tract pathogen e. coli. this resistance has in response to various conditions and opportunities, such as: clustering and overcrowding, increased number of immunodeficient patients, increased elderly population, population mobility, increased use of (broad-spectrum) antibiotics, over-the-counter sale and self-dosing with antibiotics, inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions and lack of  compliance, fewer resources for education and infection control, decreased funding for public health surveillance. in belgium, we should be able to develop, implement and evaluate a good antibiotic policy. our country has a wealth of information on antibiotic consumption in hospitals and the community. this information has been used for benchmarking of antibiotic consumption in hospitals. a unique system for reimbursement of prophylactic use of antibiotics in surgery was developed which resulted in a more adequate use of antibiotics. however, a policy should not be limited to the human ecosystem. therefore, a coordination commission for antibiotic policy was installed recently by the ministers of social affairs, public health and agriculture.

AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in nottingham, uk, 1985-1996.
AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == comparative activity of eight antimicrobial agents against clinical bacterial isolates from the united states, measured by two methods.
AB  == in a surveillance study conducted during 1992-1993 at 83 medical institutions of  different types and sizes (e.g., laboratories, community hospitals, teaching hospitals) and from different geographical areas of the united states, clinical bacterial isolates were tested for their susceptibility to eight comparative antimicrobial agents (cefepime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, and piperacillin). a total of 12,574 isolates were tested by either the etest method (ab biodisk) or a microdilution method (microscan) in the participating laboratories; 11.8% of these isolates were subsequently retested for quality assurance purposes by both methods in a central laboratory. the results obtained in the central laboratory were essentially the same as the results obtained in the participating laboratories. this article presents data for gram-negative and gram-positive isolates other than streptococcus pneumoniae, the results of which have been previously published. antimicrobial susceptibility results obtained with the two different minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) methods--microscan and etest--showed that  most isolates of enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to cefepime, exceeding the activity of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime, principally because of the  greater activity of cefepime against the species that produce bush group 1 beta-lactamases (predominantly enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and  citrobacter freundii). in addition, the activity of cefepime against pseudomonas  aeruginosa isolates was essentially equivalent to that of ceftazidime and greater than that of third-generation cephalosporins. most methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to all the cephalosporins, whereas methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococci were resistant. overall, the most active antimicrobials in this study were imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime, but the activity of all the antimicrobials varied with different species. categorically, the results from the microdilution and etest methods were equivalent.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (up-pcr) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. a  universal protocol of preparation of pcr samples from cultures representing escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. the bands of up-pcr  products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. the applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the dna bands obtained for different strains. three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis produced very similar dna banding patterns. they comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. the dna profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each  other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. the method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of fk-037, a new parenteral cephalosporin structurally related to cefpirome and cefepime, was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, cefpirome, cefepime, imipenem and meropenem against 1,837 clinical isolates obtained from three spanish hospitals. fk-037 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae isolates at < or = 0.25 microgram/ml, with the exception of enterobacter aerogenes (mic90 1 microgram/ml), enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii (mic90 8 micrograms/ml). in cefotaxime- and ceftazidime-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing shv-2 and shv-6 beta-lactamases, the activity of fk-037, cefpirome and cefepime was similar (mic  range 0.25-32 micrograms/ml). in enterobacteriaceae strains hyper-producing chromosomally inducible beta-lactamases, fk-037 (mic90 range, 0.25-8 micrograms/ml) was 8- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime and ceftazidime but  two- to eightfold less active than cefpirome and cefepime. fk-037 and cefpirome were twofold more active than ceftazidime and cefepime against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, with mic90 values of 16 micrograms/ml. the activity of fk-037, cefpirome and cefepime was two- to eightfold lower in ceftazidime-resistant derepressed pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants. fk-037 (mic range, 0.12-2 micrograms/ml) and the other beta-lactam agents tested were active  against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci; however, only cefpirome and, particularly, fk-037 (mic90 of 32 micrograms/ml) displayed some activity against  methicillin-resistant strains. in penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, the mic90s of fk-037 were 0.03, 0.5 and 1 microgram/ml, respectively.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro activity of cp-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == comparative crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
AB  == the study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in 12 healthy male volunteers with normal renal function. each volunteer received oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg, intravenous (i.v.) ciprofloxacin 400 mg, oral ofloxacin 400 mg, or i.v. ofloxacin 400 mg in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design with a one-week 'washout' period between doses. mean peak serum concentrations were 4.48 and 5.44 mg/l for i.v. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. for the oral regimens, mean peak serum concentrations were 2.45 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and 4.44 mg/l for ofloxacin. minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) and serum bactericidal activity (sba) for each  drug were measured against five strains of each of the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter anitratus, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae, using the microdilution method of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). ciprofloxacin was more active in vitro than ofloxacin against the tested species of enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, while ofloxacin was slightly more active against a. anitratus. mbcs for the two drugs were similar for h. influenzae and s. aureus. oral and i.v. ciprofloxacin in the doses given resulted in nearly equivalent sba. similarly, oral and i.v. ofloxacin had nearly equivalent sba. for the i.v. and oral regimens of both agents, peak sba was > or = 2 throughout the 12-hour test period against the enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. at peak concentrations, both drugs had modest sba against p. aeruginosa, a. anitratus, and s. aureus but little or no activity 8 and 12 h after dosing.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == in vitro activities of cefuzonam (czon) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mic's and the results of disc susceptibility test. the mic's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)cfu/ml. the mic80's of czon against streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, haemophilus influenzae and citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. the mic80's against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. the mic80's against staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. approximately 70% of strains of s. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. for the interpretation of the czon showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa disc containing czon, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic less than 60 micrograms/ml. reliability of the czon  disc tests in estimating approximate mic values was studied using showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms czon. a good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters  and mic's, showing the reliability of the disc method. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately  classified into the 4 groups except those against p. aeruginosa. some strains of  p. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with mic's against these organisms. as czon is not effective against p. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between mic's and the disc test would result when p. aeruginosa was excluded. with showa  30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. in this study, however, it was  demonstrated that differentiation of strains with mic's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of czon were used. according to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including  penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding  of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in  the body.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  == tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., serratia marcescens,  and yersinia enterocolitica. at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited haemophilus spp., neisseria spp., and branhamella catarrhalis. it did not inhibit pseudomonas spp. or acinetobacter spp. tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. some enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. the mic for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, and c and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the mic for 90% of enterococci, listeria spp., bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as tem-1 and shv-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of  enterobacter, morganella, pseudomonas, and bacteroides spp. tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. the growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity  of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the mics and mbcs.

TI  == a preliminary survey of aerobic bacteria in breast milk of mothers from the low-income group in nigeria.
AB  == the aerobic bacteria colonizing breast milk of the low-income group in nigeria were quantified to assess its suitability for use in milk banks. in parallel, the nutritional and health status of donating mothers and their infants were assessed by physicians. the aerobic bacteria contained in the specimens included streptococcus salivarius, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermides. in general, the microbial load found in these milk samples is lower than levels considered dangerous. an analysis of the results showed that 50% of the mother's milk is contaminated, 17% of which was infected with primary pathogens. there was no correlation between demographic data, nutritional or health status of either mother or infant and microbial load  in mother's milk. milk obtained from this socio-economic group, is therefore, considered safe for use in milk banks.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. observation on the mics and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (cmx) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. cmx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and haemophilus influenzae and also streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. against staphylococci and serratia marcescens, cmx showed the antimicrobial activity with mic90 6.25 micrograms/ml. however, cmx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against streptococcus faecalis. reliability of cmx disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of cmx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, capable of utilizing cmx disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of cmx. using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms cmx, fuchs et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm =  mic 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = mic 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. in this investigation, the  following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = mic greater than 3  to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = mic greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = mic greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). based on cmx pharmacokinetic data currently available, mic break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.

TI  == five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  == in a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics90) against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter aerogenes. subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized,  crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. the 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. the area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at  least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the mic90 for all seven groups of pathogens;  at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the mic90 against the majority of bacterial groups. in contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the mic90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin  were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. these data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the mics90  longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.

AB  == a new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam derivative, 6059-s, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. twenty-five patients were treated with 10 to 274 mg/kg per day of 6059-s by intravenous administrations. the diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute bronchitis (2), pneumonia (4), pertussis (4), acute enterocolitis (2), recurrent urinary tract infection (2), suspected septicemia (3), and acute purulent meningitis (1); and the remaining 5  patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. the pathogens recovered were streptococcus pneumoniae (1), haemophilus influenzae (4), haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), enterobacter cloacae (1), enterobacter aerogenes (1), proteus morganii (1), psuedomonas aeruginosa (2) and salmonella typhimurium (1). all the  patients of bacterial infections were cured after the 6059-s therapy. however, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium were not eradicated after the 6059-s therapy, and the rate of bacterial disappearance was 75%. diarrhea (3), precordial pain (2, only in cases with high-dose therapy), transient elevation of got and gpt (2), and transient eosinophilia (2) were found to be associated with  the 6059-s therapy. however, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. half life of the serum 6059-s level was 1.34 +/- 0.16 hours. csf concentrations in a case with haemophilus influenzae meningitis ranged 4.0 to 9.7 mcg/ml after an intravenous injection of 34.3 to 75 mg/kg of 6059-s. from the present study, 6059-s appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections. it remains to be further determined whether 6059-s is superior to abpc in the treatment of haemophilus influenzae meningitis.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of some cyclic hydroxamic acids and related lactams.
AB  == against enterobacter aerogenes 13048, serratia marcescens 13880, klebsiella pneumoniae 10031, pseudomonas aeruginosa 10145, escherichia coli 9723, lactobacillus casei 7469, lactobacillus plantarum 8014, leuconostoc dextranicum 8086, and streptococcus faecalis 8043, the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of three cyclic hydroxamic acids, 3-amino-3,4-dihydro-1-hydroxycarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 0.6, 0.6, and 0.2 micrograms/ml, and those of the corresponding lactams, 3-amino-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 60, 60, and 6 micrograms/ml, respectively. under the same assay conditions the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of chloramphenicol and kanamycin were both 2 micrograms/ml. in addition, the cyclic hydroxamic acids but not the lactams inhibited the growth of candida albicans at minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 20 to 200 micrograms/ml, at ph 7, as compared with that of amphotericin b, at 2 micrograms/ml.

TI  == [infective situation in a cow barn contaminated with klebsiella mastitis].
AB  == the infection situation in a four-row cow-house for 153 animals with a frequent occurrence of klebsiella mastitis was subject to a detailed analysis. the following results were obtained after two collections of blood and udder-quarter  milk samples examined by the test-tube agglutination, gel precipitation, and bacteriological diagnosis methods: 1. streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from  milk samples 28 and 31 times, pseudomonas aeruginosa 15 and 19 times, staphylococcus arueus 16 and 19 times, klebsiella pneumoniae 6 and 6 times, acinetobacter calcoaceticus once and 4 times, enterobacter aerogenes twice and three times, and escherichia coli twice. the authors failed to determine the causative agent in 26--38 cows (20--30%) with a pathologically changed secretion. 2. double test-tube agglutination performed in a 30-day interval revealed suspected klebsiella antibodies having a titre of 80 + + and higher in 13 dairy cows (12%); however, the suspicion was disproved by the negative results of gel precipitation. 3. the final deduction concerning the exogenic character of klebsiella mastitis should encourage efforts for good housing, due nutrition, efficacious disinfection, and hygienic milk production.

TI  == [approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  == in this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. this system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (ph-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (uripret-g). a total of 130 cultures was investigated. the employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. they included the following species: candida albicans, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus inconstans, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris, serratia liquefaciens, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus faecium. employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.

TI  == acute severe mastitis in cows of the dutch-friesian breed (author's transl).
AB  == one hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. e. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by st. aureus (19%), c. pyogenes (10%), str. dysgalactiae (9%), str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, aerobacter aerogenes, kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and  p. multocida. in several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. the prognosis will vary with the causative organism. treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.

TI  == butirosin, a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex: antibacterial activity in vitro and in mice.
AB  == butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. significantly susceptible bacteria include strains  of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae,  proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris, salmonella enteritidis and s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri and s. sonnei. good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained  in various acute mouse infections. butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.

TI  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. four of six different strains, including the propagating s. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. all six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. in contrast to sensitive s. aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella montevideo, s. zymogenes, and diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. among gram-positive bacteria, only d. pneumoniae inhibited s. aureus bacteriostasis. agglutinins of s. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, c-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for s. aureus serum bacteriostasis. after diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins a, g, and m appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. it is suggested that s. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions  with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.

TI  == the bacterial induction of homograft sensitivity. ii. effects of sensitization with staphylococci and other microoorganisms.
AB  == heat-killed strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus albus can induce  in guinea pigs a state of altered reactivity to skin homografts which is indistinguishable from that which results from sensitization with homologous tissues or group a streptococci. challenge of suitably prepared recipients with first-set skin homografts obtained from unrelated randomly selected donors elicits white graft reactions or accelerated rejection of such grafts. other bacteria tested included lancefield streptococcal groups b, c, d, e, g, h, l, and o, pneumococcus types ii, iii, xiv and a rough strain, corynebacterium xerosis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, aerobacter aerogenes, salmonella typhimurium, proteus vulgaris, neisseria catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and two human virulent strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis. none of these microorganisms was active in the induction of homograft sensitivity in the guinea pig. pretreatment of recipients with gram-negative bacterial suspensions was associated with a slight increase in the mean survival time of first-set skin homografts. results of this study suggest the presence in staphylococci, as well  as in group a streptococci, of antigens related in their biologic effects to tissue transplantation antigens.

TI  == effect of naturally occurring xanthines on bacteria. i. antimicrobial action and  potentiating effect on antibiotic spectra.
AB  == the effect of xanthines on various microorganisms was studied. the antibacterial  effect was not high; most of the test organisms could easily withstand a concentration of 2,500 mug/ml. caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. the effect was both bacteriostatic and  bactericidal against susceptible organisms. the susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. the morphology of aerobacter  aerogenes and a. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. this potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.

TI  == in vitro biological activity of cephalothin.
AB  == chang, te-wen (tufts university school of medicine, boston, mass.) and louis weinstein. in vitro biological activity of cephalothin. j. bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. shigella, salmonella, and proteus mirabilis were the most  sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. escherichia coli and aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa and  herellea were highly resistant. penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of s. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with s. aureus. cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. this antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin g but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.
