TI  == characterization, validation and application of a dna microarray for the detection of mandatory and other waterborne pathogens.
AB  == culture methods for the detection of indicator bacteria are currently used for detection of waterborne bacteria. the need for an increased range of analyzed bacteria coupled with the obtainment of rapid and early results justify the development of a dna microarray for the identification of waterborne pathogens. this dna microarray has 16 implanted probes with a median size of 147 bases, targeting 12 different parameters, including all mandatory indicator microorganisms, such as escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, total and fecal coliforms and enterococci. the validation performed with dna extracted from pure microbial cultures showed the suitability of the probes for detection of the target microorganism. to overcome  the high dilution of water samples it was included either a prior culture step of bacterial contaminants retained after filtering 100 ml of water, or a 10-fold increase in the volume of filtered water, that resulted in the increase of the detected bacteria. the analysis of complex environmental water samples using culture methods and the dna microarray revealed that the latter detected the same parameters plus other bacteria tested only in the dna microarray. the results show that this dna microarray may be a useful tool for water microbiological surveillance.

TI  == recovery of staphylococcus aureus in gray mugil cephalus roe (bottarga): investigation by an integrated cultural/molecular approach.
AB  == in the mediterranean area, salted and dried roe from the gray mugil cephalus "bottarga" represent a speciality food with great commercial value. bottarga is currently produced by a traditional handmade process and, the risk of human bacterial contamination during its manufacturing is still unknown; in this perspective the foodborne pathogen staphylococcus aureus could potentially contaminate this product due to poor sanitation or bad handling during processing. the aim of this work is: to evaluate the contamination level of foodborne pathogens at different product manufacturing stages and, in addition, to describe a fast and realizable method for the rapid detection of s. aureus in  bottarga samples in the field. a cultural procedure was initially used to investigate the occurrence of s. aureus and the other main foodborne pathogens in bottarga samples at the different manufacturing stages (from roe to final product). in addition, a molecular approach was used to rapidly determine the presence of total bacteria, s. aureus, and its potential toxigenicity. of the 194 specimens analyzed, we identified: clostridium perfringens, enterococcus spp. and enterobacteriaceae. however, some samples resulted as being contaminated with s.  aureus (4% in roe and 8.7% in the final product). during the bottarga manufacturing process, we observed an increase in pathogen levels (from 10(2) to  10(5) cfu/g) in contaminated samples, and enta and entb genotypes were identified. reconstruction experiments suggest that the fresh roe and the bottarga (not completely dried) could represent a risk for the contamination and  growth of pathogen bacteria.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  == foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as campylobacter jejuni,  bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica,  staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, and vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely  affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. to help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by  different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and  physicochemical methods (heat, uv light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. possible areas for future research are suggested. plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the  potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. the collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  == the present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (fabs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). samples were screened for escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic  plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log cfu/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (p < 0.05), whereas the  other fabs contained , 25 cfu/25 ml microorganisms. unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7  to 14.1%) or ph (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and b. cereus (detected in all fabs) were present in some products. b. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other  fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (p < 0.05). the finding that spore-forming b. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality fab products. new strategic quality management plans for various fabs are needed.

TI  == expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in canada.
AB  == enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in canada and globally. understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously,  to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information  is difficult or expensive to obtain. thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. the elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. transmission was attributed primarily to food for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, cyclospora cayetanensis, trichinella spp., all three vibrio spp. categories explored, and yersinia enterocolitica. multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as campylobacter spp., four escherichia coli categories, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., and staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. water was the primary pathway for giardia spp. and cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and shigella spp. consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. this study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for canada, considering all possible transmission routes. further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and e. coli subgroups in canada.

TI  == hygienisation and nutrient conservation of sewage sludge or cattle manure by lactic acid fermentation.
AB  == manure from animal farms and sewage sludge contain pathogens and opportunistic organisms in various concentrations depending on the health of the herds and human sources. other than for the presence of pathogens, these waste substances are excellent nutrient sources and constitute a preferred organic fertilizer. however, because of the pathogens, the risks of infection of animals or humans increase with the indiscriminate use of manure, especially liquid manure or sludge, for agriculture. this potential problem can increase with the global connectedness of animal herds fed imported feed grown on fields fertilized with local manures. this paper describes a simple, easy-to-use, low-tech hygienization method which conserves nutrients and does not require large investments in infrastructure. the proposed method uses the microbiotic shift during mesophilic  fermentation of cow manure or sewage sludge during which gram-negative bacteria,  enterococci and yeasts were inactivated below the detection limit of 3 log10 cfu/g while lactobacilli increased up to a thousand fold. pathogens like salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, e. coli ehec o:157 and vegetative clostridium perfringens were inactivated within 3 days of fermentation. in addition, ecbo-viruses and eggs of ascaris suum were inactivated within 7 and 56 days, respectively. compared to the mass lost through composting  (15-57%), the loss of mass during fermentation (< 2.45%) is very low and provides strong economic and ecological benefits for this process. this method might be an acceptable hygienization method for developed as well as undeveloped countries, and could play a key role in public and animal health while safely closing the nutrient cycle by reducing the necessity of using energy-inefficient inorganic fertilizer for crop production.

TI  == characterization of deep sea fish gut bacteria with antagonistic potential, from  centroscyllium fabricii (deep sea shark).
AB  == the bacterial isolates from centroscyllium fabricii (deep sea shark) gut were screened for antagonistic activity by cross-streak method and disc diffusion assay. this study focuses on strain btss-3, which showed antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria including salmonella typhimurium, proteus vulgaris, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, bacillus circulans, bacillus macerans and bacillus pumilus. btss3 was subjected to phenotypic characterization using biochemical tests, sem imaging, exoenzyme profiling and antibiotic susceptibility tests. comparative 16s rdna gene sequence analysis indicated that this strain belonged to the genus bacillus, with high (98 %) similarity to 16s rdna sequences of bacillus amyloliquefaciens. the chemical nature of the antibacterial substance was identified by treatment with proteolytic enzymes. the antibacterial activity was reduced by the action of these enzymes pointing out its peptide nature. it was observed from the growth and production kinetics that the bacteriocin was produced in the eighth hour of incubation, i.e., during the mid-log growth phase of the bacteria.

TI  == spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-clostridium activity from actinomadura sp. 2eps.
AB  == the rare actinomycetes strain 2eps was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell  wall, and 16s rrna gene sequence indicates that 2eps belongs to genus actinomadura. in addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the  relationships of this strain to other members of actinomadura. a butanol extract  with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. the structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)h-nmr and (13)c-nmr) and mass spectrometric analysis (hr-tof-ms). compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the japanese patent number jp 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are be-45722a (1), be-45722b (2) and be-45722c (3), respectively. all compounds were active against  gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, bacillus cereus atcc 14579, and b. subtilis atcc 6633) with low mic values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar mic values, against clostridium perfringens s107 at 0.63 microg/ml and c. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. these results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of clostridium infections. overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == cost-of-illness and disease burden of food-related pathogens in the netherlands,  2011.
AB  == to inform risk management decisions on control and prevention of food-related disease, both the disease burden expressed in disability adjusted life years (daly) and the cost-of-illness of food-related pathogens are estimated and presented. disease burden of fourteen pathogens that can be transmitted by food,  the environment, animals and humans was previously estimated by havelaar et al. (2012). in this paper we complement these by cost-of-illness estimates. together, these present a complete picture of the societal burden of food-related diseases. using incidence estimates for 2011, community-acquired non-consulting cases, patients consulting their general practitioner, hospitalized patients and the incidence of sequelae and fatal cases, estimates were obtained for dalys, direct  healthcare costs (e.g. costs for doctor's fees, hospitalizations and medicines),  direct non-healthcare costs (e.g. travel costs to and from the doctor), indirect  non-healthcare costs (e.g. productivity loss, special education) and total costs. the updated disease burden for 2011 was equal to 13,940 daly/year (undiscounted)  or 12,650 daly/year (discounted at 1.5%), and was of the same magnitude as previous estimates. at the population-level thermophilic campylobacter spp., toxoplasma gondii and rotavirus were associated with the highest disease burden.  perinatal listeriosis infection was associated with the highest daly per symptomatic case. the total cost-of-illness in 2011 of fourteen food-related pathogens and associated sequelae was estimated at euro 468 million/year, if undiscounted, and at euro 416 million/year if discounted by 4%. direct healthcare costs accounted for 24% of total costs, direct non-healthcare costs for 2% and indirect non-healthcare costs for 74% of total costs. at the population-level, norovirus had the highest total cost-of-illness in 2011 with euro 106 million/year, followed by thermophilic campylobacter spp. (euro 76 million/year)  and rotavirus (euro 73 million/year). cost-of-illness per infected case varied from euro 150 for clostridium perfringens intoxications to euro 275,000 for perinatal listeriosis. both incident cases and fatal cases are more strongly correlated with coi/year than with daly/year. more than 40% of all cost-of-illness and dalys can be attributed to food, in total euro 168 million/year and 5,150 daly/year for 2011. beef, lamb, pork and poultry meat alone accounted for 39% of these costs. products of animal origin accounted for euro 86 million/year (or 51% of the costs attributed to food) and 3,320 daly/year (or 64% of the disease burden attributed to food). among the pathogens studied staphylococcus aureus intoxications accounted for the highest share of costs attributed to food (euro 47.1 million/year), followed by campylobacter spp. (euro 32.0 million/year) and norovirus (euro 17.7 million/year).

TI  == comparison of two methods of bacterial dna extraction from human fecal samples contaminated with clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, and campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == in this study, 2 methods of dna extraction were evaluated for use in conjunction  with the screening system rapid foodborne bacterial screening 24 (rfbs24), which  employs multiplex real-time sybr green polymerase chain reaction (sg-pcr) and can simultaneously detect 24 target genes of foodborne pathogens in fecal dna samples. the qiaamp dna stool mini kit (qkit) and ultra clean fecal dna isolation kit (ukit) were used for bacterial dna extraction from fecal samples artificially inoculated with clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, and campylobacter jejuni. sg-pcr and simplex real-time quantitative  pcr (s-qpcr) analyses revealed higher copy numbers (8-234 times) of dna in samples obtained using ukit compared with those obtained using qkit, resulting in lower cycle threshold values for the ukit samples of the 4 bacteria on sg-pcr analysis. fecal dna samples from patients infected during foodborne outbreaks of  salmonella and campylobacter were also prepared by qkit and ukit methods and subjected to rfbs24 analyses. higher numbers of rfbs24 bacterial target genes were detected in dna samples obtained using ukit compared with those obtained using qkit. thus, the higher dna extraction efficiency of the ukit method compared with qkit renders the former more useful in achieving improved detection rates of these 4 bacteria in fecal samples using sg-pcr.

TI  == high incidence of staphylococcus aureus and norovirus gastroenteritis in infancy: a single-center, 1-year experience.
AB  == purpose: the etiology of acute gastroenteritis (age) has changed since the introduction of the rotavirus vaccination. the aim of this study was to clarify which common pathogens, both bacterial and viral, are currently causing age in infants. methods: infants with acute diarrhea were enrolled. we tested for 10 bacterial pathogens and five viral pathogens in stool specimens collected from infants with age. the clinical symptoms such as vomiting, mucoid or bloody diarrhea, dehydration, irritability, and poor oral intake were recorded, and laboratory data such as white blood cell count and c-reactive protein were collected. the clinical and laboratory data for the cases with bacterial pathogens and the cases with viral pathogens were compared. results: of 41 total  infants, 21 (51.2%) were positive for at least one pathogen. seventeen cases (41.5%) were positive for bacterial pathogens and seven cases (17.1%) were positive for viral pathogens. staphylococcus aureus (13 cases, 31.7%) and clostridium perfringens (four cases, 9.8%) were common bacterial pathogens. norovirus (five cases, 12.2%) was the most common viral pathogen. fever and respiratory symptoms were common in the isolated viral infection group (p=0.023 and 0.044, respectively), whereas other clinical and laboratory data were indistinguishable between the groups. conclusion: in our study, s. aureus (41.5%) and norovirus (12.2%) were the most common bacterial and viral pathogens, respectively, among infants with age.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from australian dairy farm environments.
AB  == the ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. in dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this  transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. this survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3  caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in victoria, australia. a total  of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. the prevalence of the bacillus cereus group, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens,  cronobacter, shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli, listeria, salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (cps), and yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. the 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the b. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. the highest occurrence of any pathogen was the b. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. all of the cps were staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. pathogenic listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 l. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 l. monocytogenes-positive water sample. shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a  single raw milk sample. cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms,  predominantly in feed samples. no y. enterocolitica was detected. results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as cl. perfringens and b. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.

TI  == bacterial contamination of fabric and metal-bead identity card lanyards: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == in healthcare, fabric or metal-bead lanyards are universally used for carrying identity cards. however there is little information on microbial contamination with potential pathogens that may readily re-contaminate disinfected hands. we examined 108 lanyards from hospital staff. most grew skin flora but 7/108 (6%) had potentially pathogenic bacteria: four grew methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and four grew probable fecal flora: 3 clostridium perfringens and 1 clostridium bifermentans (one lanyard grew both s. aureus and c. bifermentans). unused (control) lanyards had little or no such contamination.  the median duration of lanyard wear was 12 months (interquartile range 3-36 months). 17/108 (16%) of the lanyards had reportedly undergone decontamination including wiping with alcohol, chlorhexidine or chlorine dioxide; and washing with soap and water or by washing machine. metal-bead lanyards had significantly  lower median bacterial counts than those from fabric lanyards (1 vs. 4 cfu/cm(2); mann-whitney u=300.5; p<0.001). 12/32 (38%) of the metal-bead lanyards grew no bacteria, compared with 2/76 (3%) of fabric lanyards. we recommend that an effective decontamination regimen be instituted by those who use fabric lanyards, or that fabric lanyards be discarded altogether in preference for metal-bead lanyards or clip-on identity cards.

TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == gut microbiome in sudden infant death syndrome (sids) differs from that in healthy comparison babies and offers an explanation for the risk factor of prone  position.
AB  == the role of bacteria in the causation of sudden infant death syndrome (sids) is gaining acceptance. mainstream research favouring respiratory compromise has failed to provide a plausible pathogenetic mechanism despite many years of investigation and thousands of research papers. bacterial colonisation of the colon of the human infant is influenced by many factors including age, mode of delivery, diet, environment, and antibiotic exposure. the gut microbiome influences development of the immune system. the gut microflora could be important in protection against the bacteria and/or their toxins purportedly involved in sids pathogenesis. the aim was to perform a preliminary investigation of the gut microflora in sudden infant death syndrome (sids) compared with live comparison babies. the intestinal contents from 52 sids, and 102 faecal samples from age-matched live comparison infants were screened by pcr to target 16s rna genes of clostridium innocuum, cl. perfringens, cl. difficile, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and staphylococcus aureus. gut colonisation of the babies with these bacteria was analysed in relation to age, gender and type of feeding; and for sids babies sleeping position. cl. difficile, cl. innocuum and b. thetaiotaomicron were significantly associated with sids with 25%, 46% and 30% of cases pcr positive for these respective bacteria compared with only 6%, 23% and 8.8% respectively in the comparison group. sids babies had dual colonisation by both cl. perfringens and cl. difficile significantly more often than comparison babies and also with triple colonisation by cl. perfringens, cl. difficile and cl. innocuum. sids babies were more often colonised by s. aureus than comparison  babies. in addition, sids babies found prone were significantly more likely to be colonised by s. aureus than for other positions recorded (or = infinity; ci = 2.04 - infinity). no significant differences between breast and bottle-fed sids babies was observed in regard to each clostridial bacterium, or s. aureus, however cl. innocuum was found to be significantly associated with formula feeding in the comparison cohort. comparison of breast and formula feeding of sids babies with live comparison babies revealed significant differences with regards to some of the clostridial bacteria. age-specific differences in gut bacterial microbiome were observed in both sids and comparison healthy babies. this study gives an insight into differences in the gut bacterial microbiome of sids babies compared with healthy babies. these differences could be important in contributing to a baby's susceptibility to infection and therefore to sids. the association of s. aureus colonisation with prone sleep position supports the hypothesis that prone sleep position could increase the risk of ingestion/inhalation of bacteria contaminating the sleeping surface and could account for the increased risk of sids in babies who are put to sleep prone. the  study provides impetus for broader studies into the gut microbiome of babies and  could lead to effective approaches to sids prevention.

TI  == use of essential oils and extracts from spices in meat protection.
AB  == the hydro distillation method was used in this study to get essential oils (eos)  from cumin (cuminum cyminum l.), clove (eugenia caryohyllata) and elecampane (inula helenium l.) and the co-hydro distillation method (addition of fatty acid  ethyl esters as extraction cosolvents) to get functional extracts (efs). the mic  (minimum inhibitory concentration) and the mbc (minimum bactericidal concentration) were determined on five pathogenic strains (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus and toxoplasma gondi). the results showed that essential oils of cumin and clove and  their functional extracts are effective on concentrations from 500 mg/l to 750 mg/l. the essential oils with functional extracts were used on meat samples at three different concentrations: 750, 1,500 and 2,250 mul. the cumin essential oil produced a reduction of 3.78 log ufc/g with the application of 750 mul, the clove essential oil produced a reduction of 3.78 log ufc/g with the application of 2,250 mul and the cumin and clove functional extracts got a reduction of 3.6 log  ufc/g. by chromatography, eugenol was identified in the clove oil, cuminaldehyde  in the cumin oil and the isoalactolactones and alactolactones in the elecampane oil as main compounds on the chemical composition of the essential oils and functional extracts obtained.

AB  == clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus are the two important bacteria  frequently associated with majority of the soft tissue infections. the severity and progression of the diseases caused by these pathogens are attributed primarily to the alpha toxins they produce. previously, we synthesized a non-toxic chimeric molecule r-alphacs encompassing the binding domains of c. perfringens and s. aureus alpha toxins and demonstrated that the r-alphacs hyperimmune polysera reacts with both the native wild type toxins. in the present report, we evaluated efficacy of r-alphacs in conferring protection against c. perfringens and s. aureus alpha toxin infections in murine model. immunization of balb/c with r-alphacs was effective in inducing both high titers of serum anti-r-alphacs antibodies after three administrations. sub-typing the antibody pool revealed high proportions of igg1 indicating a th2-polarized immune response. the r-alphacs stimulated the proliferation of splenocytes from the immunized mice upon re-induction by the antigen, in vitro. the levels of interleukin-10 increased while tnf-alpha was found to be downregulated in the r-alphacs induced splenocytes. mice immunized with r-alphacs were protected against intramuscular challenge with 5xld100 doses of c. perfringens and s. aureus alpha toxins with >80% survival, which killed control animals within 48-72h. passive immunization of mice with anti-r-alphacs serum resulted in 50-80% survival. our results indicate that r-alphacs is a remarkable antigen with protective efficacy against alpha toxin mediated c. perfringens and s. aureus soft tissue co-infections.

TI  == evaluation of a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial contamination in apheresis and pooled random-donor platelet units.
AB  == background: despite existing strategies, bacterial contamination of platelets (plts) remains a problem, and reliable testing near the time of use is needed. we evaluated the bactx assay (immunetics, inc.), a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial peptidoglycan, for this purpose. study design and methods: apheresis- and whole blood-derived plt units, the latter tested in 6-unit pools,  inoculated with 10 representative bacterial species (eight aerobic, two anaerobic), were tested with the bactx assay at two sites to determine analytic sensitivity and time to detection. specificity on sterile plts and reproducibility across different plt units and assay kit lots was also determined. results: analytical sensitivity for the 10 bacterial species ranged from 6.3 x 10(2) to 7.6 x 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. in time-to-detection studies after inoculation of plts with 0.7 to 5.3 cfus/ml, 10 replicates of all eight aerobic species were positive when bacterial titers were  above the analytic sensitivity detection limit, which occurred at 48 hours for 60 plt units and at 72 hours for the remaining 4 units, as well as at 7 days for all units. specificity was 99.8% and reproducibility was 100%. conclusions: the bactx assay had an analytical sensitivity below the 10(5) cfus/ml threshold of clinical significance, detected all eight aerobic bacterial species 48 to 72 hours after inoculation as well as at 7 days, and had high specificity and reproducibility. these findings suggest that the bactx assay will be a valuable test for detection of clinically relevant levels of bacterial contaminants in plt units and pools near time of use.

TI  == potentialities of newly isolated bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus sp for curd  preparation and a comparative study of its physico-chemical parameters with other marketed curds.
AB  == two bacillus sp. were isolated from the local fermented milk and identified on the basis 16s rrna sequence profile as bacillus subtilis akl1 and by biochemical  process as lactobacillus acidophilus akl2. these isolates were used as fresh inoculums for curd preparation individually and in combinations. different physico-chemical and therapeutic properties of the newly prepared curd were examined and compared with marketed local (sweet and sour) and branded (mother dairy and thackar) curds. the total hydrolyzed peptides, free amino acids, lactic acid were significantly higher, whereas, total solid, ash content, syneresis and  free reducing sugar were lower in the curd prepared by a mixture of akl1 and akl2 (0.5:0.5, v/v). the antioxidant activity against abts+, dpph8, oh* and fe3+ were  also higher in the newly formulated curd. polyphenols (85.5 microg/g), flavonoids (12.5 microg/g) and free aromatic amino acids contents were also higher in akl1+akl2. all these components prevent excess protein oxidation that was revealed by sds-page. the curd also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against some entero-pathogens like clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, shigella dysentery, vibrio cholerae and staphylococcus aureus. it can be concluded that the combination of these lactobacillus sp. will be a fruitful inoculum for the preparation of curd having better health promoting effects.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

AB  == medical microbiology laboratories play a key role in the investigation of foodborne disease outbreaks. bacterial pathogens (salmonella, escherichia coli, campylobacter, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, etc) have historically been implicated in foodborne illness, while the role of viruses (especially norovirus) appears to have been underestimated. culture-based diagnosis has gradually been complemented, or replaced, by rapid molecular methods applied directly to biological samples. these new tools should help to reduce the number of outbreaks in which the etiological agent goes unidentified,  and to improve the exhaustiveness of notifications.

TI  == bio-preservation of ground beef meat by enterococcus faecalis cect7121.
AB  == meat and particularly ground beef is frequently associated with food poisoning episodes and breeches in food safety. the main goal of this research was to evaluate the bactericide effect of the probiotic enterococcus faecalis cect7121,  against different pathogens as: escherichia coli o157:h7, staphylococcus aureus,  clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes, inoculated in ground beef meat. three studies were performed to evaluate the inhibition of e. faecalis cect7121 on ground beef meat samples inoculated with pathogens: study i: samples  (100 g meat) were inoculated with pathogens (10(3) cfu/g)) and e. faecalis cect7121 (10(4) cfu/g) simultaneously. study ii: samples were inoculated with e.  faecalis cect7121 24 h before the pathogens. study iii: e. faecalis cect7121were  inoculated 24 h after pathogens. the viable counts were performed at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h post-inoculation. the simultaneous inoculation of e. faecalis cect7121 with e. coli o157:h7 strains resulted in the absence of viable counts of bacteria at 72 h post-treatment. however, when the probiotic was added 24 h before and 24  h after the pathogen e. coli o157:h7, viable cells were not detected at 24 h and  48 h post-treatment, respectively. consistently, neither s. aureus nor cl. perfringens viable bacteria were detected at 48 h in whole assays when inoculated with e. faecalis cect7121. the same trend than described before was obtained after applying the 3 models assayed for l. monocytogenes. the current assays demonstrated the bactericide activity of e. faecalis cect7121 strain on bacterial pathogens in ground beef meat.

TI  == structural insights into delta toxin pore formation.
AB  == clostridium perfringens delta toxin is one of the three hemolysin-like proteins produced by c. perfringens type c and possibly type b strains. one of the others, netb, has been shown to be the major cause of avian nectrotic enteritis, which following the reduction in use of antibiotics as growth promoters, has become an  emerging disease of industrial poultry. delta toxin itself is cytotoxic to the wide range of human and animal macrophages and platelets that present gm2 ganglioside on their membranes. it has sequence similarity with staphylococcus aureus beta-pore forming toxins and is expected to heptamerize and form pores in  the lipid bilayer of host cell membranes. nevertheless, its exact mode of action  remains undetermined. here we report the 2.4 a crystal structure of monomeric delta toxin. the superposition of this structure with the structure of the phospholipid-bound f component of s. aureus leucocidin (lukf) revealed that the glycerol molecules bound to delta toxin and the phospholipids in lukf are accommodated in the same hydrophobic clefts, corresponding to where the toxin is  expected to latch onto the membrane, though the binding sites show significant differences. from structure-based sequence alignment with the known structure of  staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin, a model of the delta toxin pore form has been built. using electron microscopy, we have validated our model and characterized the delta toxin pore on liposomes. these results highlight both similarities and  differences in the mechanism of delta toxin (and by extension netb) cytotoxicity  from that of the staphylococcal pore-forming toxins.

TI  == targeting agr- and agr-like quorum sensing systems for development of common therapeutics to treat multiple gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  == invasive infection by the gram-positive pathogen staphylococcus aureus is controlled by a four gene operon, agr that encodes a quorum sensing system for the regulation of virulence. while agr has been well studied in s. aureus, the contribution of agr homologues and analogues in other gram-positive pathogens is  just beginning to be understood. intriguingly, other significant human pathogens, including clostridium perfringens, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis contain agr or analogues linked to virulence. moreover, other significant human gram-positive pathogens use peptide based quorum sensing systems to establish or maintain infection. the potential for commonality in aspects of these signaling systems across different species raises the prospect of identifying therapeutics that could target multiple pathogens. here, we review the status of research into these agr homologues, analogues, and other peptide based quorum sensing systems in gram-positive pathogens as well as the potential  for identifying common pathways and signaling mechanisms for therapeutic discovery.

AB  == infections with pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, riemerella anatipestifer, and escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. it can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks.  the aim of this study was to develop a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single  tube reaction. the target genes used were kmt1 of p. multocida, the invasion protein gene of s. enterica, 16s rdna of r. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of e. coli. the detection limit of the assay for all bacterial dna was 10 pg. the mpcr did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, mycoplasma gallinarum, mycoplasma synoviae, and mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. we applied mpcr to field samples, and the results were the same as the single pcr results. these results suggest that mpcr for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.

AB  == clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic bacterium that causes numerous important  human and animal diseases, primarily as a result of its ability to produce many different protein toxins. in chickens, c. perfringens causes necrotic enteritis,  a disease of economic importance to the worldwide poultry industry. the secreted  pore-forming toxin netb is a key virulence factor in the pathogenesis of avian necrotic enteritis and is similar to alpha-hemolysin, a beta-barrel pore-forming  toxin from staphylococcus aureus. to address the molecular mechanisms underlying  netb-mediated tissue damage, we determined the crystal structure of the monomeric form of netb to 1.8 a. structural comparisons with other members of the alpha-hemolysin family revealed significant differences in the conformation of the membrane binding domain. these data suggested that netb may recognize different membrane receptors or use a different mechanism for membrane-protein interactions. consistent with this idea, electrophysiological experiments with planar lipid bilayers revealed that netb formed pores with much larger single-channel conductance than alpha-hemolysin. channel conductance varied with  phospholipid net charge. furthermore, netb differed in its ion selectivity, preferring cations over anions. using hemolysis as a screen, we carried out a random-mutagenesis study that identified several residues that are critical for netb-induced cell lysis. mapping of these residues onto the crystal structure revealed that they were clustered in regions predicted to be required for oligomerization or membrane binding. together these data provide an insight into  the mechanism of netb-mediated pore formation and will contribute to our understanding of the mode of action of this important toxin. importance necrotic  enteritis is an economically important disease of the worldwide poultry industry  and is mediated by clostridium perfringens strains that produce netb, a beta-pore-forming toxin. we carried out structural and functional studies of netb to provide a mechanistic insight into its mode of action and to assist in the development of a necrotic enteritis vaccine. we determined the structure of the monomeric form of netb to 1.8 a, used both site-directed and random mutagenesis to identify key residues that are required for its biological activity, and analyzed pore formation by netb and its substitution-containing derivatives in planar lipid bilayers.

TI  == clinicobiochemical investigations of gangrenous mastitis in does: immunological responses and oxidative stress biomarkers.
AB  == a total of 50 does were used to determine selected hematological and biochemical  parameters with special references to oxidative stress markers, acute phase protein profiles, and proinflammatory cytokines in healthy and gangrenous mastitis affected does. animals were divided into two equal groups represented as clinically healthy (control) and diseased groups, respectively. the bacteriological examination of milk samples from diseased does revealed many types of bacterial infection. the isolated bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (n=23/25), escherichia coli (n=11/25), and clostridium perfringens (n=4/25). there was a significant increase in the levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate, non-esterified free fatty acids, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c), aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase and a significant reduction in the levels of glucose, cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) in does with gangrenous mastitis compared to healthy does. moreover, there was a significant increase in the levels of malondialdehyde and uric acid with a significant decrease in the levels of reduced glutathione, super oxide dismutase, and catalase in does with gangrenous  mastitis compared to healthy does. in addition, there was a significant increase  in the haptoglobin, serum amyloid a, fibrinogen, interleukin 6 (il-6), il-1beta,  and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) in does with gangrenous mastitis compared to healthy ones. conclusively, oxidative stress biomarkers, acute phase  proteins, and proinflammatory cytokines play an essential task as biomarkers for  gangrenous mastitis in does. mastitis may be considered as one of the ketotic stressors in does after parturition.

TI  == taguchi optimization of duplex pcr for simultaneous identification of staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens alpha toxins.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens are two major bacteria that infect open wounds and delay the healing process. the rapid and progressive deterioration of soft tissue during s. aureus and c. perfringens coinfections is  due to analogous necrotic alpha toxins produced by the two organisms. the aim of  this study was to determine the alpha toxins of s. aureus and c. perfringens by duplex pcr. the pcr assay employed two sets of primers: hlaf/r to amplify staphylococcal alpha toxin gene hla (274 bp) and cpaf/r to amplify clostridial alpha toxin gene cpa (398 bp) along with a competitive internal amplification control (608 bp), simultaneously. optimization of the duplex pcr assay was achieved by a modified taguchi method, an engineering optimization process, in a  nine-tube combinatorial array. the detection level of the duplex pcr was found to be 10 pg of purified dna or 10(3 ) cfu ml(-1) of s. aureus and 100 pg of purified dna or 10(4) cfu ml(-1) of c. perfringens. other bacteria routinely found in tissue infections were tested for cross-reactivity and the duplex pcr turned out  to be highly specific. this duplex pcr assay provides a rapid, robust and reliable alternative to the existing conventional techniques in establishing the  aetiology of s. aureus and c. perfringens in soft tissue infections.

TI  == phytochemical profiles of volatile constituents from centaurea ragusina leaves and flowers and their antimicrobial effects.
AB  == the volatile oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of the croatian endemic plant centaurea ragusina l. were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. the chemical compositions, determined by gc and gc-ms, were complex, with sesquiterpenes the most abundant class of compound. nonterpene hydrocarbons were  also identified in high quantities, while acids and ketones were found in high quantities only in the leaf volatile oil. aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other compounds were identified in lower quantities. antimicrobial effects of the volatile samples were investigated by using the disc diffusion and microdilution  assays. they were found to inhibit a wide range of bacteria and fungi, causing in vitro growth inhibition at a concentration of 250 microg/ml. the volatile oils displayed great antibacterial potential with mic values ranging from 16 to 128 microg/ml against the gram-positive bacteria bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, and lesser activity against the gram-negative bacteria cronobacter sakazakii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal strains (mic  = 32-128 microg/ml).

TI  == microbiologic characteristics of pathogenic bacteria from hospitalized trauma patients who survived wenchuan earthquake.
AB  == the purpose of this study is to investigate the microbiological characterization  of pathogenic bacteria isolated from trauma patients after wenchuan earthquake in 2008. most infections were identified in the patients over 60 years of age, with  an incidence rate of 78.5%, and more infections in wound (43.3%) and respiratory  tract (37.1%) sites were identified. a total of 97 non-duplicated clinical pathogens were isolated from 91 trauma patients. of those pathogens, 62 (63.9%) were gram-negative bacilli, 23 (23.7%) were gram-positive cocci, 9 (9.3%) were fungi, and 3 (3.1%) were anaerobes, such as clostridium perfringens. the distribution spectrum of pathogens isolated from trauma patients after earthquake was different to that from non-earthquake trauma patients in our hospital at the  same time. the most prevalent pathogenic isolates were escherichia coli (15.4%),  acinetobacter baumannii (14.4%), staphylococcus aureus (12.3%), burkholderia cepacia (11.3%), and enterococcus spp. (9.3%). the drug susceptibility results showed that most of the gram-negative bacilli, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa  and burkholderia cepacia, were susceptible to imipenem, but resistant to the first- and the second-generation cephalosporins. most of the gram-positive cocci  were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and synercid/dalfopristin. characteristics of pathogenic bacterium isolated from trauma patients after earthquake have been demonstrated which play an important role in the appropriate treatment of infections.

TI  == prevalence of staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) in food samples associated with foodborne illness in alberta, canada from 2007 to 2010.
AB  == consumption of foods containing staphylococcus aureus can cause severe gastro-intestinal illness. given the fact that over the past decade, canada has seen increasing rates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) carriage and infection, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) and mrsa on foodborne illness in alberta, canada. between january 2007 and december 2010, there were 693 food samples associated with foodborne investigations submitted to the alberta provincial laboratory for public health (provlab). these foods were screened for: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, s. aureus, aeromonas spp., campylobacter spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella, shigella spp., and yersinia spp. s. aureus was identified in 10.5% (73/693) of samples, and of these, 59% (43/73) were co-contaminated with at least one other organism on the screening panel. the s. aureus positive samples included 29 meat, 20 prepared foods containing meat, 11 prepared foods not containing meat, 10 dairy, and three produce. methicillin-resistance was not detected in any isolates tested. these findings indicate that the presence of s. aureus in food associated with foodborne investigations is a cause for concern, and although mrsa was not found, the potential for outbreaks exists, and ongoing surveillance should be sustained.

TI  == nosocomial diarrhea: evaluation and treatment of causes other than clostridium difficile.
AB  == diarrhea is common among hospitalized patients but the causes are distinct from those of diarrhea in the community. we review existing data about the epidemiology of nosocomial diarrhea and summarize recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of diarrhea. clinicians should recognize that most cases of nosocomial diarrhea have a noninfectious etiology, including medications, underlying illness, and enteral feeding. apart from clostridium difficile, the frequency of infectious causes such as norovirus and toxigenic strains of clostridium perfringens, klebsiella oxytoca, staphylococcus aureus, and bacteroides fragilis remains largely undefined and test availability is limited. here we provide a practical approach to the evaluation and management of nosocomial diarrhea when tests for c. difficile are negative.

TI  == generation and characterization of an inter-generic bivalent alpha domain fusion  protein alphacs from clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus for concurrent diagnosis and therapeutic applications.
AB  == aim: to evaluate an inter-generic recombinant alpha domain fusion protein for simultaneous detection and neutralization of clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus alpha toxins. methods and results: truncated portions of clostridial and staphylococcal alpha haemolysin genes were pcr amplified and linked to each other through a hydrophilic flexible glycine linker sequence using overlap-extension pcr to form a chimeric gene alphacs. the recombinant alphacs fusion protein was expressed and characterized for its toxicity, cell binding capacity and haemolysis inhibition properties. the fusion protein was nontoxic and effectively retarded staphylococcal alpha haemolysis, probably by competitively interacting with putative staphylococcal alpha haemolysin receptors on erythrocytes. murine hyperimmune polysera raised against r-alphacs specifically detected 42-kda and 33-kda proteins when culture supernatants of cl. perfringens (clostridial alpha toxin) and staph. aureus (staphylococcal alpha toxin), respectively, were analysed in western blot. the polyclonal antisera effectively diminished the haemolytic action of both the wild-type toxins in vitro. conclusions: the r-alphacs fusion protein was nontoxic competitive inhibitor of staphylococcal alpha haemolysin. the protein elicited specific immune response against cl. perfringens and staph. aureus alpha toxins. the antisera also neutralized the toxicities of both the native wild-type toxins in vitro. significance of the study: the bivalent recombinant alphacs protein could  be a novel intervention in the field of diagnostics and therapeutics against cl.  perfringens and staph. aureus infections, particularly, in case of co-infections  like gangrenous ischaemia, gangrenous mastitis, etc.

TI  == survival trends of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and clostridium perfringens in a sandy south florida beach.

TI  == alanyl-phosphatidylglycerol and lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol are translocated by the same mprf flippases and have similar capacities to protect against the antibiotic daptomycin in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the lysinylation of negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol by mprf proteins reduces the affinity of cationic antimicrobial peptides (camps) for bacterial cytoplasmic membranes and reduces the susceptibility of several gram-positive bacterial pathogens to camps. mprf of staphylococcus aureus encompasses a lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (lys-pg) synthase and a lys-pg flippase domain. in contrast, clostridium perfringens encodes two mprf homologs which specifically synthesize alanyl-phosphatidylglycerol (ala-pg) or lys-pg, while only the lys-pg  synthase is fused to a putative flippase domain. it remains unknown whether cationic lys-pg and zwitterionic ala-pg differ in their capacities to be translocated by mprf flippases and if both can reduce camp susceptibility in gram-positive bacteria. by expressing the mprf proteins of c. perfringens in an s. aureus mprf deletion mutant, we found that both lipids can be efficiently produced in s. aureus. simultaneous expression of the lys-pg and ala-pg synthases led to the production of both lipids and slightly increased the overall amounts of aminoacyl phospholipids. ala-pg production by the corresponding c. perfringens enzyme did not affect susceptibility to camps such as nisin and gallidermin or to the camp-like antibiotic daptomycin. however, coexpression of the ala-pg synthase with flippase domains of lys-pg synthesizing mprf proteins led to a wild-type level of daptomycin susceptibility, indicating that ala-pg can also protect bacterial membranes against daptomycin and suggesting that lys-pg flippases can also translocate the related lipid ala-pg. thus, bacterial aminoacyl phospholipid flippases exhibit more relaxed substrate specificity and ala-pg and lys-pg are more similar in their capacities to modulate membrane functions than anticipated.

TI  == identification and in vitro analysis of the gatd/murt enzyme-complex catalyzing lipid ii amidation in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the peptidoglycan of staphylococcus aureus is characterized by a high degree of crosslinking and almost completely lacks free carboxyl groups, due to amidation of the d-glutamic acid in the stem peptide. amidation of peptidoglycan has been proposed to play a decisive role in polymerization of cell wall building blocks,  correlating with the crosslinking of neighboring peptidoglycan stem peptides. mutants with a reduced degree of amidation are less viable and show increased susceptibility to methicillin. we identified the enzymes catalyzing the formation of d-glutamine in position 2 of the stem peptide. we provide biochemical evidence that the reaction is catalyzed by a glutamine amidotransferase-like protein and a mur ligase homologue, encoded by sa1707 and sa1708, respectively. both proteins,  for which we propose the designation gatd and murt, are required for amidation and appear to form a physically stable bi-enzyme complex. to investigate the reaction in vitro we purified recombinant gatd and murt his-tag fusion proteins and their potential substrates, i.e. udp-murnac-pentapeptide, as well as the membrane-bound cell wall precursors lipid i, lipid ii and lipid ii-gly(5). in vitro amidation occurred with all bactoprenol-bound intermediates, suggesting that in vivo lipid ii and/or lipid ii-gly(5) may be substrates for gatd/murt. inactivation of the gatd active site abolished lipid ii amidation. both, murt and gatd are organized in an operon and are essential genes of s. aureus. blast analysis revealed the presence of homologous transcriptional units in a number of gram-positive pathogens, e.g. mycobacterium tuberculosis, streptococcus pneumonia and clostridium perfringens, all known to have a d-iso-glutamine containing pg. a less negatively charged pg reduces susceptibility towards defensins and may play  a general role in innate immune signaling.

AB  == clostridium perfringens (a versatile pathogenic bacterium) secretes enterotoxins  (the deltatoxin, virulent factor) and causes food borne gastroenteritis and gasgangrene. the organism was isolated and characterized from improperly cooked meat and poultry samples. the isolated organism showed multiple drug resistance indicating that the treatment is challenging. hence, there is need for improved therapeutic agents. the rational design of improved therapeutics requires the crystal structure for the toxin. however, the structure for the toxin is not yet  available in its native form. thus, we modeled the toxin structure using alpha- hemolysin of staphylococcus aureus (pdb: 3m4d chain a) as template. the docking of the toxin with the herbal extract curcumin (1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3- methoxyphenyl)hepta-1,6-diene-3,5-dione) showed a binding energy of -8.6 kcal/mol, in comparison to the known antibiotic linezolid with binding energy of  -6.1 kcal/mol. this data finds application in the design and development of novel compounds against the deltatoxin from clostridium perfringens.

TI  == hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  == in order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). in all cold meat preparations clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other clostridium sp lec(-), as well as lactobacillus, bacillus sp. and salmonella sp. were recovered. for instance bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. l. monocytogenes,  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter lari were absent. differences in the occurrence of s. aureus, salmonella sp., e. coli and spore forms of c. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the  processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. a multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and  pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol  and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. antibiotics commonly used for  therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.

TI  == [factors associated with the quality of well water and the prevalence of waterborne diseases in the municipality of abomey-calavi in benin].
AB  == the objective of this work is to assess the factors associated with the water quality of household wells, suggest solutions to improve it, and study the prevalence of water-borne diseases in this community. the quality of well water and the prevalence of waterborne diseases in the municipality were studied by analysis of the microbiological indicators currently used to assess drinking-water quality and the retrospective study of waterborne diseases treated in the local health centres. the wells surveyed were contaminated by escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp, clostridium perfringens and fecal streptococci, at prevalences of 12.5, 12.2, 12.2, 12.1, 12  and 11.1%, respectively. the high rates of diarrhea, urinary infections, typhoid  fever and abdominal pain found in the retrospective study were consistent with the results of the well-water quality assessment. these results showed that human activity has strongly influenced water quality, especially the lack of sanitation in the different districts and neighbourhoods. other factors affecting the vulnerability of well water include poor waste management by households, the low  depth of the water table, the nature of the soil, and the permeability of the aquifer used. improvement in water quality, sanitation, and personal hygiene will make it possible to reduce considerably the propagation of these diseases and several others. it is therefore important to provide these populations with the necessary equipment for an adequate drinking water supply, but also to promote health education to avoid water pollution. the search for solutions to these problems will lead to a plan for future action.

TI  == rapid label-free identification of mixed bacterial infections by surface plasmon  resonance.
AB  == background: early detection of mixed aerobic-anaerobic infection has been a challenge in clinical practice due to the phenotypic changes in complex environments. surface plasmon resonance (spr) biosensor is widely used to detect  dna-dna interaction and offers a sensitive and label-free approach in dna research. methods: in this study, we developed a single-stranded dna (ssdna) amplification technique and modified the traditional spr detection system for rapid and simultaneous detection of mixed infections of four pathogenic microorganisms (pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium tetani and clostridium perfringens). results: we constructed the circulation detection well to increase the sensitivity and the tandem probe arrays to reduce the non-specific hybridization. the use of 16s rdna universal primers ensured the amplification of four target nucleic acid sequences simultaneously, and further electrophoresis and sequencing confirmed the high efficiency of this amplification method. no significant signals were detected during the single-base mismatch or non-specific probe hybridization (p < 0.05). the calibration curves of amplification products of four bacteria had good linearity from 0.1 nm to 100  nm, with all r(2) values of >0.99. the lowest detection limits were 0.03 nm for p. aeruginosa, 0.02 nm for s. aureus, 0.01 nm for c. tetani and 0.02 nm for c. perfringens. the spr biosensor had the same detection rate as the traditional culture method (p < 0.05). in addition, the quantification of pcr products can be completed within 15 min, and excellent regeneration greatly reduces the cost for  detection. conclusions: our method can rapidly and accurately identify the mixed  aerobic-anaerobic infection, providing a reliable alternative to bacterial culture for rapid bacteria detection.

TI  == isolation of microbial pathogens of subclinical mastitis from raw sheep's milk of epirus (greece) and their role in its hygiene.
AB  == the natural raw milk microflora is a factor that expresses its sensorial characteristics. the microbial charge into the mammary gland of healthy animal is low and the application of right and healthy conditions during milking and cheese making procedure, prevents from contaminating as well as maintains the natural microflora in order to lend the particular characteristics of milk. the purpose of the present project was the study of the total viable count (t.v.c.) and the count of total psychrotropic bacteria of raw sheep milk from boutsiko and karamaniko breeds, collected from healthy animals, as well as the isolation, identification and enumeration of pathogenic bacteria related with the hygiene and the quality of raw sheep milk (with a particular interest in bacteria that may cause human infection). during the experiment we examined two hundred forty (240) samples of raw sheep milk. in these samples a) staphylococcus aureus, salmonella sp., escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens (vegetative cells and spores) and bacillus sp. were isolated and identified b) the total viable count and the total number of psychrotropic bacteria were also specified. the sampling, the preparation of samples and decimal dilutions were based on international methods. the total viable count was determined using the standard methods of the  american public health association, 2002. the total number of psychrotropic bacteria was determined using apha 1976, 1978 rules. the identification of the bacteria was carried out according to the bergey's manual. microscopic examination of gram stained cells, catalase, oxidase and biochemical tests were performed when necessary to further identify. from the 240 milk samples tested, only 5% were e. coli positive, with mean counts ranged from 2 x 10(3) to 2.4 x 10(4) cfu/ml. s. aureus was isolated from 24% of the samples and the mean count per ml was ranged from <10 to 3.4 x 10(2). meanwhile, bacillus spp. was also detected in 29% samples. vegetative forms and spores of c. perfringens were detected in 13% and 63% of the samples respectively. however, microbiological analyses revealed the presence of a small number of selected pathogens in milk samples such as salmonella, which was only detected in 5% of the samples. listeria sp., pseudomonas sp. and vibrio cholerae were never found. from the experimental results, the total viable count from raw sheep milk samples, fulfils the microbiological criteria of eu legislation in a percentage of approximately 97%.

TI  == real-time pcr analysis of enteric pathogens from fecal samples of irritable bowel syndrome subjects.
AB  == background: growing amount of scientific evidence suggests that microbes are involved in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). the predominant fecal microbiota composition of ibs subjects has been widely studied  with dna-based techniques but less research has been focused on the intestinal pathogens in this disorder. here, we optimized a highly sensitive panel of 12 quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assays to shed light on the putative presence of intestinal pathogens in ibs sufferers. the panel was used to screen fecal samples from 96 ibs subjects and 23 healthy controls. results: fifteen ibs samples (17%) tested positive for staphylococcus aureus with a thermonuclease (nuc) gene-targeting qpcr assay, whereas none of the healthy controls were positive for s. aureus (p <0.05). the s. aureus -positive ibs samples were confirmed by sequencing of the pcr amplicons. clostridium perfringens was detected from ibs and control groups with a similar frequency (13% and 17%, respectively) with alpha-toxin (plc) gene -targeting qpcr assay while none of the samples tested positive for the cl. perfringens enterotoxin-encoding gene (cpe).  conclusions: the qpcr panel consisting of 12 assays for an extensive set of pathogenic microorganisms provides an efficient alternative to the conventional detection of gastrointestinal pathogens and could accelerate the initiation of targeted antibiotic therapy reducing the risk of post-infectious ibs (pi-ibs). s. aureus has not been previously reported to be associated with the onset of ibs. although we discovered significant differences in the prevalence of s. aureus between the study groups, its importance in giving rise to ibs symptoms requires  further studies.

TI  == bacterial pathogens in hawaiian coastal streams--associations with fecal indicators, land cover, and water quality.
AB  == this work aimed to understand the distribution of five bacterial pathogens in o'ahu coastal streams and relate their presence to microbial indicator concentrations, land cover of the surrounding watersheds, and physical-chemical measures of stream water quality. twenty-two streams were sampled four times (in  december and march, before sunrise and at high noon) to capture seasonal and time of day variation. salmonella, campylobacter, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio vulnificus, and v. parahaemolyticus were widespread -12 of 22 o'ahu streams had all five pathogens. all stream waters also had detectable concentrations of four  fecal indicators and total vibrio with log mean +/- standard deviation densities  of 2.2 +/- 0.8 enterococci, 2.7 +/- 0.7 escherichia coli, 1.1 +/- 0.7 clostridium perfringens, 1.2 +/- 0.8 f(+) coliphages, and 3.6 +/- 0.7 total vibrio per 100 ml. bivariate associations between pathogens and indicators showed enterococci positively associated with the greatest number of bacterial pathogens. higher concentrations of enterococci and higher incidence of campylobacter were found in stream waters collected before sunrise, suggesting these organisms are sensitive  to sunlight. multivariate regression models of microbes as a function of land cover and physical-chemical water quality showed positive associations between salmonella and agricultural and forested land covers, and between s. aureus and urban and agricultural land covers; these results suggested that sources specific to those land covers may contribute these pathogens to streams. further, significant associations between some microbial targets and physical-chemical stream water quality (i.e., temperature, nutrients, turbidity) suggested that organism persistence may be affected by stream characteristics. results implicate streams as a source of pathogens to coastal waters. future work is recommended to determine infectious risks of recreational waterborne illness related to o'ahu stream exposures and to mitigate these risks through control of land-based runoff sources.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis virulence regulator fsra binding to target promoters.
AB  == the fsrabdc signal transduction system is a major virulence regulator in enterococcus faecalis. the fsrc sensor histidine kinase, upon activation by the gelatinase biosynthesis-activating pheromone (gbap) peptide encoded by the fsrbd  genes, phosphorylates the fsra response regulator required for the transcription  of the fsrbdc and the gele-spre genes from the fsrb promoter and the gele promoter, respectively. fsra belongs to the lyttr family of proteins, which includes other virulence regulators, such as agra of staphylococcus aureus, algr  of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and virr of clostridium perfringens. the lyttr dna-binding domain that characterizes these proteins generally binds to two imperfect direct repeats separated by a number of bases that place the repeats on the same face of the dna helix. in this study, we demonstrated that fsra also binds to two imperfect direct repeats separated by 13 bp, based on the consensus  sequence of fsra, t/at/caa/gggaa/g, which is consistent with the binding characteristics of lyttr domains.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

TI  == on-farm multi-contamination of pigs by food-borne bacterial zoonotic hazards: an  exploratory study.
AB  == application of risk analysis to control pork-borne zoonoses on farms is a major aim of the current european food safety legislation. the prevalence, levels of contamination and variations in pig contaminations according to herds and batches must therefore be studied to define relevant methods for control of zoonoses. the aims of this exploratory study were to provide information on the prevalence and  levels of infection of finisher/fattening pigs by campylobacter spp., clostridium perfringens, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica and staphylococcus aureus, and to quantify the respective effects of batches and herds. one hundred  and twenty-seven pooled fresh feces samples and 120 pooled cutaneous swab samples were tested from 37 batches in 14 farrowing-to-finishing farms. campylobacter spp. was identified in all fecal samples on farms whereas l. monocytogenes was never found. c. perfringens was identified in 48% of samples, salmonella in 2%, and s. aureus in 48%. the decomposition of variance of on-farm prevalence and levels of contamination and a general linear model showed a systematically significant effect of herd, and an effect of batch only for levels of contamination with campylobacter and c. perfringens and for prevalence of s. aureus. the contamination status of pigs seems to be mainly explained by herd status linked to poor biosecurity measures. further studies are needed to explain such correlations in order to define farm indicators for food-borne zoonotic hazards.

TI  == clostridial dermatitis and cellulitis: an emerging disease of turkeys.
AB  == clostridial dermatitis of turkeys (cdt) has emerged as a major issue across most  geographic regions of the united states. the prevalence and severity of dermatitis has increased over the last several years, since the time it was first reported in 1993. cellulitis in poultry can be associated with staphylococcus aureus or escherichia coli, but the more recent field situation in turkeys is specifically associated with clostridium spp. the prevalence of cellulitis is relatively low; however, the disease can be devastating in the individual flocks  affected. clostridium septicum, clostridium perfringens, clostridium sordelli, and s. aureus can cause cellulitis. escherichia coli, streptococcus spp., and other bacteria have occasionally been isolated from birds diagnosed with cellulitis. cdt appears as excessive mortality in older birds around 16-18 weeks  of age. it has been reported from field experience as early as 7 wk of age. clinical signs of cdt can range from sudden death to inappetence, depression, leg weakness, recumbency, and ataxia. the disease is characterized by reddish to dark or greenish discoloration of the skin around the thighs, abdomen, keel, tail region, back, and wings. the lesions can extend into the underlying muscles, and  there can be gas bubbles under the skin which result in crepitation. some cases present with dead birds having "bubbly tail," fluid-filled blisters associated with broken feather follicles around the base of the tail. bubbly tail in breeder toms might not cause excessive mortality, but the lesions are so severe that the  birds cannot be used for semen collection. incidence of mortality from this condition can be severe and acute (i.e., rapid onset of high mortality). the dead birds decompose very quickly. microscopically, there is necrosis, with or without inflammation of the skin, especially in the dermis and occasionally in the skeletal muscles, associated with large numbers of rod-shaped bacteria. overcrowding, aggressive birds, poor-wet litter, decreased down time, a contaminated environment including feed and water, poor hygienic conditions, and  contaminated vaccines and vaccine equipment, etc., can predispose birds for cdt.  preventative measures and treatment are discussed extensively in this review.

TI  == cell-based biosensor for rapid screening of pathogens and toxins.
AB  == development and validation of a mammalian cell-based biosensor for application in food defense and food safety was investigated. three prototypes of the biosensor  capable of handling different sample types were developed and tested with food and beverages. the sensing element is a b lymphocyte ped-2e9 cell-line, encapsulated in collagen matrix in 3d scaffold. the uniqueness of this biosensor  is that it detects analyte interaction with mammalian cells and is able to distinguish pathogenic from non-pathogenic and active from inactive toxins, rendering accurate estimation of the risk associated with the agents. this sensor gave positive signal for a broad range of bacterial pathogens; listeria monocytogenes, enterotoxigenic bacillus, vibrio, micrococcus and serratia, and toxins; alpha-hemolysin from staphylococcus aureus, phospholipase c from clostridium perfringens, cytolysin from sea anemone stoichactis helianthus, listeriolysin o from l. monocytogenes, and enterotoxin from bacillus. detection limit for toxins was 10-40 ng in 2 h while for a model bacterial pathogen, l. monocytogenes, 10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml in 4-6 h, even in the presence of a mixture of  higher concentrations of non-pathogenic species of the same genera or common background microflora. with inoculated food and beverage, the sensor detected l.  monocytogenes and bacillus cereus at a low initial concentration of 10(2)-10(4) cfu/g from ready-to-eat meat and rice, and only active toxins at nanogram quantities from rice, milk and water samples. though all the three prototypes performed well with beverages, devices ii & iii are most suitable for testing particulate foods. these data present promising evidence for possible application of this biosensor for rapid detection of multiple pathogens or toxins for food defense and food safety application.

TI  == rapid detection of enterotoxigenic clostridium perfringens in meat samples using  immunomagnetic separation polymerase chain reaction (ims-pcr).
AB  == rapid detection of enterotoxigenic clostridium perfringens in meat samples was accomplished with an immunomagnetic separation polymerase chain reaction (ims-pcr). first, a monoclonal antibody (mab) specific to c. perfringens was generated. the antibody showed strong binding to c. perfringens and no binding to non- clostridia bacteria, except a weak cross-reaction to staphylococcus aureus based on the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). then, magnetic beads were coated with the mab, and the ims-pcr system was developed. with the optimized conditions, the ims-pcr assay was capable of detecting as few as 10 colony forming units (cfu)/g of c. perfringens cells in the meat sample within 10 h. of  the 116 collected samples (26 chicken samples, 20 beef samples, 30 pork samples,  20 fish samples, and 20 processed meat samples) examined with ims-pcr, 36 (31%) were c. perfringens -positive samples and 2 (1.7%) were enterotoxigenic c. perfringens -positive samples. the ims-pcr results gave a good agreement with the results obtained by conventional culture methods. in comparison to conventional culture methods, the ims-pcr is a rapid and specific method and has potential use as a screening tool for enterotoxigenic c. perfringens in food samples.

TI  == regulation of neurotoxin production and sporulation by a putative agrbd signaling system in proteolytic clostridium botulinum.
AB  == a significant number of genome sequences of clostridium botulinum and related species have now been determined. in silico analysis of these data revealed the presence of two distinct agr loci (agr-1 and agr-2) in all group i strains, each  encoding putative proteins with similarity to agrb and agrd of the well-studied staphylococcus aureus agr quorum sensing system. in s. aureus, a small diffusible autoinducing peptide is generated from agrd in a membrane-located processing event that requires agrb. here the characterization of both agr loci in the group i strain c. botulinum atcc 3502 and of their homologues in a close relative, clostridium sporogenes ncimb 10696, is reported. in c. sporogenes ncimb 10696, agr-1 and agr-2 appear to form transcriptional units that consist of agrb, agrd,  and flanking genes of unknown function. several of these flanking genes are conserved in clostridium perfringens. in agreement with their proposed role in quorum sensing, both loci were maximally expressed during late-exponential-phase  growth. modulation of agrb expression in c. sporogenes was achieved using antisense rna, whereas in c. botulinum, insertional agrd mutants were generated using clostron technology. in comparison to the wild-type strains, these strains  exhibited drastically reduced sporulation and, for c. botulinum, also reduced production of neurotoxin, suggesting that both phenotypes are controlled by quorum sensing. interestingly, while agr-1 appeared to control sporulation, agr-2 appeared to regulate neurotoxin formation.

TI  == [myonecrosis in users of injecting drugs (a clinical case)].
AB  == myonecrosis remains one of the severest manifestations of skin and soft tissue infections. clostridia (c. perfringens, c. novyi, c. septicum, c. sordellii, c. histolyticum) are dominant and staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and bacteriodes fragilis are much less in the etiology of myonecrosis. cases of gas gangrene have recently become more frequent among injection drug users all over the world. russia has become the largest opiate market in europe and consumption of these narcotic drugs is annually growing. in  the russian federation, a larger number of injection drug users uniquely results  in a rise of cases of clostridium- and mixed flora-induced myonecrosis. gas gangrene in hiv-positive drug abusers seems to rapidly progress to multiple organ failure and to show high death rates, rather than to develop a localized form. the analyzed case of mixed flora-induced gas gangrene is of interest to physicians of any specialties who can encounter this wound infection in hiv-positive patients.

TI  == presence of pathogens and indicator microbes at a non-point source subtropical recreational marine beach.
AB  == swimming in ocean water, including ocean water at beaches not impacted by known point sources of pollution, is an increasing health concern. this study was an initial evaluation of the presence of indicator microbes and pathogens and the association among the indicator microbes, pathogens, and environmental conditions at a subtropical, recreational marine beach in south florida impacted by non-point sources of pollution. twelve water and eight sand samples were collected during four sampling events at high or low tide under elevated or reduced solar insolation conditions. the analyses performed included analyses of  fecal indicator bacteria (fib) (fecal coliforms, escherichia coli, enterococci, and clostridium perfringens), human-associated microbial source tracking (mst) markers (human polyomaviruses [hpyvs] and enterococcus faecium esp gene), and pathogens (vibrio vulnificus, staphylococcus aureus, enterovirus, norovirus, hepatitis a virus, cryptosporidium spp., and giardia spp.). the enterococcus concentrations in water and sand determined by quantitative pcr were greater than the concentrations determined by membrane filtration measurement. the fib concentrations in water were below the recreational water quality standards for three of the four sampling events, when pathogens and mst markers were also generally undetectable. the fib levels exceeded regulatory guidelines during one  event, and this was accompanied by detection of hpyvs and pathogens, including detection of the autochthonous bacterium v. vulnificus in sand and water, detection of the allochthonous protozoans giardia spp. in water, and detection of cryptosporidium spp. in sand samples. the elevated microbial levels were detected at high tide and under low-solar-insolation conditions. additional sampling should be conducted to further explore the relationships between tidal and solar  insolation conditions and between indicator microbes and pathogens in subtropical recreational marine waters impacted by non-point source pollution.

TI  == simultaneous identification of seven foodborne pathogens and escherichia coli (pathogenic and nonpathogenic) using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism coupled with multiplex pcr.
AB  == the objective of this study was to develop a novel technique for parallel analysis of eight important foodborne microbes using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (ce-sscp) coupled with multiplex pcr. specific primers for multiplex pcr amplification of the 16s rrna gene were designed, corresponding to eight species of bacteria, including escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enterica, listeria monocytogenes, vibrio parahaemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus, for the species-specific identification and optimal separation of their pcr products in subsequent analysis by ce-sscp. multiplex pcr conditions including annealing temperature, extension time, the number of pcr cycles, and primer concentrations were then optimized for simultaneous detection  of all target foodborne bacteria. the diagnostic system using ce-sscp combined with multiplex pcr developed here can be used for rapid investigation of causative agents of foodborne illness. the simplicity and high sensitivity of the method may lead to improved management of safety and illness related to food.

TI  == nosocomial and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea caused by organisms other than clostridium difficile.
AB  == most cases of nosocomial and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are caused by alteration of the physiological gut microflora. this alteration leads to reduced  microbial metabolism of carbohydrates and primary bile acids, resulting in osmotic or secretory forms of diarrhoea. moreover, facultative enteropathogens may experience a growth advantage due to the antibiotic-induced microflora alteration that, in turn, can harm the gut mucosa by the toxins they produce. clostridium difficile is the major infectious agent leading to pseudomembranous colitis. however, there is increasing evidence that certain other pathogens such  as enterotoxin-producing clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella oxytoca can induce mucosal deterioration and diarrhoea after antibiotic use. but, as with c. difficile, these facultative enteropathogens can  also be found in the healthy population. their contribution to disease is, therefore, controversial and their presence in the stools of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea patients is often claimed to be mere colonisation. in this respect, the causal relationship of each suspected pathogen with the development of intestinal disease has to be proved clinically and experimentally.

TI  == use of an ez-tn5-based random mutagenesis system to identify a novel toxin regulatory locus in clostridium perfringens strain 13.
AB  == background: although useful for probing bacterial pathogenesis and physiology, current random mutagenesis systems suffer limitations for studying the toxin-producing bacterium clostridium perfringens. methodology/principal findings: an ez-tn5-based random mutagenesis approach was developed for use in c. perfringens. this mutagenesis system identified a new regulatory locus controlling toxin production by strain 13, a c. perfringens type a strain. the novel locus, encoding proteins with homology to the agrb and agrd components of the agr quorum sensing system of staphylococcus aureus and two hypothetical proteins, was found to regulate early production of both alpha toxin and perfringolysin o (pfo) by strain 13. pfo production by the strain 13 deltaagrb mutant could be restored by genetic complementation or by physical complementation, i.e. by co-culture of the strain 13 deltaagrb mutant with a pfoa mutant of either strain 13 or c. perfringens type c cn3685. a similar agrb- and agrd-encoding locus is identifiable in all sequenced c. perfringens strains, including type b, c, d, and e isolates, suggesting this regulatory locus contributes to toxin regulation by most c. perfringens strains. in strain 13, the agrb and agrd genes were found to be co-transcribed in an operon with two upstream genes encoding hypothetical proteins. conclusions/significance: the new  tn5-based random mutagenesis system developed in this study is more efficient and random than previously reported c. perfringens random mutagenesis approaches. it  allowed identification of a novel c. perfringens toxin regulatory locus with homology to the agr system of s. aureus and which functions as expected of an agr-like quorum sensing system. since previous studies have shown that alpha toxin and perfringolysin o are responsible for strain 13-induced clostridial myonecrosis in the mouse model, the new agr regulatory locus may have importance  for strain 13 virulence.

TI  == virulence gene regulation by the agr system in clostridium perfringens.
AB  == a gram-positive anaerobic pathogen, clostridium perfringens, causes clostridial myonecrosis or gas gangrene in humans by producing numerous extracellular toxins  and enzymes that act in concert to degrade host tissue. the agr system is known to be important for the regulation of virulence genes in a quorum-sensing manner  in staphylococcus aureus. a homologue for s. aureus agrbd (agrbd(sa)) was identified in the c. perfringens strain 13 genome, and the role of c. perfringens agrbd (agrbd(cp)) was examined. the agrbd(cp) knockout mutant did not express the theta-toxin gene, and transcription of the alpha- and kappa-toxin genes was also  significantly decreased in the mutant strain. the mutant strain showed a recovery of toxin production after the addition of the culture supernatant of the wild-type strain, indicating that the agrbd(cp) mutant lacks a signal molecule in the culture supernatant. an agr-virr double-knockout mutant was constructed to examine the role of the virr/virs two-component regulatory system, a key virulence regulator, in agrbd(cp)-mediated regulation of toxin production. the double-mutant strain could not be stimulated for toxin production with the wild-type culture supernatant. these results indicate that the agrbd(cp) system plays an important role in virulence regulation and also suggest that virr/virs is required for sensing of the extracellular signal and activation of toxin gene  transcription in c. perfringens.

TI  == clostridium perfringens delta toxin is sequence related to beta toxin, netb, and  staphylococcus pore-forming toxins, but shows functional differences.
AB  == clostridium perfringens produces numerous toxins, which are responsible for severe diseases in man and animals. delta toxin is one of the three hemolysins released by a number of c. perfringens type c and possibly type b strains. delta  toxin was characterized to be cytotoxic for cells expressing the ganglioside g(m2) in their membrane. here we report the genetic characterization of delta toxin and its pore forming activity in lipid bilayers. delta toxin consists of 318 amino acids, its 28 n-terminal amino acids corresponding to a signal peptide. the secreted delta toxin (290 amino acids; 32619 da) is a basic protein (pi 9.1)  which shows a significant homology with c. perfringens beta toxin (43% identity), with c. perfringens netb (40% identity) and, to a lesser extent, with staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin and leukotoxins. recombinant delta toxin showed a preference for binding to g(m2), in contrast to beta toxin, which did not bind  to gangliosides. it is hemolytic for sheep red blood cells and cytotoxic for hela cells. in artificial diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine membranes, delta and beta toxin formed channels. conductance of the channels formed by delta toxin, with a  value of about 100 ps to more than 1 ns in 1 m kcl and a membrane potential of 20 mv, was higher than those formed by beta toxin and their distribution was broader. the results of zero-current membrane potential measurements and single channel experiments suggest that delta toxin forms slightly anion-selective channels, whereas the beta toxin channels showed a preference for cations under the same conditions. c. perfringens delta toxin shows a significant sequence homolgy with c. perfringens beta and netb toxins, as well as with s. aureus alpha hemolysin and leukotoxins, but exhibits different channel properties in lipid bilayers. in contrast to beta toxin, delta toxin recognizes g(m2) as receptor and forms anion-selective channels.

TI  == a genetically enhanced anaerobic bacterium for oncopathic therapy of pancreatic cancer.
AB  == background: a major obstacle in treatment of solid tumors is the inefficient delivery of therapeutic agents to the hypoxic cores. hypoxia offers the potential for anaerobic bacteria colonization and tumor destruction by the bacteria, and dormant spores of wild-type clostridium perfringens (cp) germinate and proliferate within the hypoxic cores of pancreatic tumors in mice. however, the oncopathic effects of cp were limited by host inflammatory responses and by cp's  residual tolerance to oxygen, which caused toxic effects in animals. methods: recombinant cp strains in which superoxide dismutase, a major oxygen tolerance gene, was deleted (cp/sod(-)) were constructed to enhance its selective growth in tumors. in addition, panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl), an inflammation-suppressing gene from staphylococcus aureus, was inserted into the cp/sod(-) genome to enhance its oncopathic potency. the ability of the recombinant cp strains to kill tumors was investigated in c57/bl6 mice bearing murine panc02 tumors. systemic and organ toxic effects were assessed by monitoring serum chemistries and histopathological examination. statistical tests were two-sided. results: cp/sod(-) showed reduced toxic effects compared with wild-type cp when spores were administered intravenously into panc02 tumor-bearing mice. mice treated with cp/sod(-)/pvl spores demonstrated a reduction in neutrophils and macrophages in tumors, logarithmically elevated growth of intratumoral bacteria, enhanced tumor necrosis, and substantially prolonged survival without apparent systemic and organ toxic effects, compared with mice treated with both wild-type cp and cp/sod(-) spores. accordingly, 47% of cp/sod(-)/pvl-treated mice (n = 15) achieved tumor-free survival for over 120  days, whereas all mice treated with cp/sod(-) or phosphate-buffered saline (n = 10 per group) died within 50 days. the median survival for cp/sod(-)/pvl-treated  mice was 77 days (95% confidence interval [ci] = 45 to 120 days) and for cp/sod(-)-treated mice was 30 days (95% ci = 23 to 36 days; p < .001). conclusions: cp/sod(-)/pvl provides a prototype for a novel class of oncopathic microbes that may have potential for the safe and effective treatment of pancreatic cancer and other poorly vascularized tumors.

TI  == cell surface o-glycans limit staphylococcus aureus adherence to corneal epithelial cells.
AB  == the mucin-rich environment of the intact corneal epithelium is thought to contribute to the prevention of staphylococcus aureus infection. this study examined whether o-glycans, which constitute the majority of the mucin mass of epithelial cell glycocalyces, prevented bacterial adhesion and growth. abrogation of mucin o glycosylation using the chemical primer benzyl-alpha-galnac resulted in increased adherence of parental strain rn6390 to apical human corneal-limbal epithelial (hcle) cells and to biotinylated cell surface protein in static and liquid phase adhesion assays, consistent with a role of mucin o-glycans in preventing bacterial adhesion. comparable results were found with alc135, an isogenic mutant strain defective in the accessory gene regulators agr and sar, indicating that the agr- and/or sar-regulated virulence factors did not play a major role in mediating adhesion to the corneal cell surface after mucin o-glycan truncation. in exoglycosidase digestion studies, treatment with sialidase from arthrobacter ureafaciens--which hydrolyzed mucin-associated o-acetyl sialic acid--but not from clostridium perfringens resulted in an increase in rn6390 and  alc135 adhesion. abrogation of mucin o glycosylation in hcle cell cultures did not affect bacterial growth. overall, these data indicate that mucin o-glycans contribute to the prevention of bacterial adherence to the apical surface of corneal epithelial cells and suggest that alteration of cell surface glycosylation from disease or trauma, including that stemming from contact lens wear, could contribute to a higher risk of infection.

AB  == in an epidemiological survey of human enterobacterial infections in the republic  of korea during three years from 2004 to 2006, we isolated 1,784 (6.2%, isolation rate of enteropathogens from stool samples) in 2004, 2,547 (9.5%) in 2005 and 3,506 bacteria (12.3%) from people who visited clinics. among the isolated bacteria, pathogenic escherichia coli, especially, eaec was the most frequently identified pathogen in both urban and rural regions followed by staphylococcus aureus, salmonella species, bacillus cereus, vibrio parahaemolyticus, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, and shigella species. distinct seasonality was found in v. parahaemolyticus species, while this pathogen showed  no age-specific patterns. however, other bacteria, i.e., pathogenic e. coli, s. aureus, salmonella spp., and b. cereus showed similar seasonality throughout the  year, showing a slight increase in the infection rate during the summer months and high prevalence among children under 10 years of age and elder-age people. the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pathogenic e. coli, salmonella spp., and s. aureus showed high resistance to penicillins. however, both pathogenic e.  coli and salmonella spp. were susceptible to several cephems, imipenem, and amikacin. moreover, s. aureus strains resistant to vancomycin were not found. in  conclusion, these surveillances can play an important role for the control and prevention to the diseases originated by enteritis bacteria.

TI  == risk profiles of pork and poultry meat and risk ratings of various pathogen/product combinations.
AB  == risk profiles of pork and poultry meat were carried out using an excel-based software program, risk ranger. it is a semi-quantitative risk estimator answering various questions relating to the probability of exposure to a hazard, susceptibility of the population of interest, severity of the illness caused by the hazard if present and probability of food containing an infectious dose. therefore, qualitative and quantitative inputs were used to estimate and rank the risk of various hazards/food combinations. risk scores provided by the tool were  characterized as low, medium and high. also, health risk was estimated separately, where needed, for low and high risk populations. low risk scores were obtained for salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) for low risk population. high risk scores were obtained for hepatitis e virus (hev) in raw pork products (both low and high risk populations). moderate risk scores for salmonella spp. and l. monocytogenes in processed pork or poultry-meat products (ready-to-eat or to be reheated) and partially cooked pork products were also obtained (low risk population). scores for staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus and various product types were mostly in the "medium" risk category, except for s. aureus/ready-to-eat pork products able to support growth of the organism, which fell into the high risk category. campylobacter spp. gave moderate risk scores with one exception (raw poultry products), whereas y. enterocolitica showed combinations of low risk and few of medium risk. high risk pathogen/product combinations identified were: 1) temperature abused, ready-to-eat pork and/or poultry-meat products with extended shelf life and cross-contaminated by l. monocytogenes (high risk population), ehec (high risk population) or s. aureus (all population), 2) partially cooked or processed intended to be reheated pork products cross-contaminated by l. monocytogenes, served undercooked and receiving improper cooling or reheating (high risk population), and 3) all people consuming undercooked meals cross-contaminated with campylobacter spp. (e.g. from raw poultry and raw poultry-meat products) and hev (e.g. from raw pork and raw pork-meat products). salmonellae gave high risk scores in all food categories (except preserved meat products) for high risk population. preserved meats (mainly pork) such as dry fermented sausages gave low risk scores. only salmonella spp., l. monocytogenes and e. coli ehec gave moderate risk ratings in  case of ingredients likely to be contaminated at an early stage of processing (e.g. animal at slaughter) and inadequate fermentation process. these results may constitute a source of information for hazard assessment during application of a  food safety management system.

TI  == antibiotic-associated diarrhea: candidate organisms other than clostridium difficile.
AB  == background/aims: the direct toxic effects of antibiotics on the intestine can alter digestive functions and cause pathogenic bacterial overgrowth leading to antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad). clostridium difficile (c. difficile) is widely known to be responsible for 10 approximately 20% of aad cases. however, klebsiella oxytoca, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and candida species might also contribute to aad. methods: we prospectively analyzed the organisms in stool and colon tissue cultures with a c. difficile toxin a assay in patients with aad between may and december 2005. in addition, we performed the c. difficile toxin a assays using an enzyme-linked fluorescent assay technique. patients were enrolled who had diarrhea with more than three stools per day for at least 2 days after the initiation of antibiotic treatment for up to 6 approximately 8 weeks after antibiotic discontinuation. results: among 38 patients (mean age 59 +/- 18 years, m:f =18:20), the organism isolation rates were 28.9% (11/38) for stool culture, 18.4% (7/38) for colon tissue cultures and  13.2% (5/38) for the c. difficile toxin a assay. the overall rate of identification of organisms was 50.0% (19/38). of the five patients that had a positive result by the c. difficile toxin a assay, two had no organism isolated by the stool or colon tissue culture. the organisms isolated from the stool cultures were c difficile (4), klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) (3), candida species (3), and staphylococcus aureus (1). c. difficile (4) and k. pneumoniae (3) were isolated from the colon tissue culture. conclusions: for c. difficile negative aad patients, k. pneumoniae, candida species and staphylococcus aureus were found to be potential causative organisms.

TI  == netb, a new toxin that is associated with avian necrotic enteritis caused by clostridium perfringens.
AB  == for over 30 years a phospholipase c enzyme called alpha-toxin was thought to be the key virulence factor in necrotic enteritis caused by clostridium perfringens. however, using a gene knockout mutant we have recently shown that alpha-toxin is  not essential for pathogenesis. we have now discovered a key virulence determinant. a novel toxin (netb) was identified in a c. perfringens strain isolated from a chicken suffering from necrotic enteritis (ne). the toxin displayed limited amino acid sequence similarity to several pore forming toxins including beta-toxin from c. perfringens (38% identity) and alpha-toxin from staphylococcus aureus (31% identity). netb was only identified in c. perfringens  type a strains isolated from chickens suffering ne. both purified native netb and recombinant netb displayed cytotoxic activity against the chicken leghorn male hepatoma cell line lmh; inducing cell rounding and lysis. to determine the role of netb in ne a netb mutant of a virulent c. perfringens chicken isolate was constructed by homologous recombination, and its virulence assessed in a chicken  disease model. the netb mutant was unable to cause disease whereas the wild-type  parent strain and the netb mutant complemented with a wild-type netb gene caused  significant levels of ne. these data show unequivocally that in this isolate a functional netb toxin is critical for the ability of c. perfringens to cause ne in chickens. this novel toxin is the first definitive virulence factor to be identified in avian c. perfringens strains capable of causing ne. furthermore, the netb mutant is the first rationally attenuated strain obtained in an ne-causing isolate of c. perfringens; as such it has considerable vaccine potential.

TI  == lactobacillus isolates from weaned piglets' mucosa with inhibitory activity against common porcine pathogens.
AB  == twelve lactobacilli isolates from mucosa of 3-5-week-old weaned pigs were found to exert good antimicrobial activity against common porcine pathogens (s. aureus, b. cereus, e. coli, c. perfringens). two of them produced in addition to lactic acid also considerable amounts of acetic acid, and 6 of them produced hydrogen peroxide and metabolites other than organic acids. isolates 4/26 and 2/25 (identified as l. crispatus or l. amylovorus) were inhibitory against most strains of s. aureus, b. cereus and e. coli, and especially the strain 4/26 survived well in simulated gastric and intestinal juice. diarrhea-causing e. coli o8k88h9 ent(+) was successfully inhibited by the growing culture as well as by the catalase-treated and neutralized supernatant of l. reuteri 12/26. mucin degradation and multiple resistance to antibiotics were not observed.

TI  == preliminary study on the efficacy and safety of eight individual and blended disinfectants against poultry and dairy indicator organisms.
AB  == eight individual and blended chemical disinfectants were screened for preliminary evaluation of safety, bactericidal and virucidal effectiveness against poultry and dairy organisms. the test organisms were escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus spp. and clostridium perfringens, in addition to avian influenza virus (aiv) and newcastle disease virus (ndv). viable counts of surviving bacteria were determined after 30 min contact with each disinfectant and in the presence or absence of skimmed milk, to simulate the interference of organic matter. the haemagglutination test was used  to assess the survival of the test viruses in the presence of the different disinfectants after propagation in 10-day-old chick embryos. in the presence of skimmed milk, a higher concentration of most of the disinfectants examined was required to exert antimicrobial effectiveness. when used individually, quaternary ammonium showed no virucidal activity against ndv and aiv; peracetic acid was not effective against streptococcus spp., s. enteritidis and ndv, while iodophors showed low bactericidal and inconsistent virucidal activity. the single and blended disinfectants with high microbicidal activities included phenols (high bactericidal and virucidal activity), blends of quaternary ammonium compounds (high bactericidal activity) and blends of cresols and organic acids (high virucidal activity). this suggests the use of blends of compatible compounds for  disinfection operations in poultry and dairy industries since they will target a  wider range of micro-organisms. none of the disinfectants had a negative effect on the development of the different organs of chicken embryos and the iodine-based disinfectant, developed for dairy-teat dipping, also showed no adverse reactions in experimental cows.

TI  == clinical mastitis in ewes; bacteriology, epidemiology and clinical features.
AB  == background: clinical mastitis is an important disease in sheep. the objective of  this work was to identify causal bacteria and study certain epidemiological and clinical features of clinical mastitis in ewes kept for meat and wool production. methods: the study included 509 ewes with clinical mastitis from 353 flocks located in 14 of the 19 counties in norway. clinical examination and collection of udder secretions were carried out by veterinarians. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) was performed on 92 staphylococcus aureus isolates from 64 ewes. results and conclusion: s. aureus was recovered from 65.3% of 547 clinically affected mammary glands, coagulase-negative staphylococci from 2.9%, enterobacteria, mainly escherichia coli, from 7.3%, streptococcus spp. from 4.6%, mannheimia haemolytica from 1.8% and various other bacteria from 4.9%, while no bacteria were cultured from 13.2% of the samples. forty percent of the ewes with  unilateral clinical s. aureus mastitis also had a subclinical s. aureus infection in the other mammary gland. twenty-four of 28 (86%) pairs of s. aureus isolates obtained from clinically and subclinically affected mammary glands of the same ewe were indistinguishable by pfge. the number of identical pairs was significantly greater than expected, based on the distribution of different s. aureus types within the flocks. one-third of the cases occurred during the first  week after lambing, while a second peak was observed in the third week of lactation. gangrene was present in 8.8% of the clinically affected glands; s. aureus was recovered from 72.9%, clostridium perfringens from 6.3% and e. coli from 6.3% of the secretions from such glands. this study shows that s. aureus predominates as a cause of clinical ovine mastitis in norway, also in very severe cases. results also indicate that s. aureus is frequently spread between udder halves of infected ewes.

TI  == a systematic review of the clinical, public health and cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests for the detection and identification of bacterial intestinal pathogens in faeces and food.
AB  == objectives: to determine the diagnostic accuracy of tests for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning in clinical and public health practice and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these assays in a hypothetical population in order to inform policy on the use of these tests. data sources: studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests were retrieved using electronic databases and handsearching reference lists and key journals. hospital laboratories and test manufacturers were contacted for cost data, and clinicians  involved in the care of patients with food poisoning were invited to discuss the  conclusions of this review using the nominal group technique. review methods: a systematic review of the current medical literature on assays used for the rapid  diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning was carried out. specific organisms under review were salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli o157, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus. data extraction was undertaken using standardised data extraction forms. where a sufficient number of studies evaluating comparable tests were identified, meta-analysis was performed. a decision analytic model was developed, using effectiveness data from the review and cost data from hospitals and manufacturers, which contributed to an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of rapid tests in a hypothetical uk population. finally, diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness results were presented to a focus group of gps, microbiologists and consultants in communicable disease control, to assess professional opinion on the use of rapid  tests in the diagnosis of food poisoning. results: good test performance levels were observed with rapid test methods, especially for polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays. the estimated levels of diagnostic accuracy using the area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was very high. indeed, although traditional culture is the natural reference test to use for comparative statistical analysis, on many occasions the rapid test outperforms culture, detecting additional 'truly' positive cases of food-borne illness. the significance of these additional positives requires further investigation. economic modelling suggests that adoption of rapid tests in combination with routine culture is unlikely to be cost-effective, however, as the cost of rapid technologies decreases; total replacement with rapid technologies may be feasible. conclusions: despite the relatively poor quality of reporting of studies evaluating rapid detection methods, the reviewed evidence shows that pcr  for campylobacter, salmonella and e. coli o157 is potentially very successful in  identifying pathogens, possibly detecting more than the number currently reported using culture. less is known about the benefits of testing for b. cereus, c. perfringens and s. aureus. further investigation is needed on how clinical outcomes may be altered if test results are available more quickly and at a greater precision than in the current practice of bacterial culture.

TI  == prevalence of enterotoxin producing staphylococcus aureus in stools of patients with nosocomial diarrhea.
AB  == background: nosocomial diarrhea causes prolonged hospital stay leading to additional diagnostic and therapeutic procedures resulting in higher costs. a total of 20%-25% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) cases are attributed to  clostridium difficile. other microorganisms like clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus are discussed to be associated with aad. patients and methods: this study evaluated the prevalence of enterotoxigenic s. aureus in stool samples submitted to the laboratory with the diagnosis nosocomial diarrhea. a total of 2,727 stools from clinical patients were investigated for s. aureus and c. difficile. samples were cultured for both bacteria and a c. difficile toxin a and b assay was performed from all stools. isolated s. aureus were investigated for enterotoxin production and for resistance against methicillin. in addition, both assays were evaluated for determination of s. aureus enterotoxins directly in stool samples. results: out of 2,727 stools investigated, 198 grew s. aureus and 148 c. difficile. toxins a/b from c. difficile were detected in 184 stools. a total of 114 s. aureus strains produced  the following enterotoxins in vitro: a, 36; b, 20; c, 19; d, 68; e, 2. both pathogens were found in 25 stools. twenty-nine (14.6%) s. aureus strains were identified as methicillin-resistant. the two toxin assays evaluated in this study were not able to detect s. aureus enterotoxins directly in stools. conclusion: the role of enterotoxigenic s. aureus in the pathogenesis of nosocomial and aad needs further consideration. it might be necessary to investigate stool samples from patients with aad/nosocomial diarrhea for s. aureus on a routine basis.

TI  == gangrenous clostridium perfringens infection and subsequent wound management in a rhesus macaque (macaca mulatta).
AB  == a 10-y-old female rhesus macaque presented acutely with 3 large (diameter, greater than 4 cm), malodorous, ulcerogangrenous skin wounds on the left caudal thigh and calf. limb radiographs revealed free gas infiltrating deep tissues, and histologic examination confirmed myonecrosis. clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and prevotella intermedia were isolated from the wounds. antimicrobials, analgesics, and aggressive debridement of necrotic skin and muscle resulted in immediate clinical improvement of the primate. at 1 wk prior to presentation, the animal had received several intramuscular injections in close proximity to the site of infection. repeated intramuscular injections through excrement-contaminated skin possibly contributed to the pathogenesis of infection. continued therapy consisted of biweekly wound debridement and nonadherent bandage changes for 7 wk. the macaque regained full use of the affected leg and remains in good physical condition at our facility. our management of this case led to improvements in training regarding intramuscular injection practices in our macaque colony. this case study is the first report of clostridium perfringens myonecrosis in a laboratory nonhuman primate. we discuss  various methodologies for the diagnosis and treatment of necrotizing clostridial  infections.

TI  == antibiotic associated diarrhoea: infectious causes.
AB  == nearly 25% of antibiotic associated diarrhoeas (aad) is caused by clostridium difficile, making it the commonest identified and treatable pathogen. other pathogens implicated infrequently include clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella oxytoca, candida spp. and salmonella spp. most mild cases of aad are due to non-infectious causes which include reduced break down of primary  bile acids and decrease metabolism of carbohydrates, allergic or toxic effects of antibiotic on intestinal mucosa and pharmacological effect on gut motility. the antibiotics most frequently associated with c. difficile associated diarrhoea are clindamycin, cephalosporin, ampicillin and amoxicillin. clinical presentation may vary from mild diarrhoea to severe colitis and pseudomembranous colitis associated with high morbidity and mortality. the most sensitive and specific diagnostic test for c. difficile infection is tissue culture assay for cytotoxicity of toxin b. commercial elisa kits are available. though less sensitive, they are easy to perform and are rapid. withdrawal of precipitating antibiotic is all that is needed for control of mild to moderate cases. for severe cases of aad, oral metronidazole is the first line of treatment, and oral  vancomycin is the second choice. probiotics have been used for recurrent cases.

TI  == prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == the effect of multifunctional polymer-based gels on wound healing in full thickness bacteria-contaminated mouse skin wound models.
AB  == we determined whether a two-part space-conforming polyethylene glycol/dopa polymer-based gel promoted healing of contaminated wounds in mice. this silver-catalysed gel was previously developed to be broadly microbiocidal in vitro while being biocompatible with human wound cell functioning. full-thickness wounds were created on the backs of mice. the wounds were inoculated with 10(4) cfu of each of four common skin wound contaminants, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii and clostridium perfringens. the wounds were then treated with our multifunctional polymer-based gel, the commercially available newskin product, or left to heal untreated. the untreated  wounds were overtly infected, and presented detectable bacterial loads over the entire 21-day healing period, while the gel and newskin groups presented significantly smaller rises in bacterial levels and were cleared of detectable colonies by the third week, with the gel group clearing the bacteria earlier. while all three groups healed their wounds, the polymer-based gel-treated group demonstrated significantly earlier re-epithelialization and dermal maturation (p<0.05). this was reflected in a quick regain of tensile strength. this accelerated dermal maturation and regain in strength was noted in mice treated with the polymer-based gel when compared to wound treated with the commercially available aquacel-ag dressing (p<0.05). what distinguishes the polymer-based gel  from these other products is that it is incorporated within the healing wound. these preclinical studies show that the anti-microbial polymer gel not only supports but also accelerates healing of bacterially contaminated wounds.

TI  == soluble cd14 and cd83 from human neonatal antigen-presenting cells are inducible  by commensal bacteria and suppress allergen-induced human neonatal th2 differentiation.
AB  == cd14 is expressed on the cell surface of various antigen-presenting cells, and cd83 is a maturation marker for dendritic cells (dc). cd14 and cd83 are also present as soluble proteins, and both have immunoregulatory functions. we examined whether neonatal cord blood monocytes or dc released soluble cd14 (scd14) or scd83 when exposed to the commensal intestinal bacteria clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis. we found that the gram-positive bacteria c. perfringens and s. aureus, but not gram-negative bacteria, induced the release of scd14 from  monocytes. dc, on the other hand, released scd14 in response to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. moreover, the expression of the virulence factor staphylococcal protein a seemed to be important for s. aureus-induced scd14 production from both monocytes and dc. soluble cd83 was released from dc, but not from monocytes, when exposed to both gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria. finally, to investigate whether scd14 or scd83 could modulate neonatal allergen-induced t-cell differentiation, dc were exposed to birch allergen alone or in the presence of scd14 or scd83 and then cocultured with autologous t cells. we demonstrate that scd14 and scd83 inhibited the birch  allergen-induced th2 differentiation by suppressing interleukin 13 production. together, these results suggest that the commensal intestinal flora may be an important stimulus for the developing immune system by inducing the immunoregulatory proteins scd14 and scd83, which may be involved in preventing t-cell sensitization to allergens in infants.

TI  == relationships between bacteroides 16s rrna genetic markers and presence of bacterial enteric pathogens and conventional fecal indicators.
AB  == occurrence and prevalence of different bacterial enteric pathogens as well as their relationships with conventional (total and fecal coliforms) and alternative fecal indicators (host-specific bacteroides 16s rrna genetic markers) were investigated for various water samples taken from different sites with different  degrees of fecal contamination. the results showed that a wide range of bacterial pathogens could be detected in both municipal wastewater treatment plant samples  and in surface water samples. logistic regression analysis revealed that total and human-specific bacteroides 16s rrna genetic markers showed significant predictive values for the presence of escheriachia coli o-157, salmonella, heat-labile enterotoxin (lt) of enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec), and heat-stable enterotoxin for human (sth) of etec. the probability of occurrence of these pathogenic bacteria became significantly high when the concentrations of human-specific and total bacteroides 16s rrna genetic markers exceeded 10(3) and  10(4) copies/100 ml. in contrast, clostridium perfringens was detected at high frequency regardless of sampling sites and levels of bacteroides 16s rrna genetic markers. no genes related to shigella spp., staphylococcus aureus and vibrio cholerae were detected in any samples analyzed in this study. conventional indicator microorganisms had low levels of correlation with the presence of pathogens as compared with the alternative fecal indicators. these results suggested that real-time pcr-based measurement of alternative bacteroides 16s rrna genetic markers was a rapid and sensitive tool to identify host-specific fecal pollution and probably associated bacterial pathogens. however, since one fecal indicator might not represent the relative abundance of all pathogenic bacteria, viruses and protozoa, combined application of alternative indicators with conventional ones could provide more comprehensive pictures of fecal contamination, its source and association with pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == microbiological safety of retail vacuum-packed and modified-atmosphere-packed cooked meats at end of shelf life.
AB  == a study of retail modified-atmosphere-packed and vacuum-packed cooked ready-to-eat meats was undertaken from september through mid-november 2003 to determine the microbiological quality at the end of shelf life and to establish any risk factors in the production, storage, and display of this product. examination of 2,981 samples using microbiological guidelines criteria revealed that 66% were of satisfactory or acceptable microbiology quality, 33% were of unsatisfactory quality mainly due to high aerobic colony counts and enterobacteriaceae concentrations, and 1% were of unacceptable quality due to the presence of listeria monocytogenes at 100 cfu/g or higher (27 samples; range of 10(2) to 106 cfu/g) and campylobacter jejuni (1 sample), indicating a risk to health. all samples at the end of the shelf life had satisfactory (<20 cfu/g) and/or acceptable (<102 cfu/g) levels of staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens, four samples (<1%) had unsatisfactory levels of escherichia coli (range of 102 to 106 cfu/g) and 5.5% of the samples contained l. monocytogenes at <20 cfu/g (4.8%) or between 20 and 100 cfu/g (0.7%). more samples of chicken (45%; 224 of 495 samples), beef (43%; 160 of 371 samples), and turkey (41%; 219 of 523 samples) were of unsatisfactory or unacceptable quality compared with ham  (23%; 317 of 1,351 samples) or pork (32%; 67 of 206 samples). twelve different l. monocytogenes typing characters (serotype-amplified fragment length polymorphism  type-phage type) were evaluated for isolates recovered from samples of unacceptable quality, and the 1/2-ix-nt type was recovered from almost half (48%) of these samples. salmonella was not detected in any samples examined. risk factors identified for cooked meats that were microbiologically contaminated more frequently included vacuum packaging, packaging on retail premises, slicing, temperature not monitored in display units, and no hazard analysis system in place. results from this study also suggest that the shelf life assigned to some  modified-atmosphere-packed and vacuum-packed meats may not be appropriate.

TI  == the use of clinical profiles in the investigation of foodborne outbreaks in restaurants: united states, 1982-1997.
AB  == improving the efficiency of outbreak investigation in restaurants is critical to  reducing outbreak-associated illness and improving prevention strategies. because clinical characteristics of outbreaks are usually available before results of laboratory testing, we examined their use for determining contributing factors in outbreaks caused by restaurants. all confirmed foodborne outbreaks reported to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) from 1982 to 1997 were reviewed. clinical profiles were developed based on outbreak characteristics. we  compared the percentage of contributing factors by known agent and clinical profile to their occurrence in outbreaks of unclassified aetiology. in total, 2246 foodborne outbreaks were included: 697 (31%) with known aetiology and 1549 (69%) with aetiology undetermined. salmonella accounted for 65% of outbreaks with a known aetiology. norovirus-like clinical profiles were noted in 54% of outbreaks with undetermined aetiology. improper holding times and temperatures were associated with outbreaks caused by clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella, and also with outbreaks of undetermined aetiology that fitted diarrhoea-toxin and vomiting-toxin clinical profiles. poor personal hygiene was associated with norovirus, shigella, and salmonella, and also with outbreaks that fitted norovirus-like and vomiting-toxin clinical profiles. contributing factors were similar for outbreaks with known aetiology and for those where aetiology was assigned by corresponding clinical profile. rapidly categorizing outbreaks by clinical profile, before results of laboratory testing are available, can help identification of factors which contributed to the occurrence of the outbreak and will promote timely and efficient outbreak investigations.

AB  == random samples at the three processing stages of turkey keshta, turkey rosto, turkey luncheon and turkey frankfurter (20 samples for each stage were collected). for luncheon and frankfurter, 20 samples of each of thighs and breast represents the 1 st stage of processing were also taken. these samples were obtained from some meat processing plants at alexandria province to make a total  of 280 samples. the samples were examined microbiologically and the results revealed that, the total aerobic bacterial count in the examined keshta and rosto shows their highest count in the 1st stage and gradually decreased in the 2nd and 3rd stages. on the other hand, the total aerobic bacterial count in luncheon and  frankfurter samples slightly increased in the 2nd stage and then decreased in the 3rd stage. the coliform count also shows its highest count in the 1st stage and decreased in the 2nd stage and could not be detected from the 3rd stage of keshta and rosto samples, while it increased slightly in 2nd stage and could not be detected in the 3rd stage for luncheon and frankfurter samples. e. coli and staphylococcus aureus were higher in the 1st stage than in the 2nd stage of processing of the examined keshta and rosto samples while they were higher in the 2nd stage than in the 1st one in luncheon and frankfurter samples but could not be detected from the 3rd stage in all products. both clostridium perfningens and  salmonella could not be detected in the examined turkey products at the different processing stages. the total mould and yeast counts in the examined products showed highest count in the 1st stage and decreased in the 2nd stage and could not be detected in keshta and rosto in 3rd stage while in frankfurter samples the counts in the 1st and 2nd stages were nearly the same and decreased in the 3rd stage but in luncheon samples the count was slightly increased in the 2nd stage and not detected in the 3rd stage. the public health significance of microorganisms as well as the suggested hygienic measures in order to improve the quality of the examined turkey products were discussed.

TI  == activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1dra, temporin-1va and the melittin-related peptides ar-23 and rv-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1dra from rana draytonii and temporin-1va from rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (ar-23 from rana tagoi and rv-23 from r. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. these peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. all peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) </=25 microm) against the gram-positive bacilli propionibacterium acnes and clostridium tertium and the gram-positive cocci peptostreptococcus anaerobius. activity was lower and more variable against clostridium septicum, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. growth of the gram-negative  bacilli bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (mic</=25 microm) against prevotella melaninogenica. the clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1dra and temporin-1va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == one strain of lactobacillus salivarius, two strains of lactobacillus reuteri and  lactobacillus amylovorus, and two strains of bifidobacterium thermacidophilum with antagonistic effect against clostridium perfringens were isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract. isolates were assayed for their ability to survive in synthetic gastric juice at ph 2.5 and were examined for their ability  to grow on agar plate containing porcine bile extract. there was a large variation in the survival of the isolates in gastric juice and growth in the medium containing 0.3% (w/v) bile. l. salivarius g11 and l. amylovorus s6 adhered to the ht-29 epithelial cell line. cell-free supernatant of l. amylovorus s6 showed higher antagonistic activity as effective as the antibiotics such as neomycin, chlortetracycline, and oxytetracycline against bacterial pathogens including c. perfringens, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, edwardsiella tarda, and aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial activity of protein extracts  from hacat cell line against bacterial strains, isolated from clinical materials, obtained from patients with clinical symptoms of acne (propionibacterium acnes) and gas gangrene (clostridium perfringens and sterptococcus pyogenes). reference  strain of staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 also was used. protein extracts from cultured hacat cells were obtained by 3-fold freezing/defreezing cells in dry ice following by centrifugation and incubated with appropriate bacterial suspension (0.5 mcfarland scale) during 6 and 24 hours. we observed time-depending and strain-depending activity of hacat--protein extract. interestingly, high activity was demonstrated against strains of s. pyogenes and c. perfringens. because of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics further studies in the field of antimicrobial peptides are required.

TI  == sensitive quantitative detection of commensal bacteria by rrna-targeted reverse transcription-pcr.
AB  == a sensitive rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) method was developed for exact and sensitive enumeration of subdominant bacterial populations. using group- or species-specific primers for 16s or 23s rrna, analytical curves were constructed for escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the threshold cycle value was found to be linear up to an rna amount of 10(-3) cell per rt-pcr. the number of bacteria in culture was determined by rt-qpcr, and the results correlated well with the cfu count over the range from 10(0) to 10(5) cfu. the bacterial counts obtained by rt-qpcr were the same as the cfu counts irrespective of the growth phase in vitro, except for c. perfringens during starvation periods; the viable cell counts obtained by using a combination of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi) staining and syto9-propidium iodide double staining were in good agreement with the rt-qpcr counts rather than with the cfu  counts. the rt-qpcr method could detect endogenous enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa in feces of hospitalized patients (n = 38) at a level of 10(3) cells per g of feces, and for enumeration of s. aureus or p. aeruginosa spiked into human peripheral blood, the lower detection limit for rt-qpcr quantification of the bacteria was 2 cells per ml of blood, suggesting that this method was equivalent to the conventional culture method. as only 5 h was needed for rt-qpcr quantification, we suggest that rrna-targeted rt-qpcr assays provide a sensitive  and convenient system for quantification of commensal bacteria and for examining  their possible invasion of a host.

TI  == rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time pcr.
AB  == buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as pcr, and to prevent false-positive results due to dna  originating from dead cells. applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae o139, vibrio parahaemolyticus o3k6, vibrio vulnificus, providencia alcalifaciens, aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus  aureus, and clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. this method can be used prior to real-time quantitative pcr (rti-qpcr) and viable-cell counting. using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations  as low as 10(1) to 10(3) cfu/g using the rti-qpcr assay, and amounts as small as  10(0) to 10(1) cfu/g could be isolated using plate counting. the combined separation and concentration methods and rti-qpcr confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) cfu/g of salmonella and c. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of s. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. these results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of salt (nacl) used for the preservation of natural casings.
AB  == the antimicrobial properties of salt (nacl) used for the preservation of natural  casings were studied by investigating the survival of six bacterial species in natural casings at different water activity (aw) levels. individual sheep casings were inoculated with ca. 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu) g(-1) of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens and 10(2)cfu g(-1) of e. coli o157:h7. the casings were stored at 20+/-1.5 degrees c in different brines and dry salt, giving aw-levels of 0.90 aw, 0.87aw, 0.85 aw, 0.83 aw and 0.75 aw. samples were taken at day 1, 3, 6, 8, 13, 20, 27 and 30 after inoculation and the number of bacteria present was  determined. based on survival curves, death rates (day(-1)) were calculated to quantify the reduction in log10 cfu g(-1) per day. the influence of aw on death rates was higher for gram-negative bacteria than for gram-positive bacteria. the  death rates were overall higher for gram-negatives than for gram-positives. no clear reduction in the survival of c. perfringens in relation to any aw level was observed in this study. these results indicate that the antimicrobial properties  of salt used for the preservation of natural casings are sufficient to reduce the bacterial contamination (except for clostridium spores) well below acceptable levels at a water activity level of 0.85 or lower during a 30-day storage period.

TI  == comparative analysis of prevalence, risk factors, and molecular epidemiology of antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we prospectively studied the comparative epidemiology and risk factors for clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad). four thousand six hundred fifty-nine inpatient fecal specimens (11 months) were tested for c. difficile cytotoxin, c.  perfringens enterotoxin, and s. aureus by vero cell assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and growth on fresh blood agar, respectively. two distinct age-, sex-, and location-matched control patient groups were used for multivariate logistic regression risk factor analyses: symptomatic patients who were aad pathogen negative and asymptomatic patients with histories of recent antimicrobial therapy. all aad pathogen isolates were dna fingerprinted. in aad cases, the prevalences of c. difficile cytotoxin, c. perfringens enterotoxin, and s. aureus were 12.7%, 3.3%, and 0.2%, respectively (15.8% overall). age of >70 years was a common risk factor. other risk factors for infective aad and c. difficile aad included length of hospital stay and use of feeding tubes (length of stay odds ratios [or], 1.017 and 1.012; feeding tube or, 1.864 and 2.808). female gender and use of antacids were significantly associated with increased risk of c. perfringens aad (or, 2.08 and 2.789, respectively), but unlike what was found for c. difficile aad, specific antibiotic classes were not associated with increased risk. a limited number of genotypes caused the majority of c. difficile and c. perfringens aad cases. similar to what was found for c. difficile aad, there was epidemiological evidence of c. perfringens aad case clustering and reinfection due to different strains. c. difficile aad was approximately 4 and 60 times more common than c. perfringens aad and s. aureus aad, respectively. risk factors for these aad pathogens differed, highlighting the need to define specific control measures. there is evidence of nosocomial transmission in cases of c. perfringens aad.

TI  == comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal  action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal  microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol,  were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.

AB  == objective: to compare bact/alert (bta) and bactec 9240 (bac), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. materials and methods:  blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented bta and bac standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. the time to growth detection (td) was recorded for each bottle that became positive.  a quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess td of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. results: a total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both bta and bac bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by bta bottles and 13 (56.5%) by bac. proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the bta system. the average tds were 19.0 and 24.6 h for bta and bac, respectively. analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same  for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa but slightly different for haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. the anaerobic  bottle ofthe bta did not support the growth of h. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) cfu/ml whereas the bac did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) cfu/ml. td for  s. pneumoniae in the bta was about half of that in the bac. conclusions: the bta  system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the bac system to detect the same organism.

TI  == validation of bacon processing conditions to verify control of clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == it is unclear how rapidly meat products, such as bacon, that have been heat treated but not fully cooked should be cooled to prevent the outgrowth of spore-forming bacterial pathogens and limit the growth of vegetative cells. clostridium perfringens spores and vegetative cells and staphylococcus aureus cells were inoculated into ground cured pork bellies with and without 1.25% liquid smoke. bellies were subjected to the thermal profiles of industrial smoking to 48.9 degrees c (120 degrees f) and normal cooling of bacon (3 h) as well as a cooling phase of 15 h until the meat reached 7.2 degrees c (45 degrees  f). a laboratory-scale bacon smoking and cooling operation was also performed. under normal smoking and cooling thermal conditions, growth of c. perfringens in  ground pork bellies was <1 log regardless of smoke. increase of s. aureus was 2.38 log cfu/g but only 0.68 log cfu/g with smoke. when cooling spanned 15 h, both c. perfringens and s. aureus grew by a total of about 4 log. the addition of liquid smoke inhibited c. perfringens, but s. aureus still achieved a 3.97-log increase. staphylococcal enterotoxins were detected in five of six samples cooled for 15 h without smoke but in none of the six samples of smoked bellies. in laboratory-scale smoking of whole belly pieces, initial c. perfringens populations of 2.23 +/- 0.25 log cfu/g were reduced during smoking to 0.99 +/- 0.50 log cfu/g and were 0.65 +/- 0.21 log cfu/g after 15 h of cooling. populations of s. aureus were reduced from 2.00 +/- 0.74 to a final concentration of 0.74 +/- 0.53 log cfu/g after cooling. contrary to findings in the ground pork belly system, the 15-h cooling of whole belly pieces did not permit growth of either pathogen. this study demonstrates that if smoked bacon is cooled from 48.9 to 7.2 degrees c (120 to 45 degrees f) within 15 h, a food safety hazard from either c. perfringens or s. aureus is not likely to occur.

AB  == the coordination of food sampling activities across wales, a part of the united kingdom with a population of approximately 3 million, led to the establishment in 1995 of a coordinated food-sampling program designed to monitor on a long-term basis the microbiological quality and safety of specific ready-to-eat products. this surveillance system has been ongoing for 9 years and has generated a database of microbiological and associated demographic results for 15,228 ready-to-eat food samples. the food types that had the poorest overall results were sliced meats, unsliced poultry, sandwiches made without salad, and cakes made without dairy cream. for all food types, the overall unsatisfactory rate was 17% for aerobic colony counts, 1.6% for escherichia coli, and 0.5% for listeria spp. overall unsatisfactory or unacceptable rates for pathogens such as clostridium perfringens, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus were all below 0.5%. no campylobacter-positive samples and  only one salmonella-positive sample were found. the analysis of the results show  that the ready-to-eat food types sampled over the 9 years of the program were generally of good microbiological quality when compared with current united kingdom guidelines. the information contained in the database provides a baseline measurement of the microbial quality of a variety of ready-to-eat foods and allows environmental health officers and food microbiologists to generate hypotheses for targeted surveys or research work.

TI  == bacteriological evaluation of commercial canine and feline raw diets.
AB  == twenty-five commercial raw diets for dogs and cats were evaluated bacteriologically. coliforms were present in all diets, ranging from 3.5 x 10(3)  to 9.4 x 10(6) cfu/g (mean 8.9 x 10(5); standard deviation 1.9 x 10(6)). escherichia coli was identified in 15/25 (64%) diets; however, e. coli o157 was not detected. salmonella spp. were detected in 5/25 (20%) diets; 1 each of beef-, lamb-, quail-, chicken-, and ostrich-based diets. sporeforming bacteria were identified from 4/25 (16%) samples on direct culture and 25/25 (100%) samples using enrichment culture. clostridium perfringens was identified in 5/25 (20%) samples. a toxigenic strain of c. difficile was isolated from one turkey-based food. staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 1/25 (4%) diets. campylobacter spp. were not isolated from any of the diets.

TI  == genetic characterization of the beta-glucuronidase enzyme from a human intestinal bacterium, ruminococcus gnavus.
AB  == beta-glucuronidase activity (encoded by the gus gene) has been characterized for  the first time from ruminococcus gnavus e1, an anaerobic bacterium belonging to the dominant human gut microbiota. beta-glucuronidase activity plays a major role in the generation of toxic and carcinogenic metabolites in the large intestine, as well as in the absorption and enterohepatic circulation of many aglycone residues with protective effects, such as lignans, flavonoids, ceramide and glycyrrhetinic acid, that are liberated by the hydrolysis of the corresponding glucuronides. the complete nucleotide sequence of a 4537 bp dna fragment containing the beta-glucuronidase locus from r. gnavus e1 was determined. five orfs were detected on this fragment: three complete orfs (orf2, gus and orf3) and two partial orfs (orf4 and orf5). the products of orf2 and orf3 show strong similarities with many beta-glucoside permeases of the phosphoenolpyruvate : beta-glucoside phosphotransferase systems (ptss), such as escherichia coli bglc,  bacillus subtilis bglp and bacillus halodurans pts enzyme ii. the product of orf5 presents strong similarities with the amino-terminal domain of clostridium acetobutylicum beta-glucosidase (bgla). the gus gene product presents similarities with several known beta-glucuronidase enzymes, including those of lactobacillus gasseri (69%), e. coli (61%), clostridium perfringens (59%) and staphylococcus aureus (58%). by complementing an e. coli strain in which the uida gene encoding the enzyme was deleted, it was confirmed that the r. gnavus gus gene encodes the beta-glucuronidase enzyme. moreover, it was found that the gus gene was transcribed as part of an operon that includes orf2, orf3 and orf5.

TI  == one-year (2003) nationwide pork carcass microbiological baseline data survey in taiwan.
AB  == from january through december 2003, swab samples from 1,650 pork carcasses were collected from 39 slaughter plants in taiwan. these samples were analyzed for the prevalence of indicator microorganisms and specific pathogens. viable aerobic bacteria, total coliforms, and escherichia coli were recovered from 100, 95.3, and 87.5% of these carcasses, respectively. of those carcasses that harbored bacteria, the mean aerobic plate, total coliform, and escherichia coli counts were 4.0, 0.6, and 0.1 log cfu/cm2, respectively. staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella were recovered from 4.8, 0.3, 13.8, 0.7, and 1.7 of 1,038 carcasses, respectively. e. coli o157:h7 was not detected from any carcass. when positive for a specific pathogen, the mean carcass concentration was 0.57 log cfu/cm2 for s. aureus, 0.66 most probable number (mpn)/cm2 for c. jejuni and  c. coli, and 0.18 mpn/cm2 for salmonella. the findings of this study will help provide a reference for establishing hygienic standards and a criterion for evaluating the effects of slaughtering operations in taiwan.

TI  == screening for bacillus isolates in the broiler gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == spores from a number of different bacillus species are currently being used as human and animal probiotics, although their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. here we describe the isolation of 237 presumptive gut-associated bacillus spp. isolates that were obtained by heat and ethanol treatment of fecal  material from organically reared broilers followed by aerobic plating. thirty-one representative isolates were characterized according to their morphological, physiological, and biochemical properties as well as partial 16s rrna gene sequences and screening for the presence of plasmid dna. the bacillus species identified included b. subtilis, b. pumilus, b. licheniformis, b. clausii, b. megaterium, b. firmus, and species of the b. cereus group, whereas a number of our isolates could not be classified. intrinsic properties of potential importance for survival in the gut that could be advantageous for spore-forming probiotics were further investigated for seven isolates belonging to five different species. all isolates sporulated efficiently in the laboratory, and the resulting spores were tolerant to simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions. they also exhibited antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria,  including food spoilage and pathogenic organisms such as bacillus spp., clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes. importantly, the isolates were susceptible to most of the antibiotics tested, arguing that they would not act as donors for resistance determinants if introduced in the form of probiotic preparations. together, our results suggest that some of the sporeformers isolated in this study have the potential to persist in or transiently associate with the complex gut ecosystem.

TI  == prevalence and characteristics of bacteria and host factors in an outbreak situation of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  == antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (aad) represents a clinical entity leading to prolonged hospital stays and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and results in additional costs. the aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence and characteristics of different bacteria in stools of patients with aad. the reliability of diagnostic procedures under routine conditions was evaluated. host factors were also analysed. from june 2002 to april 2003 89 cases of diarrhoea were reported at a hospital unit for internal medicine. clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens toxin enzyme-immunoassays (eias), and culture for c. difficile, c. perfringens and staphylococcus aureus were performed on stool samples from all patients. toxin production was determined in isolated s. aureus  strains. in vitro susceptibility of s. aureus for oxacillin and of c. difficile for vancomycin, metronidazole, linezolid, fusidic acid and tetracycline was tested. host factors, such as age, comorbidities, antibiotic exposure and contact with other patients, were evaluated. twenty-six stools were positive for c. difficile toxins by an eia technique, while c. difficile was cultured from 39. c. difficile was isolated from 21 stools that were eia negative. additionally, from  28 stools s. aureus and/or c. perfringens could be isolated. nine samples contained only s. aureus and/or c. perfringens. thirty-one stools were negative in all tests. all c. difficile isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and metronidazole. age >60 years, and diseases of the vascular system, the heart, the kidneys and the lungs were identified as risk factors for acquiring c. difficile  in this setting (p values < 0.05). stool culture for c. difficile was shown to be more sensitive than toxin eia in this study. risk factors for the acquisition of  c. difficile in outbreak situations seem to differ from risk factors in the normal hospital setting. the role of toxin-producing s. aureus in cases of aad needs further investigation.

TI  == growth of enterotoxigenic staphylococcus aureus in povi masima, a traditional pacific island food.
AB  == aims: to obtain preliminary data on the microbiology and hurdles to pathogen growth in the traditional pacific island food, povi masima, which is essentially  beef brisket cured in brine. methods and results: six containers of povi masima were prepared and two were inoculated with five enterotoxigenic strains of staphyloccocus aureus. the povi masima were divided into two lots each containing two uninoculated control and an inoculated container. lot 1 was incubated at room temperature (20 degrees c) and lot 2 under refrigeration (4-5 degrees c) for up to 98 days. during storage, samples were removed and tested for aerobic plate count, coagulase-producing staphylococci, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcal enterotoxin and various chemical parameters of the food. coagulase-producing staphylococci and aerobic plate counts grew to high levels in both the inoculated and uninoculated lots stored at room temperature, but enterotoxin was only detected at one time point in these lots and this may represent a false positive  result. the concentration of nacl in the meat increased with time as concentrations equilibrated, and nitrite was rapidly lost in those lots stored at room temperature. storage at 4-5 degrees c prevented proliferation of coagulase-producing staphylococci. conclusions: for safe curing and storage, this food should be kept under refrigeration as this prevented growth of staphylococci. optimum storage would also be achieved with improved attempts to ensure equal distribution of nacl prior to storage. significance and impact of the study: under conditions traditionally used to cure and store this food, enterotoxigenic staphylococci can grow to numbers where toxigenesis might occur,  especially during the early stages of curing where the salt has not diffused from the brine into the meat.

TI  == multipathogen oligonucleotide microarray for environmental and biodefense applications.
AB  == food-borne pathogens are a major health problem. the large and diverse number of  microbial pathogens and their virulence factors has fueled interest in technologies capable of detecting multiple pathogens and multiple virulence factors simultaneously. some of these pathogens and their toxins have potential use as bioweapons. dna microarray technology allows the simultaneous analysis of  thousands of sequences of dna in a relatively short time, making it appropriate for biodefense and for public health uses. this paper describes methods for using dna microarrays to detect and analyze microbial pathogens. the fda-1 microarray was developed for the simultaneous detection of several food-borne pathogens and  their virulence factors including listeria spp., campylobacter spp., staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin genes and clostridium perfringens toxin genes.  three elements were incorporated to increase confidence in the microarray detection system: redundancy of genes, redundancy of oligonucleotide probes (oligoprobes) for a specific gene, and quality control oligoprobes to monitor array spotting and target dna hybridization. these elements enhance the reliability of detection and reduce the chance of erroneous results due to the genetic variability of microbes or technical problems with the microarray. the results presented demonstrate the potential of oligonucleotide microarrays for detection of environmental and biodefense relevant microbial pathogens.

TI  == food safety: emerging trends in foodborne illness surveillance and prevention.
AB  == between 250 and 350 million americans are estimated to suffer acute gastroenteritis annually, with 25% to 30% thought to be caused by foodborne illnesses. most vulnerable to foodborne diseases are elderly people, pregnant women, immune-compromised people, and children. while bacterial causes such as salmonella are widely recognized and monitored as foodborne infections, other important bacterial causes such as clostridium perfringens , bacillus cereus , and staphylococcus aureus are less well known. while the majority of cases of foodborne diseases are of unknown cause, bacteria and viruses are the most likely causative agents. caliciviridae (norwalk-like) virus cases are more difficult to  identify, but represent the most common cause of known and probably unknown cases. fresh produce has to be added to the traditional list of foods requiring careful selection and handling to prevent foodborne disease. to assess the disease burden in the united states, morbidity and mortality surveillance activities are done by several networks and systems with collaboration among federal agencies and health departments. not all important causes are being equally monitored. critical behaviors by food processors, food retailers, foodservice personnel, and consumers can reduce the risk of foodborne illness episodes. dietetics professionals can more readily monitor new developments and update knowledge and practice through online resources.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == cot mattresses as reservoirs of potentially harmful bacteria and the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  == cot mattress materials were investigated as potential reservoirs of bacteria in relation to the sudden infant death syndrome (sids). the sleeping position of the infant significantly influenced bacterial population density of cot mattress polyurethane foams (p<0.0000001) and their covers (p<0.004). staphylococcus aureus was isolated at significantly higher frequency (p<0.03) from the infant's  head region of cot mattress materials. significantly higher bacterial population  densities (p<0.001) were associated with polyurethane foams from non-integral mattresses (exposed polyurethane foam), when compared to those from mattresses completely covered by polyvinyl chloride (integral type mattress). the frequency  of isolation of s. aureus from polyurethane foams from non-integral mattresses was also significantly higher (p=0.03) than from foams from the integral type. the following factors were significantly associated with increased frequency of isolation of s. aureus: from the polyurethane foam, previous use of non-integral  mattresses by another child (p=0.03 for all sample sites, p=0.01 for torso region); from the covers, sleeping in the prone position (p=0.003 head region, p=0.001 torso region). prone sleeping was also significantly associated with increased bacterial population levels (p=0.01) and increased frequency of isolation of escherichia coli (p=0.02) from the torso region of cot mattress covers. these findings could explain some recently identified risk factors for sids associated with type and previous use of cot mattresses. clostridium perfringens was isolated at very low frequency and streptococcus pyogenes was not isolated from any cot mattress materials tested.

TI  == genome architecture studied by nanoscale imaging: analyses among bacterial phyla  and their implication to eukaryotic genome folding.
AB  == the proper function of the genome largely depends on the higher order architecture of the chromosome. our previous application of nanotechnology to the questions regarding the structural basis for such macromolecular dynamics has shown that the higher order architecture of the escherichia coli genome (nucleoid) is achieved via several steps of dna folding (kim et al., 2004). in this study, the hierarchy of genome organization was compared among e. coli, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens. a one-molecule-imaging technique, atomic force microscopy (afm), was applied to the e. coli cells on a cover glass that were successively treated with a detergent, and demonstrated that the nucleoids consist of a fundamental fibrous structure with a diameter of  80 nm that was further dissected into a 40-nm fiber. an application of this on-substrate procedure to the s. aureus and the c. perfringens nucleoids revealed that they also possessed the 40- and 80-nm fibers that were sustainable in the mild detergent solution. the e. coli nucleoid dynamically changed its structure during cell growth; the 80-nm fibers releasable from the cell could be transformed into a tightly packed state depending upon the expression of dps. however, the s. aureus and the c. perfringens nucleoids never underwent such tight compaction when they reached stationary phase. bioinformatic analysis suggested that this was possibly due to the lack of a nucleoid protein, dps, in both species. afm analysis revealed that both the mitotic chromosome and the interphase chromatin of human cells were also composed of 80-nm fibers. taking all together, we propose a structural model of the bacterial nucleoid in which a  fundamental mechanism of chromosome packing is common in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == purification of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == bacteriocins are antibacterial substances of a proteinaceous nature that are produced by different bacterial species. lactic acid bacteria (lab) produce biologically active peptides or protein complexes that display a bactericidal mode of action almost exclusively toward gram-positive bacteria and particularly  toward closely related species. generally they are active against food spoilage and foodborne pathogenic microorganisms including bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes. there is an increased tendency to use natural occurring metabolites to prevent the growth of  undesirable flora in foodstuffs. these metabolites could replace the use of chemical additives such as sorbic acid, sulfur dioxide, nitrite, nitrate, and others. for instance, bacteriocins produced by lab may be promising for use as bio-preservaties. bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria are typically cationic, hydrophobic peptides and differ widely in many characteristics including molecular weight, presence of particular groups of amino acids, pi, net positive  charge, and post-translational modifications of certain amino acids. this heterogeneity within the lab bacteriocins may explain the different procedures for isolation and purification developed so far. the methods most frequently used for isolation, concentration, and purification involve salt precipitation of bacteriocins from culture supernatants, followed by various combinations of gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc). in this chapter, a protocol is described that combines several methods used in our laboratory for the purification of two cationic bacteriocins, lactocin 705al and enterocin crl10, produced by lactobacillus casei crl705 and enterococcus mundtii crl10, respectively.

TI  == in vitro activity of ertapenem: review of recent studies.
AB  == ertapenem is a long-acting, 1beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-a-day dosing supported by clinical studies. ertapenem is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. isolates from a variety of infections (intra-abdominal infections, skin/soft-tissue infections, community-acquired pneumonia, pelvic infections and urinary tract infections) are inhibited by ertapenem. it has restricted activity against nosocomial pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. ertapenem has potent activity against the majority of anaerobic isolates from intra-abdominal infections, and against most of the aerobes isolated from these infections, with the exceptions of the nosocomial pathogens mentioned above. mic(90)s for most species of enterobacteriaceae were <1 mg/l, significantly lower than those of imipenem. mic(90)s for most bacteroides fragilis group isolates ranged from 1 to 4 mg/l, and mic(90)s were species specific for clostridium, ranging from 0.06 mg/l for clostridium perfringens to 4 mg/l for clostridium clostridioforme. ertapenem was equivalent to or better than piperacillin-tazobactam in activity against most anaerobic species isolated from these infections, and was more potent than piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone against the most common skin pathogens (e.g. methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus). ertapenem was highly active against most of the pathogens isolated from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, except for isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (which are infrequent causes of community-acquired infection); these isolates were also resistant to ceftriaxone. resistance to ertapenem is most commonly attributable to a variety of mechanisms including alterations in penicillin-binding proteins in gram-positive organisms, and combinations of potent metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes, porin protein defects and efflux pumps in gram-negative organisms.

TI  == microbial-gut interactions in health and disease. antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  == most cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (aad) are directly or indirectly due to the alteration of gut microflora by antibiotics. 'functional' diarrhoea, usually limited to a mild and brief change in stool frequency, is considered as the most frequent pattern of aad. reduced carbohydrate fermentation and impaired  metabolism of bile acids have been claimed as the potential causes of this transient digestive discomfort but a critical analysis of the data supporting these theories is necessary. alternatively, changes in the gut flora ecosystem allow pathogens to proliferate. clostridium difficile is responsible for approximately 10% of cases of aad and almost all cases of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. the level of evidence which supports the potential responsibility of other candidate pathogens (klebsiella oxytoca, enterotoxin-producing clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus, candida) needs to be appreciated according to the updated postulates of causality relationships between a bacterium and a disease.

TI  == comparative analysis of gene expression among low g+c gram-positive genomes.
AB  == we present a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed (phx) genes in the low g+c gram-positive genomes of bacillus subtilis, bacillus halodurans, listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium acetobutylicum, and clostridium perfringens. most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are phx in these genomes, but not those involved in the tca cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. only b. subtilis and b. halodurans have several tca cycle phx genes, whereas the tca pathway is entirely  missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two streptococcus species and is incomplete in listeria, lactococcus, and clostridium. pyruvate-formate lyase, an  enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest phx genes in all these genomes except for c. acetobutylicum (not phx), and b. subtilis, and b. halodurans (missing). pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently phx in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. phosphotransferase system genes are generally phx with selection of different substrates in different genomes. the various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in  different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.

TI  == the role of bacterial and non-bacterial toxins in the induction of changes in membrane transport: implications for diarrhea.
AB  == bacterial toxins induce changes in membrane transport which underlie the loss of  electrolyte homeostasis associated with diarrhea. bacterial- and their secreted toxin-types which have been linked with diarrhea include: (a) vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin, e1 tor hemolysin and accessory cholera enterotoxin); (b) escherichia coli (heat stable enterotoxin, heat-labile enterotoxin and colicins); (c) shigella dysenteriae (shiga-toxin); (d) clostridium perfringens (c. perfringens enterotoxin, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin and theta-toxin); (e) clostridium difficile (toxins a and b); (f) staphylococcus aureus (alpha-haemolysin); (g) bacillus cereus (cytotoxin k and haemolysin bl); and (h)  aeromonas hydrophila (aerolysin, heat labile cytotoxins and heat stable cytotoxins). the mechanisms of toxin-induced diarrhea include: (a) direct effects on ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells, i.e. direct toxin interaction with intrinsic ion channels in the membrane and (b) indirect interaction with ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells mediated by toxin binding to a membrane  receptor. these effects consequently cause the release of second messengers, e.g. the release of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate/guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, ip(3), ca2+ and/or changes in second messengers that are the result of toxin-formed ca2+ and k+ permeable channels, which increase ca2+ flux and augment changes in ca2+ homeostasis and cause depolarisation of the membrane  potential. consequently, many voltage-dependent ion transport systems, e.g. voltage-dependent ca2+ influx, are affected. the toxin-formed ion channels may act as a pathway for loss of fluid and electrolytes. although most of the diarrhea-causing toxins have been reported to act via cation and anion channel formation, the properties of these channels have not been well studied, and the available biophysical properties that are needed for the characterization of these channels are inadequate.

TI  == microbiology of charcoal-broiled european river lampreys (lampetra fluviatilis) stored at 3 and 22 degrees c.
AB  == the microbiological quality of 30 production lots of charcoal-broiled river lampreys was studied at three lamprey processing plants (plants a, b, and c). samples were taken directly after charcoal broiling and stored at 22 and 3 degrees c. lampreys were examined on the day of manufacture, and those kept at 22 degrees c were examined every second day for 6 days. samples kept at 3 degrees c  were examined every fourth day for up to 24 days. on the production day, the mean aerobic plate counts (apcs) for broiled lampreys from plants a, b, and c were 2.29 log cfu/g, 1.88 log cfu/g, and undetectable (1.67 log cfu/g), respectively.  at 22 degrees c, the mean apcs for samples from plants a, b, and c increased markedly within 4 days, and after 6 days the counts for samples from these plants were 8.56, 5.04, and 6.23 log cfu/g, respectively. chilling and storage at 3 degrees c remarkably improved the shelf life of the product. the levels of bacteria in charcoal-broiled river lampreys from plant a were higher than those in lampreys from plants b and c. no significant increases in apcs were observed during storage at 3 degrees c for 24 days; mean apcs did not exceed 2.80 log cfu/g for samples from any plant. staphylococcus aureus was found in two samples. no lactic acid bacteria, thermotolerant coliforms, enterococci, clostridium perfringens, or listeria monocytogenes was detected. microbiological data from this study will be used for the development of a hazard analysis for the determination of critical control points.

AB  == a duplex real-time sybr green lightcycler pcr (lc-pcr) assay with dna extraction  using the qiaamp dna stool mini kit was evaluated with regard to detection of 8 of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in five stool specimens in 2 h or  less. the protocol used the same lc-pcr with 20 pairs of specific primers. the products formed were identified based on a melting point temperature (t(m)) curve analysis. the 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens examined were enteroinvasive escherichia coli, enteropathogenic e. coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli, enterotoxigenic e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, salmonella spp., shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, vibrio vulnificus, aeromonas spp., staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, and bacillus cereus. no interference with the lc-pcr assay was observed when stool specimens were artificially inoculated with each bacterial species. the detection levels were approximately 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of  stool. the protocol for processing stool specimens for less than 10(4) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool requires an overnight enrichment step to achieve adequate sensitivity. however, the rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of greater than 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g in samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food- or waterborne outbreaks.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == wessex shopping basket survey - a structured approach to local food sampling.
AB  == the shopping basket approach to food sampling, in which ready-to-eat food items from a shopping list were sampled at premises chosen at random, was adopted by 15 environmental health departments in the wessex region. a total of 2037 samples were analysed over a 30-month period. the microbiological quality varied considerably between food categories, with gravy and stock samples giving the highest proportion of satisfactory results. sliced meats, cooked rice and sandwiches gave the poorest overall results. whilst the majority of unsatisfactory results were due to elevated levels of indicator organisms (aerobic colony count, enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli), unsatisfactory or potentially hazardous levels of pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens or listeria monocytogenes) were detected in 1% of samples. salmonella was not detected in any sample. the shopping basket survey was considered to be a useful way of structuring local sampling, and the random selection of premises was found to be a considerable advantage over previous sampling plans. in addition, the survey drew attention to a number of microbiological problems with specific food types, leading to more detailed investigations.

TI  == consumer food-handling behaviors associated with prevention of 13 foodborne illnesses.
AB  == to be effective in reducing the incidence of foodborne illness, consumers and food safety educators need information about behaviors that will decrease exposure to foodborne pathogens. a four-round delphi technique was used to survey nationally recognized experts in food microbiology, epidemiology, food safety education, and food safety policy with the aim of identifying and ranking food-handling and consumption behaviors associated with 13 major foodborne pathogens. the food safety experts ranked behaviors related to keeping foods at safe temperatures as of primary importance in preventing illness caused by bacillus cereus and clostridium perfringens and of secondary importance in preventing illness caused by staphylococcus aureus. the use of a thermometer to cook foods adequately was ranked as of primary importance for the prevention of illness caused by campylobacter jejuni, salmonella species, escherichia coli o157:h7, toxoplasma gondii, and yersinia enterocolitica, with the avoidance of cross-contamination being ranked as of secondary importance for most of these pathogens. hand washing was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of shigellosis. the avoidance of certain foods that are likely to be contaminated was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of illnesses caused by listeria monocytogenes, noroviruses, and vibrio species. the expert panel's ranking of behaviors for the reduction of the risk of illness caused by major foodborne pathogens can enable consumers to make informed choices about food consumption and handling behaviors and can guide food safety educators in prioritizing their  educational efforts.

TI  == bactericidal effects of konjac fluid on several food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the bactericidal effects of japanese alkaline foods on food-poisoning bacteria were evaluated. konjac is an alkaline food soaked in calcinated calcium (the ph of konjac fluid ranges from 11.42 to 12.53). konjac fluids completely inactivated escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli o157:h7 and e. coil o26:h9, salmonella enteritidis, vibrio parahemolyticus. and staphylococcus aureus. the initial level of 6 log cfu/ml dramatically decreased after incubation with konjac fluid, and no viable gram-negative bacterium cells could be detected within 1 to 2 days and no viable s. aureus cells could be detected within 3 to 5 days. on the other hand, treatment with konjac fluid was also effective in reducing levels of spore-forming bacteria (bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium botulinum type e and type a). at least a 4-log reduction of spore-forming bacteria was obtained in konjac fluid within 7 to 14 days. vegetative cells were more susceptible to konjac fluid than spores were. when the initial cell count was 6 log cfu/ml, a few surviving spores remained for 60 to 90 days, but no spores could be detected  after 120 days. when the initial count of spore-forming bacteria was 3 to 4 log cfu/ml, the cells considered vegetative were completely inactivated within i to 3 days. repeated treatment with konjac fluid caused complete inactivation of spores in less than 1 to 3 days. our studies indicate that konjac fluid, which has a long history of use in food, will control food-poisoning bacterial contamination  during the production or preservation of konjac and other foods and has a preventive effect on bacteria that can cause severe disease at uniquely low levels.

TI  == identification of species of brucella using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  == fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) is a technique that has been used  over the years in chemical analysis for the identification of substances and is one that may be applied to the characterisation of microorganisms. the marked tendency of brucella towards variation in the smooth rough phase, together with the laboriousness and risk involved in the methods used in their identification,  make their classification difficult. we studied the type strains of the different species and biovars of brucella and 11 isolates of human origin of brucella melitensis, six corresponding to biovar 1, one to biovar 2 and five to biovar 3.  the results of linear discriminant analysis performed using the data provide an above 95% likelihood of correct classification, over half of which are in fact above 99% for the vast majority of brucella strains. only one case of b. melitensis biovar 1 has been incorrectly classified. the rest of the microorganisms studied (staphylococcus aureus, strteptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and pseudomonas aeruginosa) have been classified correctly in all cases to a likelihood of over 80%. in the graphic representation of the analysis, a grouping of these can be seen in clusters, which include the different species. one of these comprises b.  melitensis, another brucella abortus, and another wider one is made up of brucella suis. the brucella canis, brucella ovis and brucella neotomae strains appear separate from the previously described groups.

TI  == duplication is more common among laterally transferred genes than among indigenous genes.
AB  == background: recent developments in the understanding of paralogous evolution have prompted a focus not only on obviously advantageous genes, but also on genes that can be considered to have a weak or sporadic impact on the survival of the organism. here we examine the duplicative behavior of a category of genes that can be considered to be mostly transient in the genome, namely laterally transferred genes. using both a compositional method and a gene-tree approach, we identify a number of proposed laterally transferred genes and study their nucleotide composition and frequency of duplication. results: it is found that duplications are significantly overrepresented among potential laterally transferred genes compared to the indigenous ones. furthermore, the gc3 distribution of potential laterally transferred genes was found to be largely uniform in some genomes, suggesting an import from a broad range of donors. conclusions: the results are discussed not in a context of strongly optimized established genes, but rather of genes with weak or ancillary functions. the importance of duplication may therefore depend on the variability and availability of weak genes for which novel functions may be discovered. therefore, lateral transfer may accelerate the evolutionary process of duplication by bringing foreign genes that have mainly weak or no function into the genome.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == horizontal transfer of drug-resistant aminoacyl-transfer-rna synthetases of anthrax and gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == the screening of new antibiotics against several bacterial strains often reveals  unexpected occurrences of natural drug resistance. two examples of this involve specific inhibitors of staphylococcus aureus isoleucyl-transfer-rna synthetase 1  (ilers1) and, more recently, streptococcus pneumoniae methionyl-trna synthetase 1 (metrs1). in both cases, resistance is due to the presence of a second gene that  encodes another synthetase (ilers2 or metrs2). here, we show that both s. pneumoniae metrs2 and s. aureus ilers2 have closely related homologues in the gram-positive bacterium bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. furthermore, similar to drug-resistant pathogens, strains of b. anthracis and its closest relative, b. cereus, also have wild-type iles1 and mets1 genes. clostridium perfringens, the causative agent of gangrene, also has two mets genes, whereas oceanobacillus iheyensis isolated from deep-sea sediments has a single iles2-type gene. this study shows the importance of understanding complex  evolutionary networks of ancient horizontal gene transfer for the development of  novel antibiotics.

TI  == an investigation into the microflora of heroin.
AB  == in 2000, an unusual increase of morbidity and mortality among illegal injecting drug users in the uk and ireland was reported and clostridium novyi was identified as the likely source of the serious infection, although infections due to c. botulinum and bacillus cereus were also reported. because heroin was a possibile source of infection, this study investigated the microflora of heroin samples seized in england during 2000 and 2002. two methods were developed for the examination of the microflora of heroin. the first consisted of suspension of the drug in maximum recovery diluent (mrd) which was inoculated directly into clostridium botulinum isolation cooked meat broth (cbi). the second method rendered the heroin soluble in citric acid, concentrated particulate material (and bacterial cells) by filtration and removed heroin residues by washing with citric acid and phosphate-buffered saline before placing the filter in cbi broth. duplicate cbi broths from both methods were incubated without heating and after heating at 60 degrees c for 30 min. subcultures were made after incubation for 7  and 14 days on to eight different solid media. the methods were evaluated with heroin samples spiked with either c. botulinum or c. novyi spore suspensions; recovery of 10 spores in the original sample was demonstrated. fifty-eight heroin samples were tested by citric acid solubilisation and 34 by the mrd suspension technique. fifteen different gram-positive species of four genera were recognised. no fungi were isolated. aerobic endospore-forming bacteria (bacillus  spp. and paenibacillus macerans) were the predominant microflora isolated and at  least one species was isolated from each sample. b. cereus was the most common species and was isolated from 95% of all samples, with b. licheniformis isolated  from 40%. between one and five samples yielded cultures of b. coagulans, b. laterosporus, b. pumilus, b. subtilis and p. macerans. staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 23 (40%) samples; s. warneri and s. epidermidis were the most common and were cultured from 13 (22%) and 6 (10%) samples respectively. one or two samples yielded cultures of s. aureus, s. capitis and s. haemolyticus. the remainder of the flora detected comprised two samples contaminated with c. perfringens and two samples with either c. sordellii or c. tertium. multiple bacterial species were isolated from 43 (74%) samples, a single species from the  remaining 15. in 13 samples b. cereus alone was isolated, in one b. subtilis alone and in one sample b. pumilus alone. c. botulinum and c. novyi were not isolated from any of the heroin samples. recommendations for the optimal examination of the microflora of heroin are given.

TI  == the murein hydrolase of the bacteriophage phi3626 dual lysis system is active against all tested clostridium perfringens strains.
AB  == clostridium perfringens commonly occurs in food and feed, can produce an enterotoxin frequently implicated in food-borne disease, and has a substantial negative impact on the poultry industry. as a step towards new approaches for control of this organism, we investigated the cell wall lysis system of c. perfringens bacteriophage phi3626, whose dual lysis gene cassette consists of a holin gene and an endolysin gene. hol3626 has two membrane-spanning domains (msds) and is a group ii holin. a positively charged beta turn between the two msds suggests that both the amino terminus and the carboxy terminus of hol3626 might be located outside the cell membrane, a very unusual holin topology. holin  function was experimentally demonstrated by using the ability of the holin to complement a deletion of the heterologous phage lambda s holin in lambdadeltasthf. the endolysin gene ply3626 was cloned in escherichia coli. however, protein synthesis occurred only when bacteria were supplemented with rare trna(arg) and trna(ile) genes. formation of inclusion bodies could be avoided by drastically lowering the expression level. amino-terminal modification by a six-histidine tag did not affect enzyme activity and enabled purification by metal chelate affinity chromatography. ply3626 has an n-terminal amidase domain and a unique c-terminal portion, which might be responsible for the specific lytic range of the enzyme. all 48 tested strains of c. perfringens were sensitive to the murein hydrolase, whereas other clostridia and bacteria belonging to other genera were generally not affected. this highly specific activity towards c. perfringens might be useful for novel biocontrol measures in food, feed, and complex microbial communities.

AB  == in this research, the effects of different cooking processes (grilling, oven, and microwave cooking) on microbial flora and chemical composition of the raw and cooked meatballs as consumed in tekirdag were investigated. microbial flora of the raw meatballs was as follows: total bacteria, 6.02 x 10(6) cfu/g; psychrophilic bacteria, 1.3 x 10(5) cfu/g; yeast and mould, 2.4 x 10(5) cfu/g; coliforms, 1.1 x 10(5) cfu/g; escherichia coli, 1.0 x 10(2) cfu/g; total staphylococcae, 3.3 x 10(2) cfu/g; staphylococcus aureus, 85 cfu/g. while salmonella was found in only one sample, none of the samples contained clostridium perfringens. the cooking processes clearly decreased the microbial flora (2-3 log cycles in grilling (71 degrees c) and oven-cooked (79 degrees c),  3-4 log cycles in microwave (97 degrees c) heating) of the meatballs. however, because of the crust formation and high moisture losses from the meatball surface in microwave heating, some sensorial defects were observed in the final product.  also, fat and moisture losses were higher in microwave cooking compared to the other cooking processes. in conclusion, it is advised to use slightly higher temperatures than used in the grilling or conventinal cooking procedures to increase microbial quality of the meatballs studied in this research.

TI  == a novel type of conserved dna-binding domain in the transcriptional regulators of the algr/agra/lytr family.
AB  == sequence analysis of bacterial genomes revealed a novel dna-binding domain. this  domain is found in several response regulators of the two-component signal transduction system, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa algr, involved in the regulation of alginate biosynthesis and in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis; clostridium perfringens virr, a regulator of virulence factors, and in several regulators of bacteriocin biosynthesis, previously unified in the agra/come family. most of the transcriptional regulators that contain this dna-binding domain are involved in biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides, fimbriation, expression of exoproteins, including toxins, and quorum sensing. we  refer to it as the lyttr ('litter') domain, after bacillus subtilis lytt and staphylococcus aureus lytr response regulators, involved in regulation of cell autolysis. in addition to response regulators, the lyttr domain is found in combination with mhyt, pas and other sensor domains.

TI  == evaluation of n-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == n-acetylchitooligosaccharides ((glcnac)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. a chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using hcl. after purification, the purity of each (glcnac)(1-6) was >86%. the growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (bm) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize glcnac and (glcnac)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. bifidobacterium adolescentis and eubacterium limosum could use (glcnac)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis and proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (glcnac)(1-6). glcnac was used more readily than (glcnac)(2-6) by staphylococcus  aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. in bm, streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.

TI  == microbiological quality and safety of ready-to-eat cooked foods from a centralized school kitchen in argentina.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbiological and sensory quality as well as the safety of ready-to-eat (rte) cooked foods prepared in and distributed from a centralized kitchen to schools in argentina. a total of 101 cooked food samples delivered as hot rte cooked foods (group a) and as rte cooked foods at room temperature (group b) and 140 surface swab environment samples were collected from february to november 1999. petrifilm plates were used for aerobic  (pac), coliform (pcc), and escherichia coli (pec) counts. standard methods were used to determine enterobacteriaceae (entc) and thermotolerant coliform counts (tcc). samples were also tested for the presence of salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens. food temperatures just before samples were put into containers ranged from 80 to 98 degrees c and from 28 to 32 degrees c for group a and group b, respectively. for  group a food samples, pac ranged from 1.04 to 3.50 log cfu/g, and pcc, pec, tcc,  and entc were not detected. for group b food samples, pac ranged from 3.63 to 6.48 log cfu/g, pcc ranged from 1.90 to 5.36 log cfu/g, tcc ranged from 1.30 to 3.95 log cfu/g, and entc ranged from 3.60 to 5.46 log cfu/g. of the foodborne pathogens, only b. cereus was isolated (63.4% of samples) in both food groups (<4 log cfu/g). the microbiological and sensory quality and the safety of group a foods were satisfactory. large numbers of pac and entc detected in group b foods  show that better control is needed to avoid potential foodborne diseases.

TI  == epidemiologic profiling: evaluating foodborne outbreaks for which no pathogen was isolated by routine laboratory testing: united states, 1982-9.
AB  == the objective was to evaluate foodborne outbreaks of undetermined aetiology by comparing them to pathogen-specific epidemiologic profiles of laboratory-confirmed foodborne outbreaks. national foodborne outbreak data reported to cdc during 1982-9 were categorized by clinico-epidemiologic profiles  based on incubation, duration, percent vomiting, fever and vomiting to fever ratio. from the pathogen-specific profiles, five syndromes were developed: a vomiting-toxin syndrome resembling bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus; a diarrhoea-toxin syndrome characteristic of clostridium perfringens, a diarrhaeogenic escherichia coli syndrome, a norwalk-like virus syndrome, and a salmonella like syndrome. of 712 outbreaks, 624 (87.6%) matched one of five syndromes; 340 (47.8%) matched the norwalk-like syndrome and 83 (11.7%) matched the salmonella-like syndrome. after combining information on known pathogens and  epidemiologic profiles, only 88 (12.4%) outbreaks remained unclassified. norwalk-like virus outbreaks appear as common as salmonella-like outbreaks. we conclude that profiling can help classify outbreaks, guide investigations and direct laboratory testing to help detect new and emerging pathogens.

TI  == the failure of oral tolerance induction is functionally coupled to the absence of t cells in peyer's patches under germfree conditions.
AB  == although intestinal bacterial flora has been thought to play a role in the induction of oral tolerance, the mechanism has yet to be elucidated. we therefore examined the bacterial flora-dependent acquisition of susceptibility to oral tolerance induction using a gnotobiotic murine model. germ-free (gf) mice exhibited a significant shortage of t cells in the pps in comparison to spf mice. a recovery in the number of such t cells was accomplished in the gnotobiotic mice associated with bifidobacterium infantis or escherichia coli but not in the gnotobiotic mice with clostridium perfringens or staphylococcus aureus. to examine the susceptibility to oral tolerance induction, these mice were orally given ovalbumin (ova) as a tolerogen and then injected i.p. with the ag. the ag-specific igg1 in the serum remained at a low level in both spf and those gnotobiotic mice groups containing a sufficient number of t cells in the pps. however, no such unresponsiveness in the ab response was observed in gf or the other gnotobiotic mice groups containing only a few t cells in the tissues. adoptive cell transfer analysis clearly showed that a sufficient number of t cells in the pps is required for the induction of oral tolerance. furthermore, the reduced expression of slc (secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine), which is responsible for t-cell migration to lymphoid organs, was observed in the pps of gf mice, resulting in a shortage of t cells in the tissues. however, the reduced  expression of slc was restored even in the gf mice after conventionalization, thus suggesting that the failure of oral tolerance induction is functionally coupled to the innate absence of t cells under the gf condition.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  == evaluation of the bact/alert automated blood culture system for detecting bacteria and measuring their growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted platelet concentrates.
AB  == background and objective: to evaluate the bact/alert automated blood culture system for the detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates, and to determine bacterial growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted units. materials and methods: apheresis (cobe leucocyte reduction system [lrs]) and pooled buffy coat-derived (optipress) platelet concentrates (pcs) were tested. six organisms were used for spiking the pcs: clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, group b  streptococcus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli. units were inoculated to give a final concentration of approximately equal  to 1 and 50 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. on days 0, 2 and 5, bact/alert standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles were inoculated with a 5-ml fill volume and bacteria were enumerated. results: the bact/alert automated blood culture system gave rapid determination times of spiked units, with all positives detected within 48 h and 98.1% detected within 24 h. in general, as the inoculum  concentration increased, the detection time decreased. rapid growth was obtained  with all organisms tested except for b. cereus, which failed to grow on four occasions. bacterial numbers on day 2 ranged from 10(5) to 10(11) cfu/ml and on day 5 ranged from 10(4) to 10(12) cfu/ml. growth was not significantly greater in leucodepleted units. conclusions: the study confirmed that pcs are an excellent growth medium for bacteria. rapid and substantial growth was obtained with all organisms under test. leucodepletion does not appear to enhance bacterial proliferation. the bact/alert automated blood culture system could rapidly detect contamination of units. bacterial screening using an automated blood culture system is therefore a potential option.

TI  == mode of action of beta-barrel pore-forming toxins of the staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin family.
AB  == staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin is the prototype of a family of bacterial exotoxins with membrane-damaging function, which share sequence and structure homology. these toxins are secreted in a soluble form which finally converts into a transmembrane pore by assembling an oligomeric beta-barrel, with hydrophobic residues facing the lipids and hydrophilic residues facing the lumen of the channel. besides alpha-hemolysin the family includes other single chain toxins forming homo-oligomers, e.g. beta-toxin of clostridium perfringens, hemolysin ii  and cytotoxin k of bacillus cereus, but also the staphylococcal bi-component toxins, like gamma-hemolysins and leucocidins, which are only active as the combination of two similar proteins which form hetero-oligomers. the molecular basis of membrane insertion has become clearer after the determination of the crystal structure of both the oligomeric pore and the soluble monomer. studies on this family of beta-barrel pore-forming toxins are important for many aspects: (i) they are involved in serious pathologies of humans and farmed animals, (ii) they are a good model system to investigate protein-membrane interaction and (iii) they are the basic elements for the construction of nanopores with biotechnological applications in various fields.

AB  == this study was executed to investigate microbiological hazards at swine farms, slaughterhouses, dressing operations, and local markets for the application of the hazard analysis critical control point system in korea by analyzing total aerobic plate count (apc) and presence of pathogens. six integrated pig farms and meat packers were selected from six different provinces, and samples were collected from pig carcasses by swabbing and excision methods at the slaughterhouses, processing rooms, and local markets, respectively. apcs of water in water tanks were relatively low, 1.9 to 3.1 log10 cfu/ml; however, they were increased to 4.6 to 6.9 log10 cfu/ml when sampled from water nipples in the pigpen. apcs of feeds in the feed bins and in the pigpens were 4.4 to 5.4 and 5.2 to 6.7 log10 cfu/g, respectively. salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, and clostridium perfringens were detected from water and feed sampled in pigpens and  pigpen floors. s. aureus was the most frequently detected pathogenic bacteria in  slaughterhouses and processing rooms. listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica were also detected from the processing rooms of the kyonggi, kyongsang, and cheju provinces. even though apcs were maintained at the low level of 3.0 log10 cfu/g during slaughtering and processing steps, those of final pork  products produced by the same companies showed relatively high numbers when purchased from the local market. these results indicated that the cold chain system for transporting and merchandising of pork products was deficient in korea. water supply and feed bins in swine farms and individual operations can be identified as critical control points to reduce microbiological hazards in swine  farms, slaughterhouses, and processing plants.

TI  == prevalence of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcal enterotoxins in raw pork and uncooked smoked ham--a comparison of classical culturing detection and rflp-pcr.
AB  == in many countries staphylococcus aureus is considered to be the second or third most common pathogen causing outbreaks of food poisoning, only outnumbered by salmonella spp. and in competition with clostridium perfringens. often the consumption of ham or meat containing staphylococcal enterotoxins (se) is identified as cause of the illness. thus, to gain an insight into the prevalence  of s. aureus and its emetic enterotoxins in raw pork and uncooked smoked ham and  to investigate how the prevalence of the pathogen is influenced during the fabrication process, a total of 135 samples of raw pork, salted meat and ready-for-sale uncooked smoked ham were examined for the prevalence of s. aureus  and staphylococcal enterotoxins a to d (sea-sed). to this means classical cultural methods were employed as well as molecular biological techniques (pcr) and the results were compared. in 25.9% of all samples s. aureus was detected by  culture whereas 51.1% of the samples showed a positive result when pcr was used for the detection of the pathogen. fresh meat was contaminated most often. by pcr, 62.2% were identified as being s. aureus positive compared to 57.7% positive samples using the cultural technique. the detection rate during the fabrication process declined significantly. the pathogen was cultivated from 8.9% of the salted meat samples. here, 55.6% of the samples reacted positively in the pcr, and finally, in approximately a third of the ready-for-sale smoked hams, s. aureus genes were found. from 11.1% of these samples, the pathogen could be isolated by culture. from these results, we conclude that the pcr used in this study is more sensitive than the classical cultural method. by pcr, one or more staphylococcal enterotoxin genes were found in 24 of the 135 examined samples. this means that 34.8% of the staphylococcal strains identified using the pcr technique were enterotoxigenic. using the set-rpla, a percentage of 28.6% enterotoxigenic isolates was ascertained. no staphylococcal enterotoxin formation was detected by the set-rpla in ready-for-sale ham, although se-genes were found  by pcr. the detection of se-genes by pcr is faster and easier to perform than the set-rpla.

AB  == sections of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and large intestine from 14 sudden infant death syndrome (sids) babies were examined by scanning (sem) and transmission electron microscopy (tem). the type and amount of damage was characterised and quantitated and compared with the presence of clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus in faecal samples from the babies and toxins from the bacteria in faecal samples and serum from the babies. the data were compared with the damage that these toxins cause to the rabbit intestinal epithelium (see the previous paper in this issue). damage was present in most of the sids samples, varying from 0 to 96%, and most damage occurred when the faecal samples contained the above bacteria and their toxins. damage varied from removal of microvilli, damage to villus tips, separation of and removal of epithelial cells from the lamina propria, and removal of enterocytes leaving goblet and tuft cells, to damage and breakdown of  the lamina propria. the results support the hypothesis that the cause of death in a significant proportion of sids babies may result from the absorption of toxins  from the intestinal tract initiating a toxic shock reaction.

TI  == the effect of bacterial enterotoxins implicated in sids on the rabbit intestine.
AB  == the aim of this project was to characterise the type of damage caused to the intestine of the infant rabbit by bacterial enterotoxins implicated in sudden infant death syndrome (sids). samples of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and large intestine exposed to the toxins for up to 6 hours were examined by scanning (sem) and transmission electron microscopy (tem). the damage was quantitatively assessed (% villi damaged) by sem and qualitatively by sem and tem. clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin b and clostridium difficile toxin a + toxin b combined all caused severe damage to the villi in the small intestine (80-90% damage). clostridium difficile toxin b caused only slight damage (17% to the jejunum, 26% to the caecum). clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin caused moderate damage to the small intestine (duodenum 34%, caecum 35%), and escherichia coli sta caused significant damage to the small (53-70%) and large intestine (51%). the level of toxin damage increased with time, the small intestine being more susceptible generally to damage than the large intestine. each toxin differed in its ability to damage the villi, microvilli, enterocytes and lamina propria.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == partial characterization of polyfermenticin scd, a newly identified bacteriocin of bacillus polyfermenticus.
AB  == aims: to characterize polyfermenticin scd, a newly identified bacteriocin of bacillus polyfermenticus scd. methods and results: bacillus polyfermenticus scd was identified as a bacteriocin producer with a bactericidal activity against bacillus subtilis ifo 12113. polyfermenticin scd, named tentatively as the bacteriocin produced by b. polyfermenticus scd, showed a narrow spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, a yeast and moulds. production of polyfermenticin scd in a 5 l jar fermenter followed typical kinetics of primary metabolite synthesis. the antibacterial activity of polyfermenticin scd on sensitive indicator cells disappeared completely by treatment with proteinase k, which indicates its proteinaceous nature. polyfermenticin scd seemed to be very stable throughout the ph range of 2.0 to 9.0, and it was relatively heat labile compared with other bacteriocins. direct detection of polyfermenticin scd activity on sds-page suggested that it had an apparent molecular mass of about 14.3 kda. conclusions: bacillus polyfermenticus  scd produced relatively heat-labile polyfermenticin scd with a narrow spectrum of activity. significance and impact of the study: bacillus polyfermenticus scd is a commercial probiotic which has been used for the treatment of long-term intestinal disorders. new findings on polyfermenticin scd will be valuable in the evaluation of commercial probiotics. polyfermenticin scd can be used to control bacillus spoilage organisms as a biological control agent.

TI  == spread of antibiotic resistance with food-borne pathogens.
AB  == this short review summarizes data on antibiotic resistance profiles of common food-borne pathogens like salmonella sp., escherichia coli, campylobacter sp., listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. as a flashlight on the literature of the last few years, it provides ample evidence that antibiotic resistance traits have entered the microflora of farm animals and the food produced from them. molecular analysis of the resistance genes, where available, shows that the food microflora is not separated from its human counterpart and conjugative transfer of resistance genes has been demonstrated in vitro and in a few cases in vivo. for example, for salmonella typhimurium, resistance towards tetracyclines has increased from zero in 1948 to a 98% level in certain epidemic populations of s.  typhimurium dt104 in 1998. the high incidence of food-borne pathogens in raw meat and milk together with a high level of therapeutic, prophylactic and nutritional  application of antibiotics in agriculture reveals an antibiotic resistance problem of global dimensions. the resistance problem in human medicine will not be solved if there is a constant influx of resistance genes into the human microflora via the food chain.

TI  == microbiological hazard identification and exposure assessment of street food vending in johannesburg, south africa.
AB  == one hundred and thirty-two samples of beef, chicken, salad and gravy were collected from two street vendors over eleven replicate surveys to assess microbiological safety and quality. for each food type samples were collected during preparation and holding. dish water was also collected and food preparation surfaces swabbed during preparation and display. standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts, enterobacteriaceae counts, coliform  counts and spore counts. six hundred and seventy-five predominant colonies were isolated from aerobic plate counts of all samples and characterised. the incidence of selected foodborne bacterial pathogens and non-pathogenic e. coli 1  was also determined. in most cases mean bacterial counts of the raw materials were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of corresponding cooked foods. no significant differences (p > 0.05) in all count types were observed between food  samples collected during cooking and those collected during holding. in addition, no significant differences (p > 0.05) in all count types were observed between prepared salads and their raw materials. mean bacterial counts of water and swab  samples collected from vendor 1 were lower than those of water and swab samples collected from vendor 2.the predominant populations isolated from the aerobic plate counts were bacillus spp., staphylococcus spp., enterobacteriaceae and alcaligenes spp. bacillus cereus was detected in 17%, clostridium perfringens in  1%, staphylococcus aureus in 3% and vibrio metchnikovii in 2% of the food samples. campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, and escherichia coli o157:h7 were not detected. non-pathogenic e. coli 1 was detected in 13% of food samples, in 86 and 36% of dish water samples collected from vendors 1 and 2, respectively, and in 36% of surface swab samples from vendor 2.

TI  == a new cytotoxin from bacillus cereus that may cause necrotic enteritis.
AB  == a cytotoxin (cytk) has been isolated from a bacillus cereus strain that caused a  severe food poisoning outbreak killing three people. a protein of 34 kda was highly cytotoxic, and the addition of other secreted proteins gave no synergistic effect. cytk was also necrotic and haemolytic. no known b. cereus enterotoxins were produced by this strain. a dna sequence from 1.8 kb upstream to 0.2 kb downstream of the toxin gene was sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequence of the toxin showed similarity to staphylococcus aureus leucocidins, gamma-haemolysin and alpha-haemolysin, clostridium perfringens beta-toxin and b.  cereus haemolysin ii, all belonging to a family of beta-barrel channel-forming toxins. there was no sequence similarity between cytk and enterotoxins of b. cereus. the upstream sequence contained a partial sequence of a putative histidine kinase gene. a recognition site for plcr, which regulates the transcription of enterotoxins hbl and nhe of b. cereus, was found in the promoter region of the toxin. this new cytotoxin may be responsible for a disease that is  similar to, although not as severe as, the necrotic enteritis caused by the beta-toxin of c. perfringens type c.

TI  == new developments in chromogenic and fluorogenic culture media.
AB  == this review describes some recent developments in chromogenic and fluorogenic culture media in microbiological diagnostic. the detection of beta-d-glucuronidase (gud) activity for enumeration of escherichia coli is well known. e. coli o157:h7 strains are usually gud-negative and do not ferment sorbitol. these characteristics are used in selective media for these organisms and new chromogenic media are available. some of the new chromogenic media make the salmonella diagnostic easier and faster. the use of chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates for detection of beta-d-glucosidase (beta-glu) activity to differentiate enterococci has received considerable attention and new media are described. rapid detection of clostridium perfringens, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus are other application of enzyme detection methods in food and water microbiology.

AB  == screening for bacteriocin production of 500 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) from various african fermented foods resulted in the detection of a bacteriocin producing lactococcus lactis (bfe 1500) isolated from a dairy product called wara. the bacteriocin inhibited not only the closely related lab, but also strains of listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua, clostridium butyricum, clostridium perfringens, bacillis cereus and staphylococcus aureus. it was heat stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees c for 15 min) and was active  over a wide ph range (2-10), but highest activity was observed in the lower ph range. the bacteriocin was inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase k, but not by other proteases. growth kinetic assay indicated stronger growth inhibition by the bacteriocin produced by lc. lactis bfe 1500 on l. monocytogenes ws 2250 and b. cereus dsm 2301 than with the nisin a producing strain dsm 20729.  polymerase chain reaction indicated the presence of the nisin operon in strain bfe 1500 and sequencing of its structural gene showed that lc. lactis bfe 1500 produced the natural nisin variant, nisin z, as indicated by the substitution of  asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. the genetic determinants  for bacteriocin production in strain bfe 1500 are located on a conjugative transposon. the ability of the bacteriocin produced by lc. lactis bfe 1500 to inhibit a wide range of food-borne pathogens is of special interest for food safety, especially in the african environment with perennial problems of poor food hygiene.

TI  == bacteria associated with processed crawfish and potential toxin production by clostridium botulinum type e in vacuum-packaged and aerobically packaged crawfish tails.
AB  == refrigerated vacuum-packaged storage has been shown to increase significantly the shelf life of fresh fish and seafood products, but the effect, if any, on the outgrowth and toxin production of clostridium botulinum type e on cooked crawfish is unknown. microflora associated with live crawfish reflect the microbial populations of the harvest water and sediments in which they are living. the presence or absence of specific pathogens in either vacuum-packaged or air-permeable bags of cooked crawfish have not been thoroughly evaluated. this study evaluates the potential survival and outgrowth of biological hazards in both vacuum-packaged and air-permeable-packaged cooked crawfish held at 4 and 10  degrees c for 30 days. during shelf-life studies of vacuum-packaged and air-permeable-bagged cooked crawfish, a total of 31 bacterial species were isolated and identified from crawfish samples using both selective and nonselective media. the only pathogens isolated from both vacuum-packed and air-permeable bags of processed crawfish samples during shelf-life studies were strains of aeromonas hydrophila and staphylococcus aureus. c. botulinum type e and clostridium perfringens species were not isolated from any of the uninoculated crawfish samples. cooked crawfish were inoculated with 10(3) c. botulinum type e spores per g of crawfish tail meat to determine whether cooked crawfish tails would support the growth of c. botulinum type e strains and produce toxin at refrigerated temperatures. spore-inoculated crawfish tails were  vacuum packaged in both a high barrier film and an air-permeable bag and stored at 4 degrees c and 10 degrees c for 30 days. c. botulinum toxin e was not detected in any of the spore-inoculated packages throughout the shelf-life study  until day 30. microbiological data from this study should be useful in the development and implementation of the hazard analysis and critical control point  plans for processed crawfish tails.

TI  == clostridium perfringens beta-toxin forms multimeric transmembrane pores in human  endothelial cells.
AB  == beta-toxin is one of the lethal toxins of clostridium perfringens. it shares sequence homology with the pore-forming alpha-toxin of staphylococcus aureus and  structural homology has been indicated by mutagenesis studies. human endothelial  cells are sensitive to the toxic effect of alpha-toxin and in order to investigate the function of beta-toxin we have looked at the effect of the protein on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. we show that like alpha-toxin  beta-toxin induces release of arachidonic acid in a dose dependent manner. in addition we show that both toxins cause leakage of inositol from the cells, consistent with the formation of transmembrane pores. the effect of toxin mutants on endothelial cells correlates with the lethal dose of each mutant in mice. furthermore, we demonstrate the formation of heat stable toxin multimers in the cell membrane. multimer formation was not observed on other cell types tested. we conclude that beta-toxin is a cell specific pore-forming toxin, structurally and  functionally related to alpha-toxin of staphylococcus aureus.

AB  == two toxin-producing bacteria implicated in sudden infant death syndrome (sids) are staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens. epidemiological studies have shown that breast feeding reduces an infant's risk of sids. this protective  effect could be due partly to iga antibodies to these toxins in human milk. the aim of this work was to use a quantitative elisa to determine levels of iga antibodies that bound to toxic shock syndrome toxin (tsst-1), staphylococcal enterotoxin c (sec) and c. perfringens enterotoxin a (cea) in individual samples  of human milk. all samples of milk tested contained iga antibodies that bound to  the bacterial toxins. for individual samples, iga bound to tsst-1, sec and cea were in the range of 900-3100 ng ml(-1), 1000-3600 ng ml(-1) and 1000-4300 ng ml(-1) respectively. isolation of s. aureus from mothers donating breast milk samples was used to determine if the presence of bacteria affected iga levels which bound tsst-1 and sec. for 3/5 samples with levels above the upper limit of  the standard deviation (2375 ng ml(-1)) for iga bound to tsst-1, s. aureus was isolated from the mother whilst 4/5 samples found to contain levels above the upper limit of the standard deviation (2627 ng ml(-1)) for iga bound to sec, had  s. aureus isolated from the mother. in conclusion, if bacterial toxins do play a  role in precipitating a sids death, the presence of iga antibodies to toxins in breast milk, but not in infant formula, might contribute to the protective effect of breast feeding in relation to sids.

TI  == reversal of tetracycline resistance mediated by different bacterial tetracycline  resistance determinants by an inhibitor of the tet(b) antiport protein.
AB  == active efflux is a useful strategy by which bacteria evade growth inhibition by antibiotics. certain semisynthetic tetracycline (tc) analogs, substituted at the  13th carbon at c-6 on ring c of the tc molecule, blocked tc efflux as revealed in everted membrane vesicles from class b tc-resistant (tcr) escherichia coli (m. l. nelson, b. h. park, j. s. andrews, v. a. georgian, r. c. thomas, and s. b. levy,  j. med. chem. 36:370-377, 1993). a representative c-13-substituted analog, 13-cyclopentylthio-5-oh-tc (13-cptc), was shown to competitively inhibit tc translocation by the tet(b) protein, blocking the uptake of tc into vesicles and  therefore the efflux of tc from whole cells. against tcr e. coli, 13-cptc, when used in combination with doxycycline, produced synergistic inhibition of growth.  13-cptc was shown to increase the uptake of [3h]tc into the resistant cells. 13-cptc alone was a potent growth inhibitor against tc-susceptible (tcs) and tcr  staphylococcus aureus and enterococci specifying class k or class l efflux-dependent tc resistance mechanisms or, unexpectedly, the class m ribosomal protection mechanism. these findings indicate that derivatives of tc, identified  by their ability to block the tet(b) efflux protein, can restore tc activity against tcr bacteria bearing either of the two known resistance mechanisms. blocking drug efflux and increasing intracellular drug concentrations constitute  an effective approach to reversing tc resistance and may be generally applicable  to other antibiotics rendered ineffective by efflux proteins.

TI  == immunostimulatory properties of genomic dna from different bacterial species.
AB  == bacterial dna has potent immunological properties because of its content of immunostimulatory sequences centering on cpg motifs. to investigate whether dna from various bacterial species differ in these properties, the activity of a panel of dna was assessed in in vitro cultures of murine spleen cells. this panel varied in base composition and included dna from clostridium perfringens (cp), escherichia coli (ec), micrococcus lysodeikticus (mc), staphylococcus aureus (sa), and, as a mammalian dna control, calf thymus (ct) dna. in assays of il-12 and ifn-gamma production as well as b cell mitogenesis, these dna showed marked differences in their immunostimulatory activity. for both cytokine and b cell responses, ec dna demonstrated the highest activity while cp dna had the lowest activity among the bacterial dna. to determine whether differences in stimulatory capacity resulted from differences in cell uptake, the activity of dna complexed  with lipofectin was tested. while the addition of lipofectin to dna increased stimulation by all dna, it did not change the relative potency of the dna tested. these results indicate that bacterial dna differ in their immunostimulatory capacity, most likely reflecting their content of cpg motifs. these differences could affect the induction of innate immunity as well as the consequences of infection.

TI  == foodborne illness in the elderly.
AB  == the elderly (> or = 65 years of age) are more susceptible to morbidity and mortality from foodborne-induced gastroenteritis than younger individuals. several factors contribute to the increased susceptibility to foodborne infections as well as other infections in elderly populations. these include an age-associated decrease in humoral and cellular immunity, age-related changes in  the gastrointestinal tract (decreased production of gastric acid and decreased intestinal motility), malnutrition, lack of exercise, entry into nursing homes, and excessive use of antibiotics. data from foodborne outbreaks associated with nursing homes indicate that the elderly are more likely to die from foodborne campylobacter, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella, and staphylococcus aureus infections than the general population. infections by salmonella species are the most common cause of illness and death in nursing homes with salmonella enteritidis as the major cause of both morbidity and mortality. while it is impossible to turn back the clock, practicing a healthy life-style with regular exercise, maintaining a balanced diet, receiving regular  health care, paying attention to personal hygiene, and monitoring food preparation and handling should lead to a reduced incidence of foodborne and other infections in the elderly.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == microbiological quality of hot meals served by airlines.
AB  == the microbiological quality of 1,012 hot meals served on aircraft was studied in  1991 to 1994. the material included dishes prepared in 33 countries all over the  world. the geometric means of aerobic colony counts and escherichia coli were significantly lower in breakfasts (p < 0.05) than in main dishes. pathogenic bacteria were found in 30 samples (3.0%), bacillus cereus being the most common pathogen. the frequencies of b. cereus and staphylococcus aureus did not differ between breakfasts and main dishes. many of the samples exceeded the minimum acceptable microbiological standards recommended by the association of european airlines (aea) for e. coli, s. aureus, b. cereus, clostridium perfringens, and salmonella; i.e., 8.2%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. there were considerable differences in aerobic colony counts and e. coli counts between countries where the food was prepared.

TI  == evaluation of microbial hazards during processing of spanish prepared flamenquin.
AB  == flamenquin is a traditional, prepared, frozen meat product from the south of spain made with minced pork, chicken, and cooked ham. since it is a prepared raw  meat product some microbial hazards could be associated with the process of making it. microbiological analyses have been performed throughout the various steps of processing over a 1-year period to evaluate microbial hazards in the commercial process. high levels of microorganisms were observed all through the processing of this product, the mincing and mixing steps being where major microbial contamination was observed. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus  aureus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected during processing. raw materials and food handlers were the principal sources of microbial contamination. a modification of processing to include a heating step after mincing and mixing and an improvement in hygiene practices could eliminate the microbial hazards. both modifications should be noted for the implementation of a hazard analysis of critical control points (haccp) program in commercial flamenquin processing.

TI  == studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  == the specific growth rates of brochothrix thermosphacta, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the food micromodel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a  td, r = specific growth rate; t = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). the exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. a microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. the d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. the temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for b. thermosphacta and y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as b. cereus, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and s. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the  d-value of c. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. the values of parameter a of  the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. for all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. the lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. the change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. the influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in  chinese sausages. the d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from mrs cultures was 2.36. in refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. in this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-834, a novel oral carbapenem.
AB  == cs-834 is a novel oral carbapenem antibiotic. this compound is an ester-type prodrug of the active metabolite r-95867. the antibacterial activity of r-95867 was tested against 1,323 clinical isolates of 35 species and was compared with those of oral cephems, i.e., cefteram, cefpodoxime, cefdinir, and cefditoren, and that of a parenteral carbapenem, imipenem. r-95867 exhibited a broad spectrum of  activity covering both gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes. its activity was superior to those of the other compounds tested against most of the  bacterial species tested. r-95867 showed potent antibacterial activity against clinically significant pathogens: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus including ofloxacin-resistant strains, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant strains, clostridium perfringens, neisseria spp., moraxella  catarrhalis, most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, and haemophilus influenzae (mic at which 90% of strains are inhibited, < or =0.006 to 0.78 microg/ml). r-95867 was quite stable to hydrolysis by most of the beta-lactamases tested except the metallo-beta-lactamases from stenotrophomonas maltophilia and bacteroides fragilis. r-95867 showed potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus and escherichia coli. penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of s. aureus and 1bs, 2, 3, and 4 of e. coli had high affinities for r-95867. the in vivo efficacy of cs-834 was evaluated in murine systemic infections caused by 16 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens. the efficacy of cs-834 was in many cases superior to those of cefteram pivoxil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefdinir, and cefditoren pivoxil, especially against infections caused by s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, e. coli, citrobacter freundii, and proteus vulgaris. among the drugs tested, cs-834 showed the highest efficacy against experimental pneumonia in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

TI  == biochemical and genetic characterization of enterocin p, a novel sec-dependent bacteriocin from enterococcus faecium p13 with a broad antimicrobial spectrum.
AB  == enterocin p is a new bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium p13 isolated from a spanish dry-fermented sausage. enterocin p inhibited most of tested spoilage and food-borne gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, such as listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium botulinum. enterocin p is produced during growth in mrs broth from 16 to 45 degrees c; it is heat resistant (60 min at 100 degrees c; 15 min at 121 degrees c) and can withstand exposure to ph between 2.0 and 11.0, freeze-thawing, lyophilization, and long-term storage at 4 and -20 degrees c. the bacteriocin was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, cation-exchange, hydrophobic-interaction, and reverse-phase liquid chromatography. the sequence of 43 amino acids of the n terminus was obtained by  edman degradation. dna sequencing analysis of a 755-bp region revealed the presence of two consecutive open reading frames (orfs). the first orf encodes a 71-amino-acid protein containing a hydrophobic n-terminal sec-dependent leader sequence of 27 amino acids followed by the amino acid sequence corresponding to the purified and sequenced enterocin p. the bacteriocin is apparently synthesized as a prepeptide that is cleaved immediately after the val-asp-ala residues (positions -3 to -1), resulting in the mature bacteriocin consisting of 44 amino  acids, and with a theoretical molecular weight of 4,493. a second orf, encoding a putative immunity protein composed of 88 amino acids with a calculated molecular  weight of 9,886, was found immediately downstream of the enterocin p structural gene. enterocin p shows a strong antilisterial activity and has the consensus sequence found in the pediocin-like bacteriocins; however, enterocin p is processed and secreted by the sec-dependent pathway.

TI  == oral tolerance to ovalbumin in mice: induction and long-term persistence unaffected by staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin b and clostridium perfringens type a enterotoxin.
AB  == oral administration of dietary antigen (ag) results in the systemic ag-specific immunologic unresponsiveness termed oral tolerance. its induction is of importance in the young where numerous symptoms are associated with ige-mediated  food-hypersensitivity reactions. two related enterotoxins, cholera toxin and escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin, have been shown to abrogate oral tolerance (i.e. igg and ige antibody (ab) unresponsiveness) to an unrelated and simultaneously fed ag. however, a critical role has been suggested for the gut flora in recovery of a hyporesponsive state. the purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin b (seb) and clostridium perfringens type a enterotoxin (cpe), involved in many diarrheas, could affect the induction and long-term persistence of oral tolerance to ovalbumin (ova). using conventional and germ-free mice fed once or twice with enterotoxin plus ova, we investigated the possible role of the indigenous gut flora. in addition, we tested the influence of cpe synthesized in vivo in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice on the induction of ova-specific oral tolerance. mice were immunized intraperitoneally with ova twice, and igg and ige  ab levels were measured by elisa. neither seb nor cpe, orally given or synthesized in vivo (cpe), prevented the induction of oral tolerance to ova. moreover, the igg ab unresponsiveness persisted over 2 mo in the conventional mice fed with toxin plus ova as also observed in the ova controls. the results indicate that, independent of the gut flora's influence, seb and cpe did not affect the induction nad long-term persistence of oral tolerance to co-ingested ag.

AB  == usefulness of the synergistic haemolysis (camp-like) test in the identification of aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas sobria, and aeromonas caviae was evaluated, using beta-toxin producing staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and alpha-toxin producing clostridium perfringens atcc 13124 as sphingomyelinase producing indicator strains. the tests were done on columbia blood agar base supplemented with 5% sheep blood (cba; difco laboratories, detroit, mi, usa). when cultured aerobically, 77% of a. hydrophila isolates, 75% of a. sobria isolates, and 23% of a. caviae isolates elicited synergistic haemolysis of sheep erythrocytes with the beta-toxin producing strain of s. aureus. anaerobically, using the same indicator strain, synergistic haemolysis was given by 91%, 51% and 82% of a. hydrophila, a. sobria, and a. caviae, respectively. when alpha-toxin producing c. perfringens was used in the test instead of beta-toxin producing s. aureus, 100%, 86%, and 93% of a. hydrophila, a. sobria, and a. caviae isolates, respectively, showed synergistic haemolysis of sheep erythrocytes. due to the high number of the tested isolates of a. hydrophila, a. sobria, and a. caviae giving a positive synergistic haemolysis reaction in both atmospheric conditions of culture, this test cannot be used to identify any of the three aeromonas spp. the use of alpha-toxin producing c. perfringens did not improve discriminatory power of the  test. because the nature of the product of aeromonas spp. responsible for the lytic phenomenon is not known, the use of aeromonas factor and synergistic haemolysis terms was proposed rather than camp (reaction, test) or camp (-like) factor.

TI  == economic costs and trade impacts of microbial foodborne illness.
AB  == this article presents the economic costs of foodborne diseases for selected countries, the approaches used to calculate these costs, and a discussion on the  interaction between microbial food safety issues and international trade in food. the human illness costs due to foodborne pathogens are estimated most completely  in the united states of america, where, each year, 7 foodborne pathogens (campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7. listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, and toxoplasma gondii) cause an estimated 3.3-12.3 million cases of foodborne illness and up to 3900 deaths. these 7 pathogens are found in animal products and cost the united states an estimated $6.5-$34.9 billion (1995 us$) annually. the presence of foodborne pathogens in a country's food supply not only affects the health of the local population, but also represents a potential for spread to pathogens to visitors to the country and to consumers in countries which import food products. with more complete data on foodborne illnesses, deaths, costs and international trade  rejections in each country, indicators could be developed by which changes in food safety can be monitored.

TI  == safe poultry meat production in the next century.
AB  == the revolutionary industrialisation of the poultry industry in the last 30 years  has made the food poultry meat available for large groups of consumers. due to its nutritional, sensory and economical characteristics, poultry meat is by far the most popular animal food product world-wide. epidemiological reports, however, incriminate poultry meat as a source for outbreaks of human food poisoning. the organisms involved are salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and, to a lesser extent, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium perfringens and aeromonas spp. contamination of the end-product with pathogenic microorganisms is a reflection of the contamination of the live birds and, therefore, measures to be taken by industry  to avoid contamination of the consumer-ready product should start at that level.  in terms of the critical control point approach of the haccp concept, the quantitative contribution of critical phases in the production chain towards end-product contamination should be estimated in order to take the necessary intervention or corrective steps. to guarantee the production of safe poultry meat, knowledge of the capability of microorganisms to colonise the gastrointestinal tract is needed and the use of vaccines, antimicrobials and competitive exclusion microfloras as well as the implementation of new processing technology should be encouraged.

TI  == intracellular transport and processing of protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria.
AB  == bacterial toxins are associated with disease in humans and animals. toxins can either be preformed in food or produced by bacteria in the intestine. there are two types of toxins: heat-labile protein toxins and heat stabile toxins. heat labile toxins are produced by bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and vibrio cholerae, and heat-stabile enterotoxins consisting of relatively few amino acids are produced by escherichia coli and acts by activation of guanylate cyclase. similarly, heat-stabile entero-toxins are also produced by staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of food poisoning in the united states, and yersenia enterocolitica. protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria  can intoxicate intestinal cells and can also be taken up from the gut and reach other cells in the body. for example the shiga-like toxins (vero-toxins) can intoxicate endothelial cells in the kidney and cause kidney failure. intracellular transport and processing of a few of the protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria, namely clostridium difficile toxin a and b, cholera toxin and the related heat-labile toxin produced by escherichia coli, and shiga toxin and shiga-like toxins are presented.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem, was studied in comparison with other beta-lactam antimicrobials against 711 recent clinical isolates including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that faropenem was active against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mics <  or = 4 mg/l), with reduced activity against serratia spp. (mic90 = 32 mg/l). in common with its comparators, faropenem had weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic > 128 mg/l). faropenem was active against staphylococci, although for mrsa mics were raised (mic90 = 2 mg/l) compared with those for mssa (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l). faropenem was also found to be  active against streptococci, neisseria spp., enterococcus faecalis and beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and  moraxella catarrhalis. of the anaerobic bacteria studied, faropenem was most active against peptostreptococci and clostridium perfringens (mic90 < or = 1 mg/l) and bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 4 mg/l). an increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu raised faropenem mics for morganella morganii from 0.06-1 mg/l to 2-4 mg/l and for mrsa from 0.25-2 mg/l to 8 mg/l (a similar increase was not observed for mssa). the mics of faropenem were not affected by the presence of either 20% or 70% (v/v) serum. mics for faropenem to 11 well characterized beta-lactamase producers were similar to those of non-producers. in hydrolysis studies, faropenem was shown to be highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases,  including tem-1, shv-1, the extended spectrum beta-lactamases, tem-3 and tem-9, and the beta-lactamase produced by staphylococcus aureus (nctc 11561).

AB  == possible adverse effects of microbial organisms have been implicated in symptomatic silicone implant patients. in the literature, numerous authors have investigated the possible role of infection with respect to implant problems. to  date, various bacterial species have been reported, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococci, and clostridium perfringens. infections in polyurethane-coated prostheses also have been shown to prolong morbidity. antibiotic use has been relatively empirical in this regard. the purpose of this study was, first, to determine the frequency, type, and clinical relevance of microbial colonization on implant surfaces removed from symptomatic patients and, second, to determine possible effects of microbial colonization on implant integrity (gel bleed, rupture). a total of 139 implants from 72 symptomatic patients were entered into the prospective clinical study between february of 1993 and july of 1994 at the ucla medical center. the implant shell types included smooth (79 percent), polyurethane (8 percent), textured (7 percent), and smooth and dacron (6 percent). the implant locations were subglandular (71 percent), submuscular (28 percent), and subcutaneous (1 percent). of the 139 implants removed, 69 percent were intact and 31 percent were ruptured. forty-seven percent of 139 implants were culture-positive. propionibacterium acnes was isolated most frequently (57.5 percent), followed by  staphylococcus epidermidis (41 percent), and then escherichia coli (1.5 percent). no fungal infections were identified. culture positivity was not significantly associated with systemic symptoms. sixty-seven percent of the positive culture implants were intact; 33 percent were ruptured. the frequency (47 percent) and types (p. acnes and s. epidermidis) of microbial colonization are determined in symptomatic silicone implant patients.

TI  == the effect of gamma-irradiation on the antibacterial activity of honey.
AB  == there is increasing usage of honey as a dressing on infected wounds, burns and ulcers, but there is some concern that there may be a risk of wound botulism from the clostridial spores sometimes found in honey. it is well-established that the  antibacterial activity is heat-labile so would be destroyed if honey were sterilized by autoclaving, but the effect of gamma-irradiation on the antibacterial activity of honey is not known. therefore an investigation was carried out to assess the effect on the antibacterial activity of honey when the  honey was subjected to a commercial sterilization procedure using gamma-irradiation (25 kgy). two honeys with antibacterial activity due to enzymically-generated hydrogen peroxide and three manuka honeys with non-peroxide antibacterial activity were investigated. the honeys were tested against staphylococcus aureus in an agar well diffusion assay. there was no significant change found in either type of antibacterial activity resulting from this form of sterilization of honey, even when the radiation was doubled (to 50 kgy). testing  of honey seeded with spores of clostridium perfringens and c. tetani (10000 and 1000 spores g-1 of honey, respectively) showed that 25 kgy of gamma-irradiation was sufficient to achieve sterility.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of activities of nitazoxanide and tizoxanide against anaerobes and aerobic organisms.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of nitazoxanide and its main metabolite, tizoxanide, were tested against a broad range of bacteria, including anaerobes. metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, and clindamycin were used as positive controls. mics were determined by reference agar dilution methods. the 241 anaerobes were all inhibited by nitazoxanide, with the mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic90s) being between 0.06 and 4 mg/liter with the exception of those for propionibacterium species, for which the mic90 was 16 mg/liter. the mic90s of nitazoxanide were 0.5 mg/liter for the bacteroides fragilis group (80 strains), 0.06 mg/liter for clostridium difficile (21 strains), and 0.5 mg/liter for clostridium perfringens  (16 strains). metronidazole showed a level of activity comparable to that of nitazoxanide except against bifidobacterium species, against which it was poorly  active, and propionibacterium species, which were resistant to metronidazole. the other antibiotics showed various levels of activity against anaerobes, with imipenem along with nitazoxanide being the most active agents tested. tizoxanide  was less effective than nitazoxanide except against the b. fragilis group, against which its activity was similar to that of nitazoxanide. under aerobic conditions, nitazoxanide demonstrated poor activity against members of the family enterobacteriacae and pseudomonas, staphylococcus, and enterococcus species. the  same results were obtained when culture was performed under anaerobic conditions  with the notable exception of the results against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of nitazoxanide were in the range of 2 to 4 mg/liter for 34 clinical isolates of  s. aureus, 12 of which were methicillin resistant, while tizoxanide was not effective.

TI  == preventable disease in correctional facilities. desmoteric foodborne outbreaks in the united states, 1974-1991.
AB  == background: various disease outbreaks have been reported among prisoners. recent  foodborne outbreaks in correctional facilities in georgia and delaware prompted us to review the epidemiological characteristics of such outbreaks reported in the united states. methods: foodborne outbreaks reported to the centers for disease control and prevention as part of routine surveillance from 1974 to 1991  were examined to identify outbreaks in jails, prisons, correctional facilities, and juvenile detention centers. outbreak sizes, temporal trends, food vehicles, pathogens, and hygienic transgressions were analyzed. results: eighty-eight desmoteric foodborne outbreaks involving 14307 cases of illness were reported from 31 states and territories. the mean outbreak size was 163 cases, compared with a mean of 31 cases for the 9107 reported outbreaks not involving prisoners.  no fatalities among prisoners were reported. no pathogen was identified in 47 (53%) of the 88 outbreaks salmonella species accounted for 15 (37%) of 41 outbreaks of known cause from 1974 to 1991, clostridium perfringens for 14 (34%), and staphylococcus aureus for 9 (22%). fourteen of 15 salmonella outbreaks occurred from 1984 to 1991. food vehicles were reported for 63 (72%) of the outbreaks. beef and poultry each were implicated in 9 (14%) of these, followed by fish or poultry salads and mexican food, which accounted for 6 outbreaks (10%). food-handling errors were reported for 69 (78%) of the 88 outbreaks. improper food storage was reported in 62 (90%) of these. conclusions: foodborne outbreaks  are reported regularly from correctional facilities in the united states. outbreaks caused by salmonella species, a special threat to prisoners with human  immunodeficiency virus infection, seem to be increasing. food production in correctional facilities should meet minimum safety standards, including sufficient refrigeration facilities, training of food handlers, and exemption of  ill food handlers from work.

TI  == transmembrane glutamic acid residues play essential roles in the metal-tetracycline/h+ antiporter of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == three transmembrane aspartyl residues play essential roles in the transposon tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/h+ antiporter (tet(b)) [yamaguchi, a. et al. (1992) j. biol. chem. 267, 7490-7498]. the tetk gene-encoding tetracycline resistance protein (tet(k)) of staphylococcus aureus mediates metal-tetracycline/h+ antiport similarly to tet(b); however, it has no transmembrane aspartyl residue. on the other hand, tet(k) has three glutamyl residues, glu-30, glu-152 and glu-397, in the putative transmembrane regions. in  the present work, tet(k) gene was expressed in escherichia coli and the transport activity was measured in everted membrane vesicles. when these glutamyl residues  were replaced with gln, the tetracycline transport activity was almost completely lost, indicating the important roles of these residues in tet(k). in the case of  glu-397, even the charge-conserved mutation to asp caused complete loss of the activity. on the other hand, the mutation of glu-30 and glu-152 to asp resulted in significant retention of transport activity. these results are similar to those on the mutation of the three transmembrane aspartyl residues in tet(b), indicating that the transmembrane glutamyl residues in tet(k) play roles similar  to those of the transmembrane aspartyl residues in tet(b).

TI  == detection of bacteria in equine synovial fluid by use of the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == equine synovial fluid aliquots were inoculated with salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, actinobacillus equuli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus zooepidemicus to obtain approximate concentrations of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 colony forming u/ml. synovial fluid aliquots were also inoculated with an unquantitated  inoculum of bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens. inoculated synovial fluid was incubated in trypticase-soy broth or columbia broth for approximately 12 hours. then aliquots were removed for dna extraction and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis for detection of a 531 base-pair segment of bacterial dna corresponding to a region of the 16s ribosomal gene. duplicate samples of inoculated synovial fluid were prepared for microbial culture. bacteria were detected in all samples inoculated with bacteria but not in control synovial fluid samples. under experimental conditions there was no difference between microbial culture and pcr analyses for detection of bacteria. experimentally, pcr was able to detect bacteria in synovial fluid within 24 hours of inoculation.

TI  == in vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam gv104326.
AB  == gv104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). the in vitro activity of gv104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. gv104326  had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. the trinem had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. gv104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of gv104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. enterococci and lancefield group a and b streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to gv104326 than they were to amoxicillin. streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to gv104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to gv104326 (mic90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). the anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.

TI  == new drugs--reports of new drugs recently approved by the fda. dirithromycin.
AB  == dirithromycin is a semisynthetic derivative of erythromycin, a 14-membered ring macrolide antibiotic. the drug is converted during absorption and distribution, to an active metabolite 9-(s)-erythromycylamine, which is the predominant compound found in plasma and extravascular tissues. high tissue concentration of  erythromycylamine is achieved after oral doses of dirithromycin, with slow release back into the circulation. the mechanism of action of dirithromycin is like that of erythromycin and other macrolides. these compounds inhibit rna-dependent protein synthesis. it has recently been suggested that all macrolides stimulate dissociation of peptidyl-trna from ribosomes during the elongation phase, leading to inhibited protein synthesis. the antimicrobial spectrum of dirithromycin is similar to that of erythromycin, although the drug offers no significant advantage with regard to mic values. in vitro against gram-positive isolates, dirithromycin exhibits similar potency to that of clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, and clindamycin. in vivo, dirithromycin is active against penicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae. dirithromycin is as effective as penicillin vk against streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsilitis, and  as effective as erythromycin against acute superimposed chronic bronchitis and skin and soft-tissue infections. in comparison with other newer macrolides, dirithromycin has shown similar or lesser in vitro activity. in particular, haemophilus influenzae, bacteroides spp., peptococcus-peptostreprococcus spp., clostridium perfringens, legionella spp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, and chlamydia trachomatis were all less sensitive to dirithromycin than azithromycin or clarithromycin. once-daily oral administration of dirithromycin (500 mg) has been demonstrated to be similar in efficacy to erythromycin (250 mg, 4 times daily), each for approximately 7 days, in the treatment of acute bronchitis or acute-exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in controlled studies. proven or presumed pathogen eradication rates were 83 and 86% for acute bronchitis patients treated with dirithromycin and erythromycin, respectively. corresponding bacteriological response rates in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were  75 to 84% with dirithromycin and 75 to 82% with erythromycin. both agents achieved clinical cure or improvement in over 85% of the patients with either condition. the main advantage of dirithromycin over erythromycin appears to be once-daily administration. lilly launched dirithromycin in september 1993, in spain, received approval from fda in august 1995, and launched it during october  1995.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == probes and polymerase chain reaction for detection of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  == dna-hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) are techniques commonly used to detect pathogenic bacteria. in this paper, the use of these techniques for detection of salmonella, e. coli, v. cholerae, non-o1 vibrio, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and c. botulinum is reviewed with emphasis on application in food microbiology. in food control, dna-techniques have most often been used in a 'culture confirmation' fashion, i.e. bacteria are  enriched and sometimes even purified by traditional culture procedures and thereafter identified by the use of dna-based methods. the most desirable approach is, however, to detect organisms directly in the food, but major problems remain to be solved before this can be routinely performed.

AB  == microbiological analyses of workers' hands were made for the common indicators, including aerobic mesophilic plate counts (apc), as well as the common food pathogens. opportunities were observed for cross-contamination of roast beef by workers' hands during slicing operations. workers' hands showed apc counts of up  to 10(7) cfu/hand and the presence of s. aureus and c. perfringens. salmonella spp were not isolated from hands. these results show that handling of these foods by such workers would be a risk in transmitting pathogenic microorganisms to the  foods and is apparent that it is necessary for these workers to take care of personal hygiene. decimal reductions obtained in the microbiological counts after washing and antisepsis of workers' hands were at 2,6 logs cycles and still demonstrated the importance of this practice in food services by the fact that pathogens such as s. aureus and c. perfringens were inhibited or killed.

AB  == we have analysed data from the surveillance scheme of general foodborne outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease in england and wales reported to, or otherwise identified by, the phls communicable disease surveillance centre in 1992 and 1993. data were available about 458 outbreaks, 197 (43%) in commercial catering premises (restaurants, cafes, hotels, public houses, and canteens), 77 (17%) associated with food prepared in private houses, and 58 (13%) in hospitals and residential institutions. salmonellas and clostridium perfringens were responsible for 340 outbreaks (74%) and no pathogen was identified in 55 outbreaks (12%). organisms associated with the highest mean attack rates were staphylococcus aureus (66%) and c. perfringens (53%). eleven thousand people were reported to be il and 362 were admitted to hospital. there were 15 deaths, 13 of  which were associated with salmonellosis. a specified food was suspected to be the vehicle of infection in 204 outbreaks (45%). possible contributory factors were identified in 277 (61%), most commonly inappropriate storage, cross contamination, and inadequate heat treatment. reducing the incidence of food poisoning will depend on concerted action on farms, in abattoirs and food processing plants, in wholesale and retail outlets, and in kitchens.

TI  == the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of surgical infections.
AB  == this study examines the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of both gram-negative and gram-positive surgical infections. a dose of 2 g of cefotaxime will sustain peripheral compartment concentrations of 2.6, 3.9, 1.6, and 0.7 micrograms/ml for 6, 8, 10 and 12 h, respectively. therefore, the proportion of pathogens with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) below the peripheral compartment cefotaxime concentrations was assessed as a measure of therapeutic potential. it  was observed that bacterial elimination in infections correlates well with such pharmacodynamic predictions. therefore, treatment recommendations for surgical infections are based on the following pharmacodynamics. the times above the mic in the tissue compartment for various pathogens (1988-1994) known to cause surgical infections were: escherichia coli, 12 h; all pyogenic streptococci, 12 h; pneumococci, 12 h; haemophilus spp., 12 h; proteus mirabilis, 12 h; klebsiella spp., 10.9 h; viridans streptococci, 10.6 h; oxacillin-susceptible, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.7 h; providencia spp., 9.2 h; clostridium perfringens, 8.6 h; peptostreptococcus spp., 8 h; oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 7.3 h; and all s. aureus, 6.8 h. from the examination of pharmacodynamic parameters, cefotaxime appears to be a viable choice for the therapy of surgical infections other than the gram-negative anaerobes. for those  infections, metronidazole with cefotaxime would be preferred.

TI  == isolation, and virulence profiles, of aeromonas hydrophila implicated in an outbreak of food poisoning in sweden.
AB  == a case of food poisoning outbreak involving aeromonas hydrophila is reported in this study. a group of 27 people consumed a typical swedish food "landgang" which is a type of smorgasbord containing shrimps with mayonnaise, liver pate, ham, sausage, and legume salad which was purchased from a food store. twenty-two of the 27 persons became ill within 20-34 hr of consumption of the food and reported the symptoms ranging from severe acute diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, fever  and vomiting. one person also fainted. the symptoms lasted for a couple of days.  of the remaining 5 healthy persons who consumed the left-over food the next day,  2 became ill with similar symptoms. the bacteriological examination of left-over  food samples resulted in the isolation of a. hydrophila from shrimps with mayonnaise, smoked sausage, liver pate and boiled ham. the total number of a. hydrophila in these foods were log 10(6) to log > 10(7) organisms per gram of food sample. a. hydrophila was however, not isolated from legume/mayonnaise salad samples. all the food samples tested showed low numbers of other expected food contaminating organisms such as coliforms at 37 c and 44 c, fecal streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, fungi and yeast etc., while bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and salmonella spp. were not detected in the food samples. investigations of the virulence profiles of the a. hydrophila isolates showed their capacity to produce beta-hemolysin, cytotoxins, cytotonic toxins, enterotoxins, and adhesion to and invasion of human intestinal (henle 407) cells  in culture.

TI  == growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

(2) to analyze the role of computed tomography (ct) in myositis associated with bacterial infection. methods: review of cases treated by the authors with literature review. results: two patients had classical pyomyositis with staphylococcus aureus as the etiologic agent. one patient had pyomyositis with enterobacter cloacae (the first reported to our knowledge), 2 had myositis/fasciitis (one due to clostridium perfringens and one due to s. aureus), and one had fatal toxic rhabdomyolysis in association with c. perfringens bacteremia without evidence of gas gangrene. no patient had a completely normal ct scan of affected muscles, but ct scans in 3 patients failed to show abscesses  that were subsequently discovered at surgery, while in another patient ct scanning falsely suggested a large abscess that was not present at surgery. conclusion: infection associated muscle involvement represents a spectrum of clinical manifestations that include pyomyositis, myonecrosis, fasciitis/myositis, and toxic rhabdomyolysis. diagnosis may be delayed by the often mild clinical presentation. ct scanning alone may be unreliable in distinguishing muscle abscess from swollen muscle unless combined with ct guided  needle biopsy.

TI  == sudden infant death syndrome (sids): are common bacterial toxins responsible, and do they have a vaccine potential?
AB  == despite extensive research, no unifying concept has satisfactorily explained the  cause of the sudden infant death syndrome (sids). the details are briefly outlined of some of the evidence supporting the hypothesis that common bacterial  toxins are important in the aetiology of sids. these bacterial toxins act as triggers to initiate a biochemical cascade resulting in death. data from four research groups, each working independently, indicated that the bacteria clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus spp. and enterococcus spp. were present in higher numbers in infants who had suffered sids than in control infants. certainly more detailed studies need to be performed on the role of bacterial infections in infants. there are many implications arising from this work, particularly the use of vaccination as a means of reducing infections, and consequently the number of sids deaths.

TI  == immunization and immunotherapy for mastitis.
AB  == immunization and immunotherapy for mastitis are active areas of investigation. the past decade has seen development of effective and economical r-mutant vaccines for gram-negative mastitis. these vaccines doubtless will prove beneficial on well managed dairies that have eradicated contagious mastitis pathogens. development of vaccines for other mastitis pathogens has been noticeably slower. a commercially available staphylococcus aureus vaccine appears to reduce the frequency and severity of clinical episodes, but probably has minimal impact on the incidence or prevalence of infection. this product has not  been extensively studied. the recent recognition of virulence factors produced in vivo by staphylococcus aureus may provide a breakthrough in the development and production of staphylococcus aureus vaccines. bacterins employing this principle  presently are not commercially available, however. in the case of all contagious  mastitis pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, and mycoplasma spp.), traditional control and eradication efforts (teat dip, dry cow  therapy, culling programs) likely will prove preferable to long-term immunization. ongoing research may provide more efficacious vaccines for these mastitis syndromes. immunostimulants are an active area of research. although leukopoietic factors appear promising as immunostimulants, no compound has clearly demonstrated efficacy in either the prevention or treatment of bovine mastitis.

TI  == molecular genetic analysis of beta-toxin of clostridium perfringens reveals sequence homology with alpha-toxin, gamma-toxin, and leukocidin of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == oligonucleotide probes designed on the basis of the n-terminal sequence of clostridium perfringens beta-toxin were used to isolate the encoding gene (cpb).  the nucleotide sequence of cpb was determined, and on the basis of dna hybridization experiments it was shown that the gene is found only in type b and  c strains of c. perfringens. the deduced amino acid sequence of the beta-toxin revealed homology with the alpha-toxin, gamma-toxin, and leukocidin of staphylococcus aureus. the beta-toxin purified from c. perfringens appeared to exist in monomeric and multimeric forms. recombinant beta-toxin, produced in escherichia coli, appeared to be mainly in the multimeric form.

TI  == detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  == forty bacteriocin-producing (bac+) lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. of the 40 bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). by direct plating, bac+ lab were detected at levels up to 2.4 x  10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. the bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, sds-page protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; sds-page proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique bac+ isolates. bac+ lab included enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus curvatus, lb. delbrueckii, lb. plantarum, lactococcus lactis, and pediococcus acidilactici. lb. curvatus (four strains) and lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus. some lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine gram-positive genera. lb. curvatus fs47 and fs65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees c; however, lc. lactis fs56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. the high incidence of bac+ lab detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of bac+ lab that occur as natural contaminants. these data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == effect of phospholipase treatment on insulin receptor signal transduction.
AB  == to study the role of membrane lipids in signal transduction by the insulin receptor, we have studied the effect of phospholipase c (clostridium perfringens) and a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase (staphylococcus aureus) on insulin binding, a function of the alpha-subunit, and tyrosine kinase activity, a function of the beta-subunit in im-9 lymphocytes and nih 3t3 fibroblasts transfected with the human insulin receptor. treatment of the cells with phospholipase c at concentrations up to 3.4 u/ml did not affect specific insulin  binding, but reduced insulin-stimulated receptor phosphorylation by 50%. this effect of phospholipase c was observed within 10 min of treatment and occurred with no change in the basal level of phosphorylation. pre-treatment of cells with insulin for 5 min prior to enzyme addition prevented any change in kinase activity. insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of pp 185, the presumed endogenous substrate for the insulin receptor kinase, was also reduced following phospholipase c treatment, with an almost complete loss of insulin stimulation after exposure of cells to enzyme at concentrations as low as 0.6 u/ml. in contrast to these effects of phospholipase c on intact cells, receptor autophosphorylation was not affected in insulin receptors purified on wheat germ  agglutinin-agarose from phospholipase c treated cells. likewise, the phospholipase c effect was reduced by the addition of phosphatidylcholine, but not by the addition of the protease inhibitors, aprotinin and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, to the incubation indicating its dependence on phospholipid hydrolysis. treatment of cells with the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c did not affect any of the parameters studied.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == relationship between the clostridium perfringens catq gene product and chloramphenicol acetyltransferases from other bacteria.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the clostridium perfringens chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat)-encoding resistance determinant, catq, was determined. an open reading frame encoding a protein of 219 amino acids with a molecular weight  of 26,014 was identified. although catq was expressed constitutively, sequences similar in structure to those found upstream of inducible cat genes were observed. the catq gene was distinct from the c. perfringens catp determinant. the deduced catq monomer had considerable amino acid sequence conservation compared with catp (53% similarity) and other known cat proteins (39 to 53%). phylogenetic analysis revealed that the catq monomer was as closely related to cat proteins from staphylococcus aureus and campylobacter coli as it was to cat monomers from the clostridia.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of e-4497, a new 3-amine-3-methyl-azetidinyl tricyclic fluoroquinolone.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new tricyclic fluoroquinolone, e-4497 [s(-)-9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(3-amine-3-methyl-azetidin-1-yl)-7-oxo- 2,3-dihydro- 7h-pyrido-(1,2,3-de)-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid], were evaluated in comparison with those of dr-3355 [s-(-)-ofloxacin], norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. e-4497 was more potent than norfloxacin and as potent as or more potent than dr-3355 and ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus  spp., and enterococcus faecalis. with the exception of providencia spp., e-4497 inhibited 90% of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. against enteric bacteria, e-4497 was similar in potency to norfloxacin but less potent than dr-3355 and ciprofloxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics of e-4497, dr-3355, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin for 90% of strains were 2, 2, 4, and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. against clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis, e-4497 (mics for 90% of strains, 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively) was two- to fourfold more active than norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. e-4497 activity decreased moderately in the presence of 10 mm  mg2+. urine at ph 5.5 caused a significant decrease in activity compared with urine at ph 7.2. however, the presence of serum either had no effect or increased the activity of e-4497. in general, e-4497 was bactericidal at the mic. in systemic infections with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice, the protective effect of e-4497 was generally greater than that of norfloxacin and comparable to those of  dr-3355 and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == hospital green salads and the effects of washing them.
AB  == each week from april 1989 to february 1990, a plate of green salad prepared in the hospital kitchen was examined microbiologically. of the 256 plates examined,  51% had total viable counts (tvcs) of greater than or equal to 10(5) colony forming units (cfu) g-1. staphylococcus aureus was present in 13 samples and escherichia coli in one sample. no listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens or salmonella spp. were isolated. the effect of washing mustard and cress, cucumber and the different layers of lettuce leaves was examined. washing  the salad by agitating it under running tap water in a colander for 2 min reduced the total bacterial counts by 10-fold. the inner leaves of a lettuce had tvcs less than 10(4)cfu g-1, at least 10-100-fold less than the outer leaves. cucumber after washing had similar tvcs as after peeling. five of six samples of mustard and cress had tvcs of at least 10(6)cfu g-1 before washing. as a consequence, mustard and cress was no longer used in our salads.

TI  == bacteriological studies of the venom and mouth cavities of wild malayan pit vipers (calloselasma rhodostoma) in southern thailand.
AB  == venom and oropharyngeal swabs from freshly captured malayan pit vipers (calloselasma rhodostoma) in southern thailand and captive specimens in england were cultured aerobically and anaerobically to identify the bacterial flora which might contaminate wounds inflicted by bites of this species. the snakes' mouths contained a wider range of organisms than their venoms, especially gut-related gram-negative rods such as enterobacter and pseudomonas species and some staphylococci and clostridia. there were fewer positive cultures from captive snakes. c. rhodostoma venom inhibited the growth of group a streptococci and, to  a lesser extent, that of staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens but not that of 2 gram-negative organisms. secondary bacterial infection is an important complication of snake bite, especially of necrotic wounds. a combination of gentamicin with benzyl penicillin would have prevented infection with, or treated, most of the bacteria isolated from snake venoms and mouths in thailand.

AB  == the in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 against 229 aerobic and 330 anaerobic clinical isolates was determined using the agar dilution technique. for comparison, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and metronidazole (only anaerobic bacteria) were tested. bay v 3522 was found to have high activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic cocci, propionibacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens and fusobacteria. when tested against a higher inoculum or using the  broth dilution technique, the activity of bay v 3522 showed little dependence on  inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to inhibitory activity in most bacterial groups. bay v 3522 may be useful in the treatment of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections. clinical studies are thus warranted.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin bay  v 3522.
AB  == the activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to mics of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. it was more active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. groups b, c and g streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the mi"90 for streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for enterococci and listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most bacteroides spp. were resistant. the mic90 for beta-lactamase positive escherichia coli (producing primarily tem-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. the mic90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus  mirabilis, providencia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. bay v 3522 was destroyed by tem-1, shv-1, tem-3 and p99 beta-lactamases.

TI  == the role of escherichia coli haemolysin in the pathogenic synergy of colonic bacteria in subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  == the growth of nine species of colonic bacteria--escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium, clostridium perfringens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus and bifidobacterium adolescentis--was examined after concomitant injection to form experimental subcutaneous abscesses in mice. injection of a mixture of c. 10(5) cfu of each of the first five strains (e. coli, ent. faecalis, b. ovatis, f. varium and c. perfringens) resulted in abscess formation in all mice tested when  the e. coli strain was haemolytic. e. coli and b. ovatus multiplied and reached a maximum population of c. 10(8) cfu/abscess. when non-haemolytic e. coli was used, injection of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu was required for abscess formation. the inclusion of partially purified e. coli haemolysin (125 hu50) with c. 10(5) cfu of bacteria including non-haemolytic e. coli resulted in abscess formation in most mice tested. these results indicate that e. coli haemolysin is  one factor that may potentiate pathogenic synergy among colonic bacteria especially between e. coli and b. ovatus, during abscess formation.

TI  == occlusive dressings. does dressing type influence the growth of common bacterial  pathogens?
AB  == we studied the effect of different occlusive dressings and of air exposure on the growth of four pathogenic bacteria in wounds. partial-thickness wounds on domestic pigs were inoculated with staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. each wound was covered with three dressings (duoderm, opsite, or vigilon), or left exposed to air. groups of wounds were sampled at 24, 48, and 72 hours. staphylococcus aureus reached high levels beneath all of the dressings and in the air-exposed wounds. the numbers of c perfringens and b fragilis were greatly reduced in the air-exposed wounds and slightly reduced in the opsite-covered wounds. the numbers of p aeruginosa were greatest in the opsite- and vigilon-covered wounds. the results indicate that occlusive dressings are not indicated in wounds that clinically appear to be grossly contaminated or that may contain anaerobic organisms.

TI  == a54145 a new lipopeptide antibiotic complex: microbiological evaluation.
AB  == a54145 complex is made up of eight factors; a, a1, b, b1, c, d, e, and f which were active in vitro (mic 0.25 approximately greater than 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive aerobic organisms. the complex, factor b and b1 were found  to be active against two strains of clostridium perfringens. a calcium dependence study on some of the factors showed that their in vitro antibacterial activity was greatly enhanced by the presence of calcium (50 mg/liter) in the media. resistance build-up was seen when staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp. were passed seven times in the presence of sublethal concentrations of a54145 antibiotics. this resistance disappeared immediately when the resistant organisms were passed in the absence of the antibiotics. factor a was very effective against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes infections in mice (sc ed50s of 3.3 approximately 2.4 mg/kg x 2, respectively). factor b was more active against s. pyogenes in vivo (sc ed50, 0.9 mg/kg x 2). acute mouse toxicities were determined with these antibiotics. semisynthetic derivatives were evaluated.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activity of clarithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, and regression curve].
AB  == this study was set up to establish the regression curve for clarithromycin inhibition zone diameters (disks 15 micrograms) and mic to create a strain distribution plot, in order to allow accurate interpretation of the disk diffusion method for testing susceptibility to clarithromycin. 430 bacterial strains were studied in three university hospital. clarithromycin was active against erythromycin sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci at concentrations of 0.12 to 0.25 microgram/ml (mode 0.25). erythromycin resistant strains were also resistant to clarithromycin. enterococci could be divided into two populations, one resistant (mic greater than 128 micrograms/ml) and the other with mic of 0.06 to 2 (mode 0.25). this was also the case for streptococci and pneumococci with mic lower for susceptible strains (mode 0.03 to 0.06). clarithromycin was active on haemophilus at concentrations of 4 to 64 micrograms/ml (mode 16); mics for beta-lactamase producing strains were comparable to those of strains not producing. mics for neisseria were 0.12 to 16 and for b. catarrhalis 0.016 to 0.5. mic were 0.5 and 1 (mode 1) for clostridium perfringens; bacteroides fragilis strains were inhibited by 0.12 to 8 micrograms/ml (mode 0.5-1). so, antibacterial activity of c was similar to that of e; it was sometimes slightly superior, particularly on gram positive cocci. for mic breakpoints of 1 and 4 micrograms/ml, zone size breakpoints should be 23  and 17 mm and for 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, 20 and 15 mm.

TI  == analytical methods for bacillus cereus and other bacillus species.
AB  == bacillus cereus can give rise to two distinct forms of foodborne disease, the emetic and the diarrhoeal syndromes. the emetic syndrome is believed to be associated with an emetic toxin pre-formed in food. cooked rice is the most common vehicle, and the symptoms are similar to those of staphylococcus aureus intoxication. the diarrhoeal type is caused by an enterotoxin and the symptoms generally parallel those of the clostridium perfringens food poisoning. the heat  resistance of b. cereus spores and the non-fastidious nature of the organism facilitates its survival and/or growth in a wide variety of foods. this review describes analytical methods available for the isolation, identification, and enumeration of the organism, in addition to details about biological and immunological methods for toxin assay. data are also presented concerning the incidence and epidemiology of b. cereus food poisoning around the world, and especially in japan.

AB  == three quite different bacterial toxins (s. aureus alpha-toxin, c. perfringens theta-toxin and e. coli haemolysin) induce the leakage of phosphorylated metabolites from lettre cells and of calcein from liposomes; in each case leakage is inhibited by zn2+ greater than ca2+ greater than mg2+. inhibition is not due to displacement of toxin from the membrane, since divalent cations inhibit leakage through pre-formed pores. electrical conductivity across phospholipid bilayers is induced by each of the three toxins; in each case the probability of  channels being in the open state is reduced by divalent cations. although the pores induced in phospholipid bilayers and liposomes vary greatly in size (theta-toxin much greater than haemolysin greater than alpha-toxin), in lettre cells the lesions appear more uniform, suggestive of a limiting effect in cells.

TI  == [infectious diarrhea in the adult].
AB  == infectious diarrhoeas are usually divided into two types; toxinogenic and invasive. invasive diarrhoeas are copious and responsible for dehydration which is the principal clinical sign; mucosal lesions and bacteraemia are absent. the most typical of toxinogenic diarrhoeas is cholera, but enterotoxicogenic e. coli  and aeromonas infections have similar clinical features. in invasive diarrhoeas the responsible microorganisms penetrate into the epithelial cells of the intestine, producing fever and stools that contain blood and mucus. however, some organisms causing invasive diarrhoeas secrete cytotoxins; they include shigella spp., salmonella spp, some strains of e. coli, campylobacter jejuni and yersinia  spp. when diarrhoea occurs in patients under antibiotics pseudomembranous colitis due to the proliferation of clostridium difficile must be suspected; the diagnosis is suggested by endoscopy and confirmed by bacteriology. toxic and infectious diarrhoeas due to food are increasingly frequent; they are usually caused by salmonella spp., but sometimes by clostridium perfringens or staphylococcus aureus. in patients with suspected infectious diarrhoea symptomatic treatment combined or not with intestinal antibacterial agents is immediately initiated in most cases; stool cultures are reserved to severe or protracted diarrhoeas. specimens must be collected under the best conditions and  rapidly sent to the laboratory.

AB  == the thermal inactivation of salmonella thompson, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, candida zeylanoides, enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis was accelerated by the addition of sodium isoascorbate (1 mmol/l) to phosphate-buffer heating medium but not to complex food mixtures. the lethal effect of isoascorbate was nullified by heating under anaerobic conditions or by  the addition of catalase. the scavengers of hydroxyl radicals, mannitol and formate were not protective whereas histidine was. histidine may have protected by slowing the rate of isoascorbate autoxidation, a property common to other amino acids tested. superoxide dismutase was not protective. dehydroascorbic acid also enhanced heat killing and its action was also reversed by catalase. the bactericidal effects of mild heat plus isoascorbate or dehydroascorbic acid both  apparently depend on oxidative processes but their relative effectiveness was not related to their respective rates of oxygen consumption or peroxide production. we speculate that site-specific redox reactions, involving amino-carbonyl intermediates are involved in the inactivation mechanism.

(two patients), p. aeruginosa (one patient), enterobacter sp. (one patient), and serratia sp. (one patient). side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). superinfecting organisms and sites  were as follows: enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). ciprofloxacin administered either  intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of at-4140, a new broad-spectrum quinolone.
AB  == at-4140, 5-amino-1-cyclopropyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(cis-3,5- dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. its mics for 90% of the strains tested were 0.1 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against gram-positive organisms, such as members of the genera staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus, and 0.0125 to 1.56 micrograms/ml against gram-negative organisms, such as members of the family enterobacteriaceae and the genera pseudomonas, branhamella, campylobacter, haemophilus, and neisseria. its mics were 0.025 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, such as members of the genera xanthomonas, acinetobacter, alcaligenes, moraxella, flavobacterium, and brucella; 0.2 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, such as clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis; 0.0125 to 0.05 micrograms/ml against legionella spp.; 0.0125 to 0.2 micrograms/ml against mycoplasma spp.; 0.031 to 0.063 micrograms/ml against chlamydia spp.; and 0.1 to 0.3 micrograms/ml against mycobacterium spp. the potencies of at-4140 against gram-negative organisms were comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and higher than those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin. the potencies of at-4140 against gram-positive organisms, glucose nonfermenters, anaerobes, mycoplasma spp., chlamydia spp., and mycobacterium spp. were generally higher than those of the quinolones with which at-4140 was compared. at-4140 showed good oral efficacy against systemic infections with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. its efficacy was better when a daily dose was given once than when it was given in two doses. good efficacies of the orally administered drug were also observed in pulmonary, dermal, and urinary tract infection models in mice. the in vivo efficacies of at-4140 were equal to or better than those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin.

TI  == foodborne gastroenteritis due to norwalk virus in a winnipeg hotel.
AB  == within 1 week four separate incidents of gastroenteritis presumed to be foodborne were reported by guests of a winnipeg hotel. investigation revealed poor food-handling practices and illness among the kitchen staff. elevated bacterial counts and escherichia coli were found in 15 of 24 samples of food tested, and staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 2 pastry samples. culture of 14 stool samples for bacteria yielded clostridium perfringens in 1 sample from a staff member and coagulase-positive s. aureus in 2 samples from staff members and 3 from guests. all of the s. aureus isolates were nonenterotoxigenic and had three  different phage patterns. electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy revealed the prototype norwalk virus in five (56%) of nine stool samples; four samples were from guests, and one was from a kitchen employee. the employee had had diarrhea 24 hours before the first outbreak and was thus believed to be the source of the virus infection, possibly through food handling. this is the first  report of norwalk virus isolation and the first of foodborne norwalk virus transmission in canada. a review of foodborne norwalk virus infections is presented.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

TI  == high resolution deuterium nmr studies of bacterial metabolism.
AB  == high resolution deuterium nmr spectra were obtained from suspensions of five bacterial strains: escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus. deuterium-labeled d-glucose at c-1, c-2, and c-6 was used to monitor dynamically anaerobic metabolism. the flux of glucose through the various bacterial metabolic pathways  could be determined by following the disappearance of glucose and the appearance  of the major end products in the 2h nmr spectrum. the presence of both labeled and unlabeled metabolites could be detected using 1h nmr spectroscopy since the proton resonances in the labeled species are shifted upfield due to an isotopic chemical shift effect. the 1h-1h scalar coupling observed in both the 2h and 1h nmr spectra was used to assign definitively the resonances of labeled species. an increase in the intensity of natural abundance deuterium signal of water can be used to monitor pathways in which a deuteron is lost from the labeled metabolite. the steps in which label loss can occur are outlined, and the influence these processes have on the ability of 2h nmr spectroscopy to monitor metabolism are assessed.

TI  == ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole.
AB  == ciprofloxacin has a reduced activity against anaerobic pathogens. therefore, a combination of ciprofloxacin with an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, such as metronidazole, seems to be interesting for the treatment of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections. high metronidazole concentrations (10 mg/l or 40 mg/l) neither affected the bactericidal efficacy of ciprofloxacin on aerobic pathogens, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, nor on the anaerobic pathogens clostridium  perfringens and clostridium difficile, as demonstrated by kill-kinetic curves. the same high concentrations, as well as lower therapeutically achievable concentration (2 mg/l or 5 mg/l) of metronidazole in combination with ciprofloxacin were slightly more potent for the tested clostridia than ciprofloxacin or metronidazole alone.

TI  == release of proteins from the surface of bovine central nervous system myelin by salts and phospholipases.
AB  == incubation of bovine cns myelin with phospholipase c from bacillus cereus under conditions that lead to extensive phospholipid degradation caused 10% of the myelin protein to be released from the membrane. the myelin basic protein (mbp) was a major component of the dissolved protein. comparable incubations with phospholipase c from clostridium perfringens, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c from staphylococcus aureus, or cabbage phospholipase d removed little mbp. however, concentrations of sodium chloride near 1 m and concentrations of divalent metal ions between 50 and 600 mm released typically 9-12% of the total myelin protein, with mbp again as the predominant component. repetitive washing with calcium chloride solutions resulted in dissolution of over 90% of the mbp. when myelin was incubated in 1.0 m sodium chloride or 25 mm  calcium chloride, the mbp was cleaved largely into two major peptides with apparent molecular weights near 14,000 and 12,000, but with 200 mm or higher concentrations of calcium chloride most of this protein remained intact. with appropriate manipulation of the ionic milieu, it is thus possible to remove most  of this extrinsic protein from the myelin surface under relatively mild conditions. the conditions that release the protein suggest that it is held at the membrane surface by ionic interactions.

AB  == prolonged oral or parenteral administration of antibiotics has led to the development of resistant strains of microorganisms. bacteria acquire drug resistance by mutation, conjugation and transduction. oral antibiotics by a process of selection pressure facilitate the proliferation of resistant population of bacteria. drug resistant bacteria are capable of transferring their resistance to drugs to other bacteria by the process of transferable drug resistance (tdr). this can lead to multiple resistance to a vast number of therapeutically useful antibiotics which will, therefore, become ineffective for  treatment. tdr can occur between pathogenic organism, between organism of different species, such as e. coli, salmonella and shigella; and also between pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms. faecal contamination of meat during slaughter may result in the transfer of antibiotic resistant e. coli to the meat. in the human gut this e. coli could transfer resistance to other gut flora, namely e. coli or salmonella. antibiotic-resistant coliforms have been isolated from carcases, fresh and cooked meat, raw meat handlers and livestock handlers. handling of raw market meat by buyers in nigeria could also lead to contamination of meat with resistant microorganisms. veterinary drugs are sold and used without much control in nigeria. this practice may have created a population of resistant bacteria in the meat animals. the presence of antibiotic residues in meat, milk and their products pose potential health hazards for man. allergic skin conditions, nausea, vomiting, anaphylactic shock and even death have resulted from the ingestion of residues. cooking and freezing have minimal effect on residues. resistance to antibiotics have been detected in food poisoning bacteria, namely salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens. some epidemiological link has been established between s. typhimurium of calves and food poisoning in man. judicious use of antibiotics, public education on the health risks of the promiscuous use of drugs in livestock production; and hygienic slaughter at the slaughter houses, will help to reduce bacterial drug resistance in man and animals.

TI  == potent antagonism of escherichia coli, bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium,  and enterococcus faecalis, alone or in combination, for enteropathogens in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  == interactions between representative strains of four predominant resident bacteria of the human colon, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus,  and fusobacterium varium, and strains of seven enteropathogens, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, vibrio parahaemolyticus, v. cholerae serogroup non o1, staphylococcus aureus, and clostridium perfringens, were examined in studies with an anaerobic continuous flow culture system and medium resembling the content of the mouse caecum (mcm).  potent unilateral antagonism attributable to synergic activities of the resident  bacteria against the enteropathogens was evident. the four resident bacteria persisted at levels of c. 10(6) cfu/ml or more in single and in any mixed cultures of the resident species. the seven enteropathogens also persisted in single cultures. in contrast, y. enterocolitica was excluded in several days in mixed cultures with each of the four resident bacteria. sh. flexneri and staph. aureus were excluded in the presence of e. coli alone. c. perfringens, v. parahaemolyticus and v. cholerae serogroup non o1 were excluded in the presence of e. coli with b. ovatus and, in some cases, with additional species. s. typhimurium was the most resistant; only c. 10(2)-fold reduction of the population level was observed in mixed culture with all four of the resident species. when the amounts of some components in the medium, such as peptone and yeast extract, were increased, c. perfringens grew and persisted even in the presence of the four resident bacteria. sh. flexneri, in contrast decreased steadily, even in enriched media.

TI  == an evaluation of various working practices in shops selling raw and cooked meats.
AB  == three groups of premises (butchers' shops, supermarkets and general dealers) which sell raw and cooked meats were compared. salmonellas were not detected, but escherichia coli, and to a lesser degree staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus  faecalis, were widely distributed in all three groups of premises. contamination  of hands, towels and nail brushes was related to poor working practices. the presence of e. coli or str. faecalis on slicing machines was associated with contamination of meat samples. a number of wiping cloths were heavily contaminated with e. coli, and many also contained clostridium perfringens. fewer premises provided written cleaning plans, and in many cases staff did not receive an adequate training in food hygiene. the use of disinfectants as part of the cleaning process did not necessarily reduce the level of bacterial contamination. in general there was poor correlation between microbiological results and a visual inspection made by an environmental health officer. the possible reasons for this finding are discussed.

TI  == lethal effect of butylated hydroxyanisole as related to bacterial fatty acid composition.
AB  == bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas fragi, escherichia coli, and salmonella "anatum" were challenged with butylated hydroxyanisole (bha). susceptibility was measured as the concentration of bha required to cause a 90% reduction in bacterial survivors. staphylococcus aureus lp and p. fragi were two of the most resistant species examined; c. perfringens and p. fluorescens were the most susceptible. gram stain reaction was found not to be a strict indicator of bacterial susceptibility to bha. there was no obvious relationship between individual fatty acids and susceptibility. the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in the total lipid fraction of only the gram-positive species was related to susceptibility. the ratios of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids of other fractions were not related to susceptibility.

TI  == in vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  == flurithromycin is an (8,s)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of streptomyces erythraeus atcc 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. the range of mic for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group a is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline ph. among anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, other species of bacteroides and peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. flurithromycin also showed some  activity on mycobacterium bovis, m. scrofulaceum and m. phley. the determination  of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 x mic. a combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. the possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. at concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.

TI  == bacteremia and fungemia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
AB  == forty-nine episodes of bacteremia and fungemia occurred in 38 of 336 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome seen at our institution since 1980. there were five types of infections. infections commonly associated with a t-cell immunodeficiency disorder comprised 16 episodes and included those with salmonella species, listeria monocytogenes, cryptococcus neoformans, and histoplasma capsulatum. infections commonly associated with a b-cell immunodeficiency disorder included those with streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. infections occurring with neutropenia were caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis. other infections occurring in the hospital were caused by candida albicans, staphylococcus epidermidis, enteric gram-negative rods, staphylococcus aureus, and mixed s. aureus and group g streptococcus. other infections occurring out of  the hospital included those with s. aureus, clostridium perfringens, shigella sonnei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group b streptococcus. because two thirds of  the septicemias were caused by organisms other than t-cell opportunists, these pathogens should be anticipated during diagnostic evaluation and when formulating empiric therapy.

TI  == characterization of a parasporal inclusion body from sporulating, enterotoxin-positive clostridium perfringens type a.
AB  == inclusion bodies (ib) synthesized during sporulation and enterotoxin formation by clostridium perfringens nctc 8239 and 8798 were isolated and characterized. ib were isolated by disruption of sporangia by sonication in the presence of tetrasodium edta and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. fractionation was carried out in a linear gradient of sodium bromide, sucrose, or diatrizoate sodium. denaturing and reducing agents were necessary to solubilize the ib. an alkylating agent was required to prevent reaggregation of the subunits. molecular weight, compositional, and serological analyses and peptide mapping revealed strong similarities between the ib subunits and the enterotoxin synthesized during sporulation by c. perfringens. ib appear to represent the structural component where overproduced enterotoxin accumulates intracellularly. enterotoxin-like subunits in the ib appeared to be held together by noncovalent and disulfide bonds, which were generally resistant to the action of intracellular proteases of c. perfringens, trypsin, or trypsin plus bile salts.

TI  == evolution and epidemiology of mls resistance.
AB  == within the framework of this symposium, it is not feasible to present an exhaustive description of the present state of knowledge regarding the sensitivity and resistance of bacterial species to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins (mls). this paper is limited to a description of the evolution of  different types of resistance in the light of decisive factors described in previous papers, in order to deduce, if at all possible, trends in future strategy in therapeutics. only acquired resistance lends itself to epidemiological study, in contrast to natural resistance which is, by definition, characteristic of a species or a genus, and not liable to change. three groups will therefore be studied in turn: staphylococcus aureus, streptococci and bacteroides fragilis. there is as yet insufficient accumulated data to draw conclusions regarding the epidemiology and evolution of mlsb resistance observed  in clostridium perfringens and corynebacterium diphtheriae, or regarding the high-level resistance to erythromycin due to enzymatic inactivation recently described in escherichia coli.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  == hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of  a specific wavelength. hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. this investigation assessed the effect of light-activated hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. light-activated hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus m-g intermedius, streptococcus mutans, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus magnus, and clostridium perfringens, but did not affect escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or candida albicans. photoactivation of hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. combinations of light-activated hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular s. aureus. the ability of hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the  treatment of abscesses.

AB  == the importance of postoperative wound infection in major amputations was elucidated by recording the organisms isolated in preoperatively infected gangrene and in postoperatively infected wounds of patients undergoing lower-limb amputations for ischemia. sixty-four amputations were performed on 61 patients. the frequency of coexisting diabetes mellitus was 34%. postoperative infections occurred in nearly two-thirds of the 19 cases of infected gangrene, as compared with less than one-third of cases of noninfected gangrene. the presence of diabetes mellitus did not significantly influence the infection rate. preoperatively as well as postoperatively, the most frequently isolated bacterium was staphylococcus aureus. clostridium perfringens was cultured in four cases. postoperative wound infection following lower-limb amputation for ischemia is the main reason for reamputation, especially in patients with infected gangrene.

TI  == protective role of intestinal flora against infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice: influence of antibiotics on colonization resistance.
AB  == swiss white mice were given ampicillin, clindamycin, kanamycin, metronidazole, or streptomycin in drinking water for a period of 3 weeks. one week after the initiation of antibiotic administration, the treated mice and untreated control mice were challenged orally with approximately 10(8) viable, streptomycin-resistant (sr) pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. all five of the antibiotics decreased the resistance of the mice to intestinal colonization with  sr p. aeruginosa, as reflected by an increased fecal carriage of the organism and an increase in population levels of sr p. aeruginosa in feces as compared with untreated controls. metronidazole was least effective in this regard. the antibiotics lowered the dose of sr p. aeruginosa that resulted in implantation in 50% of the mice id50 to various degrees. administration of streptomycin, the most effective antibiotic, caused a 10,000-fold decrease in id50 as compared with untreated controls. oral inoculation of approximately 10(8) organisms of sr p. aeruginosa resulted in translocation of the organism to the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleens, or livers of 13 or 17 streptomycin-treated mice, 1 of 20 clindamycin-treated mice, and 1 of 14 metronidazole-treated mice. translocation was not observed, however, in ampicillin- or kanamycin-treated animals. antibiotic activity was detected in the cecal contents of streptomycin-, kanamycin, and clindamycin-treated mice but not in the cecal contents of ampicillin- or metronidazole-treated animals.

TI  == comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  == it is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. although the effect of most of these  toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. the resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. the biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase,  leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of camp. stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. the duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. the heat-labile toxins of v. cholerae, e. coli, salmonella spp., a. hydrophila and y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. similarly the heat-stable toxins of e. coli and y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. classified along with the enterotoxin of c. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of e. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. in another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by staph. aureus until  more is known. surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological  and structural differences. evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. the structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. it is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like v. cholerae.

TI  == [recent advances in the molecular mechanism of action of bacterial toxins, in particular of diphtheria, cholera, coli, botulinum and shigella toxins as well as tetanospasmin and the toxins of staphylococcus aureus].
AB  == great progress was achieved in the clarification of the molecular structure and the mechanism of action of the toxins of pathogenic forms of bacteria. proportions of toxins of corynebacterium diphtheriae and of pseudomonas aeruginosa transfer from the nad and adp-ribose protein to an amino acid of the elongation factor 2. thus the protein synthesis is much inhibited. the cholera toxin and the l-toxin from escherichia coli have a similar structure. they transfer an adp-ribose portion from nad to the gtp-protein of the adenylate cyclase complex, by which means the gtpase activity is reduced. the increase of the camp content leads to an increase of the permeability of the cells of the intestinal epithelium. the tetanospasmin decreases the production of the inhibitingly acting neurotransmitters ( glycin ) from intermediate neurons and thus evokes spasms. the botulinum toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine from the motor end-plates and leads to paralyses. staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens form among others cytolysins which are injurious to membranes.

AB  == the effect of bran ingestion on the flora of the human digestive tract was studied using two methods: quantitative enumeration of various microbial populations of the faecal flora, and a demonstration of the antagonistic effect exerted by the faecal flora against various potentially pathogenic bacteria of the environment. since this latter study cannot be effected in human subjects, we used a model constituted by axenic mice inoculated with patients' flora. faecal samples from 3 human donors receiving bran-containing diets were obtained prior to treatment and 30 days thereafter. these faecal samples were inoculated into axenic mice fed a diet with or without bran. the dominant floras of the human donors, before and after bran ingestion, were highly similar. the faecal floras of the gnotoxenic mice resembled those of the donors and no change resulting from the presence of bran in the diet could be observed. the drastic or permissive barrier effects exerted in the gnotoxenic mice by the human donors against clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and pseudomonas  aeruginosa were not modified by the presence of bran in the diet. the large variability between animals in the barrier effect against clostridium difficile masked any possible role of the bran. study of the transit of bacillus spores in  the digestive tract of various mouse groups showed the existence of differences according to the origin of the inoculated floras, but not according to the presence or absence of bran in the diet.

TI  == the microbiology of selected retail food products with an evaluation of viable counting methods.
AB  == in an inter-laboratory survey, the pour plate, surface spread, agar droplet and spiral plate methods were used in parallel with the surface drop method for enumeration of micro-organisms in foods. good agreement was obtained between all  surface methods of enumeration, but there was poor agreement between molten agar  methods and the surface drop method. a total of 1143 samples of food that were ready for consumption at the point of retail sale were examined. eight types of food products were chosen: meat pasties, sausage rolls, real-cream slices, synthetic-cream slices, mayonnaise-based coleslaws, faggots, pates and continental sausages. the results of this survey suggest that the upper limit for an acceptable viable count should vary according to the food product. salmonellae were not isolated on any occasion. potentially harmful organisms were not isolated at levels expected to constitute a public health hazard. information concerning the nature of the product, the total viable count, the presence or absence of pathogenic, toxigenic or indicator organisms, the spectrum of the bacterial flora and the relative predominance of each organism must all be considered when assessing the microbiological acceptability of retail 'ready to eat' products.

TI  == teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  == teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and gram-positive anaerobes (propionibacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens and cl. difficile). ninety per cent of the staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for str.  faecalis. in mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. it was very effective in curing experimental mouse  septicemias caused by gram-positive bacteria (ed50 values less than 1 mg/kg).

TI  == survival of cultured cells after functional and structural disorganization of plasma membrane by bacterial haemolysins and phospholipases.
AB  == lesions were induced in the plasma membranes of cultured human fibroblasts by membrane damaging toxins of bacterial origin (haemolysins). structural disorganization of the membrane was measured as leakage of a radiolabelled small  cytoplasmic marker and functional membrane damage was measured as decreased uptake of aminoisobutyrate. cell survival was scored 24 and 48 hr later by measuring uptake of trypan blue and by light microscopical evaluation of cell morphology and proliferation. the membrane damage induced by most bacterial toxins was reversible upon removal of the toxin, since toxin-treated cells recovered and excluded trypan blue although they had been permeable to the dye immediately after the toxin treatment. among ten bacterial toxins tested, the only exception of this general behavior was the aeromonas hydrophila beta-haemolysin, which irreversibly damaged human fibroblasts. thus, the action of bacterial haemolysins on cultured cells generally seems restricted to a plasma membrane permeabilization, which is reversible regardless of the mechanism of membrane damaging action of the toxin or of the relative size of the structural lesions induced. furthermore, the use of trypan blue uptake as a measure of cell  death caused by membrane damaging agents appears to be of limited value.

TI  == allogenic modification of rat sarcoma cells in vitro by staphylococcal exotoxin.
AB  == the effect of toxin preparations from clostridium welchii and staphylococcus aureus on the growth of some experimental animal tumor cell lines was investigated. while clostridium toxin exerted considerable cytotoxicity, it did not influence either in vivo or in vitro growth of recovered cells. however, staphylotoxin treated sarcoma cells, while showing normal in vitro growth and metabolism, exhibited decreased growth rates when transplanted into susceptible hosts. this effect was demonstrable even after as many as 10 or more passages in  vitro after the toxin treatment. increased immunogenicity of staphylotoxin treated sarcoma cells was demonstrated by the complement-dependent serum cytotoxicity test. these results indicate that bacterial products, besides cytotoxicity and macrophage stimulation, may exert other effects upon tumor cells, for instance alteration of their immunogenicity and thus influence the tumor growth.

AB  == two hundred lots of 'filet americain' (a mixture of minced meat, acid sauce, condiments, salt, etc., meant to be eaten raw) were sampled from retailers and examined for several types of micro-organism; 185 lots had been prepared by the retailer, fifteen on an 'industrial' scale. pork had been used in seventy-three lots (including fourteen 'industrial' lots); beef was present in all lots, horse  meat in none of them. on the whole, the bacterial state of the meats in which pork had been used was found to be considerably inferior to that of samples not containing this ingredient. the aerobic bacterial count and number of yeasts, as  well as enterobacteriaceae and group d. streptococci were at least 10 times higher on an average in this case than they were in lots not containing pork. in  the case of lactobacillus, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens the  picture was similar, though the counts of the two lastnamed species were smaller. salmonella was detected in 84 per cent of the pork-containing lots and in 13 per  cent of the other lots. for yersinia enterocolitica, these figures were 44 per cent and 5 per cent, and for campylobacter fetus, subsp, jejuni 18 per cent and 6 per cent. the ph varied from 5 to 6. lots containing pork averaged a higher ph. addition of acid sauce had only a slight effect on ph levels. a number of these results were related to each other. it is concluded that the use of raw pork in meat products meant for raw consumption should be avoided.

TI  == gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  == pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. we studied whether other gram-positive species (groups a and b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. in vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18%  for the control). infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate c5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. these alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.

TI  == microbiological studies on hamburgers.
AB  == one hundred and eighty-two raw, 112 pre-cooked and 750 cooked hamburgers composed mainly of beef or beef and pork were subjected to microbiological examination.raw hamburgers gave total bacterial counts from 10(6) to 10(8) per g, counts of enterobacteriaceae from 10(4) to 10(6) per g, of escherichia coli from 10(3) to 10(5), of group d streptococci from 10(2) to 10(4), of staphylococcus aureus from 3 to 10(2) and of clostridium perfringens less than 10 bacteria per g. of the samples, 32% contained salmonellas; the highest most probable number was 10(2) per g but most estimates were below 1 per g. corresponding figures for the pre-cooked samples were 2-3 log cycles lower, and only one sample contained salmonella. yersinia enterocolitica was not isolated from any raw or pre-cooked sample.three hundred and ninety-five of the cooked hamburgers were prepared by grilling raw hamburgers for between 2 and 5.5 min. these gave total bacterial counts from 10(5) to 10(7) per g, and counts of enterobacteriaceae from 10(2) to  10(5) per g. of the samples, 9.4% contained salmonellas, always in numbers below  1 per g. the remaining 355 cooked hamburgers were prepared from samples pre-cooked for 10 min at 80 degrees c. some were grilled and some fat fried. the  total bacterial counts were from 10(3) to 10(5) per g, and counts of enterobacteriaceae below 10(2) per g. salmonellae, again in small numbers only, were recovered from 3.5% of samples.when hamburgers were artificially contaminated with salmonella typhimurium it took 5.5 min on a commercial grill, 2.25 min frying in a frying pan and 1.75 min on a household grill to reliably reduce the salmonella count one hundredfold. this means that at many vending places hamburgers are often cooked for too short a time.d-values were determined  for s. typhimurium in hamburger meat at 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70 degrees c, these values were 7.1, 5.1, 1.2, 0.9 and 0.6 min respectively. it can be concluded that the heating action in the centre of the hamburgers will take place more slowly than in the hamburger as a whole, and that the time between cooking and consumption is very important in reducing the microbial load to acceptable levels.pre-cooking (10 min at 80 degrees c in a water bath) gives a reduction in  the numbers of salmonella of about 4 x 10(3), after which cooking gives a further reduction as mentioned above.

TI  == enzymatic hydrolysis of immobilized sphingomyelin by three bacterial phospholipases c.
AB  == through hydrophobic interaction, sphingomyelin was adsorbed to agarose beads containing octyl groups by a stepwise dilution procedure. this immobilized lipid  was used as a substrate for three bacterial phospholipases c (e.c. 3.1.4.3.). the degradation with time of this substrate showed two different fractions of the substrate according to hydrolysing velocity in the early part of the time-curve when phospholipases c from bacillus cereus and clostridium perfringens were used. the early fractions could be predigested by the enzymes, a procedure which resulted in linear time-curves. the corresponding early part of the time-curve for phospholipase c from staphylococcus aureus was linear, indicating a comparatively large early fraction of the substrate for this enzyme. the stock gel of the immobilized lipid substrate could be stored for months. it was easily  and reproducibly handled as a water suspension. after enzymatic hydrolysis the substrate was rapidly separated from enzyme and product by filtration. the enzyme assay presented thus represents a convenient way to avoid the difficulties connected with the use of temporary sonicated suspensions as substrate for bacterial phospholipases c.

TI  == some aspects of microbial contamination of hands of workers in food industries.
AB  == with regard to food hygiene, the question is posed whether carriers of pathogenic organisms, like salmonella can contaminate a product by their hands. this might especially be possible in case of bad toilet hygiene. experiments were carried out in 13 food and 3 non-food establishments. an inquiry was made into habits of  toilet use and hand washing. the following microbiological examinations were performed on workers' hands: total colony-forming-units per hand, and the presence of salmonella, e. coli, enterobact., staph. aureus, faecal streptococci  and cl. perfringens. approximately 42% of workers in the food industry and approximately 64% of workers in other industries seems to use the factory toilet  regularly for defaecation. because of the presence of contaminated raw materials  in food industries, it is impossible to get direct proof that faecal contamination of the hands is due to toilet use. however, there is indirect evidence that contamination of workers' hands by raw materials, especially of animal origin, is of much more importance than the consequences of toilet use. this is shown by the occurrence of salmonella on the hands (5-36% pos.) in only those factories where raw materials of animal origin are handled, by the low incidence of e. coli on the hands in food industries where "clean" materials (vegetables, biscuits, chocolate) are handled, and by the total absence of e. coli on the hands of workers in two non-food industries.

AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

TI  == controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  == a cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. it operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through  a short orifice. if the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. the disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by stansted fluid power limited, stansted, england. phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including chlorella, aspergillus fumigatis, fusarium sp., saccharomyces cerevisiae, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, bacillus subtilis, clostridium perfringens, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus zooepidermicus and staphylococcus aureus. the cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. the applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. the case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.

TI  == synthesis and quantitative structure--activity relationships of some antibacterial 3-formylrifamycin sv n-(4-substituted phenyl)piperazinoacethydrazones.
AB  == a series of 14 3-formylrifamycin sv n-(4-substituted phenyl)piperazinoacethydrazones has been synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. the compounds were found active against bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium phlei, and mycobacterium tuberculosis but not as active as rifampin. the compounds also exhibited significant activity against clostridium perfringens and in this bacterial system some were more active than rifampin. the qsar showed that the activity against b. subtilis depended only on lipophilicity, and the regression equation was linear.  a parabolic relationship between the antibacterial activity and lipophilicity of  the compounds was found in staph. aureus. additionally, the activity was dependent upon the electronic and steric effects of the phenyl substituents. the  sensitivity of m. phlei to the compounds was found to correlate well with a linear combination of hydrophobic, electronic, and steric parameters. no statistically significant correlation was possible between the physicochemical parameters studied and the activity of the compounds against c. perfringens and m. tuberculosis.

TI  == synergistic hemolysis phenomenon shown by an alpha-toxin-producing clostridium perfingens and streptococcal camp factor in presumptive streptococcal grouping.
AB  == a new phenomenon of synergistic hemolysis by clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin  and the streptococcal camp factor on human and guinea pig erythrocytes is described. a possible mode of action of the camp factors is suggested. on human blood agar all of the tested isolates of group b streptococci gave an arrowhead-shaped zone of hemolysis; 74% of group a gave a crescent-shaped lytic zone, whereas all isolates of groups c and g and the remaining 26% of group a streptococci gave a bullet-shaped lytic zone. by comparison, in the camp test incubated aerobically and anaerobically, 70 and 91%, respectively, of streptococci other than group b gave positive, arrowhead-shaped lytic zones. if all intermediate positive reactions in the camp tests were read as negative after aerobic incubation, only 89% of group b streptococci would be properly identified. the synergistic hemolysis phenomenon, using an alpha-toxin-producing  c. perfringens and human blood agar, provided a reliable test for presumptive identification of group b streptococci, with promising potential to differentiate in the same test group a streptococci from other groups.

TI  == synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == sheep and human erythrocytes, partially processed by staphylococcus aureus or clostridium perfringens, were susceptible to lysis in the presence of propionibacterium acnes. p. acnes liberated a lipase that was detected on tween 80 agar and also on phospholipase c-precipitated egg yolk agar. such a lipase might have contributed in the process of an intensified cellular lysis. similar reactions were attempted with lactobacillus acidophilus, known to possess a nondiffusible lipase, and failed to produce any such reactions. the synergistic reactions, between p. acnes and c. perfringens, were compared with the classical  camp reaction in an attempt to find a correlation with the established membrane composition of the erythrocytes involved. synergistic reactions observed do seem  to reflect the membrane composition. such findings, besides being contributory to an understanding of the role of these organisms in the process of pathogenesis, are of importance in the elucidation of molecular organization of biomembranes. detailed studies, involving a large number of representative anaerobic bacteria,  may also help provide an avenue in anaerobic species identification.

AB  == in an earlier paper we described the synthesis and the antitrichomonas activity of 2-nitro-alpha,alpha,1-trimethyl-1h-imidazole-5-methanol (2). starting from this compound, several derivatives have been synthesized. among these, the phenyl carbonate 8 has been shown to possess activity equal to that of 2 and to be less  toxic. this compound therefore is interesting in comparison with some antitrichomonas agents currently in use clinically. before undertaking an in-depth investigation, compound 8 was subjected to some studies to see whether it has any effects on the central nervous system (cns). preliminary results show  that, at therapeutic doses, it might induce unwanted cns effects to a lesser degree than metronidazole.

TI  == binding of protein chemotactic factors to the surfaces of neutrophil leukocytes and its modification with lipid-specific bacterial toxins.
AB  == the binding to neutrophil leukoyctes of human serum albumin (hsa), which is chemokinetic for leukocytes, i.e. influences their rate of locomotion, and of alkali-denatured hsa, which is chemotactic for leukocytes, i.e. influences their  direction of locomotion, was studied. native serum albumin showed low affinity binding to the neutrophil surface. denatured serum albumin showed saturable binding with a ka of approximately 1-(6) litres per mole to about 10(6) binding sites per cell. another protein chemotactic factor, alpha5-casein, gave similar binding. these results exclude that chemotactic reactions to denatured proteins are mediated in a completely non-specific manner and suggest the presence on the  cell of a restricted number of defined recognition sites. binding was reduced following treatment of the cells with either of two lipid-specific bacterial toxins, perfringolysin, the theta-toxin of clostridium perfringens, an oxygen-labile cholesterol-specific toxin, and staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase c. both have previously been shown to reduce chemotactic reactions and both were used at doses which did not reduce cell viability. these  results suggest an important, and possiblly direct, role for membrane lipid in the binding sites for chemotactic factors. visual analysis of the behaviour of perfringolysin-treated neutrophils showed that these cells were still capable of  chemotactic locomotion. the cells appeared to be less efficient than normal in detecting chemotactic gradients only when at a distance from the gradient source, a finding which is consistent with reduced binding of the chemotactic factor to the cell surface.

TI  == qualitative study of paradoxical zone phenomenon of penicillins against 17 bacterial species of clinical importance.
AB  == using a triple agar layer technique and enzymatic inactivation of penicillin, the occurrence of a paradoxical zone phenomenon (illustrated by a typical 'target' image around the reservoir of antibiotic) was determined for several bacterial species specially chosen with regards to their taxonomic position, clinical importance and penicillin susceptibility. among gram-positive bacteria, a paradoxical zone was obtained for approximately 43% of the strains studied here (all 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus, all 10 strains of streptococcus faecalis, 7 of 10 strains of group b beta-hemolytic streptococci, 1 of 10 group a strains, 3 of 10 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 3 of 10 strains of clostridium perfringens but for none of 10 strains each of streptococcus pneumoniae, and listeria monocytogenes). among gram-negative bacteria, a target image was regularly obtained with haemophilus influenzae (all 10 strains tested)  and proteus species (9 of 10 strains) but with none of the following species: escherichia coli, salmonella, shigella, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis and bacteroides fragilis. therapeutic implications of these observations are difficult to assess, and need further investigation.

AB  == specimens from 135 cutaneous abscesses in outpatients were cultured anaerobically and aerobically. of these, 4% were sterile and 29% yielded pure cultures, predominantly of staphylococcus aureus. aerobic species were isolated from all anatomic areas. anaerobes were found with a frequency comparable to aerobes in all nonperineal areas except the hand. in contrast, abscesses in the perineal region contained a greater variety and frequency of anaerobes. only two patients  were febrile. all abscesses were treated with incision and drainage, and all healed without complication, including those 74% that were treated without adjunctive antibiotics. primary management of cutaneous abscesses should be incision and drainage. in general, routine culture and antibiotic therapy are not indicated for localized abscesses in patients with presumably normal host defenses.

AB  == the authors present data obtained from a series of 27 rabbits studied following intracarotid injection of saline, brain-heart infusion broth, aerobic, or anaerobic bacteria. these data support the hypothesis that injections of cultures of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms by way of the carotid artery disrupts the blood-brain barrier over the cerebral convexities within 15 minutes; however, the inflammatory response and bacterial proliferation occur much more rapidly in the  ventricular system. within 3 hours,the barrier over the convexities is intact, but leukocytes and organisms may be seen in the long cilia of the aqeuductal region. a relative failure of leucotaxis over the convexities of the brain is the most likely explanation of these preliminary findings in this experimental model.

AB  == operational guidelines for a chain of the newer type of seafood restaurants and take-out stores were derived from plots of bacteriological and trimethylamine changes during the preparation and storage of cod fillets, shrimp, and clams. if  fish is to be defrosted at room temperature it should be washed and portioned within 14 h. subsequent storage at 5 degrees c should not exceed 72 h and once removed from the refrigerator it should be fried within 3 h. new stores should consider improved methods of defrosting. trimethylamine content was a more sensitive measure of quality loss than bacterial growth. shrimp quality can be improved by emphasizing the way shells are removed because most of the contamination was external. shrimp shelled while still frozen had the best potential keeping quality. clam meat is handled less and is always held at 5 degrees c; but bacterial growth indicated that it should not be held on the premises for more than 3 days including the time necessary for defrosting. batter prepared fresh daily can be feft at room temperature. frying can obliterate poor  handling procedures, but adequate cooking is essential under any conditions. clams are a gourmet item but the practice of cooking them lightly at customer request proved inadvisable.

TI  == effect of klebsiella pneumoniae enterotoxin on intestinal transport in the rat.
AB  == the effects on intestinal transport of either a semipurified preparation of enterotoxin elaborated by klebsiella pneumoniae or similaryly prepared control material were tested by marker perfusion studies in the small intestine of rats.  at a concentration of 2 mg/ml, the enterotoxin produced net secretion of water, na, and cl in both jejunal and ileal segments; hco3 transport was not affected. net secretion was evident within 30 min after intorduction of the toxin and was maximal after 90 min. the addition of 56 mm glucose to the enterotoxin-containing perfusion fluid resulted in reversal of water and na transport to net absorption  in both intestinal segments. the enterotoxin also produced a significant depression of xylose absorption in both the jejunum and ileum but did not affect  the absorption of either glucose or l-leucine. intestinal structure was not altered after perfusion of the toxin but insillation of approximately one-quarter of the total perfusion dose into a ligated jejunal loop for 18 h produced fluid secretion and structural abnormalities. these observations confirm the fact that  other species of coliform bacteria in addition to tescherichia coli are capable of elaborating an enterotoxin. such species commonly contaminate the small intestine of persons with tropical sprue and it is suggested that chronic exposure of the intestinal mucosa to the enterotoxin elaborated by these bacteria may be a factor in the pathogenesis of intestinal abnormalities in thid disorder.

TI  == organization of phospholipids in human red cell membranes as detected by the action of various purified phospholipases.
AB  == 1. the action of eight purified phospholipases on intact human erythrocytes has been investigated. four enzymes, e.g. phospholipases a2 from pancreas and crotalus adamanteus, phospholipase c from bacillus cereus, and phospholipase d from cabbage produce neither haemolysis nor hydrolysis of phospholipids in intact cells. on the other hand, both phospholipases a2 from bee venom and naja naja cause a non-haemolytic breakdown of more than 50% of the lecithin, while sphingomyelinase c from staphylococcus aureus is able to produce a non-lytic degradation of more than 80% of the sphingomyelin. 2. phospholipase c from clostridium welchii appeared to be the only lipolytic enzyme tested, which produces haemolysis of human erythrocytes. evidence is presented that the unique  properties of the enzyme itself, rather than possible contaminations in the purified preparation, are responsible for the observed haemolytic effect. 3. with non-sealed ghosts, all phospholipases produce essentially complete breakdown of those phospholipids which can be considered as proper substrates for the enzymes  involved. 4. due to its absolute requirement for ca2+, pancreatic phospholipase a2 can be trapped inside resealed ghosts in the presence of edta, without producing phospholipid breakdown during the resealing procedure. subsequent addition of ca2+ stimulates phospholipase a2 activity at the inside of the resealed cell, eventually leading to lysis. before lysis occurs, however, 25% of  the lecithin, half of the phosphatidylethanolamine and some 65% of the phosphatidylserine can be hydrolysed. this observation is explained in relation to an asymmetric phospholipid distribution in red cell membranes.

TI  == determination of toxin-induced leakage of different-size nucleotides through the  plasma membrane of human diploid fibroblasts.
AB  == human diploid lung fibroblasts were treated with cytolytic bacterial toxins and the nature of the membrane damage was investigated. [3h] uridine was used for differential labeling of cytoplasmic components of small or large molecular size. two principal size categories were achieved by labeling the fibroblasts in either early growth phase or stationary phase, a high-molecular weight ribonucleic acid  label and a low-molecular-weight nucleotide label. the size of the labeled molecules was determined by perchloric acid precipitation and gel chromatography. leakage of labeled molecules of different size indicated the size of the "functional pores" in the plasma membrane caused by the test substance. the nonionic detergent triton x-100 produced large functional pores in the fibroblast membrane as evidenced by rapid leakage of both large and small labeled molecules. theta-toxin from clostridium perfringens and the polyene antibiotic filipin both  gave rise to considerably small functional pores in the plasma membrane. although small molecules easily passed the treated membrane, large molecules could not escape from the cells even after prolonged treatment with these substances or by  increasing their concentration. by the contrast, the leakage profiles obtained with melittin from bee venom or with delta-toxin from staphylococcus aureus in each case suggested the formation initially of pores of intermediate size that increased upon prolonged incubation or when higher concentrations were used.

AB  == a comparison was made of four methods of thawing frozen chickens and an average thaw time for each method was determined.fully and partially thawed chickens, inoculated with salmonellas, clostridium welchii and staphylococcus aureus were cooked in a spit-roasting oven at different temperatures for different lengths of time. the chickens were examined freshly cooked and after storage under various conditions.spit roasting fully thawed chickens until the outer skin was golden brown was sufficient heat-treatment to kill salmonellas and staph. aureus but cl. welchii could survive. salmonellas could also survive if the chickens were not fully thawed before cooking.incorrect storage after cooking was shown to encourage the growth of pathogens.the incidence of intestinal pathogens in frozen dressed chickens and environmental hazards in spit-roasting establishments were also studied. of raw chickens examined 35% contained salmonellas (9 serotypes), 63% contained cl. welchii and 63% staph. aureus.

TI  == the effect of two methods of cooking and cooling on clostridium welchii and other bacteria in meat.
AB  == a comparison was made of beef cooked in conventional and moist air (rapidaire) ovens. in both large (ca. 4.5 kg.) and small (ca. 2.7 kg.) joints, spores of clostridium welchii survived after cooking but vegetative cells, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus, did not, regardless of the type of oven used.cooling at room temperature after cooking permitted growth of cl. welchii. although some multiplication also occurred in the centre of large roasts cooled under refrigeration, the viable counts were considered too low to constitute a potential health risk.

TI  == collagenolytic activity of bacteria.
AB  == actively growing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were screened by a plate assay, with reconstituted guinea pig collagen as a substrate, for their ability to produce a collagenolytic factor. collagenolytic activity was not demonstrated among the aerobic organisms tested, with the exception of one strain of staphylococcus aureus (only when grown under anaerobic conditions). collagenolytic activity, however, was detected in cultures of clostridium tetani  and bacteroides species other than b. melaninogenicus. collagenolytic activity of these organisms could be confirmed by measuring the amount of hydroxyproline liberated from the collagen gel during growth. although collagenase production by pseudomonas aeruginosa has been suggested in previous reports, our results were negative. an extracellular fraction of p. aeruginosa was able to hydrolyze a synthetic hexapeptide cbz-glycyl-l-prolyl-glycyl-glycyl-l-prolyl-l- alanine, but  was without detectable effect on reconstituted collagen.

TI  == food-borne bacterial toxins.
AB  == food poisoning caused by the ingestion of preformed bacterial toxins is considered in relation to comparative symptoms, procedures for extraction and purification of the causal toxins, their chemistry, serology, assay procedures and pharmacology, in so far as these are known.the bacteria discussed in this context are clostridium botulinum, c. perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and vibrio parahemolyticus. the possible roles of the enterococci, proteus, e. coli and of unknown species, in relation to production of non-antigenic toxic substances, are discussed briefly.requirements for prevention of the various forms of bacterial food poisoning are outlined.

TI  == effect of high fat diets on intestinal microflora and serum cholesterol in rats.
AB  == graber, c. d. (baylor university college of medicine, houston, tex.), r. m. o'neal, and e. r. rabin. effect of high fat diets on intestinal microflora and serum cholesterol in rats. j. bacteriol. 89:47-51. 1965.-differential bacterial counts of feces and total plasma cholesterol determinations were performed on 60  wistar rats fed several high lipid diets for a period of approximately 6 months.  fecal flora remained relatively stable irrespective of diet, but cholesterol levels rose in animals fed butter and sodium cholate. the six most commonly cultured organisms in all diets were enterococci, proteus, lactobacilli, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and other micrococci. no enteric pathogens which did not ferment lactose or fermented it slowly were grown. fungi  and yeasts were rare. aerobes generally outnumbered anaerobes in proportions which were sometimes as high as 300:1. clostridium perfringens isolations were consistently high in animals given the butter diets, particularly when sodium cholate was added. evidence is reviewed which indicates that this organism may play a role in bile salt and cholesterol metabolism. this experiment would seem to demonstrate that differences in plasma-cholesterol levels among the various dietary groups of rats were the result of dietary factors rather than alteration  in intestinal flora.
