TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == antimicrobial co-resistance patterns of gram-negative bacilli isolated from bloodstream infections: a longitudinal epidemiological study from 2002-2011.
AB  == background: increasing multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacilli (gnb) infections poses a serious threat to public health. few studies have analyzed co-resistance rates, defined as an antimicrobial susceptibility profile in a subset already resistant to one specific antibiotic. the epidemiologic and clinical utility of determining co-resistance rates are analyzed and discussed. methods: a 10-year retrospective study from 2002-2011 of bloodstream infections with gnb were analyzed from three hospitals in greater vancouver, bc, canada. descriptive statistics were calculated for antimicrobial resistance and co-resistance. statistical analysis further described temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance, correlations of resistance between combinations of antimicrobials, and temporal trends in co-resistance patterns. results: the total number of unique blood stream isolates of gnb was 3280. increasing resistance to  individual antimicrobials was observed for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. cloacae, and p. aeruginosa. ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli peaked in 2006 at 40% and subsequently stabilized at 29% in 2011, corresponding to decreasing ciprofloxacin usage after 2007, as assessed by defined daily dose utilization data. high co-resistance rates were observed for ceftriaxone-resistant e. coli with ciprofloxacin (73%), ceftriaxone-resistant k. pneumoniae with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (83%), ciprofloxacin-resistant e. cloacae with ticarcillin-clavulanate (91%), and piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant p. aeruginosa with ceftazidime (83%). conclusions: increasing antimicrobial resistance was demonstrated over the study period, which may partially be associated with antimicrobial consumption. the study of co-resistance rates in multidrug resistant gnb provides insight into the epidemiology of resistance acquisition, and may be used as a clinical tool to aid prescribing empiric antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == supporting the ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam enterobacteriaceae breakpoint determination using humanised in vivo exposures in a thigh model.
AB  == previous in vivo studies using a human-simulated regimen of ceftaroline/avibactam 600/600mg every 8h (q8h) showed activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-, ampc- and kpc-producing enterobacteriaceae with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) </= 1 mug/ml. here we sought to determine the efficacy of this human-simulated regimen against organisms with mics >/= 1 mug/ml to help determine a breakpoint value that would reliability predict efficacy in humans. in total, 31 isolates (1 escherichia coli, 9 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 enterobacter cloacae, 1 citrobacter koseri, 2 serratia marcescens, 1 klebsiella oxytoca and 8 pseudomonas aeruginosa) with ceftaroline/avibactam mics of 1 to 16  mug/ml were tested in a murine immunocompromised thigh infection model; 15 isolates were also tested in an immunocompetent model. doses were given to simulate human free drug exposures of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h over 24h as a 1-h infusion by targeting the ft>mic profile. efficacy was evaluated as the change in log10 cfu compared with 0-h controls after 24h. reductions in bacterial cfu in the neutropenic model were seen against a majority of isolates tested with mics </= 4 mug/ml, where ft>mic was >55%. more variable efficacy was seen in isolates with mics >/= 8 mug/ml, where ft>mic drops below 40%. overall activity was enhanced in the immunocompetent model. the humanised regimen of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h as a 1-h infusion showed  predictable efficacy against isolates with various genotypic and phenotypic profiles and mics </= 4 mug/ml. these data provide valuable information to help determine a ceftaroline/avibactam breakpoint for enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == [prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in peking union medical college hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in peking union medical college  hospital. method: the incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. results: there were 449  positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. samples separated from patients with  community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. most community-aquired infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples.  respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were gram-negative (66.9%). the most common gram-negative bacteria included escherichia coli (13.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common gram-positive  bacteria. gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). the detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumonia/klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. the resistance to acinetobacter baumannii was serious. multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant a. baumannii acountted for 74% of all a. baumannii infections. stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. also, 22 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. all patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. fourteen  of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. there were 61  samples proved to be bacteria colonization. nonfermenters such as acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. conclusions: the pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly gram-negative bacteria. the incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.

TI  == structural similarity of secretins from type ii and type iii secretion systems.
AB  == secretins, the outer membrane components of several secretion systems in gram-negative bacteria, assemble into channels that allow exoproteins to traverse the membrane. the membrane-inserted, multimeric regions of pscc, the pseudomonas  aeruginosa type iii secretion system secretin, and puld, the klebsiella oxytoca type ii secretion system secretin, were purified after cell-free synthesis and their structures analyzed by single particle cryoelectron microscopy. both homomultimeric, barrel-like structures display a "cup and saucer" architecture. the "saucer" region of both secretins is composed of two distinct rings, with that of puld being less segmented than that of pscc. both secretins have a central chamber that is occluded by a plug linked to the chamber walls through hairpin-like structures. comparisons with published structures from other bacterial systems reveal that secretins have regions of local structural flexibility, probably reflecting their evolved functions in protein secretion and needle assembly.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of the triterpene 3beta,6beta,16beta-trihydroxylup-20(29)-ene on planktonic cells and biofilms from gram positive and gram negative bacteria.
AB  == this study evaluated the antimicrobial effect of 3beta,6beta,16beta-trihydroxylup-20(29)-ene (clf1), a triterpene isolated from combretum leprosum mart., in inhibiting the planktonic growth and biofilms of gram positive bacteria streptococcus mutans and s. mitis. the antimicrobial activity was assessed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc). the antibiofilm potential was determined by quantifying total biomass and enumerating biofilm-entrapped viable  bacteria. in addition, the acute toxicity of clf1 on artemia sp. nauplii was also determined. the results showed that clf1 was able in inhibiting the growth of s.  mutans and s. mitis with mic and mbc of 7.8 mug/ml and 15.6 mug/ml, respectively. clf1 was highly effective on biofilms of both bacteria. only 7.8 mug/ml clf1 was  enough to inhibit by 97% and 90% biomass production of s. mutans and s. mitis, respectively. on the other hand, such effects were not evident on gram negative pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. the toxicity tests showed that the lc50 of clf1 was 98.19 mug/ml. therefore, clf1 isolated from c. leprosum may constitute an important natural agent for the development of new therapies for caries and other infectious diseases caused by s. mutans and s. mitis.

TI  == rapid identification of carbapenemase genes in gram-negative bacteria with an oligonucleotide microarray-based assay.
AB  == rapid molecular identification of carbapenemase genes in gram-negative bacteria is crucial for infection control and prevention, surveillance and for epidemiological purposes. furthermore, it may have a significant impact upon determining the appropriate initial treatment and greatly benefit for critically  ill patients. a novel oligonucleotide microarray-based assay was developed to simultaneously detect genes encoding clinically important carbapenemases as well  as selected extended (esbl) and narrow spectrum (nsbl) beta-lactamases directly from clonal culture material within few hours. additionally, a panel of species specific markers was included to identify escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii/braakii, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii. the assay was tested using a panel of 117 isolates collected from urinary, blood and stool samples. for these isolates, phenotypic identifications  and susceptibility tests were available. an independent detection of carbapenemase, esbl and nsbl genes was carried out by various external reference  laboratories using pcr methods. in direct comparison, the microarray correctly identified 98.2% of the covered carbapenemase genes. this included blavim (13 out of 13), blagim (2/2), blakpc (27/27), blandm (5/5), blaimp-2/4/7/8/13/14/15/16/31 (10/10), blaoxa-23 (12/13), blaoxa-40-group (7/7), blaoxa-48-group (32/33), blaoxa-51 (1/1) and blaoxa-58 (1/1). furthermore, the test correctly identified additional beta-lactamases [blaoxa-1 (16/16), blaoxa-2 (4/4), blaoxa-9 (33/33), oxa-10 (3/3), blaoxa-51 (25/25), blaoxa-58 (2/2), ctx-m1/m15 (17/17) and blavim (1/1)]. in direct comparison to phenotypical identification obtained by vitek or  maldi-tof systems, 114 of 117 (97.4%) isolates, including acinetobacter baumannii (28/28), enterobacter spec. (5/5), escherichia coli (4/4), klebsiella pneumoniae  (62/63), klebsiella oxytoca (0/2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12/12), citrobacter freundii (1/1) and citrobacter braakii (2/2), were correctly identified by a panel of species specific probes. this assay might be easily extended, adapted and transferred to point of care platforms enabling fast surveillance, rapid detection and appropriate early treatment of infections caused by multiresistant  gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == effect of algae and plant lectins on planktonic growth and biofilm formation in clinically relevant bacteria and yeasts.
AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the abilities of plant and algae lectins to inhibit  planktonic growth and biofilm formation in bacteria and yeasts. initially, ten lectins were tested on staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, and c. tropicalis at concentrations of 31.25 to 250 mu g/ml. the lectins from cratylia floribunda (cfl), vatairea macrocarpa (vml), bauhinia bauhinioides (bbl), bryothamnion seaforthii (bsl), and hypnea musciformis (hml) showed activities against at least one microorganism. biofilm formation in the presence of the lectins was also evaluated; after 24 h of incubation with the lectins, the biofilms were analyzed  by quantifying the biomass (by crystal violet staining) and by enumerating the viable cells (colony-forming units). the lectins reduced the biofilm biomass and/or the number of viable cells to differing degrees depending on the microorganism tested, demonstrating the different characteristics of the lectins. these findings indicate that the lectins tested in this study may be natural alternative antimicrobial agents; however, further studies are required to better elucidate the functional use of these proteins.

AB  == background: worldwide, the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria is a clinical problem. surface disinfectant cleaners (sdcs) that are effective against these bacteria are needed for use in high risk areas around patients and on multi-touch surfaces. we determined the efficacy of several sdcs  against clinically relevant bacterial species with and without common types of multidrug resistance. methods: bacteria species used were atcc strains; clinical  isolates classified as antibiotic-susceptible; and multi-resistant clinical isolates from klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens  (all oxa-48 and kpc-2); acinetobacter baumannii (oxa-23); pseudomonas aeruginosa  (vim-1); and achromobacter xylosoxidans (atcc strain). experiments were carried out according to en 13727:2012 in quadruplicate under dirty conditions. the five  evaluated sdcs were based on alcohol and an amphoteric substance (aas), an oxygen-releaser (or), surface-active substances (sas), or surface-active-substances plus aldehydes (sasa; two formulations). bactericidal concentrations of sdcs were determined at two different contact times. efficacy was defined as a log10 >/= 5 reduction in bacterial cell count. results: sdcs based on aas, or, and sas were effective against all six species irrespective of  the degree of multi-resistance. the sasa formulations were effective against the  bacteria irrespective of degree of multi-resistance except for one of the four p. aeruginosa isolates (vim-1). we found no general correlation between sdc efficacy and degree of antibiotic resistance. conclusions: sdcs were generally effective against gram-negative bacteria with and without multidrug resistance. sdcs are therefore suitable for surface disinfection in the immediate proximity of patients. single bacterial isolates, however, might have reduced susceptibility to selected biocidal agents.

TI  == ceftolozane/tazobactam activity tested against aerobic gram-negative organisms isolated from intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections in european and united states hospitals (2012).
AB  == ceftolozane/tazobactam is under clinical development for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (iai), complicated urinary tract infections (uti) and  ventilator-associated pneumonia. we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam and comparator agents tested against gram-negative aerobic bacteria causing iai and healthcare-associated uti (hca-uti). the organisms were  consecutively collected from january to december 2012 from 59 medical centers located in the united states (usa) and 15 european countries by the program to assess ceftolozane/tazobactam susceptibility (pacts). the collection included 809 organisms from iai and 2474 organisms from hca-uti, and susceptibility testing was performed by reference broth microdilution methods as described by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) m07-a9 document. overall, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most  frequently isolated pathogens from both infection types. ceftolozane/tazobactam was very active against e. coli (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 98.5-99.9% inhibited at an mic of </=8 mg/l) and retained activity against many of the multidrug-resistant (mdr; mic50/90, 0.5/2->32 mg/l) and esbl-phenotype strains (mic50/90, 0.5/2-32 mg/l). ceftolozane/tazobactam was active against most k. pneumoniae strains (mic50/90, 0.25/16 mg/l, 88.9-89.6% inhibited at an mic of </=8 mg/l), but some esbl-phenotype (mic50/90, 4-8/>32 mg/l) and mdr (mic50/90, 16/>32 mg/l) isolates exhibited elevated mic values. ceftolozane/tazobactam was the most active agent tested against p. aeruginosa (mic50/90, 0.5/4 mg/l; 93.4-95.7% inhibited at </=8 mg/l) and retained potency against many mdr (mic50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/l), ceftazidime-nonsusceptible (mic50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/l) and meropenem-nonsusceptible (mic50/90, 2/>32 mg/l) strains. ceftolozane/tazobactam was also active against klebsiella oxytoca (mic50/90, </=0.12-0.25/0.5-1 mg/l), enterobacter spp. (mic50/90, 0.25-0.5/4-8 mg/l), citrobacter spp. (mic50/90, 0.25/2-32 mg/l), proteus mirabilis (mic50/90, 0.5/0.5 mg/l), indole-positive proteae (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5-1 mg/l), and serratia spp. (mic50/90, 0.5/1-2 mg/l).  in summary, ceftolozane/tazobactam demonstrated potent in vitro activity when tested against contemporary aerobic gram-negative pathogens causing iai and hca-uti in usa and european medical centers.

TI  == pediatric multicenter evaluation of the verigene gram-negative blood culture test for rapid detection of inpatient bacteremia involving gram-negative organisms, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases.
AB  == we evaluated the investigational use only (iuo) version of the rapid verigene gram-negative blood culture test (bc-gn), a microarray that detects 9 genus/species targets (acinetobacter spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., escherichia coli/shigella spp., klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens) and 6 antimicrobial resistance determinants (blactx-m, blakpc, blandm, blavim, blaimp,  and blaoxa) directly from positive blood cultures. bc-gn was performed on positive bact/alert pediatric fan and bactec peds plus blood cultures with gram-negative organisms at two tertiary pediatric centers. vitek ms (biomerieux,  durham, nc) was used to assign gold standard organism identification. the check mdr ct-102 microarray (check points b.v., wageningen, netherlands) was used as an alternative method for detecting resistance determinants. in total, 104 organisms were isolated from 97 clinical blood cultures. bc-gn correctly detected 26/26 cultures with acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens, 5/6 with citrobacter spp., 13/14 with enterobacter spp., 23/24 with e. coli, 2/3 with k. oxytoca, 16/17 with k. pneumoniae, and 0/1 with proteus spp. bc-gn appropriately  reported negative bc-gn results in 8/13 blood cultures that grew organisms that were not represented on the microarray but failed to detect targets in 3/5 cultures that grew multiple gram-negative organisms. bc-gn detected 5/5 and 1/1 clinical blood cultures with blactx-m and blavim. all 6 results were corroborated by check mdr ct-102 microarray testing. the verigene bc-gn test has the potential to expedite therapeutic decision making in pediatric patients with gram-negative  bacteremia. sensitivity was satisfactory but may be suboptimal in mixed gram-negative blood cultures.

TI  == evaluation of an automated rapid diagnostic assay for detection of gram-negative  bacteria and their drug-resistance genes in positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the performance of the verigene gram-negative blood culture nucleic  acid test (bc-gn; nanosphere, northbrook, il, usa), an automated multiplex assay  for rapid identification of positive blood cultures caused by 9 gram-negative bacteria (gnb) and for detection of 9 genes associated with beta-lactam resistance. the bc-gn assay can be performed directly from positive blood cultures with 5 minutes of hands-on and 2 hours of run time per sample. a total of 397 gnb positive blood cultures were analyzed using the bc-gn assay. of the 397 samples, 295 were simulated samples prepared by inoculating gnb into blood culture bottles, and the remaining were clinical samples from 102 patients with positive blood cultures. aliquots of the positive blood cultures were tested by the bc-gn assay. the results of bacterial identification between the bc-gn assay  and standard laboratory methods were as follows: acinetobacter spp. (39 isolates  for the bc-gn assay/39 for the standard methods), citrobacter spp. (7/7), escherichia coli (87/87), klebsiella oxytoca (13/13), and proteus spp. (11/11); enterobacter spp. (29/30); klebsiella pneumoniae (62/72); pseudomonas aeruginosa  (124/125); and serratia marcescens (18/21); respectively. from the 102 clinical samples, 104 bacterial species were identified with the bc-gn assay, whereas 110  were identified with the standard methods. the bc-gn assay also detected all beta-lactam resistance genes tested (233 genes), including 54 bla(ctx-m), 119 bla(imp), 8 bla(kpc), 16 bla(ndm), 24 bla(oxa-23), 1 bla(oxa-24/40), 1 bla(oxa-48), 4 bla(oxa-58), and 6 blavim. the data shows that the bc-gn assay provides rapid detection of gnb and beta-lactam resistance genes in positive blood cultures and has the potential to contributing to optimal patient management by earlier detection of major antimicrobial resistance genes.

TI  == independent domain assembly in a trapped folding intermediate of multimeric outer membrane secretins.
AB  == the outer membrane portal of the klebsiella oxytoca type ii secretion system, puld, is a prototype of a family of proteins, the secretins, which are essential  components of many bacterial secretion and pilus assembly machines. puld is a homododecamer with a periplasmic vestibule and an outer chamber on either side of a membrane-spanning region that is poorly resolved by electron microscopy. membrane insertion involves the formation of a dodecameric membrane-embedded intermediate. here, we describe an amino acid substitution in puld that blocks its assembly at this intermediate "prepore" stage. electron microscopy indicated  that the prepore has an apparently normal periplasmic vestibule but a poorly organized outer chamber. a peptide loop around this amino acid appears to be important for the formation/stability of the fully folded complex. a similar assembly intermediate results from creation of the same amino acid substitution in the pseudomonas aeruginosa secretin xcpq.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-negative aerobic bacilli from intra-abdominal pathogens to antimicrobial agents collected in the united states during 2011.
AB  == objectives: during 2011, a total of 1442 gram-negative pathogens from intra-abdominal infections were collected as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) from 19 hospital sites within the united  states. susceptibility to ertapenem and comparators and molecular analysis of ertapenem resistant isolates was performed. methods: extended-spectrum beta-lactamase esbl (esbl) isolates were determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute's recommended phenotypic test. isolates were identified to the species level, and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using custom microscan dehydrated broth microdilution panels esbls and carbapenemases were characterized using the check-points microarray. strain typing of klebsiella pneumoniae was performed by rep-pcr on the diversilab system. results: the majority of isolates were escherichia coli (36%), k. pneumoniae (18.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%) and enterobacter cloacae (8.4%). incidence of esbl-positive isolates was 12.7%, 9.7%, 3.6% and 3.1% for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella oxytoca, respectively. against the majority of isolates and species tested, the most active antibiotics  were amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem, with the carbapenems being the most active in vitro, including against esbl-positive isolates of e. coli. all other antibiotics exhibited diminished activity. against k. pneumoniae, the carbapenems were notably less active against esbl-positive isolates though their activity against this sub-population was still the highest of all antibiotics tested; however, 41.1% (14 of 34) of the phenotypically esbl-positive k. pneumoniae co-produced a carbapenemase (kpc2 or kpc3), and >90% of the isolates producing only an esbl remained susceptible to ertapenem. conclusions: further monitoring of susceptibility of intra-abdominal isolates is warranted due to limited therapeutic options available to physicians.

TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

TI  == microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in central alabama.
AB  == urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. they are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. the purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in central alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. this was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their  antibiotic resistance profile at this central alabama hospital. the survey period was between july 2009 and june 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed  and susceptibility testing was determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) microdilution method. the results indicated that escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.8%), enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (3.0%),  klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter freundii (1.5%), morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). for the 215 e. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, p < 0.05). in contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, p < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this central alabama hospital. additionally, this study found that e. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (lee et al. 2010; rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. it is imperative to monitor the resistance of p. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.

TI  == antimicrobial-resistant pathogens associated with healthcare-associated infections: summary of data reported to the national healthcare safety network at the centers for disease control and prevention, 2009-2010.
AB  == objective: to describe antimicrobial resistance patterns for healthcare-associated infections (hais) reported to the national healthcare safety network (nhsn) during 2009-2010. methods: central line-associated bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and surgical site infections were included. pooled mean proportions of isolates interpreted as resistant (or, in some cases,  nonsusceptible) to selected antimicrobial agents were calculated by type of hai and compared to historical data. results: overall, 2,039 hospitals reported 1 or  more hais; 1,749 (86%) were general acute care hospitals, and 1,143 (56%) had fewer than 200 beds. there were 69,475 hais and 81,139 pathogens reported. eight  pathogen groups accounted for about 80% of reported pathogens: staphylococcus aureus (16%), enterococcus spp. (14%), escherichia coli (12%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (11%), candida spp. (9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (and klebsiella oxytoca; 8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), and enterobacter spp. (5%). the percentage of resistance was similar to that reported in the previous 2-year period, with a slight decrease in the percentage of s. aureus resistant to oxacillins (mrsa). nearly 20% of pathogens reported from all hais were the following multidrug-resistant phenotypes: mrsa (8.5%); vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (3%); extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca (2%), e. coli (2%), and enterobacter spp. (2%); and carbapenem-resistant  p. aeruginosa (2%), k. pneumoniae/oxytoca (<1%), e. coli (<1%), and enterobacter  spp. (<1%). among facilities reporting hais with 1 of the above gram-negative bacteria, 20%-40% reported at least 1 with the resistant phenotype. conclusion: while the proportion of resistant isolates did not substantially change from that in the previous 2 years, multidrug-resistant gram-negative phenotypes were reported from a moderate proportion of facilities.

TI  == artemisia capillaris extracts as a green factory for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles with antibacterial activities.
AB  == we report a green synthesis of silver nanoparticles that uses extracts from the aerial part of artemisia capillaris. both water and 70% ethanol extracts successfully generated silver nanoparticles. the formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance bands, fourier transform-infrared spectra, high resolution-transmission electron and atomic force microscopic images. various shapes of silver nanoparticles were generated with an average diameter of 29.71 nm with water extract and 29.62 nm with 70% ethanol extract. an improvement in antibacterial activity (mic 8.35-16.7 microg/ml) was observed against a total of twenty different strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. a remarkable enhancement (approximately 12-fold) was observed against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, and klebsiella areogenes when compared  with the extract alone. silver nanoparticles produced by the 70% ethanol extract  showed slightly higher antibacterial activity than those generated with the water extract. the correlation between total flavonoid content of each extract and the  antibacterial activity did not exert any significant relationships. this report suggests that plant extracts have the potential to be used as powerful reducing agents for the production of biocompatible silver nanoparticles possessing enhanced antibacterial activities.

TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

AB  == a strain of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bmk2005 isolated from healthy infant faeces has shown a remarkable antibacterial activity against 32 bacterial pathogenic strains of human clinical isolates. among them, 13 strains belonging to species of escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to cefotaxime (ctx) and ceftazidime (caz), and 4 strains of staphylococcus aureus were resistant to methicillin (mrsa). this antibacterial activity was attributed to a bacteriocin designated as paracaseicin a. it was heat-stable up to 120 degrees c for 5 min and active within the ph range of 2-5.  its activity was lost when treated with proteases, which reveals its proteinaceous nature. this bacteriocin was successfully purified only by two steps of reversed phase chromatography. its molecular mass, determined by mass spectrometry analysis, was 2,462.5 da. to our knowledge, the present study is the first report on characterization and purification of a bacteriocin, produced by a l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strain exhibiting an antibacterial activity against various multidrug-resistant species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria,  which reveals its potential for use in prevention or treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant species especially in cases of antibiotics-associated diarrhea (aad).

TI  == complications of port-a-cath(r) in patients with sickle cell disease.
AB  == background: red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease (scd). however, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central venous catheters (cvcs) in adult patients with moderate or severe scd. aims: to review our experience with the use of the port-a-cath((r)) device in sixteen patients with scd undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. methods: among a cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen scd  patients required the insertion of a port-a-cath((r)) device. these patients included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 +/- 2.3; mean +/- sd]. a  total of 24 port-a-cath((r)) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the study period. eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2 devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted. results: out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. the organisms involved were candida spp. (3), c. parapsilosis (2), c. albicans (1), c. famata (1), c. lusitanice (1), staphylococcus spp. (6), and s. aureus (3), as well as the coagulase-negative staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic streptococcus (1), diphtheroid bacilli (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), ps. spp. (3), escherichia coli (3), klebsiella oxytoca (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), klebsiella spp. (1), serratia liquefaciens (1), serratia fanticola (1), achromobacter spp. (2) chromobacterium violaceum (1), delftia acidovirans (1), stenotrophomonas maltophile (1), alcaligenes faecalis (1), and enterobacter cloacae (1). two episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. one case presented with right atrial thrombosis/svc syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm thrombosis. two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports in place at the time of this study. the median working life of the ports was 688.5 days (range: 39-3925). the rate of infective complications was 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly correlated with the number of ports [pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. discussion: our results suggest that patients with scd suffer infective complications associated  with the port-a-cath((r)), which often necessitate its removal. although these devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against gram-negative pathogens  isolated from blood in europe (2004-2009).
AB  == here we report on the antimicrobial resistance amongst gram-negative isolates (excluding acinetobacter spp.) collected from blood culture sources at european study sites as part of the global tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) from the study start in 2004 until august 2009. all isolates were collected and tested for minimum inhibitory concentrations using clinical and laboratory standards institute methodology. over the collection period, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production was recorded in 21.1% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.6% of klebsiella oxytoca and 11.3% of escherichia coli,  primarily in croatia, greece, hungary, italy, poland, romania and the slovak republic. esbl rates stabilised amongst k. pneumoniae over 2006-2009, but doubled amongst e. coli in 2008-2009. the patterns of antimicrobial resistance changed accordingly for both organisms. generally, greece had the highest antimicrobial resistance for k. pneumoniae, italy for e. coli, serratia marcescens and enterobacter spp., and croatia for pseudomonas aeruginosa. high resistance rates  amongst k. pneumoniae were also seen in croatia and italy. imipenem resistance amongst k. pneumoniae was reported exclusively in greece (13.8%); amongst other enterobacteriaceae, imipenem resistance was absent or low. similarly, meropenem resistance was low amongst the enterobacteriaceae except k. pneumoniae from greece (42.6%). across europe, the most active antimicrobial agents against the enterobacteriaceae were tigecycline, amikacin and the carbapenems, each with <10% resistance each year. against the other antimicrobials, significant increases in  non-susceptibility were reported for k. pneumoniae and e. coli, both important causative pathogens of bacteraemia.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative organisms from intraabdominal infections and evolution of isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases in the smart study in spain (2002-2010).
AB  == introduction: the smart (study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends) surveillance study records the antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacilli obtain from intraabdominal infections with special focus in isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). material and methods: the antimicrobial susceptibility of 8,869 isolates was analyzed by microdilution during the smart study performed in spain from 2002 to 2010. isolates were recovered in 16 centres. results: escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen (60.9% from intraabdominal infections acquired in the community and 49.9% in those from nosocomial origin) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.9% vs 9.2%). pseudomonas aeruginosa was more common in intraabdominal infections from nosocomial origin (5.6% community and 8.6% nosocomial). frequency of esbl-producing isolates was: e. coli, 8.7%; k. pneumoniae, 8.4%; klebsiella oxytoca, 1.4%; and proteus mirabilis, 1.6%. overall, esbl-producing isolates were more frequently isolated from elderly patients (6.8% >60 years). ertapenem and meropenem were the most active antimicrobials (susceptibility range with eucast criteria, 89.0-100%) when considering all enterobacteriaceae isolates and also against esbl producers (95.5-100%). susceptibility of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam was lower, particularly among esbl-producing isolates. nevertheless, ertapenem maintained a good activity (susceptibility >95%) in esbl-producers that were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam or fluoroquinolones. conclusions: antimicrobial susceptibility data from the smart-spain study reinforce current therapeutic guidelines of intraabdominal infections that include ertapenem as the empirical choice for treatment. this is also supported by the high frequency of esbl-producers in our geographic area.

TI  == outcomes and genetic relatedness of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae at detroit medical center.
AB  == background: carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) are rapidly emerging in hospitals in the united states and are posing a significant threat. to better understand the transmission dynamics and the acquisition of resistant strains, a  thorough analysis of epidemiologic and molecular characteristics was performed. methods: cre isolated at detroit medical center were analyzed from september 2008 to september 2009. bla(kpc) genes were investigated by polymerase chain reaction  (pcr), and repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr (rep-pcr) was used to determine  genetic similarity among strains. epidemiologic and outcomes analyses were performed. results: ninety-two unique patient cre isolates were recovered. sixty-eight strains (74%) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 were klebsiella oxytoca,  15 were enterobacter species, and 2 were escherichia coli. fifteen isolates (16%) were resistant to colistin, 14 (16%) were resistant to tigecycline, and 2 were resistant to all antimicrobials tested. the mean +/- standard deviation age of patients was 63 +/- 2 years. sixty patients (68%) were admitted to the hospital from long-term care facilities. only 70% of patients received effective antimicrobial therapy when infection was suspected, with a mean time to appropriate therapy of 120 +/- 23 hours following sample culturing. the mean length of hospitalization after sample culturing was 18.6 +/- 2.5 days. of 57 inpatients, 18 (32%) died in the hospital. independent predictors for mortality were intensive care unit stay (odds ratio [or], 15.8; p = .003) and co-colonization with cre and either acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa (or, 17.2; p = .006). among k. pneumoniae cre, rep-pcr revealed 2 genetically related strains that comprised 70% and 20% of isolates, respectively. conclusions: in this large u.s. cohort of patients with cre infection, which reflects the modern continuum of medical care, co-colonization with cre and a. baumannii or p. aeruginosa was associated with increased mortality. two predominant clones of k. pneumoniae accounted for the majority of cases of cre infection.

TI  == bacterial community composition of biological degreasing systems and health risk  assessment for workers.
AB  == biological degreasing system is a new technology based on the degradation capabilities of microorganisms to remove oil, grease, or lubricants from metal parts. no data is available about the potential biological health hazards in such system. thus, a health risk assessment linked to the bacterial populations present in this new degreasing technology is, therefore, necessary for workers. we performed both cultural and molecular approaches in several biological degreasing systems for various industrial contexts to investigate the composition and dynamics of bacterial populations. these biological degreasing systems did not work with the original bacterial populations. indeed, they were colonized by  a defined and restricted group of bacteria. this group replaced the indigenous bacterial populations known for degrading complex substrates. klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pantoea agglomerans were important members of the microflora found in most of the biological degreasing systems. these bacteria might represent a potential health hazard for  workers.

TI  == expression of a clostridium perfringens type iv pilin by neisseria gonorrhoeae mediates adherence to muscle cells.
AB  == clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic, gram-positive bacterium that causes a range of diseases in humans, including lethal gas gangrene. we have recently shown that strains of c. perfringens move across the surface of agar plates by a  unique type iv pilus (tfp)-mediated social motility that had not been previously  described. based on sequence homology to pilins in gram-negative bacteria, c. perfringens appears to have two pilin subunits, pila1 and pila2. structural prediction analysis indicated pila1 is similar to the pseudopilin found in klebsiella oxytoca, while pila2 is more similar to true pilins found in the gram-negative pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa and neisseria gonorrhoeae. strains of n. gonorrhoeae that were genetically deficient in the native pilin, pile, but  supplemented with inducible expression of pila1 and pila2 of c. perfringens were  constructed. genetic competence, wild-type twitching motility, and attachment to  human urogenital epithelial cells were not restored by expression of either pilin. however, attachment to mouse and rat myoblast (muscle) cell lines was observed with the n. gonorrhoeae strain expressing pila2. significantly, wild-type c. perfringens cells adhered to mouse myoblasts under anaerobic conditions, and adherence was 10-fold lower in a pilt mutant that lacked functional tfp. these findings implicate c. perfringens tfp in the ability of c.  perfringens to adhere to and move along muscle fibers in vivo, which may provide  a therapeutic approach to limiting this rapidly spreading and highly lethal infection.

TI  == intra- and inter-species spread of carbapenemase genes in a non-hospitalized patient.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to report intra- and inter-species spread of carbapenemase genes between gram negative rods isolated from a non-hospitalized patient with bacteremia. the approach included chart review, antibiotic susceptibility testing and phenotypic screening for metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)  detection, pcr and sequencing of bla, aac(6')-ib and qnr genes, and plasmid analysis by pcr-based replicon typing. the clonal relationships between the isolates were analysed by comparing pfge profiles. a non-hospitalized patient presented bacteraemia due to wild type enterobacter cloacae (4.08), a vim-1-producing e. cloacae (5.08), a vim-1- and ctx-m-9-producing e. cloacae (7.08), a vim-2-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa, and catheter colonization by vim-1-producing klebsiella oxytoca. the patient had no previous hospitalization but had recently undergone an ambulatory colonoscopy. in e. cloacae 7.08 and k. oxytoca isolates, the bla(vim-1) gene was located on a transferable plasmid of 48.5 kb, while in e. cloacae 5.08 the bla(vim-1) gene was encoded on a 194 kb non-transferable plasmid. the bla(ctx-m-9) gene detected in e. cloacae was encoded on an hi2 plasmid of 290 kb. to date the prevalence of vim-1 enzymes in the community is low. this molecular finding suggests an intra-species and/or inter-species horizontal spread of the mbl gene in the same non-hospitalized patient.

TI  == diarrheagenic escherichia coli in acute gastroenteritis in infants in north-west  italy.
AB  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli may cause diarrhoea in infancy, but it is not routinely detected and regarded as a major causative agent. the aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of enteropathogenic e. coli infection and to investigate its epidemiology and pathogenesis from faecal specimens in infants hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. between march 2008 and june 2009, faecal samples were collected and examined to recognize diarrhoeal aetiology, especially for e. coli, by cultural identification and multiplex-pcr. e. coli were isolated in 75 of 160 collected samples (46,88%); 10 samples of which (6,3%) had been positively recognised for pathogenic genes. data showed that the presence of diarrheagenic e. coli infection was 6.3%, but it becomes 5% considering e. coli as a unique agent responsible for diarrhoea. the datum is not statistically meaningful because of the small sample (p>0,05). bacterial pathogens were also isolated in 60 samples (37,5% of the total collected samples): 15 salmonella spp., 8 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 klebsiella oxytoca, 11 citrobacter freundii, 5 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 serratia spp., 7 enterobacter cloacae, 1 shigella spp., 2 campylobacter spp. rotavirus was the predominant pathogenic single etiologic agent identified. it was found in 35 samples (21.88%  of the overall collected samples), while adenovirus, serotypes 40 or 41, was isolated in 2 samples (1.3%). rotavirus infection was found predominantly in winter with respect to autumn. data provide an interesting epidemiologic survey of enteropathogenic e. coli, which is not usually detected, although it may have  potential clinical implications. abbreviations: cdec, detaching e. coli; daec, diffusely adherent e. coli; eaggec, enteroaggregative e. coli; ehec, enterohaemorrhagic e. coli; eiec, enteroinvasive e. coli; epec, enteropathogenic  e. coli; etec, enterotoxigenic e. coli.

AB  == severe ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) developed in a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome. after tracheostomy, the patient was treated with antibiotic therapy guided by serial surveillance cultures of endotracheal aspirates. according to the result of the culture, the suitable antibiotic targeting the pathogen (e.g., mrsa, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca) that had grown  most predominantly in the culture was used until clinical resolution of vap, leading to avoidance of overusing broad-spectrum antibiotics and ultimately a favorable outcome. during vancomycin (vcm) therapy for mrsa vap, mrsa bacteremia  occurred even though the trough value of vcm was sufficiently high. after the change from vcm to linezolid (lzd), the vap improved promptly, indicating that lzd is superior to vcm in the treatment of mrsa pneumonia.

TI  == marked hydronephrosis and hydroureter after distigmine therapy in an adult male patient with paraplegia due to spinal cord injury: a case report.
AB  == introduction: distigmine, a long-acting anti-cholinesterase, is associated with side effects such as parkinsonism, cholinergic crisis, and rhabdomyolysis. we report a spinal cord injury patient, who developed marked hydronephrosis and hydroureter after distigmine therapy, which led to a series of complications over subsequent years. case presentation: a 38-year-old male developed t-9 paraplegia  in 1989. intravenous urography, performed in 1989, showed normal kidneys, ureters and bladder. he was prescribed distigmine bromide orally and was allowed to pass  urine spontaneously. in 1992, intravenous urography showed bilateral marked hydronephrosis and hydroureter. distigmine was discontinued. he continued to pass urine spontaneously. in 2006, intravenous urography showed moderate dilatation of both pelvicalyceal systems and ureters down to the level of urinary bladder. this patient was performing self-catheterisation only once a day. he was advised to do catheterisations at least three times a day. in december 2008, this patient developed haematuriawhich lasted for nearly four months.. he received trimethoprim, then cephalexin, followed by macrodantin, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. in february 2009, intravenous urography showed calculus at the lower pole of left kidney. both kidneys were moderately hydronephrotic. ureters were dilated down to the bladder. dilute contrast was seen in the bladder due to  residual urine. this patient was advised to perform six catheterisations a day, and take propiverine hydrochloride 15 mg, three times a day. microbiology of urine showed klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis. cystoscopy revealed papillary lesions in bladder neck and trigone. transurethral resection was performed. histology showed marked chronic cystitis including follicular cystitis and papillary/polypoid cystitis. there was no evidence of malignancy. conclusion: distigmine therapy resulted in marked bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter. persistence of hydronephrosis after omitting distigmine, and presence of residual urine in bladder over many years probably predisposed to formation of polypoid cystitis and follicular cystitis, and contributed to prolonged haematuria, which occurred after an episode of urine infection. this case illustrates the dangers of prescribing distigmine to promote spontaneous voiding in spinal cord injury patients. instead of using distigmine,  spinal cord injury patients should be advised to consider intermittent catheterisation together with oxybutynin or propiverine to achieve complete, low-pressure emptying of urinary bladder.

TI  == characterization of corrosive bacterial consortia isolated from petroleum-product-transporting pipelines.
AB  == microbiologically influenced corrosion is a problem commonly encountered in facilities in the oil and gas industries. the present study describes bacterial enumeration and identification in diesel and naphtha pipelines located in the northwest and southwest region in india, using traditional cultivation technique  and 16s rdna gene sequencing. phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna sequences of the  isolates was carried out, and the samples obtained from the diesel and naphtha-transporting pipelines showed the occurrence of 11 bacterial species namely serratia marcescens ace2, bacillus subtilis ar12, bacillus cereus ace4, pseudomonas aeruginosa ai1, klebsiella oxytoca acp, pseudomonas stutzeri ap2, bacillus litoralis an1, bacillus sp., bacillus pumilus ar2, bacillus carboniphilus ar3, and bacillus megaterium ar4. sulfate-reducing bacteria were not detected in samples from both pipelines. the dominant bacterial species identified in the petroleum pipeline samples were b. cereus and s. marcescens in  the diesel and naphtha pipelines, respectively. therefore, several types of bacteria may be involved in biocorrosion arising from natural biofilms that develop in industrial facilities. in addition, localized (pitting) corrosion of the pipeline steel in the presence of the consortia was observed by scanning electron microscopy analysis. the potential role of each species in biofilm formation and steel corrosion is discussed.

TI  == crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  == the problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. these organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the ph of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. in this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary ph above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus elevated the ph of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and  caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the ph of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. the most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. this strategy raises the nucleation ph (ph(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a ph(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. it is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.

TI  == infections in patients with aplastic anemia.
AB  == infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (aa). there  are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with aa and the  patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in  the infections that they incur. prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk  factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. the most common invasive mycoses include the aspergillus species, zygomycetes, candida spp., and fusarium spp. bacterial infections that are seen in patients with aa include gram-positive coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterococcus, staphylococus aureus, clostridium spp., micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus. gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, salmonella, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumonia, aeromonas hydrophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio vulnificus. viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides a, b, and c. evidence of the parasite strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. this review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with aa who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. the specific  immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.

AB  == during the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care  unit (icu) patients in united states hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. mics for 12 different agents were  determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. the 11 organisms most frequently isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), escherichia coli (18.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), serratia marcescens (5.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), proteus mirabilis (4.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and citrobacter freundii (2.0%). specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. e. coli and p. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with acinetobacter spp. rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study  period for most species. ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (acinetobacter spp., c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens) became more susceptible. the prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among icu isolates of acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae.

TI  == binding of mouse mannan-binding lectins to different bacterial pathogens of mice.
AB  == humans have one mannan-binding lectin (mbl) in circulation but rodents, pigs, rabbits and rhesus monkeys have two, mbl-a and mbl-c. plasma forms of these proteins have similar mannan-binding activity in vitro, but might differ in their ability to bind other microbial targets. in these studies, we compared carbohydrate-dependent binding of mouse plasma mbl-a and mbl-c to mannan-sepharose beads and to intact bacteria isolated as pathogens from mice. after incubation of mouse plasma with intact bacteria, mbl-a and mbl-c were eluted with n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) and identified in nonreducing sds-page using western blot analysis and mbl-a or mbl-c specific monoclonal antibodies. glcnac eluates of plasma incubated with mannan-sepharose beads, klebsiella oxytoca and staphylococcus aureus contained similar bands (mainly approximately 50kda) that were immunoreactive with mbl-c antibody. furthermore, a smaller form  of mbl-c (approximately 45kda) was detected bound to pseudomonas aeruginosa. by comparison, immunoreactive mbl-a (a ladder of approximately 175kda and larger bands) was identified in these glcnac eluates from mannan-sepharose beads, s. aureus and k. oxytoca but not p. aeruginosa. these studies demonstrate that mouse mbl-a and mbl-c in plasma are not equivalent in their ability to recognize bacteria that are pathogens for mice.

TI  == detection of equine herpesvirus type 1 using a real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == equid herpesvirus 1 (ehv1) is a major disease of equids worldwide causing considerable losses to the horse industry. a variety of techniques, including pcr have been used to diagnose ehv1. some of these pcrs were used in combination with other techniques such as restriction enzyme analysis (rea) or hybridisation, making them cumbersome for routine diagnostic testing and increasing the chances  of cross-contamination. furthermore, they involve the use of suspected carcinogens such as ethidium bromide and ultraviolet light. in this paper, we describe a real-time pcr, which uses minor groove-binding probe (mgb) technology  for the diagnosis of ehv1. this technique does not require post-pcr manipulations thereby reducing the risk of cross-contamination. most importantly, the technique is specific; it was able to differentiate ehv1 from the closely related member of the alphaherpesvirinae, equid herpesvirus 4 (ehv4). it was not reactive with common opportunistic pathogens such as escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter agglomerans often involved in abortion. similarly, it did not react with equine pathogens such as streptococcus equi, streptococcus equisimilis, streptococcus zooepidemicus, taylorella equigenitalis  and rhodococcus equi, which also cause abortion. the results obtained with this technique agreed with results from published pcr methods. the assay was sensitive enough to detect ehv1 sequences in paraffin-embedded tissues and clinical samples. when compared to virus isolation, the test was more sensitive. this test will be useful for the routine diagnosis of ehv1 based on its specificity, sensitivity, ease of performance and rapidity.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli associated with catheter-associated and non-catheter-associated bloodstream infections and hand carriage by healthcare workers in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  == objective: bloodstream infections caused by gram-negative bacilli are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in infants in neonatal intensive care units. this study describes the species of gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections in two neonatal intensive care units, compares characteristics of catheter-related and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections, and compares species and antibiotic resistance patterns of these organisms with those isolated from the hands of nurses working in the same neonatal intensive care units. design: interventional study. setting: two high-risk neonatal intensive care units. patients: neonates hospitalized for >or  =24 hrs. interventions: prospective surveillance for bloodstream infections was performed in two neonatal intensive care units from march 2001 to january 2003. hand cultures were obtained quarterly from participating nurses immediately after they performed hand hygiene. measurements and main results: there were 298 episodes of bloodstream infections among 2,935 admissions (5.75 episodes per 1,000 patient-days); 77 of 298 (26%) episodes were caused by gram-negative bacilli. among these, 47 (61.0%) were catheter-related bloodstream infections (2.61 episodes per 1,000 catheter-days). eleven and 24 gram-negative bacilli species were isolated from neonates and nurses, respectively. the most common gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections were klebsiella pneumoniae (38.7%), escherichia coli (21.2%), enterobacter cloacae (11.2%), and serratia marcescens (11.2%). in contrast, acinetobacter lwoffi (18.1%), k. pneumoniae (11.7%), e. cloacae (10.6%), k. oxytoca (10.6%), and pseudomonas spp. (7.4%) were most commonly isolated from hands of nurses. e. coli, p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae,  and e. aerogenes were significantly more likely to cause bloodstream infections than to be isolated from nurses' hands (all p < .001). although 39% of bloodstream infections were non-catheter-related, there were no significant differences in types of organisms or antimicrobial resistance patterns between catheter-related bloodstream infections and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections (all p > or = .35). resistance patterns were similar between gram-negative bacilli isolates from neonates and nurses' hands except for a significantly higher proportion of resistance to cefotaxime and gentamicin among  neonatal isolates of k. pneumoniae (p < .05). conclusions: gram-negative bacilli  species isolated from neonatal bloodstream infections and nurses' hands varied significantly. clean hands of providers are an unlikely source of endemic gram-negative bacilli, suggesting that prevention strategies should focus more on control of endogenous neonatal flora or environmental sources.

TI  == clinical effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin on hospital-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == the effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin (cpfx) on hospital-acquired pneumonia was examined. the subjects were 32 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia classified as being in group i, group ii, and group iii, based on the japanese respiratory society guidelines for management of hospital-acquired pneumonia. none of the patients had received antibiotic treatment for the pneumonia. cpfx 300 mg was intravenously infused twice daily for 3-14 days, and its clinical effect, bacterological effect, and side effects were examined. intravenous cpex was clinically effective in 21 of the 32 patients, with an efficacy rate of 65.6%. with regard to bacteriological efficacy, 4 of 5 strains of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 2 of 3 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of streptococcus agalactiae, 1 of 2 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 of 2 strains of serratia marcescens, and the 1 strain of klebsiella oxytoca were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 42.3% (11 of 26 strains whose fate was confirmed eradicated). abnormal laboratory findings (side effects) were observed  in 11 of the 32 patients (34.4%), but all side effects were mild. based on the above data, intravenous cpfx may be the drug which should be recommended as the first choice for hospital-acquired pneumonia.

TI  == rapid, species-specific detection of uropathogen 16s rdna and rrna at ambient temperature by dot-blot hybridization and an electrochemical sensor array.
AB  == development of rapid molecular approaches for pathogen detection is key to improving treatment of infectious diseases. for this study, the kinetics and temperature-dependence of dna probe hybridization to uropathogen species-specific sequences were examined. a set of oligonucleotide probes were designed based on variable regions of the 16s gene of the escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a universal bacterial probe and probes-specific for gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were also included. the oligonucleotide probes discriminated among 16s genes derived from 11 different species of uropathogenic bacteria applied to nylon membranes in a dot-blot format. significant binding of oligonucleotide probes to target dna and  removal of nonspecific binding by membrane washing could both be achieved rapidly, requiring as little as 10 min. an oligonucleotide probe from the same species-specific region of the e. coli 16s gene was used as a capture probe in a  novel electrochemical 16-sensor array based on microfabrication technology. sequence-specific hybridization of target uropathogen 16s rdna was detected through horseradish peroxidase acting as an electrochemical transducer via a second, detector probe. the sensor array demonstrated rapid, species-specific hybridization in a time course consistent with the rapid kinetics of the dot-blot hybridization studies. as in the dot-blot hybridization studies, species-specific detection of bacterial nucleic acids using the sensor array approach was demonstrated both at 65 degrees c and at room temperature. these results demonstrate that molecular hybridization approaches can be adapted to rapid, room temperature conditions ideal for an electrochemical sensor array platform.

TI  == characterization of three new competence-regulated operons in haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae is one of a growing number of bacteria in which the natural ability to uptake exogenous dna for potential genomic transformation has  been recognized. to date, several operons involved in transformation in this organism have been described. these operons are characterized by a conserved 22-bp regulatory element upstream of the first gene and are induced coincident with transfer from rich to nutrient-depleted media. the previously identified operons comprised genes encoding proteins that include members of the type ii secretion system and type iv pili, shown to be essential for transformation in other bacteria, and other proteins previously identified as required for transformation in h. influenzae. in the present study, three novel competence operons were identified by comparative genomics and transcriptional analysis. these operons have been further characterized by construction of null mutants and examination of the resulting transformation phenotypes. the putative protein encoded by the hi0366 gene was shown to be essential for dna uptake, but not binding, and is homologous to a protein shown to be required for pilus biogenesis and twitching motility in pseudomonas aeruginosa. an insertion in hi0939 abolished both dna binding and uptake. the predicted product of this gene shares  characteristics with pulj, a pseudopilin involved in pullulanase export in klebsiella oxytoca.

TI  == [bacterial pathogens, resistance patterns and treatment options in community acquired pediatric urinary tract infection].
AB  == background: epidemiology and resistance patterns of bacterial pathogens in pediatric uti show large interregional variability and rates of bacterial resistances are changing due to different antibiotic treatment. we intended to evaluate data from northern germany. patients and methods: in 100 children (53 female, 47 male, mean age 4.4 +/- 4.2 years) with community acquired uti, who presented in the emergency department of our medical school from 2000 - 2002, urine cultures were performed. inclusion criteria were: acute voiding symptoms, significant bacteriuria with growth of at least 10 (5) colony-forming units/ml urine, leukocyturia > 50/ micro l. exclusion criteria were underlying renal diseases, anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, age < 2 months and recurrent uti. results: patients presented with a mean rectal temperature of 38.6 +/- 1.3 degrees c, mean crp of 66 +/- 68 mg/dl, mean wbc 13 500 +/- 5 600/ micro  l and mean urinary leukocytes of 425 +/- 363/ micro l. in urine cultures e. coli  was found in 47 % of the cases, enterococcus faecalis 23 %, proteus mirabilis 8 %, klebsiella oxytoca 4 %, pseudomonas aeruginosa 5 % and others 13 %. in 76 % one and in 24 % two different bacterial species (60 % enterococcus faecalis) were cultured. mean resistance rates were in all bacteria (in e. coli): ampicillin 53  % (69 %), ampicillin and sulbactam 51 % (61 %), cefalosporin 1 (st) generation (cefaclor) 48 % (24 %), cefalosporin 2 (nd) generation (cefuroxim) 40 % (3 %), cefalosporin 3 (rd) generation (cefuroxim) 33 % (0 %), tobramycin 30 % (2 %), ciprofloxacine 0 %, cotrimoxazole 40 % (42 %), nitrofurantoin 12 % (0 %). conclusion: the resistance rates to ampicillin (+/- sulbactam) did not increase as compared to previous analyses (1990 - 1995), however, resistance rates to cotrimoxazole and 1 (st) generation cefalosporines increased about 20 %. we conclude that the policies for treatment of uti in children should be re-evaluated every 5 years according to local resistance rates.

(b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == type ii protein secretion and its relationship to bacterial type iv pili and archaeal flagella.
AB  == homologues of the protein constituents of the klebsiella pneumoniae (klebsiella oxytoca) type ii secreton (t2s), the pseudomonas aeruginosa type iv pilus/fimbrium biogenesis machinery (t4p) and the methanococcus voltae flagellum  biogenesis machinery (fla) have been identified. known constituents of these systems include (1). a major prepilin (preflagellin), (2). several minor prepilins (preflagellins), (3). a prepilin (preflagellin) peptidase/methylase, (4). an atpase, (5). a multispanning transmembrane (tm) protein, (6). an outer-membrane secretin (lacking in fla) and (7). several functionally uncharacterized envelope proteins. sequence and phylogenetic analyses led to the  conclusion that, although many of the protein constituents are probably homologous, extensive sequence divergence during evolution clouds this homology so that a common ancestry can be established for all three types of systems for only two constituents, the atpase and the tm protein. sequence divergence of the  individual t2s constituents has occurred at characteristic rates, apparently without shuffling of constituents between systems. the same is probably also true for the t4p and fla systems. the family of atpases is much larger than the family of tm proteins, and many atpase homologues function in capacities unrelated to those considered here. many phylogenetic clusters of the atpases probably exhibit uniform function. some of these have a corresponding tm protein homologue although others probably function without one. it is further shown that proteins  that compose the different phylogenetic clusters in both the atpase and the tm protein families exhibit unique structural characteristics that are of probable functional significance. the tm proteins are shown to have arisen by at least two dissimilar intragenic duplication events, one in the bacterial kingdom and one in the archaeal kingdom. the archaeal tm proteins are twice as large as the bacterial tm proteins, suggesting an oligomeric structure for the latter.

TI  == brain abscess caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli: clinical features and therapeutic outcomes.
AB  == thirty-three patients (24 males and nine females) with brain abscesses resulting  from infection by aerobic gram-negative bacilli were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 14 years. of these, 23 cases developed spontaneously, with the remaining ten postneurosurgery. the organisms most frequently involved were klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and proteus species and included some rare pathogens, such as salmonella and enterobacter species, k. oxytoca, vibrio and morganella morganii.  apart from one exception, the locations of the abscess were supratentorial. twenty-four patients presented with a single abscess, while nine revealed multiple abscesses, with 26 treated surgically and seven with antibiotics exclusively. in total, seven patients died, representing an overall mortality rate of 21%. this study demonstrates that brain abscesses associated with neurosurgical procedures are not rare, accounting for 30% of cases in this study, with k. pneumoniae, proteus and enterobacter species the most prevalent of the revealed pathogens. further, proteus species were the most prevalent pathogens demonstrated for cases of both otogenic and polymicrobial infections. if brain abscesses are diagnosed for diabetic patients or have a gas-forming appearance, a diagnosis of k. pneumoniae infection should be considered, with particular attention paid to detection of other metastatic septic abscesses. in light of the high mortality rate, early treatment is essential to maximize the chances of survival.

TI  == bacterial population of a two-phase anaerobic digestion process treating effluent of cassava starch factory.
AB  == different groups of microorganisms in a two-phase anaerobic system were enumerated to evaluate the prevalence of specific groups and species. total and fecal coliforms showed similar values both in acidogenic and methanogenic reactors. the fecal streptococci were 4-fold higher in the acidogenic reactor, when compared with those of the methanogenic reactor. as expected, no methane forming or sulfate reducing bacteria were found in the acidogenic reactor. the populations of methanogenic bacteria were dominated by a mixed population of straight to curved rods and multicellular filaments which strongly resembled members of the genus methanosaeta. seven prevalent species of facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were identified as previdencia alcalifacienciens, providencia rettgeri, enterobacter cloaceae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus pennri and yersinia enterocolitica. the species pseudomonas aeruginosa, stentophomonas maltophila and acinotobacter iwoffi, were the most frequently isolated glucose non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli. among these species, only p. aeruginosa was present in high number in each sample.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems.  thirty-two species 2,697 strains of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of  moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), escherichia coli (n = 250), citrobacter freundii (n = 153), citrobacter koseri (n = 97), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), serratia marcescens (n = 153), proteus mirabillis (n = 103), proteus vulgaris (n = 77), morganella morganii (n = 141), providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii; n = 154), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), pseudomonas putida (n = 49), burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), acinetobactor iwoffii (n = 30), bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola; n = 124). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == [in vitro antimicrobial activity of glutaraldehyde plus o-phenylphenol association (ratio 2:1)].
AB  == background: the correct use of antiseptics, disinfectants and sterilization processes to inactivate or remove micro-organisms is an essential component of an effective infection control program. to reach this result the use of phenolic detergent-disinfectants which work well as a presoak has always been suggested in lieu of sterilization involving submerging instruments in a properly prepared glutaraldehyde solution for about 6 to 10 hrs. this study investigated the in vitro effectiveness of disinfectant solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 1%  o-phenylphenol. methods: the organisms used were purchased from the american type culture collection (escherichia coli atcc 25922, candida albicans atcc 10231, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228), and from our clinical collection (proteus mirabilis ch 14, klebsiella oxytoca ch 22, serratia liquefaciens ch 90). mic and  mbc were evaluated as testing solution for antimicrobial activity. the contact time studied between disinfectant and bacteria were 30 sec, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min. results: the results showed that mic values for most bacteria were 3.75 mg/ml. the mbc values were similar or higher than the mic. the disinfectant solution killed e. coli and c. albicans already after 10 min, but for s. aureus 30 min was necessary. conclusions: this study proved that this solution attained  the sterilization of surgical instruments in good timing and at low cost.

TI  == production of n-acyl homoserine lactones by gram-negative bacteria isolated from  contact lens wearers.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the production of n-acyl-homoserine  lactone (ahl) signal molecules in ocular gram-negative bacteria. a total of 91 ocular strains isolated from contact lens adverse response patients and asymptomatic subjects were used in the study. these included acinetobacter, aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia liquefaciens, serratia marcescens, and  stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the biosensor strains chromobacterium violaceum mutant cv026 and agrobacterium tumefaciens a136 were used for detection of ahl signal molecules. the majority of a. hydrophila, p. aeruginosa, and s. liquefaciens strains produced more than one ahl molecule. serratia marcescens strains were ahl positive only under detection of a136. the rest of the test species did not show any ahl production under the current detection system. these findings indicate that ahl-mediated quorum-sensing systems are present in some of the ocular bacteria, and the different signal molecules may be involved with the  quorum-sensing pathway in the other bacterial species.

TI  == identification and functional characterization of arylamine n-acetyltransferases  in eubacteria: evidence for highly selective acetylation of 5-aminosalicylic acid.
AB  == arylamine n-acetyltransferase activity has been described in various bacterial species. bacterial n-acetyltransferases, including those from bacteria of the gut flora, may be involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, thereby exerting physiopathological effects. we characterized these enzymes further by steady-state kinetics, time-dependent inhibition, and dna hybridization in 40 species, mostly from the human intestinal microflora. we report for the first time n-acetyltransferase activity in 11 species of proteobacteriaceae from seven  genera: citrobacter amalonaticus, citrobacter farmeri, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella ozaenae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, shigella flexneri, plesiomonas shigelloides, and vibrio cholerae. we estimated apparent kinetic parameters and found that 5-aminosalicylic acid, a compound efficient in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, was acetylated with a catalytic efficiency 27 to 645 times higher than that for its isomer, 4-aminosalicylic acid. in contrast, para-aminobenzoic acid, a folate precursor in bacteria, was poorly acetylated. of the wild-type strains studied, pseudomonas aeruginosa was the best acetylator in terms of both  substrate spectrum and catalytic efficiency. dna hybridization with a salmonella  enterica serovar typhimurium-derived probe suggested the presence of this enzyme  in eight proteobacterial and four gram-positive species. molecular aspects together with the kinetic data suggest distinct functional features for this class of microbial enzymes.

AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == identification of a non-haem catalase in salmonella and its regulation by rpos (sigmas).
AB  == we report the identification and functional analysis of katn, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. katn, which is not present in escherichia coli, is located between the ycigfe and ycid e. coli homologues in the salmonella genome. its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 da and is similar to the mn-catalases of lactobacillus plantarum and thermus spp. its product, katn, was visualized as a 37 kda protein  in e. coli maxicells. a katn recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its c-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed  on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. katn was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. its expression was shown to be  regulated by growth phase and rpos. northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream ycigfe genes. a putative rpos-regulated promoter was identified upstream of ycig. southern blotting revealed that katn is conserved within salmonella serovars. katn homologues were found in pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. a katn mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) response of salmonella. however, the expression of katn increased the h2o2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpos mutants in stationary phase. thus, katn may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in salmonella in certain environmental conditions.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == rna sequence requirements for nasr-mediated, nitrate-responsive transcription antitermination of the klebsiella oxytoca m5al nasf operon leader.
AB  == in klebsiella oxytoca, enzymes required for nitrate assimilation are encoded by the nasfedcba operon. nitrate and nitrite induction of nasf operon expression is  determined by a transcriptional antitermination mechanism, in which the nasr gene product responds to nitrate or nitrite and overcomes transcription termination at the factor-independent terminator site located in the nasf upstream leader region. previous studies led to the hypothesis that the nasr protein mediates transcription antitermination through interaction with nasf leader rna. here, we  report a dna sequence comparison that reveals conserved 1:2 and 3:4 rna secondary structures in the nasf leader rnas from two klebsiella species. additionally, we  found that specific binding of the nasr protein to nasf leader rna was stimulated by nitrate and nitrite. we combined mutational analysis, in vivo and in vitro antitermination assays, and an rna electrophoretic mobility shift assay to define regions in the nasf leader that are essential for antitermination and for nasr-rna interaction. formation of the 1:2 stem structure and the specific sequence of the 1:2 hexanucleotide loop were required for both nitrate induction  and for nasr-rna interaction. mutations in the 1:2 stem-loop region that abolished nitrate induction also interfered with nasr-leader rna interaction. finally, nucleotide alterations or additions in the linker region between the 1:2 and 3:4 stem-loops were deleterious to nasf operon induction but not to nasr-leader rna interaction. we hypothesize that nasr protein recognizes the 1:2  stem-loop structure in the nasf leader rna to mediate transcription antitermination in response to nitrate or nitrite.

TI  == susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the nccls disc diffusion technique. isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (icus (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from june 1995 to march 1996. the levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. a total of 310 gram-positive and 580 gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for enterococcus spp. (38 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (13), streptococcus pneumoniae (65), acinetobacter spp. (11), citrobacter diversus (6), citrobacter freundii (17), klebsiella oxytoca (39), morganella morganii (16), proteus mirabilis (20), proteus vulgaris (23), serratia spp. (19), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and haemophilus influenzae (41). the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for staphylococcus aureus (95  strains, including 2% mrsa) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, escherichia coli (111) 97%, klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. in conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in switzerland are susceptible. the susceptibility of enterococcus spp. and s. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. this compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of gram-positive infections.

TI  == characterization of sfo-1, a plasmid-mediated inducible class a beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae 8009 produced an inducible class a beta-lactamase which hydrolyzed cefotaxime efficiently. it also hydrolyzed other beta-lactams except cephamycins and carbapenems. the activity was inhibited by clavulanic acid and imipenem. the bla gene was transferable to escherichia coli by electroporation of plasmid dna. the molecular mass of the beta-lactamase was 29 kda and its pi was 7.3. all of these phenotypic characteristics of the enzyme except for inducible production resemble those of some extended-spectrum class a beta-lactamases like  fec-1. the gene encoding this beta-lactamase was cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequence of the beta-lactamase was homologous to the ampa sequences of the serratia fonticola chromosomal enzyme (96%), men-1 (78%), klebsiella oxytoca chromosomal enzymes (77%), toho-1 (75%), and fec-1 (72%). the  conserved sequences of class a beta-lactamases, including the s-x(t)-x(s)-k motif, in the active site were all conserved in this enzyme. on the basis of the  high degree of homology to the beta-lactamase of s. fonticola, the enzyme was named sfo-1. the ampr gene was located upstream of the ampa gene, and the ampr sequence of sfo-1 had homology with the ampr sequences of the chromosomal beta-lactamases from citrobacter diversus (80%), proteus vulgaris (68%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (60%). sfo-1 was also inducible in e. coli. however, a transformant harboring plasmid without intact ampr produced a small amount of beta-lactamase constitutively, suggesting that ampr works as an activator of ampa of sfo-1. this is the first report from japan describing an inducible plasmid-mediated class a beta-lactamase in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == a comparison of skin storage methods for oculoplastic surgery.
AB  == purpose: to assess the level of contamination of full-thickness skin grafts stored with or without an antibiotic cover. methods: full-thickness skin grafts were harvested from 40 bilateral upper lid blepharoplasties. before surgery the face was sterilised, the head of the patient was packed with sterile, single-use  surgical drapes and the whole face was left exposed. the harvested full-thickness skin grafts were conserved in sterile containers at 4 degrees c for 6 days, rolled in gauze moistened with either 4 ml of sterile saline solution (group i) or with 4 ml of gentamicin solution (2 mg/ml) (group ii). the degree of contamination, expressed in colony forming units (cfu), was evaluated on days 2,  3, 4, 5 and 6. identification of the microorganisms was done to species level following standard procedures and commercial methods. results: in group i 2 grafts (5%) were negative during the whole observation period while the other 38  grafts (95%) presented a degree of contamination ranging from 10(2) to 10(4) cfu. microorganisms isolated were: staphylococcus epidermidis (24 cases), staphylococcus aureus (5 cases), staphylococcus saprophyticus (2 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4 cases), serratia liquefaciens (1 case) and klebsiella oxytoca (2 cases). in group ii, 26 grafts (65%) were negative during the whole observation time while in 14 cases (35%) a few colonies (3 to 6) of candida albicans were isolated on day 2 and remained constant in number for the whole observation time. conclusions: the storage of full-thickness skin graft with an antibiotic cover is more reliable than the storage of full-thickness skin graft without an antibiotic cover.

TI  == total nutrient admixtures appear safer than lipid emulsion alone as regards microbial contamination: growth properties of microbial pathogens at room temperature.
AB  == background: the extraordinary growth properties of most microorganisms in 10% and 20% lipid emulsions has led to the centers for disease control and prevention recommendation that if lipids are given through an i.v. line, the administration  set should be replaced every 24 hours rather than the usual 72-hour interval used for crystalloid solutions, including those used for conventional total parenteral nutrition. for nearly 15 years, parenteral alimentation has been given as a total nutrient admixture (tna), with the glucose, amino acids, and lipid mixed within the same bag and infused continuously over 24 hours. methods: we prospectively studied in a representative tna (17.6% glucose, 5% amino acids, 4% lipid; ph 5.6, osmolality 1778) and in a control solution, 5% dextrose-in-water (d5%/w), the growth properties at 4, 25, and 35 degrees c of three isolates each of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, flavobacterium spp, and candida albicans, and two isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus, the species that are most likely to contaminate tna during preparation or administration and that have been implicated in >95% of all outbreaks and sporadic cases of nosocomial bloodstream infections traced to contaminated parenteral admixtures reported in the world literature. results: growth in tna at 25 and 35 degrees c occurred with only two species, c. albicans  and s. saprophyticus, and only after 24 to 48 hours; d5%/w allowed growth at 25 degrees c of two gram-negative species, s. marcescens and b. cepacia. conclusions: we conclude that tna is a poor growth medium for most nosocomial pathogens and is no better than d5%/w. the need to replace administration sets every 24 hours with tna should be reconsidered and ideally be studied in a prospective randomized trial.

TI  == reconstituted recombinant factor viii can be safely infused continuously for at least three days: it is a poor microbial growth medium.
AB  == reconstituted recombinant factor viii (fviiirec) loses little biologic activity at room temperature for up to seven days and continuous infusion is convenient, effective hemostatically and requires less fviiirec concentrate than treatment by conventional bolus injections. however, the potential for bacterial contamination, with proliferation to high levels that can cause bacteremia, is a  concern with continuous infusion. we studied the growth properties at 4, 25 and 35 degrees c in reconstituted fviiirec (kogenate) and at 25 degrees c in 5% dextrose in water (d5%w) of three isolates each of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, flavobacterium spp. and candida albicans, species most likely to contaminate infusate during preparation or administration and which have been implicated in more than 95% of all outbreaks and sporadic cases of nosocomial bloodstream infection traced to contaminated admixtures, biologic agents or medications administered parenterally. reconstituted fviiirec allowed growth of only three species at 25 degrees c and 35 degrees c: s. marcescens, s. maltophilia and p. aeruginosa; logarithmic growth appeared only after 24-48 h. d5%w allowed growth of two gram-negative species, s. marcescens and b. cepacia. we conclude that reconstituted fviiirec (kogenate) is  a poor growth medium for most nosocomial pathogens, comparable with d5%w. if reconstituted aseptically, continuous infusion of reconstituted fviiirec should be safe, and it should not be necessary to replace the container or tubing more frequently than every 3 days, an administration schedule that can provide effective hemostasis at lower cost.

TI  == macromolecular assembly and secretion across the bacterial cell envelope: type ii protein secretion systems.
AB  == a decade ago, pugsley and colleagues reported the existence of a large region of  klebsiella dna, distinct from the klebsiella gene encoding pullulanase, which was necessary for secretion of this enzyme to the cell surface in escherichia coli (d'enfert et al., 1987a,b). the pul genes it contained proved to be the tip of an iceberg. the sequences reported before 1992 (d'enfert et al., 1987a,b; d'enfert & pugsley, 1989; pugsley & reyss, 1990; reyss & pugsley, 1990) included only one gene (puld) that matched any sequence in the data base; a 220 amino acid residue  segment of puld was 32% identical with a portion of the filamentous phage-encoded protein, piv. but by the time the sequence of the 18.8 kb dna fragment that contained the pul genes had been completed (possot et al., 1992), reports of sets of homologous genes in several species of gram-negative plant and animal pathogens had appeared. for the most part, these gene clusters were cloned by their ability to complement mutants that produced, but failed to secrete, proteins normally found in the extracellular milieu; when tested, the mutants showed reduced pathogenicity or were totally avirulent. the secreted proteins included hydrolytic enzymes such as cellulase and pectinase from plant pathogens, and proteases and toxins from animal pathogens. the multi-gene family necessary for secretion of these enzymes is now known as the type ii system or the main terminal branch (mtb) of the general secretion pathway (gsp). as summarized by pugsley et al. (1997), the current tally includes type ii systems from klebsiella oxytoca (pul), erwinia chrysanthemi and carotovora (out), xanthomonas campestris  (xps), pseudomonas aeruginosa (xcp), aeromonas hydrophila (exe), and vibrio cholerae (eps). a second type ii system (sps) necessary for deposition of the s-layer on the cell surface in a. hydrophila is more similar to the x. campestris than a. hydrophila genes (thomas & trust, 1995). the biggest surprise has been the discovery of a complete set of type ii secretion genes in e. coli k12. the e. coli genes are not expressed under normal growth conditions, and a search is underway to find inducing conditions and secretion substrates (francetic & pugsley, 1996). impressive progress has already been made in defining components  of the pathway. what remains to be understood in mechanistic detail is how this protein secretion system functions.

TI  == a second prepilin peptidase gene in escherichia coli k-12.
AB  == escherichia coli k-12 strains grown at 37 degrees c or 42 degrees c, but not at 30 degrees c, process the precursors of the neisseria gonorrhoeae type iv pilin pile and the klebsiella oxytoca type iv pseudopilin pulg in a manner reminiscent  of the prepilin peptidase-dependent processing of these proteins that occurs in these bacteria. processing of prepulg in escherichia coli requires a glycine at position -1, as does processing by the cognate prepilin peptidase (pulo), and is  unaffected by mutations that inactivate several non-specific proteases. these data suggested that e. coli k-12 has a functional prepilin peptidase, despite the fact that it does not itself appear to express either type iv pilin or pseudopilin genes under the conditions that allow prepile and prepulg processing. the e. coli k-12 genome contains two genes encoding proteins with significant sequence similarity to prepilin peptidases: gspo at minute 74.5 and pppa (f310c)  at minute 67 on the genetic map. we have previously obtained evidence that gspo encodes an active enzyme but is not transcribed. pppa was cloned and shown to code for a functional prepilin peptidase capable of processing typical prepilin peptidase substrates. inactivation of pppa eliminated the endogenous, thermoinducible prepilin peptidase activity. pppa was able to replace pulo prepilin peptidase in a pullulanase secretion system reconstituted in e. coli when expressed from high-copy-number plasmids but not when present in a single chromosomal copy. the analysis of pppa-lacz fusions indicated that pppa expression was very low and regulated by the growth temperature at the level of translation, in agreement with the observed temperature dependence of pppa activity. polymerase chain reaction and southern hybridization analyses revealed  the presence of the pppa gene in 12 out of 15 e. coli isolates.

TI  == characterization of the pena and penr genes of burkholderia cepacia 249 which encode the chromosomal class a penicillinase and its lysr-type transcriptional regulator.
AB  == burkholderia cepacia is recognized as an important pathogen in the lung infections of patients with cystic fibrosis. an inducible beta-lactamase activity has been associated with increased resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of b. cepacia. in this study, we report the revised sequence of the pena gene, which encodes the inducible penicillinase of b. cepacia, and show  that it belongs to the molecular class a beta-lactamases and exhibits a high degree of similarity to the chromosomal beta-lactamase of klebsiella oxytoca. analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the dna region directly upstream of the pena coding sequence revealed an open reading frame (penr), the transcription of  which was oriented opposite to that of pena and whose initiation was 130 bp away  from that of pena. two potential ribosome-binding sites and two overlapping -10 and -35 promoter sequences were identified in the intercistronic region. the predicted translation product of penr was a polypeptide of 301 amino acids with an estimated molecular size of 33.2 kda. the deduced polypeptide of penr showed a high degree of similarity with ampr-like transcriptional activators of class a and c beta-lactamases, with identities of 59 and 58.7% with pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 ampr and proteus vulgaris b317 cumr, respectively. the n-terminal portion of b. cepacia penr was predicted to include a helix-turn-helix motif, which may bind the lysr motif identified in the intercistronic region. induction  of pena by imipenem was shown to be dependent upon the presence of penr. expression of the cloned b. cepacia pena and penr genes in escherichia coli sno302 (ampd) resulted in a high basal and hyperinducible pena activity. these results suggest that the regulation of the pena penicillinase of b. cepacia 249 is similar to that observed in other class a and class c beta-lactamases that are under the control of a divergently transcribed ampr-like regulator.

TI  == characteristics of alcohol dehydrogenases of certain aerobic bacteria representing human colonic flora.
AB  == we have recently proposed the existence of a bacteriocolonic pathway for ethanol  oxidation [i.e., ethanol is oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenases (adhs) of intestinal bacteria resulting in high intracolonic levels of reactive and toxic acetaldehyde]. the aim of this in vitro study was to characterize further adh activity of some aerobic bacteria, representing the normal human colonic flora. these bacteria were earlier shown to possess high cytosolic adh activities (escherichia coli ih 133369, klebsiella pneumoniae ih 35385, klebsiella oxytoca ih 35339, pseudomonas aeruginosa ih 35342, and hafnia alvei ih 53227). adhs of the tested bacteria strongly preferred nad as a cofactor. marked adh activities were found in all bacteria, even at low ethanol concentrations (1.5 mm) that may  occur in the colon due to bacterial fermentation. the km for ethanol varied from  29.9 mm for k. pneumoniae to 0.06 mm for hafnia alvei. the inhibition of adh by 4-methylpyrazole was found to be of the competitive type in 4 of 5 bacteria, and  ki varied from 18.26 +/- 3.3 mm for escherichia coli to 0.47 +/- 0.13 mm for k. pneumoniae. at ph 7.4, adh activity was significantly lower than at ph 9.6 in four bacterial strains. adh of k. oxytoca, however, showed almost equal activities at neutral ph and at 9.6. in conclusion, nad-linked alcohol dehydrogenases of aerobic colonic bacteria possess low apparent km's for ethanol. accordingly, they may oxidize moderate amounts of ethanol ingested during social  drinking with nearly maximal velocity. this may result in the marked production of intracolonic acetaldehyde. kinetic characteristics of the bacterial enzymes may enable some of them to produce acetaldehyde even from endogenous ethanol formed by other bacteria via alcoholic fermentation. the microbial adhs were inhibited by 4-methylpyrazole by the same competitive inhibition as hepatic adh,  however, with nearly 1000 times lower susceptibility. individual variations in human colonic flora may thus contribute to the risk of alcohol-related gastrointestinal morbidity, such as diarrhea, colon polyps and cancer, and liver  injury.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of aerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated from severe infections in 1992: results of a french multicenter study. groupe d'etude d'infections a bacilles a gram negatif (geign)].
AB  == objectives: antibiotic susceptibility of 649 gram-negative bacilli involved in severe infections and isolated in 18 teaching hospitals from january to december  1992 was evaluated. methods: minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution method for piperacillin, piperacillin+ tazobactam and imipenem, and by a microdilution method for 11 other antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin, ciprofloxacin,  fosfomycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin). criteria of comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie were followed for interpretation. betalactamases were identified by isoelectric focusing and overproduction of cephalosporinase was defined by the resistance phenotype. the main species isolated were escherichia coli (45%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8%), salmonella spp. (7.5%), enterobacter cloacae (4%) and klebsiella oxytoca (4%). most of the strains were isolated from blood culture (72.3%), respiratory tract (11.4%) and intraabdominal infections (8.6%). most of  the enterobacteria isolates were susceptible to imipenem, aztreonam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin (percentages of susceptibility were respectively 99.3, 98, 98.3 and 96.3); in most of cases clavulanic acid did not entirely restore sensitivity to amoxicillin of penicillinase-producing strains. among 89 p. aeruginosa strains, 82% were susceptible to imipenem and ceftazidime, 81% to the association piperacillin + tazobactam and 51% to ticarcillin. resistance rates are very high  for acinetobacter baumannii except for imipenem. conclusion: production of tem-type penicillinase and over-production of the chromosomal cephalosporinase are the most widely observed mechanisms of resistance (respectively 22% and 9% of 649 strains). prevalence of extended spectrum betalactamases was low (1%) and essentially observed for k. pneumoniae.

TI  == in vitro alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated acetaldehyde production by aerobic bacteria representing the normal colonic flora in man.
AB  == excessive ethanol consumption has been related with the development of liver cirrhosis, as well as with rapid intestinal transit time and diarrhea. moreover,  heavy drinking is associated with an increased incidence of cancer of the oropharynx, larynx, esophagus, and colorectum. acetaldehyde of microbial origin has recently been suggested as a possible pathogenic factor behind this alcohol-associated gastrointestinal morbidity. the present in vitro study was aimed to investigate alcohol dehydrogenase activity and acetaldehyde formation capacity of some major aerobic bacteria representing the normal colonic flora in  man. cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase activity and cytosolic protein concentration were determined spectrophotometrically. alcohol dehydrogenase activity was then calculated as nmoles of reduced substrate produced by milligrams of protein per minute. the ability of different bacteria to produce acetaldehyde was determined  by incubating the intact bacterial suspension in closed vials containing ethanol  (final concentration 22 mm) for 1 hr at 37 degrees c. the acetaldehyde formed during the incubation was analyzed by headspace gas chromatography. marked differences in the alcohol dehydrogenase activity and acetaldehyde forming capacity were found among the strains tested. the alcohol dehydrogenase activity  varied from 606 +/- 91 nmol/min/mg protein (escherichia coli ih 50546) to 1 +/- 0.2 nmol/min/mg protein (e. coli ih 50817), and acetaldehyde formation varied from 1,717 +/- 2 nmol acetaldehyde/10(9) colony-forming units (klebsiella oxytoca ih 35403) to 5 +/- 2 nmol acetaldehyde/10(9) colony-forming units (pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853). there was a statistically significant correlation (r = 0.77; p < 0.001) between alcohol dehydrogenase activity and acetaldehyde production from ethanol, strongly suggesting the catalytic role of bacterial alcohol dehydrogenase in this reaction.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of lb10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml  was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.

TI  == the cryptic general secretory pathway (gsp) operon of escherichia coli k-12 encodes functional proteins.
AB  == systematic sequencing of the escherichia coli k-12 chromosome (genbank entry u18997) has revealed the presence of an apparently complete operon of genes (the  gspc-0 operon) similar to genes coding for components of the main terminal branch of the general secretory pathway (e.g., the klebsiella oxytoca pulc-0 pullulanase secretion operon) and to related genes required for type iv pilus biogenesis. for example, the last gene in the gsp operon, gspo (formerly hopd), encodes a protein which is similar to several type iv prepilin peptidases. expression of gspo from  laczp promotes cleavage of two known prepilin peptidase substrates in e. coli k-12: neisseria gonorrhoeae type iv prepilin and k. oxytoca prepulg protein. gspo also complements a mutation in the corresponding gene (pulo) of the pullulanase secretion operon when it is expressed from laczp. another gene in the gsp operon, gspg (formerly hopg), encodes a protein similar to prepulg, a component of the pullulanase secretion pathway. expression of gspg from laczp leads to production  of a protein which (i) is recognized by pulg-specific antiserum (and by antiserum against the pseudomonas aeruginosa pulg homolog xcpg [formerly xcpt]), (ii) is processed in cells expressing gspo, and (iii) restores secretion in cells carrying a pulg mutation. the chromosomal copies of gspg and gspo are apparently  not expressed, probably because of very weak transcription from the upstream region, as measured by using a chromosomal gspc-lacz operon fusion. thus, the gsp operon of e. coli k-12 includes at least two functional genes which, together with the rest of the operon, are probably not expressed under laboratory conditions.

TI  == gram-negative bacteremia in open-heart-surgery patients traced to probable tap-water contamination of pressure-monitoring equipment.
AB  == objective: to determine the cause(s) of an outbreak of gram-negative bacteremia (gnb) in open-heart-surgery (ohs) patients at hospital a. design: case-control and cohort studies and an environmental survey. results: nine patients developed  gnb with enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (3), serratia marcescens (2), or klebsiella oxytoca (1) following ohs; five of nine patients had polymicrobial bacteremia. when the gnb patients were compared with randomly selected ohs patients, having had the first procedure of the day (8 of 9 versus 12 of 27, p = .02), longer cardiopulmonary bypass (median, 122 versus 83 minutes, p = .01) or cross-clamp times (median, 75 versus 42 minutes, p = .008), intraoperative dopamine infusion (9 of 9 versus 15 of 27, p = .01), or exposure to scrub nurse 6 (6 of 9 versus 4 of 27, p = .001) were identified as risk factors. when stratified by length of the procedure, only being the first procedure of the day and exposure to scrub nurse 6 remained significant. first procedures used pressure-monitoring equipment that was assembled before surgery and left open and uncovered overnight in the operating room, whereas other procedures used pressure-monitoring equipment assembled immediately before the procedure. at night, operating rooms were cleaned by maintenance personnel who used a disinfectant-water solution sprayed through a hose connected to an automatic diluting system. observation of the use of this hose documented that this solution could have contacted and entered uncovered pressure-monitoring equipment left in the operating room. water samples from the  hose revealed no disinfectant, but grew p aeruginosa. the outbreak was terminated by setting up pressure-monitoring equipment immediately before the procedure and  discontinuing use of the hose-disinfectant system. conclusions: this outbreak most likely resulted from contamination of uncovered preassembled pressure-monitoring equipment by water from a malfunctioning spray disinfectant device. pressure-monitoring equipment should be assembled immediately before use  and protected from possible environmental contamination.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of cefepime against clinically isolated strains].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefepime (cfpm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cfpm and other drugs were determined against  clinical isolates that were obtained in 1994. 1. cfpm showed a wide antibacterial spectrum against staphylococcus spp. and glucose non-fermentative gram-negative rods ((g)nf-gnr). antimicrobial activities of cfpm against staphylococcus spp. were stronger than those of ceftazidime (caz) and somewhat stronger than those of cefotaxime (ctx), and antimicrobial activity of cfpm against pseudomonas aeruginosa was same as that of caz. 2. antimicrobial activities of cfpm against almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of caz and ctx. and cfpm showed strong antimicrobial activities against caz-resistant escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter spp. 3. antimicrobial activities of cfpm were weaker than those of caz against some of strains of klebsiella oxytoca, beta-lactamase high producing strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis and than those of ctx against beta-lactamase high producing strains of prevotella spp. 4. the feature of new cephems was demonstrated in that cfpm had wider antibacterial spectrum than cephems of previous genenations against staphylococcus spp. and (g)nf-gnr and cfpm showed strong antimicrobial activities against almost all of oxacephem-resistant enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == a comparative study of the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux api20e and api20ne identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

TI  == the danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  == two strains-s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. after application in the surgery ward, two enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. the resistant bacteria, b. cereus and 4 strains of ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. in hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. only one of them was s. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. most of them were isolated from the floor, but  also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. the most dangerous were three gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. they were isolated from the floor (enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (proteus mirabilis) and from the container  with oral mixture in infant ward (ps. malthophilia). many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), citrobacter freundi, ps. aeruginosa, ps. cepacia (2 strains), ps. maltophilia (2  strains) and moraxella. many resistant strains were also present on the walls (e. coli, ps. mirabilis, ps. cepacia, alcaligens, acinetobacter). the resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. klebsiella oxytoca and ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. acinetobacter and pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.

TI  == a plasmid-encoded prepilin peptidase gene from enteropathogenic escherichia coli.
AB  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli, a leading agent of infantile diarrhea worldwide, adheres to tissue culture cells in a pattern called "localized adherence." localized adherence is associated with bundle-forming pili encoded by the plasmid bfpa gene, the product of which is homologous with the major structural subunit proteins of type iv fimbriae in other bacteria. several of these proteins have been shown to be processed from a precursor by a specific prepilin peptidase. we cloned restriction fragments downstream of the bfpa gene into an e. coli-pseudomonas aeruginosa shuttle vector and mobilized them into a p. aeruginosa prepilin peptidase (pild) mutant. a plasmid containing a 1.3-kb psti-bamhi fragment was able to complement the pild mutation, as demonstrated by  restoration of sensitivity to the pilus-specific bacteriophage po4. the dna sequence of this fragment revealed an open reading frame, designated bfpp, the predicted product of which is homologous to other prepilin peptidases, including  tcpj of vibrio cholerae (30% identical amino acids), pulo of klebsiella oxytoca (29%), and pild of p. aeruginosa (28%). a bfpa::tnphoa mutant complemented with a bfpa-containing dna fragment only partially processes the bfpa protein. when complemented with a larger fragment containing bfpp as well as bfpa, the mutant expresses the fully processed bfpa protein. p. aeruginosa pak, but not a pild mutant of pak, expresses mature bfpa protein when the bfpa gene is mobilized into this strain. thus, as in other type iv fimbria systems, enteropathogenic e. coli  utilizes a specific prepilin peptidase to process the major subunit of the bundle-forming pilus. this prepilin petidase contains sequence and reciprocal functional homologies with the pild protein of p. aeruginosa.

TI  == xcp-mediated protein secretion in pseudomonas aeruginosa: identification of two additional genes and evidence for regulation of xcp gene expression.
AB  == in pseudomonas aeruginosa, several exoproteins synthesized with a signal sequence (elastase, lipase, phospholipases, alkaline phosphatase and exotoxin a) are secreted by a two-step mechanism. they first cross the inner membrane in a signal sequence-dependent way, and are further translocated across the outer membrane in a second step requiring secretion functions encoded by several xcp genes. ten xcp genes have already been characterized (bally et al., 1992a). in this study, two additional xcp genes, xcpp and xcpq, are described. they are located in the 40 min region of the chromosome where they probably define an operon, divergent from the xcpr-z operon previously characterized in this region. these two genes encode two proteins, xcpp and xcpq, similar to pulc and puld of the pul system of klebsiella oxytoca. moreover, the two divergent operons share a common regulation which is growth-phase dependent.

TI  == characterization of pilq, a new gene required for the biogenesis of type 4 fimbriae in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == type 4 fimbriae are produced by a variety of pathogens, in which they appear to function in adhesion to epithelial cells, and in a form of surface translocation  called twitching motility. using transposon mutagenesis of pseudomonas aeruginosa, we have identified a new locus required for fimbrial assembly. this locus contains the gene pilq which encodes a 77 kda protein with an n-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence characteristic of secretory proteins. pilq mutants lack the spreading colony morphology characteristic of twitching motility, are devoid of fimbriae, and are resistant to the fimbrial-specific bacteriophage po4. the pilq gene was mapped to spel fragment 2, which is located at 0-5 minutes on the p. aeruginosa pao1 chromosome, and thus it is not closely linked to the previously characterized pila-d, pils,r or pilt genes. the pilq region also contains pona, arok and arob-like genes in an organization very similar to that of corresponding genes in escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae. the predicted amino acid sequence of pilq shows homology to the puld protein of klebsiella oxytoca and related outer membrane proteins which have been found in association with diverse functions in other species including protein secretion,  dna uptake and assembly of filamentous phage. pilq had the highest overall homology to an outer membrane antigen from neisseria gonorrhoeae, encoded by omc, that may fulfil the same role in type 4 fimbrial assembly in this species.

TI  == processing and methylation of puig, a pilin-like component of the general secretory pathway of klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == the signal sequence of the klebsiella oxytoca puig gene product, which is required for extracellular secretion of the enzyme pullulanase, is similar in many respects to the corresponding segment of the precursors of type iv (me-phe)  pilins. the significance of this similarity is confirmed by the observation that  the puio gene product processes prepuig at the consensus type iv prepilin peptidase cleavage site at the amino-terminal end of the puig signal sequence. like most type iv pilins, processed puig was found to have a methylated amino-terminal phenylalanine residue. site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace amino acids in prepuig that correspond to residues shown by others to be  essential for processing, methylation and assembly of type iv pilins. the glycine residue on the amino-terminal side of the prepuig cleavage site is absolutely required for processing and for pullulanase secretion. the glutamate residue at position 11(+5) is also required for pullulanase secretion but not for processing or methylation. this result contrasts with that reported for corresponding variants of pseudomonas aeruginosa type iv prepilin, which were processed but only inefficiently n-methylated. cleavage of prepuig and pullulanase secretion were both unaffected by replacement of the phenylalanine residue on the carboxy-terminal side of the cleavage site by leucine, isoleucine or valine, by a conservative substitution within the hydrophobic core of the prepuig signal sequence, or by a glutamine to proline substitution within the processed segment. however, replacement of the same glutamine residue by arginine abolished secretion without affecting either processing or methylation.

AB  == the chemical mutagen ethylmethanesulphonate (ems) has been used to generate mutants of erwinia carotovora subspecies carotovora which are defective in the secretion of pectinases (pel) and cellulases (cel) but unaltered for protease (prt) secretion. such mutants, called out-, still synthesize pel and cel but these enzymes accumulate within the periplasm. cosmid clones carrying wild-type e. carotovora ssp. carotovora dna, identified by their ability to restore the out+ phenotype when transferred to some out- mutants, were classified into six complementation groups using cosmids and cosmid derivatives. analysis of the nucleotide sequence of a 12.7 kb dna fragment, encompassing complementing cosmid  inserts, revealed a coding capacity for 13 potential open reading frames (orfs),  and these were designated outc-outo. some of the out gene products were visualized using a t7 gene 10 expression system. the predicted out proteins are highly similar to components of extracellular enzyme secretion systems from a diverse range of eubacteria including erwinia chrysanthemi, klebsiella oxytoca, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa and xanthomonas campestris. lower levels of similarity exist between ecc out proteins and components of macromolecular trafficking systems from bacillus subtilis, haemophilus influenzae, agrobacterium tumefaciens, yersinia pestis and a protein involved in  the morphogenesis of filamentous bacteriophages such as m13.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new  quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it  maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.

TI  == pulo, a component of the pullulanase secretion pathway of klebsiella oxytoca, correctly and efficiently processes gonococcal type iv prepilin in escherichia coli.
AB  == the pulo protein required for extracellular secretion of pullulanase by klebsiella oxytoca is known to be highly homologous to two type iv prepilin peptidases, namely xcpa(pild) (pseudomonas aeruginosa) and tcpj (vibrio cholerae). the predicted prepilin peptidase activity of pulo was confirmed by showing that it could correctly process the product of the cloned pile.1 type iv  pilin structural gene from neisseria gonorrhoeae in escherichia coli. the p. aeruginosa prepilin peptidase and another putative prepilin peptidase, comc from  bacillus subtilis, also processed prepile. subcellular fractionation showed that  the pile gene product that had been processed by pulo remained associated with the cytoplasmic membrane, as did the unprocessed precursor. pulo was also shown to process three of the four prepile-phoa hybrids tested. southern hybridization  experiments suggest that a pulo homologue is present in the n. gonorrhoeae chromosome.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or  equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter  cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than  16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but  it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.

TI  == an enzyme with type iv prepilin peptidase activity is required to process components of the general extracellular protein secretion pathway of klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == the last gene (pulo) of the pulc-o pullulanase secretion gene operon of klebsiella oxytoca codes for a protein that is 52% identical to the product of the pild/xcpa gene required for extracellular protein secretion and type iv pilus biogenesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa. the pild/xcpa protein is known to remove the first six amino acids of the signal sequence of the type iv pilin precursor by cleaving after the glycine residue in the conserved sequence gf(m)xxxe (where  x represents hydrophobic amino acids). this prepilin peptidase cleavage site is present in the products of four genes in the pulc-o operon (pulg, pulh, pull and  pulj proteins). it is shown here that pulo processes the pulg gene product in vivo. processing was maximal within 15 seconds, but experiments in which the expression of pulo was uncoupled from that of the other genes in the secretion operon suggest that processing can also occur post-translationally. the products  of two pulg derivatives with internal inframe deletions were also processed by pulo, but the three pulg-phoa hybrids, two pulj-phoa hybrids and the single pulh-phoa hybrid tested did not appear to be processed. sucrose gradient fraction experiments showed that both precursor and mature forms of pulg appear to be associated with low-density, outer membrane vesicles prepared by osmotic lysis of sphaeroplasts. neither the xcpa gene nor the bacillus subtilis gene comc, which is also homologous to pulo and codes for a protein with type iv prepilin peptidase activity, can correct the pullulanase secretion defect in an escherichia coli strain carrying all of the genes required for secretion except pulo. furthermore, neither xcpa nor comc is able to process prepulg protein in vivo.

TI  == microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  == to better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). we cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group d streptococcus in five patients, corynebacterium in five patients, haemophilus influenzae in three patients, neisseria in three patients, and streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. cultures yielded no growth  in nine patients. a strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. a poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx  and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). all seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. the presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.

TI  == characterisation of a pseudomonas aeruginosa twitching motility gene and evidence for a specialised protein export system widespread in eubacteria.
AB  == type-4 fimbriae (pili) are associated with a phenomenon known as twitching motility, which appears to be involved with bacterial translocation across solid  surfaces. pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants which produce fimbriae, but which have lost the twitching motility function, display altered colony morphology and resistance to fimbrial-specific bacteriophage. we have used phenotypic complementation of such mutants to isolate a region of dna involved in twitching  motility. this region was physically mapped to a spei fragment around 20 min on the p. aeruginosa pao chromosome, remote from the major fimbrial locus (around 75 min) where the structural subunit-encoding gene (fima/pila) and ancillary genes required for fimbrial assembly (pilb, c and d) are found. a gene, pilt, within the twitching motility region is predicted to encode a 344-amino acid protein which has strong homology to a variety of other bacterial proteins. these include the p. aeruginosa pilb protein, the comg orf-1 protein from the bacillus subtilis comg operon (necessary for competence), the pule protein from the klebsiella oxytoca (formerly k. pneumoniae) pulc-o operon (involved in pullulanase export),  and the virb-11 protein from the virb operon (involved in virulence) which is located on the agrobacterium tumefaciens ti plasmid. we have also identified other sets of homologies between p. aeruginosa fimbrial assembly (pil) proteins and b. subtilis com and k. oxytoca pul proteins, which suggest that these are all related members of a specialised protein export pathway which is widespread in the eubacteria.

AB  == this study examined the occurrence of non-oral gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods in advanced adult periodontitis. speciation and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the microscan micromethod system. a total of 42 taxa of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae and acinetobacter were isolated from 427 of 3,050 (14.0%) patients. in 159 (5.2%) patients, these organisms comprised more than 5% of the cultivable subgingival microflora. enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter agglomerans accounted for more than 50% of all strains isolated. virtually all study strains demonstrated high in vitro susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, but exhibited variable susceptibility patterns to 18 other antimicrobial agents tested. in 3 "refractory" periodontitis patients heavily infected with enteric rods, systemic ciprofloxacin therapy (500 mg bid for 10 days) led to resolution of the subgingival infections and improved clinical periodontal status. the present findings indicate that 5% of severe periodontitis lesions may harbor high levels of non-oral, gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods. systemic ciprofloxacin appears to be capable of eradicating these potential pathogens from deep periodontal pockets.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and interactions with beta-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins of the new monocarbam antibiotic u-78608.
AB  == u-78608, a new monocarbam antibiotic, was evaluated for in vitro activity against 312 clinical isolates of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and subjected to several  in vitro biochemical tests characterizing its interactions with beta-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins (pbps). the antibacterial activity of the compound was compared directly with those of sq 83,360 (pirazmonam) and aztreonam. u-78608, sq 83,360, and aztreonam had generally poor activity against  gram-positive aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. u-78608 demonstrated activity primarily against gram-negative aerobic bacteria, with potency generally comparable to that of sq 83,360. u-78608 and sq 83,360 were less active than aztreonam for some gram-negative species; however, both compounds were 8- to 64-fold more active than aztreonam against acinetobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pseudomonas maltophilia. all three compounds resisted inactivation by several different beta-lactamases from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. neither u-78608 nor sq 83,360 exhibited significant inhibition of these enzymes, while aztreonam inhibited beta-lactamases from p. aeurginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. all three compounds exhibited strong affinity  to pbp 3 of escherichia coli and moderate to negligible affinity to the other e.  coli pbps; quantitative measurements indicated that u-78608 had greater pbp 3 affinity than either sq 83,360 or aztreonam.

TI  == in-vitro activity of meropenem imipenem, the penem hre 664 and ceftazidine against clinical isolates from west germany.
AB  == the antibacterial activity in vitro of meropenem was compared with another carbapenem, imipenem, the penem hre 664, and ceftazidime. mics were not influenced by ph nor by inoculum size below 5 x 10(5) cfu/ml: higher inocula caused a modest increase in mic. cation supplementation of mueller-hinton broth was without effect. meropenem was more active than imipenem and the other comparative agents against the majority of gram-negative species (in particular proteus, providencia, morganella, haemophilus, neisseria and pseudomonas aeruginosa, including isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis). against gram-positive organisms, the activity of meropenem was equal to or slightly less  that of imipenem. neither meropenem nor imipenem were influenced by the extended  spectrum beta-lactamases that confer resistance to third generation cephalosporins produced by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca or serratia marcescens.

TI  == simple assay of beta-lactamase with agar medium containing a chromogenic cephalosporin, pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (padac).
AB  == a new beta-lactamase assay method with agar plates containing pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (padac) (50 microm), a beta-lactamase-labile, chromogenic cephalosporin, was examined. on the padac plates inoculated with beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (10(4) cfu per spot) and incubated at 37 degrees c, a yellow zone showing hydrolysis of padac by beta-lactamase was formed around the colony. the zone diameter increased with incubation time. examination with enterobacter cloacae gn7471 revealed that  beta-lactamase activity was present in the agar around the colony, decreasing exponentially with increasing distance from the colonial margin; this suggests that the padac hydrolysis zone is formed by an extracellular enzyme. at 18 h, significant correlations were obtained between the zone diameters of the 10 species (clinical isolates) examined and their periplasmic beta-lactamase activities determined spectrophotometrically. the addition of clavulanic acid (0.5 to 10 micrograms/ml) inhibited zone formation on the padac plates inoculated with type iiia, va, vb, pse-1, and ic beta-lactamase producers. when the clinical isolates were tested on plates with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/ml), inhibition was observed in 41 to 58% of the escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and in all isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and proteus vulgaris. thus, the use of the inhibitor made it  possible to detect penicillinase or type ic cephalosporinase producers. these results proved that the padac plate might be a useful tool permitting easy, semiquantitative determination of beta-lactamase activity.

TI  == [bone infections: treatment by ofloxacin. apropos of 10 cases].
AB  == because of its pharmacokinetic, broad spectrum and oral administration, ofloxacin can be used in the treatment of chronic bone infections. a clinical trial was performed in 10 patients with subacute or chronic osteitis (5 staphylococcus aureus, 1 staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 escherichia coli, 1 serratia marcescens, 1 pseudomonas aeruginosa). patients were given orally 200 mg 12 hourly. treatment duration went on from 2 to 6 months. in this trial, the evaluation was successful in the 10 cases with a delay of 2 to 13 months (m 8,9)  after the end of the treatment. prosthetic material has been taken off in 1 case  out of 4 patients (prosthetic hip) because of persistaet free bacteria outflow. for one patient, a superinfection with a pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ofloxacin was noticed at the second month. bone levels (microbiological method) were between 1,3 and 9,7 mg/l and always higher to the mic of the bacteria. biological tolerance was satisfactory in spite of a rise of transaminase level, a transient renal disfunction whom relationship to the treatment was difficult. 3 transient photosensitivities were also noticed.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [clinical study on effects of cefmetazole on severe infections accompanied by hematologic diseases].
AB  == severe infections accompanied by hematopathy under granulocytopenic conditions were treated with cefmetazole (cmz). subject diseases mainly consisted of acute leukemia, agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia; combined infections were septicemia, pneumonia, fever of an undetermined origin, etc. as for causative organisms found in cases that could be examined, gram-negative bacilli such as klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae were isolated, as was staphylococcus aureus. in general, 4 g of cmz divided into 2 administrations was given per day through intravenous injection or intravenous drip infusion. on the basis of the judgement criteria for effectiveness established by takaku et al., the efficacy rate in this study was found to be 68%, including 2 cases that showed excellent responses to treatment of infections caused by s. aureus. cases that showed pyretolysis within 4 days had over 1,000/microliter of neutrophils, while cases with less than 1,000/microliter showed no pyretolysis. no hepatorenal dysfunctions related to the treatment with cmz were seen as side effects except increases of transaminase in 1 case. these results indicate that cmz is a useful drug for the treatment of  infections accompanied by hematopathy under granulocytopenic condition.

TI  == the anti-microbial activity, beta-lactamase stability, and disk diffusion susceptibility testing of carumonam (ro 17-2301, ama-1080), a new monobactam.
AB  == carumonam, a new monobactam, was found to have an anti-microbial spectrum similar to aztreonam. its spectrum includes enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, pathogenic neisseria species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and some streptococci. staphylococcus species, enterococci, and many other nonenteric gram-negative bacilli were not inhibited. enterobacteriaceae resistant to cefoperazone (minimum inhibitory concentrations [mics] greater than or equal to 32 mg/l) were more likely inhibited by carumonam (52% at less than or equal to 8.0 mg/l) than aztreonam (39%) or ceftazidime (35%). dilution test methods on agar or in mueller-hinton broth produced similar results. carumonam minimum bactericidal concentrations were usually the same or one dilution above the mic. carumonam and aztreonam were very stable to most chromosomal (p99, k1, k14) and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, pse). the klebsiella oxytoca enzymes  hydrolyzed aztreonam at rates greater than or equal to fivefold higher than carumonam but at a rate less than 1% that of cephaloridine. the aztreonam mics for these klebsiella stains were greater than or equal to 32 mg/l, but the hydrolysis rates do not fully explain the high-grade resistance to aztreonam. in  vitro susceptibility tests with 30-micrograms carumonam disks were found to be very predictive. similar regression statistics were observed for aztreonam and cefotaxime. recommendations for carumonam susceptibility testing are susceptible  greater than or equal to 21 mm (less than or equal to 8.0 mg/l) and resistant less than or equal to 14 mm (greater than or equal to 32 mg/l). cross-resistance  analysis favors the independent testing of carumonam or aztreonam against gram-negative species other than enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa.

AB  == guineapigs were rederived by hysterectomy and associated with a colonization-resistant enteric microflora (crf) of mouse origin to establish a strict barrier-maintained breeding colony. infections were suspected in 55 of 209 animals autopsied. from 65 of 67 tissue samples selected for bacteriological examination 167 isolates, belonging to 16 usually non-pathogenic bacterial species or groups, were isolated mostly from cases of mastitis, typhlitis, enteritis, otitis media and pneumonia. faecal streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, citrobacter spp., c. freundii, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae accounted for 86.8% of all isolates. variations in the recovery rate of these 8 species during the study and a gradual decline in the incidence of infections were observed. elimination by rederivation of the autochthonous bacterial flora seemed to have predisposed to opportunistic infections by aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. enteric colonization resistance to the growth of these bacteria was presumably insufficiently provided by the crf of mouse origin and might be remedied by using a flora of guineapig origin.

TI  == [activity of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (augmentin) combination on strains of hospital isolates].
AB  == all strains of staphylococcus aureus and gram negative bacilli (enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter) isolated from 01.01 to 03.31.83 were studied using agar diffusion with augmentin-impregnated discs (amoxicillin 20 micrograms + clavulanic acid 10 micrograms). augmentin is active  against penicillinase-producing staphylococci susceptible to methicillin, whereas methicillin-resistant strains are also resistant to augmentin. according to the susceptibility of strains to amoxicillin, carbenicillin and cefalotin, enterobacteriaceae can be divided into five main phenotypes, of which four are resistant. "rsr" and "rrr" phenotypes, which are cephalosporinase producers, are  chiefly found among enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter and indole + proteus; in  these groups a change in inhibition diameters indicating activity of augmentin is observed only in a significant number of proteus vulgaris strains. "rrs" and "rri" strains are penicillinase producers found mainly among e. coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae and oxytoca, and proteus mirabilis; they emerge as very susceptible to augmentin. pseudomonas aeruginosa is never susceptible to augmentin. augmentin is slightly more active than amoxicillin on some acinetobacter strains but the difference is too inconsiderable to be of clinical significance.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a new n-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == temocillin. in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  == temocillin, a 6-alpha-methoxy penicillin derivative, was tested in vitro against  516 recent clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae. the compound exhibited good antibacterial activity, with 95% of isolates inhibited by a range 2 to 16 mg/l. further studies, against selected isolates resistant to ticarcillin, piperacillin and cefuroxime (klebsiella oxytoca, 25; enterobacter species, 34; and citrobacter species, 5), showed about half of the isolates of k. oxytoca (11/25) to be resistant to aztreonam (mic range 16-greater than or equal to 128 mg/l), but susceptible to temocillin, cefotaxime and latamoxef. in general, the resistant strains of enterobacter species tested were not susceptible to cefotaxime (mic range 16-128 mg/l), or aztreonam (mic range 1.0-64 mg/l), and many exhibited reduced susceptibility to latamoxef (mic range 2-128 mg/l). in contrast, all the  strains were susceptible to temocillin (mic range 4-16 mg/l). the bactericidal activity of temocillin was confirmed against selected aztreonam-resistant strains of k. oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae by conventional time-kill studies, and against a strain of e. cloacae in an in vitro model system designed to simulate the temocillin concentration profiles attained in extravascular fluid such as peripheral lymph. in the time-kill studies, temocillin concentrations of 16 and 32 mg/l were shown to effectively reduce the numbers of viable bacteria by 99 and 99.9%, respectively, within 12 hours. in the in vitro model system the numbers of bacteria were reduced 99.9% over the initial 4-hour period. in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics, temocillin exerted a synergistic or partially synergistic effect (sigma fic less than or equal to 0.75) against the majority of strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa tested. when combined with piperacillin, cefotaxime or latamoxef, temocillin, unlike cefoxitin, exhibited no antagonism against strains of enterobacteriaceae producing inducible cephalosporinases.

TI  == evaluation of experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid by excised teat assay.
AB  == an experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid, diluted in water, was evaluated by excised teat protocol. the teat dip was tested against 21 microorganisms. included were: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. numerous strains were tested for strain differences. environmental bacteria were included because of their increasing importance as a cause of bovine mastitis. all excised teats were dipped in a bacterial suspension containing about 1 x 10(8) cfu/ml. negative control teats were not dipped in a germicidal compound. positive controls were dipped in 1% iodophor. effectiveness of the experimental teat dip was expressed as the percent reduction in mean log of bacteria recovered from dipped teats as compared to numbers recovered from control teats. the sodium chlorite - lactic acid dip caused a greater percent log reduction than iodophor for 14 of 21 strains tested. however, differences were generally slight. the experimental teat dip appeared effective against gram-negative bacteria. some differences in percent log reduction were observed between strains of the same species. lowest effectiveness and greatest strain variation were observed with staphylococcus aureus for both dips tested.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fr 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fr 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group a and b streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. it was less active (mic, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit  streptococcus faecalis or listeria monocytogenes. fr 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. fr 17027 inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, providencia stuartii, providencia rettgeri, and citrobacter diversus at  less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. some strains of enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (mic, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). fr 17027 did not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa, other pseudomonas species, acinetobacter species, or bacteroides species. activity was  minimally affected by growth conditions. fr 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to polymyxin b nonapeptide.
AB  == subinhibitory concentrations of polymyxin b nonapeptide sensitized all 21 polymyxin-susceptible gram-negative bacterial strains studied to hydrophobic antibiotics such as fusidic acid, novobiocin, and erythromycin. the susceptibility increases were usually 30- to 300-fold. the strains included representatives of escherichia coli with different o- and k-antigens, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, salmonella typhimurium, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and  pseudomonas maltophilia. in contrast, polymyxin-resistant strains (proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens) were resistant to the action of polymyxin b nonapeptide.

TI  == [microflora of the birth canal and an intrauterine catheter system following use  of polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine for subpartal disinfection of the vaginal mucosa].
AB  == changes in the microflora of the birth canal as a result of application of polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine were examined. 58 women in labor were randomly selected and assigned to a pvp iodine prophylaxis- and to a control group. germinal spectra from cervical smears at the beginning of birth and directly post partum (p.p.) were taken, and bacteriological specimens from the intra-uterine catheter system and the oral cavity of the neonatus were also determined. in the  p.p. cervical smears of the pvp iodine prophylaxis group, escherichia coli (p = 0.05) were found significantly less frequently. the germinal isolates of the tip  and middle of the catheter produced an increased occurrence of pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. the frequency of these germs could be reduced  significantly by vaginal application of pvp iodine. the oral cavity smear of the  neonatus which was taken at the same time as the post partum cervical smear showed an almost identical bacterial flora. a reduction of e. coli and other gram-negative bacilli were found in the pvp iodine group.

TI  == isolation and identification of ropy bacteria in raw milk.
AB  == approximately 4.2% of 4,000 maryland-virginia raw milk tanker samples developed ropiness when incubated at 10 degrees c. of the 56 bacterial isolates 30 were identified by species. klebsiella oxytoca and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated most frequently. other ropy isolates were identified as pseudomonas spp., chromobacterium, flavobacterium multivorum, presumptive yersinia pestis, enterobacter agglomerans, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pasteurella-actinobacter spp. six of the klebsiella oxytoca isolates were mesophilic (optimum temperatures of 32.0 to 37.8 degrees c) with two isolates having psychrotrophic tendencies (optimum temperature of 26.8 degrees c). all pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates appeared to be psychrotropic in their temperature requirements (optimum temperature of 23.0 to 31.0 degrees c). klebsiella oxytoca was significant in preliminary development of the ropy condition. all klebsiella oxytoca isolates developed ropiness within 24 h. the pseudomonas spp. and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates required at long as 7 days to develop detectable ropiness at 10 degrees  c. a recommended klebsiella oxytoca differentiation agar is presented as a rapid  screening method during outbreaks where klebsiella oxytoca is the organism of significance.

TI  == superinfections in herpes simplex keratitis.
AB  == we reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. the factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. gram-negative rods were found in six cases (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and achromobacter sp.). gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were  found in six cases (staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; s. aureus, two cases; and streptococcus sp., two cases). fungal superinfections were found in three cases (cephalosporium acremonium, candida albicans, and aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.

TI  == reliability of early identifications obtained with enterobacteriaceae-plus biochemical cards in the automicrobic system.
AB  == the automicrobic system (ams) is capable of identifying most enterobacteriaceae within 8 h and many glucose-nonfermenting, gram-negative bacilli after 13 h of incubation. early preliminary results can be readily obtained from the computer as the tests incubate. data with 1,023 bacterial isolates were reviewed to determine the relative accuracy of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 13-h identifications. all automicrobic system identifications with probability (p) values of less than 0.80 were considered equivocal responses which needed supplementary tests before a final report could be issued. analysis of our data suggests that early identifications of morganella morganii, acinetobacter sp., yersinia spp., salmonella spp. (other than salmonella typhi), shigella spp. (other than shigella sonnei), enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas spp. (other than pseudomonas aeruginosa or pseudomonas maltophilia), klebsiella spp. (other than klebsiella pneumoniae or klebsiella oxytoca), citrobacter amalonauticus, serratia liquefaciens, or vibrio spp. should be considered nonspecific responses, even when p greater than or equal to 0.80. other identifications reported after 4 h were 96% accurate. at least half of our isolates (60% of our enterobacteriaceae)  could be identified reliably within 4 h, the remaining isolates required longer incubation.

TI  == aerobic bacterial oral flora of garter snakes: development of normal flora and pathogenic potential for snakes and humans.
AB  == garter snakes that are used for scientific laboratory studies or kept as exotic pets often become ill and die early in captivity. they may also act as reservoirs of potential human pathogens or transmit infection to man. a total of 126 strains of aerobic and facultative bacteria, most potential human and snake pathogens, were isolated from 82 garter snake oropharyngeal cultures. coagulase-negative staphylococcus species were the most common species isolated. acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus, hafnia alvei, arizona hinshawii, salmonella species, shigella species, klebsiella oxytoca, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were among the potential pathogens isolated. the spectrum of bacteria with potential for causing oral and pulmonary infections in garter snakes is greater than has been previously appreciated. garter snakes should also be considered reservoirs of human pathogens, and appropriate precautions should be taken by laboratory personnel and pet owners.
