TI  == molecular comparison of pathogenic bacteria from pear trees in japan and the fire blight pathogen erwinia amylovora.
AB  == several strains of the genus erwinia, which were isolated in japan from pear trees with necrotic symptoms that resembled fire blight, and tentatively identified as erwinia amylovora, were reinvestigated for their relationship to the fire blight pathogen. these isolates produced ooze on slices of immature pears and were mucoid on mm2cu agar plates, but did not synthesize levan and did  not give the expected pcr signals with several primer pairs specific for erwinia  amylovora. the isolates tested positive with pcr primers designed to detect the novel pear pathogen erwinia pyrifoliae, which was isolated from nashi pear trees  in south korea. the nucleotide sequence analysis of a dna fragment preceding the  gene cluster for exopolysaccharide synthesis revealed a closer relationship to erwinia pyrifoliae than to erwinia amylovora. plasmid profiles, protein patterns  and genomic dna analysed by pfge after xbai and spei digestion were different than erwinia amylovora. experiments with strains of erwinia amylovora isolated from raspberry (rubus sp.), erwinia mallotivora and enterobacter pyrinus also did not reveal a relationship between these bacteria and the japanese erwinia strains. the latter are not identical to erwinia pyrifoliae, but possess many similar features to this pathogen that causes asian pear blight. it is concluded  that pathogenic bacteria isolated in japan from pear trees with symptoms resembling fire blight are possibly different from erwinia amylovora.

TI  == erwinia pyrifoliae sp. nov., a novel pathogen that affects asian pear trees (pyrus pyrifolia nakai)
AB  == a novel pathogen from asian pears (pyrus pyrifolia nakai) was analysed by sequencing the 16s rdna and the adjacent intergenic region, and the data were compared to related enterobacteriaceae. the 16s rdna of the asian pear pathogen was almost identical with the sequence of erwinia amylovora, in contrast to the 16s-23s rrna intergenic transcribed spacer region of both species. a dendrogram was deduced from determined sequences of the spacer regions including those of several related species such as erwinia amylovora, enterobacter pyrinus, pantoea  stewartii subsp. stewartii and escherichia coli. dendrograms derived from 121 biochemical characteristics including biotype 100 data placed the asian pear pathogen close to erwinia amylovora and more distantly to other members of the species erwinia and to the species pantoea and enterobacter. another dna relatedness study was performed by dna hybridizations and estimation of delta tm  values. the asian pear strains constituted a tight dna hybridization group (89-100%) and were barely related to strains of erwinia amylovora (40-50%) with a delta tm in the range of 5.2-6.8. the g + c content of dna from the novel pathogen is 52 mol%. therefore, it is proposed that strains isolated from asian pears constitute a new species and the name erwinia pyrifoliae is suggested; the  type strain is strain ep 16/96t (= cfbp 4172t = dsm 12163t).
