salivacin 140, a novel bacteriocin from lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius t140 active against pathogenic bacteria.
fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and/or propionibacterium acnes. strain t140, isolated from the surface of japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by t140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. strain t140 required a high initial ph (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.
