TI  - The genomic basis for the evolution of a novel form of cellular reproduction in the bacterium Epulopiscium.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epulopiscium sp. type B, a large intestinal bacterial symbiont of the surgeonfish Naso tonganus, does not reproduce by binary fission. Instead, it forms multiple intracellular offspring using a process with morphological features similar to the survival strategy of endospore formation in other Firmicutes. We hypothesize that intracellular offspring formation in Epulopiscium evolved from endospore formation and these two developmental programs share molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the observed morphological similarities. RESULTS: To test this, we sequenced the genome of Epulopiscium sp. type B to draft quality. Comparative analysis with the complete genome of its close, endospore-forming relative, Cellulosilyticum lentocellum, identified homologs of well-known sporulation genes characterized in Bacillus subtilis. Of the 147 highly conserved B. subtilis sporulation genes used in this analysis, we found 57 homologs in the Epulopiscium genome and 87 homologs in the C. lentocellum genome. CONCLUSIONS: Genes coding for components of the central regulatory network which govern the expression of forespore and mother-cell-specific sporulation genes and the machinery used for engulfment appear best conserved. Low conservation of genes expressed late in endospore formation, particularly those that confer resistance properties and encode germinant receptors, suggest that Epulopiscium has lost the ability to form a mature spore. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the evolution of a novel form of cellular reproduction.
TI  - Cellulosilyticum ruminicola gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the rumen of yak,  and reclassification of Clostridium lentocellum as Cellulosilyticum lentocellum comb. nov.
AB  - An obligate anaerobic, Gram-staining-negative, mesophilic, cellulolytic bacterium, strain H1(T), was isolated from the rumen content of yak. Cells were straight to slightly curved rods, 0.8-1.0 x 3.0-4.0 microm in size, non-motile and encapsulated with mucous materials. Elliptical and terminal spores that swelled the cells were produced occasionally. The strain grew at 25-45 degrees C (optimum, 38 degrees C) and pH 6.0-7.8 (optimum, pH 6.7). Cellulose, cellobiose, xylan, xylose and maltose were used as carbon and energy sources, but not glucose. Products from cellulose and cellobiose fermentation were formic acid, acetic acid, carbon dioxide and trace amounts of ethanol, lactic acid and succinic acid. The genomic DNA G+C content was 33.7+/-1.2 mol%. The predominant fatty acids were C(16 : 0) (27.1 %), C(14 : 0) (9.2 %) and iso-C( 16 : 0) (6.4%). Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain H1(T) was affiliated to the clostridial rRNA cluster XIVb and showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Clostridium lentocellum DSM 5427(T) (96.0 %). These two strains formed a distinct lineage of the family 'Lachnospiraceae '. Based on data from this polyphasic taxonomic study, a new genus, Cellulosilyticum gen. nov., is proposed. Cellulosilyticum ruminicola sp. nov. is proposed for strain H1(T). The type strain of Cellulosilyticum ruminicola sp. nov. is strain H1(T) (=CGMCC 1.5065(T)=JCM 14822(T)). Clostridium lentocellum was reclassified in the new genus as Cellulosilyticum lentocellum comb. nov. (type strain RHM5(T)=ATCC 49066( T)=DSM 5427(T)=NCIMB 11756(T)).
