TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == effects of triclosan-containing rinse on the dynamics and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro plaque ecosystems.
AB  == dental plaque microcosms were established under a feast-famine regimen within constant-depth film fermentors and exposed four times daily postfeeding to a triclosan (tr)-containing rinse (dentifrice) (trd). this was diluted so that the  antimicrobial content was 0.6 mg/ml. microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) with primers specific for the v2-v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rrna gene (rdna). dominant isolates and pcr amplicons were identified by partial sequencing of 16s rdna. trd caused considerable decreases in the counts of both gram-negative organisms and total anaerobic cells, transiently lowered the numbers of streptococci and actinomycetes, and markedly increased the proportion  of lactobacilli. dgge indicated the presence of putatively unculturable bacteria  and showed that a porphyromonas sp. and selenomonas infelix had been inhibited by trd. pure culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that neisseria subflava, prevotella nigrescens, and porphyromonas gingivalis were highly susceptible to tr, while the lactobacilli and streptococci were the least  susceptible. clonal expansion of the lactobacilli in the pulsed microcosm could be explained on the basis of tr activity. the mean mics of tr, chlorhexidine, erythromycin, penicillin v, and vancomycin for the population before and after 5  days of exposure to trd showed few significant changes. in conclusion, changes in plaque microcosm populations following repeated exposure to trd showed inhibition of the most susceptible flora and clonal expansion of less susceptible species.

TI  == effects of a chlorhexidine gluconate-containing mouthwash on the vitality and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro oral bacterial ecosystems.
AB  == oral bacterial microcosms, established using saliva inocula from three individuals, were maintained under a feast-famine regime within constant-depth film fermenters. steady-state communities were exposed four times daily, postfeeding, to a chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate-containing mouthwash (chxm) diluted to 0.06% (wt/vol) antimicrobial content. the microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). chxm caused significant decreases in both total anaerobe  and total aerobe/facultative anaerobe counts (p < 0.05), together with lesser decreases in gram-negative anaerobes. the degree of streptococcal and actinomycete inhibition varied considerably among individuals. dgge showed that chxm exposure caused considerable decreases in microbial diversity, including marked reductions in prevotella sp. and selenomonas infelix. pure-culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, prevotella nigrescens, and the streptococci were highly susceptible to chx, while lactobacillus rhamnosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and neisseria subflava were the least susceptible. determination of the mics of triclosan, chx, erythromycin, penicillin v, vancomycin, and metronidazole for microcosm isolates, before and after 5 days of chxm exposure, showed that chxm exposure altered the distribution of isolates toward those that were less susceptible to chx (p < 0.05). changes in susceptibility distributions for the other test agents were not statistically significant. in conclusion, population changes in plaque microcosms following repeated exposure to chxm represented an inhibition of the most susceptible flora with a clonal expansion of less susceptible species.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == analysis of ph-driven disruption of oral microbial communities in vitro.
AB  == previously, a mixed culture chemostat system was used to demonstrate that the ph  generated from carbohydrate metabolism, rather than carbohydrate availability per se, was responsible for the shifts observed in the oral microflora which are associated with high carbohydrate diets and the development of dental caries. the aim of this study was to determine more accurately the microbially generated ph at which such shifts occurred. nine oral bacteria were grown in three independent chemostats, and pulsed with glucose on 10 consecutive days. in one chemostat, ph  control was discontinued for 6 h, and the ph fall was restricted to a minimum value of ph 5.5; the ph fall was arrested in the other two chemostats at either ph 5. 0, or at ph 4.5. when the ph was allowed to fall, the numbers and proportions of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus rhamnosus increased; this increase was directly related to the magnitude of the ph fall. veillonella dispar was the most numerous organism following all glucose pulsing regimes, especially  at low ph. the increase in proportions of acidogenic bacteria was accompanied by  a fall in the proportions of acid-sensitive species (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis). the counts of these species were relatively stable between ph 5.5 and 4.5, but were markedly reduced when the ph fell below ph 4.5; neisseria subflava could not persist in the culture at ph 4.5 or below. the data suggest that the disruption of communities associated with glucose metabolism and low ph can be explained in  terms of a two-stage process. a fall in ph to a value between ph 5.5 and 4.5 may  allow the enrichment of potentially cariogenic species, whilst permitting species associated with health to remain relatively unaffected. a further reduction in ph (<ph 4.5) may not only enhance the competitiveness of odontopathogens, but inhibit the growth and metabolism of non-caries-associated species. the results also indicate that species other that mutans streptococci or lactobacilli are competitive at ph values low enough to demineralise enamel, and thus suggest that a broader range of micro-organisms may be associated with caries initiation.

TI  == effect of oxygen, inoculum composition and flow rate on development of mixed-culture oral biofilms.
AB  == the effect of aeration on the development of a defined biofilm consortium of oral bacteria was investigated in a two-stage chemostat system. an inoculum comprising 10 species, including both facultatively anaerobic and obligately anaerobic bacteria, and species associated with oral health and disease, was inoculated into an anaerobic first-stage chemostat vessel. the effluent from this chemostat  was linked to an aerated [200 ml co2/air (5:95, v/v) min-1] second-stage vessel,  in which removable hydroxyapatite discs were inserted to allow biofilm formation. comparisons were made of planktonic and biofilm communities in the aerated second-stage vessel by means of viable counts. both planktonic and early biofilm  communities were dominated by neisseria subflava, comprising > 40% of total c.f.u. in the fluid phase, and > 80% of c.f.u. in 2 h biofilms. obligate anaerobes persisted in this mixed culture, and succession in biofilms led them to predominate only after 7 d. despite the continuous addition of air, the dissolved oxygen tension (do2) within the culture remained low (< 5% of air saturation), and the redox potential (eh) was -275 mv. in order to assess the significance of  the presence of n. subflava in community development, a subsequent experiment omitted this aerobe from the inoculum, to produce a nine-species culture. the planktonic phase was predominated by three streptococcal species, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum. biofilms again underwent successional changes, with anaerobes increasing in proportion with time. in contrast to the culture including n. subflava, do2 was 50-60% of air saturation, and the eh was +50 mv. in the final experiment, the rate of addition of first-stage culture was  reduced to 1/10 of that in the previous experiment, in order to determine whether anaerobes were growing, rather than merely persisting in the aerated culture. the data for the planktonic phase indicated that the anaerobes were growing in aerated (do2 40-50%, eh +100 mv) conditions. once again, anaerobes increased in proportion in older biofilms. the study indicates that mixed cultures can protect obligate anaerobes from the toxic effects of oxygen, both in the biofilm and planktonic modes of growth.
