TI  == evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility of bacteroides, prevotella and fusobacterium species isolated from patients of the n. n. blokhin cancer research center, moscow, russia.
AB  == in total 122 non-duplicate bacteroides, prevotella and fusobacterium spp isolated from cancer patients between 2004 and 2014 were involved in this study. most of the strains belonged to the b. fragilis group (55%), followed by prevotella strains (34.4%) and fusobacterium spp (10.6%). the species identification was carried out by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms), and they were identified on species level with a log (score) >2.0. the most common isolates were b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b.  ovatus and b. vulgatus. among prevotella species, the most frequently isolated species were p. buccae, p. buccalis, p. oris, p. denticola and p. nigrescens, and most of the fusobacterium spp. were f. nucleatum. susceptibilities of the strains were determined by the e-test methodology. the percentage of the susceptibility of b. fragilis group isolates were: metronidazole (mic </=4 mug/ml), 97%; imipenem (mic </=2 mug/ml), 95.5%; amoxicillin/clavulanate (mic </=4 mug/ml), 95.5% and clindamycin (mic </=4 mug/ml), 77.6%. three b. fragilis isolates proved to be multidrug-resistant (parallel resistance to imipenem, amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole or clindamycin was observed). all prevotella strains tested were susceptible to imipenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate, whereas 78.6% of the pigmented prevotella species and 46.4% of the non-pigmented species were resistant to penicillin (mic >0.5 mug/ml). the susceptibility to metronidazole and clindamycin were 93% and 88%, respectively. all fusobacterium strains were sensitive to all tested antibiotics, including penicillin.

TI  == beta-lactamase producing bacteria in adult periodontitis.
AB  == in 23 untreated adult periodontitis patients, the occurrence of beta-lactamase producing periodontal bacteria was determined. in addition to non-selective isolation media, selective isolation and growth of beta-lactamase positive subgingival bacterial species was carried out on blood agar plates supplemented with amoxicillin and plates with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides forsythus and campylobacter rectus isolates from the non-selective medium were tested for beta-lactamase activity by a nitrocefin disk method (dryslide) and by a laboratory chromogenic nitrocefin-based test. isolates from the amoxicillin plates that were absent on the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plates were identified and tested for beta-lactamase production. based on the non-selective plates, six  of 23 p. intermedia isolates, 2 of 19 b. forsythus isolates and 3 of 23 f. nucleatum isolates were beta-lactamase positive. the beta-lactamase positive species prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, prevotella buccalis and actinomyces spp were recovered from the selective amoxicillin plates. beta-lactamase positive subgingival species were recovered from 17 of 23 patients (74%) but usually comprised low proportions of the subgingival microbiota (range  < 0.01-15%). comparison of the dryslide test and the nitrocefin-based laboratory  test revealed full agreement of test results. beta-lactamase activity in whole subgingival plaque was detected in 12 patient samples (52%). it was concluded that beta-lactamase activity in subgingival bacteria in adult periodontitis is a  common feature. however, since the majority of the samples showed only low-level  enzymatic activity, the clinical relevance of this observation with regard to therapy with unprotected enzyme-susceptible beta-lactams is uncertain, though failure on the other hand, is difficult to rule out when a mechanism of resistance is present. the majority of beta-lactamase positive strains was found  among species of the prevotella genus.

TI  == inhibition of prevotella and capnocytophaga immunoglobulin a1 proteases by human  serum.
AB  == oral prevotella and capnocytophaga species, regularly isolated from periodontal pockets and associated with extraoral infections, secret specific immunoglobulin  a1 (iga1) proteases cleaving human iga1 in the hinge region into intact fab and fc fragments. to investigate whether these enzymes are subject to inhibition in vivo in humans, we tested 34 sera from periodontally diseased and healthy individuals in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence and titers of inhibition of seven prevotella and capnocytophaga proteases. all or nearly all of the sera inhibited the iga1 protease activity of prevotella buccae, prevotella oris, and prevotella loescheii. a minor proportion of the sera inhibited prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, and prevotella melaninogenica iga1 proteases, while no sera inhibited capnocytophaga ochracea iga1 protease. all inhibition titers were low, ranging from 5 to 55, with titer being defined as the reciprocal of the dilution of serum causing 50% inhibition of one defined unit of protease activity. no correlation between periodontal disease status and the presence, absence, or titer of inhibition was observed. the nature of the low titers of inhibition in all sera of the iga1 proteases of p. buccae, p. oris, and p. loescheii was further examined. in size exclusion chromatography, inhibitory activity corresponded to the peak volume of iga. additional inhibition of the p.  oris iga1 protease was found in fractions containing both iga and igg. purification of the igg fractions of five sera by passage of the sera on a protein g column resulted in recovery of inhibitory igg antibodies against all three iga1 proteases, with the highest titer being for the p. oris enzyme. these  finding indicate that inhibitory activity is associated with enzyme-neutralizing  antibodies.

TI  == characterisation of non-pigmented species of the genus prevotella by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == gram-negative anaerobic bacilli previously known as the melaninogenicus-oralis group of bacteroides have been assigned to a new genus, prevotella. the non-pigmented members of this genus share several general characteristics and cannot be readily distinguished by routine tests. a polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis procedure, with visual analysis of protein patterns, was used to  compare cellular protein patterns from clinical isolates with those from collection (reference) strains. reference strains of p. oralis, p. veroralis, p.  buccalis, p. oris, p. buccae, p. zoogleoformans, p. bivia, p. disiens, p. oulora, b. (p.) capillus and b. (p.) pentosaceus, and 91 non-pigmented isolates from patients with adult periodontal disease were examined by conventional biochemical tests, gas-liquid chromatography (glc) and enzyme tests, and whole-cell protein profiles were obtained by sds-page. there was close correlation between patterns  of results in biochemical and glc tests and the sds-page profiles, and the species were readily distinguished in sds-page. the periodontal isolates were assigned to 10 groups by conventional test reaction patterns and nine groups by sds-page; the profiles of 79 isolates corresponded to those of seven species reference strains. by sds-page, clinical isolates of p. buccae (42 isolates) and  p. oralis (eight isolates) showed good similarity with reference strains. however, for p. veroralis (15), p. oris (7), p. bivia (4), p. zoogleoformans (2)  and p. buccalis (1), clinical isolates showed some minor variations from reference strains. twelve isolates remained undesignated in sds-page analysis. variant sds-page profiles divided clinical isolates of p. buccae into two subgroups and those of p. veroralis into five subgroups.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == the use of whole-cell dna probes for the identification of bacteroides intermedius isolates in a dot blot assay.
AB  == bacteroides intermedius includes two distinct groups of organisms that are phenotypically indistinguishable by conventional methods. these two groups are represented by the type strain of the species atcc 25611t (b. intermedius type i) and by atcc 33563 (b. intermedius type ii). members of each group can be distinguished from each other by analysis of the cellular protein composition by  sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and by dna-dna homology studies, because they share less than 40% homology. the purpose of this study was to prepare specific dna probes for the two groups of bacteroides intermedius and  to test them against field isolates. whole-cell dna probes were prepared from b.  intermedius types i and ii and tested against 253 field strains of bacteroides which had been identified by conventional phenotypic tests as b. intermedius. of  these, 170 (67%) hybridized with the b. intermedius type i dna probe, 28 (11%) with the type ii, and 23 (9%) failed to react with the b. intermedius probes but  did hybridize with either b. melaninogenicus, b. loescheii, or b. corporis whole-cell dna probes. the 32 (13%) remaining isolates failed to hybridize with any of the five bacteroides probes or with probes to b. asaccharolyticus, b. buccae, b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. gingivalis, b. oralis, or b. oris. these data demonstrate the usefulness of whole-cell dna probes for the identification of phenotypically similar or identical field isolates.

TI  == use of the rapid-ana system to screen for enzyme activities that differ among species of bile-inhibited bacteroides.
AB  == the rapid-ana system (innovative diagnostics systems, inc., atlanta, ga.) was used to test 102 strains of 14 species of phenotypically similar bile-inhibited bacteroides from humans. bacteroides oris, bacteroides veroralis, bacteroides buccalis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides loescheii, and bacteroides denticola had very similar enzyme activity profiles. clear differentiation of these six species by the rapid-ana system was not possible, but tests for arginine aminopeptidase and beta-glucosidase were helpful. bacteroides oralis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides disiens, bacteroides bivius, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides asaccharolyticus, and bacteroides buccae each had unique enzyme activity profiles. no consistent differences in enzyme activities were found between the two dna homology groups within bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides loescheii, or bacteroides intermedius. tests for glycine aminopeptidase, alpha-galactosidase, arginine aminopeptidase, alpha-fucosidase, n-acetylglucosaminidase, reduction of triphenyltetrazolium, and production of indole were helpful in the differentiation of the species studied.
