inhibition of adhesion of enteroinvasive pathogens to human intestinal caco-2 cells by lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb decreases bacterial invasion.
salmonella typhimurium and enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) were found to adhere to the brush border of differentiated human intestinal epithelial caco-2 cells in culture, whereas yersinia pseudotuberculosis and listeria monocytogenes adhered to the periphery of undifferentiated caco-2 cells.
all these enterovirulent strains invaded the caco-2 cells.
using a heat-killed human lactobacillus acidophilus (strain lb) which strongly adheres both to undifferentiated and differentiated caco-2 cells, we have studied inhibition of cell association with and invasion within caco-2 cells by enterovirulent bacteria.
living and heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb inhibited both cell association and invasion of caco-2 cells by enterovirulent bacteria in a concentration-dependent manner.
the mechanism of inhibition of both adhesion and invasion appears to be due to steric hindrance of human enterocytic pathogen receptors by whole-cell lactobacilli rather than to a specific blockade of receptors.
