TI  - Proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria grown in goat milk.
AB  - We examined 62 strains and 21 trade starter cultures from the collection of LB Bulgaricum PLC for proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grown in goat milk. The aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation of caseins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin by LAB, using the o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) spectrophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The proteolysis targeted mainly caseins, especially beta-casein. Whey proteins were proteolyzed, essentially beta-lactoglobulin. The proteolytic activity of Lactococcus lactis l598, Streptococcus thermophilus t3D1, Dt1, Lactobacillus lactis 1043 and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b38, b122 and b24 was notably high. The proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. Most of the examined strains showed antimicrobial activity against some food pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella cholere enteridis, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Enterobacter aerogenes. The most active producers of antimicrobial-active peptides were strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, which are of practical importance. The starter cultures containing the examined species showed high proteolytic and antimicrobial activity in skimmed goat milk. The greatest antimicrobial activity of the cultures was detected against E. aerogenes. The obtained results demonstrated the significant proteolytic potential of the examined strains in goat milk and their potential for application in the production of dairy products from goat's milk. The present results could be considered as the first data on the proteolytic capacity of strains and starter cultures in goat milk for the purposes of trade interest of LB Bulgaricum PLC.
TI  - Impact of a Complex Food Microbiota on Energy Metabolism in the Model Organism Caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  - The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is widely used as a model system for research on aging, development, and host-pathogen interactions. Little is currently known about the mechanisms underlying the effects exerted by foodborne microbes. We took advantage of C. elegans to evaluate the impact of foodborne microbiota on well characterized physiological features of the worms. Foodborne lactic acid bacteria (LAB) consortium was used to feed nematodes and its composition was evaluated by 16S rDNA analysis and strain typing before and after colonization of the nematode gut. Lactobacillus delbrueckii, L. fermentum, and Leuconostoc lactis were identified as the main species and shown to display different worm gut colonization capacities. LAB supplementation appeared to decrease nematode lifespan compared to the animals fed with the conventional Escherichia coli nutrient source or a probiotic bacterial strain. Reduced brood size was also observed in microbiota-fed nematodes. Moreover, massive accumulation of lipid droplets was revealed by BODIPY staining. Altered expression of nhr-49, pept-1, and tub-1 genes, associated with obesity phenotypes, was demonstrated by RT-qPCR. Since several pathways are evolutionarily conserved in C. elegans, our results highlight the nematode as a valuable model system to investigate the effects of a complex microbial consortium on host energy metabolism.
TI  - Production of corticotropin-releasing factor and urocortin from human monocyte-derived dendritic cells is stimulated by commensal bacteria in intestine.
AB  - AIM: To examine whether commensal bacteria are a contributing cause of stress-related mucosal inflammation. METHODS: Human peripheral blood monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) were stimulated by commensal bacterial strains, including Escherichia coli, Clostridium clostridioforme, Bacteroides vulgatus (B. vulgatus), Fusobacterium varium (F. varium), and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. After incubation, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and urocortin 1 (UCN1) mRNA in the cells was examined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Supernatants from the cells were tested for CRF and UCN1 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Both CRF and UCN1 were significantly augmented by B. vulgatus and F. varium at both the mRNA and protein levels. In particular, B. vulgatus stimulated human MoDCs, resulting in extremely high levels of CRF and UCN1. CONCLUSION: Stimulation of MoDCs by B. vulgatus and F. varium may be associated with CRF/UCN1-related intestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 during manufacture and storage of white brined cheese.
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a major foodborne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. Survival of E. coli O157:H7 during processing and storage of white brined cheese was investigated. Cheeses were prepared using pasteurized milk inoculated with a 4 strain E. coli O157:H7 cocktail (7 log(10) CFU/g) with or without yogurt starter culture (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) and stored in 10% or 15% NaCl brine at 10 and 21 masculineC for 28 d. NaCl concentration, water activity (a(w)), pH, and numbers of E. coli O157:H7 and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were determined in cheese and brine. E. coli O157:H7 was able to survive in cheese stored in both brines at 10 and 21 masculineC regardless of the presence of starter LAB, although the latter significantly enhanced E. coli O157:H7 reduction in cheese or its brine at 10 masculineC. E. coli O157:H7 numbers were reduced by 2.6 and 3.4 log(10) CFU/g in cheese stored in 10% and 15% NaCl brine, respectively, in the presence of starter LAB and by 1.4 and 2.3 log(10) CFU/g, respectively, in the absence of starter LAB at 10 masculineC. The pathogen survived, but at lower numbers in the brines. The salt concentration of cheese stored in 10% brine remained about 5% during ripening, but in 15% brine, the NaCl level increased 1.6% to 8.1% (w/w) by 28 d. Values of pH and a(w) slightly decreased 1 d after exposure to brine and reached 5.5 to 6.6 and 0.88 to 0.94, respectively, in all treatments.
TI  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii TUA4408L and its extracellular polysaccharides attenuate enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-induced inflammatory response in porcine intestinal epitheliocytes via Toll-like receptor-2 and 4.
AB  - SCOPE: Immunobiotics are known to modulate intestinal immune responses by regulating Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, which are responsible for the induction of cytokines and chemokines in response to microbial-associated molecular patterns. However, little is known about the immunomodulatory activity of compounds or molecules from immunobiotics. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated whether Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii TUA4408L (Ld) or its extracellular polysaccharide (EPS): acidic EPS (APS) and neutral EPS (NPS), modulated the response of porcine intestinal epitheliocyte (PIE) cells against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) 987P. The roles of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR negative regulators in the immunoregulatory effects were also studied. ETEC-induced inflammatory cytokines were downregulated when PIE cells were prestimulated with both Ld or EPSs. Ld, APS, and NPS inhibited ETEC mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation by upregulating TLR negative regulators. The capability of Ld to suppress inflammatory cytokines was diminished when PIE cells were blocked with anti-TLR2 antibody, while APS failed to suppress inflammatory cytokines when cells were treated with anti-TLR4 antibody. Induction of Ca(2)(+) fluxes in TLR knockdown cells confirmed that TLR2 plays a principal role in the immunomodulatory action of Ld, while the activity of APS is mediated by TLR4. In addition, NPS activity depends on both TLR4 and TLR2. CONCLUSION: Ld and its EPS have the potential to be used for the development of anti-inflammatory functional foods to prevent intestinal diseases in both humans and animals.
TI  - Characterization of pMC11, a plasmid with dual origins of replication isolated from Lactobacillus casei MCJ and construction of shuttle vectors with each replicon.
AB  - Many lactic acid bacteria carry different plasmids, particularly those that replicate via a theta mechanism. Here we describe Lactobacillus casei MCJ(CCTCC AB20130356), a new isolate that contains pMC11, carrying two distinct theta-type replicons. Each replicon contained an iteron in the origin of replication (oriV1 or oriV2) and a gene coding for the replicase (RepA_1 or RepB_1), both of which are essential for plasmid replication. Escherichia coli/Lactobacillus shuttle vectors were constructed with each replicon, yielding pEL5.7 and pEL5.6 that are based on oriV2 and oriV1 replicons, respectively. These plasmids showed distinct properties: pEL5.7 was capable of replicating in L. casei MCJDelta1 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactic LBCH-1 but failed to do so in two other tested lactobacilli strains whereas pEL5.6 replicated in three different strains, including L. casei MCJDelta1, L. casei NJ, Lactobacillus paracasei LPC-37 and L. delbrueckii subsp. lactic LBCH-1. Plasmid stability was studied: pEL5.6 and pEL5.7 were very stably maintained in L. casei, as the loss rate was lower than 1 % per generation. pEL5.7 was also stable in L. delbrueckii subsp. lactic LBCH-1 with the loss rate estimated to be 3 %. These vectors were employed to express a green fluorescent protein (GFP) using the promoter of S-layer protein SlpA from Lactobacillus acidophilus. And a growth-phase regulated expression of GFP was observed in different strains. In conclusion, these shuttle vectors provide efficient genetic tools for DNA cloning and heterologous gene expression in lactobacilli.
TI  - Improvement of intestinal microflora balance by polysaccharide from Physalis alkekengi var. francheti.
AB  - A watersoluble polysaccharide fraction (PPSB) was fractionated from Physalis alkekengi var. francheti and purified using DEAE52 Cellulose and Sephadex G200 chromatography. The physicochemical properties of PPSB and its molecular activities involved in the improvement of intestinal microflora balance were evaluated. PPSB (12.525.0 mg/ml) was shown to promote the growth of Lactobacillus delbrueckii and to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis identified Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Helicobacter, Prevotella, Enterococcus, Odoribacter, Alistipes and Akkermansia as dominant organisms in the intestinal tract of mice. PPSB exhibited stimulatory effects on the growth of probiotic bacteria but inhibitory effects on the growth of pathogenic bacteria in vitro. The number of species and quantity of the Lactobacillus genus increased significantly with increasing concentrations of PPSB in vivo. Experimental results of this study suggest that PPSB may improve intestinal microflora imbalances and therefore has strong potential as a natural agent for restoring the intestinal microflora balance.
TI  - In vitro anti-bacterial and anti-adherence effects of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus on Escherichia coli.
AB  - Considering the emergence of antibiotic resistance, scientists are interested in  using new antimicrobial agents in the treatment of infectious diseases including infections of the enteric systems. Lactic acid bacteria have the great potential to produce antimicrobial compounds that inhibit and control pathogenic bacteria. The aim of this study was to determine the anti-bacterial and anti-adherence properties of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus against Escherichia coli. The antibacterial activity of L. delbrueckii was investigated using disc diffusion and spot on lawn methods. In vitro anti-adhesion effect of L. delbrueckii against E. coli was examined using Caco-2 cells. In anti-adhesion assay, three competition conditions including competitive inhibition, adhesion inhibition, and displacement were examined. In spot on lawn method the zone of growth inhibition of E. coli by L. delbrueckii was 21.1 mm. The cell free supernatant of L. delbrueckii showed a good antibacterial activity against E. coli which was mainly related to lactic acid produced by L. delbrueckii. When two bacteria added simultaneously (competitive inhibition) degree of inhibition of E. coli binding by L. delbrueckii was 77%. In adhesion inhibition assay, L. delbrueckii was able to exclude E. coli adherence by around 43.5%. Displacement assay showed that L. delbrueckii had strong displacement ability toward E. coli and reduction of E. coli attachment by bound L. delbrueckii was 81.3%. The results suggest that L. delbrueckii may be able to inhibit E. coli infection in the gut; however more studies including in vivo studies need to be performed.
TI  - Utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  - Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS) are not digested in the proximal intestine. In distal intestine, HMOS collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the HMOS is not well defined. Here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated HMOS in anaerobic culture. This allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific HMOS on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. Most Bifidobacteria spp. and Bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-L-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL), 3-FL, and lactodifucotetraose (LDFT). Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC19258 exhibited slight growth, pH reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-FL or 3-FL, but not LDFT. Supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-SL) and 6'-SL promoted moderate growth of Bifidobacterium longum JCM7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, ATCC15708, Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC8482, and B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, SCFA, or both. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830 also consumed 6'-SL. In contrast, Clostridium spp., L. rhamnosus ATCC53103, E. faecalis ATCC29200, Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli K12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. Specific Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides differentially digest specific individual HMOS, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. This suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.
TI  - Efficient production of deoxynucleoside-5'-monophosphates using deoxynucleoside kinase coupled with a GTP-regeneration system.
AB  - Deoxynucleoside-5'-monophosphates (5'-dNMPs) are the basic components of DNA and  are widely used in medicine and as chemical and biochemical reagents. A large amount of effort has been expended to obtain 5'-dNMPs of high quality and at a low cost. However, these procedures are inefficient and inconvenient. In this study, deoxyadenosine-5'-monophosphate (5'-dAMP), 2,6-diaminopurine deoxynucleoside-5'-monophosphate (5'-dDAMP), and deoxycytidine-5'-monophosphate (5'-dCMP) were biosynthesized using recombinant N-deoxyribosyltransferase II (NDT-II), deoxycytidine kinase, and acetate kinase in a one-pot reaction system. The ndt-II gene from Lactobacillus delbrueckii, dck from Bacillus subtilus, and ack from Escherichia coli K12 were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Thymidine was used as the deoxyribose donor; GTP was used as the phosphate donor, and acetyl phosphate was used to regenerate GTP. Under optimized conditions, each 10 mM adenine, 10 mM 2,6-diaminopurine, or 10 mM cytosine were converted into 9.01 mM 5'-dAMP, 8.68 mM 5'-dDAMP, or 6.23 mM 5'-dCMP, respectively. The high yield indicated that this process of biosynthesis of 5'-dAMP, 5'-dDAMP, or 5'-dCMP was efficient and economical, and this one-pot system may also potentially be used for the preparation of other types of 5'-dNMPs.
TI  - The expression of adhesin EF-Tu in response to mucin and its role in Lactobacillus adhesion and competitive inhibition of enteropathogens to mucin.
AB  - AIMS: To analyse the expression of EF-Tu in Lactobacillus strains with response to mucin exposure and its role in interfering with adhesion of enteropathogens to mucin. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Lactobacillus strains were analysed for their ability to adhere to immobilized mucin in microtiter plates. Lactobacillus delbrueckii M and Lactobacillus plantarum CS24.2 showed statistically significant adhesion to mucin, which was similar to Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, the best binding probiotic strain. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lact. delbrueckii M, Lact. plantarum CS23 and Lact. plantarum CS24.2 were able to effectively antagonize the adhesion of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi to mucin. In the presence of Lactobacillus adhesin - EF-Tu, the adhesion of Lact. delbrueckii M and the strains of Lact. plantarum to mucin was significantly inhibited. Similarly, EF-Tu also reduced the adhesion of enteropathogens to mucin. Furthermore, the relative fold change in gene expression analysis showed significant up-regulation of EF-Tu gene in the strains of Lact. plantarum and Lact. delbrueckii M when exposed to mucin for 3 h. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows the significant role of EF-Tu in lactobacilli adhesion and enteropathogens inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study suggests EF-Tu as an important factor linked to the Lactobacillus adhesion as well as enteropathogen inhibition. Lactobacillus plantarum CS23 and Lact. plantarum CS24.2 can be used as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kefir protects vero cells from cytotoxicity by type-II shiga toxin from Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Kefir is a fermented-milk beverage originating and widely consumed in the Caucasus as well as in Eastern Europe and is a source of bacteria with potential probiotic properties. Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli producing Shiga toxin is commonly associated with food-transmitted diseases; the most prevalent serotype causing epidemics is Esch. coli O157:H7. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antagonism of Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kefir against the action on Vero cells of supernatants of the Esch. coli O157:H7 strain 69160 expressing the type-II Shiga toxin (Stx2) and to study the role of the Lactobacillus cell wall in that inhibition. Spent culture supernatants of Esch. coli O157:H7 strain 69160 led to cytotoxic effects on cultured eukaryotic cells as evidenced by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-bromide-cleavage assay or by lactate-dehyrogenase release. Lb. plantarum CIDCA 83114 reduced the cytotoxic activity of Stx present in strain-69160 supernatants, and this protection was markedly higher than those of Lactobacillus kefir CIDCA 83113 and 8348 and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CIDCA 333. This antagonism of cytotoxicity was mimicked by Lb. plantarum cell walls but was reduced after heating or protease treatments, thus indicating a protein or peptide as being involved in the protection mechanism. The cell surface of the lactobacilli bound the subunit B of Stx thereby decreasing the cytotoxicity. These interactions could constitute the first step in preventing the damage induced by Esch. coli O157:H7 supernatants, thus representing a valuable means of potentially mitigating the noxious effects of this food pathogen.
TI  - Development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in Thai fermented sausage.
AB  - To improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. Microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. A total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16S rRNA gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species, including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. After fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. The array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (Lactobacillus plantarum group, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. sakei, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Listeria monocytogenes) except L. animalis. Multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. The feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with Thai fermented sausages (Nham). Meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, L. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and L. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. The naturally-fermented Nham contained L. sakei, L. delbrueckii, L. plantarum and L. fermentum. The L. plantarum-inoculated Nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for L. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. The L. brevis-inoculated Nham contained L. brevis, L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. The array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. The naturally-fermented and L. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of L. plantarum on day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. In contrast, the L. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and L. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. The bacteria identification array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.
TI  - Assessment of the in vitro inhibitory activity of specific probiotic bacteria against different Escherichia coli strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are often associated with health-promoting effects. These live microorganisms, defined as probiotics, are commonly consumed as part of fermented foods, such as yoghurt and fermented milks, or as dietary supplements. Escherichia coli is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. As a part of the normal gut microbiota, this microorganism colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans within a few hours after birth. All E. coli strains can produce a wide variety of biogenic amines responsible for potentially harmful systemic intoxications. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli serotype O157:H7 is a pathotype of diarrhoeagenic strains with a large virulence plasmid pO157 able to produce 1 or more Shiga toxins. METHODS: The overall aim of this study was to determine the inhibitory effects of different strains of probiotics on E. coli serotypes, including E. coli O157:H7 (CQ9485). In particular, the antagonistic activity of 4 Bifidobacterium strains (Probiotical SpA, Italy) and 16 lactic acid bacteria, more specifically 14 Lactobacillus spp. and 2 Streptococcus spp., was assessed against selected E. coli biotypes (ATCC 8739, ATCC 10536, ATCC 35218, and ATCC 25922). The diarrhoeagenic serotype O157:H7 was also tested. RESULTS: The experimental data collected demonstrated an in vitro significant inhibitory effect of 6 Lactobacillus strains, namely L. rhamnosus LR04, L. rhamnosus LR06, L. plantarum LP01, L. plantarum LP02, L. pentosus LPS01, and L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii LDD01, and 2 Bifidobacterium strains, B. breve BR03 and B. breve B632. The inhibiting extent was slightly different among these strains, with L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii LDD01 showing the highest activity on E. coli O157:H7. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the probiotics studied are able to antagonize the growth of the 5 strains of E. coli tested, including the O157:H7 biotype, well known for their characteristic to produce a wide variety of biogenic amines considered responsible for dangerous systemic intoxications.
TI  - The innovative potential of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LR06, Lactobacillus pentosus  LPS01, Lactobacillus plantarum LP01, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii Subsp. delbrueckii LDD01 to restore the "gastric barrier effect" in patients chronically treated with PPI: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a very widespread condition. In Europe, it is estimated that about 175 million people suffer from this disease and have to chronically take drugs to increase gastric pH. The proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole are the most widely used drug typology in this regard. However, the inhibition of normal gastric acid secretion has important side effects, the most important being bacterial overgrowth in the stomach and duodenum with a concentration of >10(5) viable cells/mL. As a major consequence of this, many harmful or even pathogenic bacteria contained in some foods could survive the gastric transit and colonize either the stomach itself, the duodenum, or the gut, where they could establish acute and even chronic infections with unavoidable consequences for the host's health. In other words, the "gastric barrier effect" is strongly reduced or even disrupted. To date, there are no real strategies to deal with this widespread, although still relatively little known, problem. The aim of this study was to confirm the gastric bacterial overgrowth in long-term PPI consumers and to assess the efficacy of some probiotic bacteria, belonging to both genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, in the reduction of gastric and duodenal bacterial overgrowth, therefore partially restoring the gastric barrier effect against foodborne pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: For this purpose, probiotics with a strong demonstrated inhibitory activity on gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, were tested in a human intervention trial involving a total of 30 subjects treated with PPIs for either 3 to 12 consecutive months (short-term) or >12 consecutive months (long-term). An additional 10 subjects not taking PPIs were enrolled and used as a control group representing the general population. Four selected probiotics Probiotical SpA (Novara, Italy), namely Lactobacillus rhamnosus LR06 (DSM 21981), Lactobacillus pentosus LPS01 (DSM 21980), Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 (LMG P-21021), and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii LDD01 (DSM 22106) were administered for 10 days to 10 subjects treated with PPIs for >12 months (group B). In the 60 mg formulation, N-acetylcysteine was included as well in light of its well-known mechanical effects on bacterial biofilms. Gastroscopies were performed at the beginning of the study (d0) in all the groups (A, B, C, and D) and after 10 days (d10) in group B only; that is, at the end of probiotics intake. The total viable cells and total Lactobacillus were quantified in gastric juice and duodenal brushing material from all subjects. The results were compared among all the groups and with the control subjects (group D) to confirm the bacterial overgrowth. A comparison was made also between d0 and d10 in group B to quantify the efficacy of the 4 probiotics administered for 10 days. Fecal samples were collected from all groups at d0, including subjects not treated with PPIs, and in group B only at d10. Specific bacterial classes, namely enterococci, total coliforms, E. coli, molds, and yeasts were quantified in all fecal specimens. RESULTS: The results collected confirmed the strong bacterial overgrowth in the stomach and duodenum of people treated with PPIs compared with subjects with a normal intragastric acidity. It is also worth noting that the bacterial cell counts in subjects who underwent a long-term treatment with a PPI were greater than the results from subjects taking these drugs for 3 to 12 months. The intake of 4 specific probiotic strains with a marked antagonistic activity towards 5 E. coli bacteria, including the enterohaemorrhagic O157:H7 strain, and an effective amount of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was able to significantly reduce bacterial overgrowth in long-term PPI-treated subjects. Total lactobacilli represented the major percentage of bacterial counts, thus demonstrating the ability of such bacteria to colonize the stomach and the duodenum, at least temporarily, and to consequently restore the gastric barrier effect. A significant decrease in fecal enterococci, total coliforms, E. coli, molds, and yeasts in subjects treated with PPIs was recorded at the end of probiotics supplementation (d10) compared with baseline (d0) in group B. This is a further confirmation of the barrier effect also exerted at the stomach level. CONCLUSIONS: PPIs are the most widely sold and used drugs in the world. However, the chronic use of these pharmacological molecules exposes the subject to the risk of foodborne infections as most pathogens are able to survive the gastric transit in a condition of significantly decreased acidity.
TI  - In vitro effects on intestinal bacterium of physalins from Physalis alkekengi var. Francheti.
AB  - Intestinal probiotic bacterium stimulative activity-guided fractionation of Physalis alkekengi var. Francheti calyces extract resulted in the isolation of four new physalins (1-4). Their structures were elucidated as 5alpha, 6beta-dihydroxy-25, 27-dihydro-7-deoxyphysalin A (1), 5alpha, 6beta-dihydroxyphysalin R (2), 3beta-hydroxy-2-hydrophysalin A (3) and 5alpha-hydroxy-7-dehydro-25, 27-dihydro-7-deoxyneophysalin A (4) by UV, MS, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Growth curves of Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Escherichia coli for different total physalins extract (TPE) concentrations were tested in vitro. Middle concentrations (0.78mg/mL-1.56mg/mL) of TPE promoted the growth of L. delbrueckii, but all inhibited the growth of E. coli, in which the bacteriostatic activity increased while TPE concentration increases. Physalins showed stimulative effects on the growth of probiotic bacteria but inhibitory effects on the growth of pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Lactobacilli differently regulate expression and secretion of CXCL8 in urothelial cells.
AB  - Modulation of the immune response is an established feature of certain lactobacilli. CXCL8 is an inflammatory chemokine released by the urinary tract mucosa after contact with uropathogenic Escherichia coli during urinary tract infection and is crucial for proper infiltration of immune cells. Nevertheless, persistently high levels of CXCL8 are associated with pathogenicity and malignancy. In this study, we tested twelve Lactobacillus strains for their ability to influence CXCL8 release from urothelial cells. We evaluated how strains from different Lactobacillus species could regulate CXCL8 in human 5637 urothelial cells, either resting cells or cells concomitantly challenged with heat-killed E. coli. A majority of the tested species altered CXCL8 release from the urothelial cells after 24 hours of stimulation. Most species increased CXCL8 release, whereas a few lactobacilli efficiently suppressed CXCL8 secretion from E. coli-challenged cells. While strong CXCL8 modulators such as Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus delbrueckii were unable to degrade CXCL8 in the extracellular environment, effects on IL8 transcription were evident for selected lactobacilli. Although IL8 transcription was affected by lactobacilli, the influence on mRNA transcript did not correlate to the impact on CXCL8 release. Phylogenetic analysis based on a 16S rRNA dendrogram of the tested lactobacilli and their effect on CXCL8 revealed some linkage to specific Lactobacillus groups. Testing the immunomodulatory nature of lactobacilli can prove important when selecting new probiotic microbes. Moreover, we believe that phylogenetic and phenotypic similarities could be used to analyse the traits governing such modulation.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  - Strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included Lactobacillus casei/Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Pediococcus acidilactici. The susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in Escherichia coli for comparison. Analysis of L. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. E. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and florfenicol. No extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.
TI  - [Isolation and characterization of vaginal lactobacilli producing hydrogen peroxide].
AB  - AIM: Isolation and characteristics of vaginal lactobacilli that actively generate H2O2 and have high antagonistic activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Staphylococcus aureus 8956, Escherichia coli 8852, Klebsiella pneumoniae 8795 and Candida albicans 5646 were used as target-strains. Skim milk and MRS medium were used for lactobacilli isolation and cultivation. Antagonism was studied in complete agar and Saburo medium. Merckoquant peroxide test (Merck) stripes were used for the determination of H2O2. Antibacterial activity was determined by diffusion into agar. Specific culture growth rate was determined by conventional method, acidification of the culture medium--by pH-meter. RESULTS: 12 strains were isolated from vaginal smears of healthy women. These strains have an ability to ferment milk among which a highly active H2O2 producer was isolated and attributed to Lactobacillus delbrueckii by the results of 16S rRNA and alpha-subunit RNA polymerase gene sequence analysis (16S rDNA and rpoA genes are registered in GenBank, numbers HQ379171 and HQ379180 respectively). L. delbrueckii MH-10 bacterial cells were characterized by specific growth speed 1.26 per hour, reaching a maximum titer of 2 x 10(9) PFU/ml with lowering medium pH to 4.0. Under aerated conditions H2O2 concentration reached 100 microg/ml or more. L. delbrueckii MH-10 has high antibacterial activity against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: L. delbrueckii MH-10 isolate is an active H2O2 producer, has high growth speed and broad antibacterial activity spectrum, is a perspective candidate for the development of probiotic preparation for the prophylaxis and therapy of vaginoses.
TI  - Development of a continuous assay and steady-state characterization of Escherichia coli threonine synthase.
AB  - Threonine synthase (TS) catalyzes the hydrolysis of O-phospho-L-homoserine (OPHS) to produce L-threonine (L-Thr) and inorganic phosphate. Here, we report a simplified purification protocol for the OPHS substrate and a continuous, coupled-coupled, spectrophotometric TS assay. The sequential actions of threonine deaminase (TD) and hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase (HO-HxoDH) convert the L-Thr product of TS to alpha-ketobutyrate (alpha-KB) and then to 2-hydroxybutyrate, respectively, and are monitored as the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm resulting from the concomitant oxidation of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to NAD(+) by HO-HxoDH. The effect of pH on the activities of Escherichia coli TD and Lactobacillus delbrueckii HO-HxoDH was determined to establish this continuous assay as suitable for steady-state characterization and to facilitate the optimization of coupling enzyme concentrations under different assay conditions to enable studies of TS across phyla. To validate this assay, TS from E. coli was characterized. The kinetic parameters (k(cat)=4s(-1) and K(m)=0.34 mM) and the pH optimum of 8.7, determined using the continuous assay, are consistent with values reported for this enzyme based on the discontinuous malachite green assay. The k(cat)/K(m)(OPHS) versus pH profile of E. coli TS is bell-shaped, and the apparent pK(a) values for the acidic and basic limbs are 7.1 and 10.4, respectively.
TI  - Design of nanoemulsion-based delivery systems of natural antimicrobials: effect of the emulsifier.
AB  - This work aims at investigating the effect of the nanoemulsion delivery systems on the antimicrobial activity of different essential oil components. Carvacrol, limonene and cinnamaldehyde were encapsulated in the sunflower oil droplets of nanoemulsions prepared by high pressure homogenization and stabilized by different emulsifiers: (a) lecithin, (b) pea proteins, (c) sugar ester and (d) a combination of Tween 20 and glycerol monooleate. The antimicrobial activity was measured against three different microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The measured antimicrobial activity was significantly affected by the formulation of the nanoemulsion, where the different bioactive compounds were encapsulated. In particular, the effect of the delivery systems on the antimicrobial activity was correlated to the concentration of the essential oil components in the aqueous phase in equilibrium with the nanoemulsion droplets, suggesting that the ability of the active molecules to interact with cell membranes is associated to their dissolution in the aqueous phase. These considerations can lead to a more rational design of the nanoemulsion-based delivery systems for essential oils, based on the opportune choice of the emulsifiers in dependence of the desired function of the antimicrobials within the food system.
TI  - Evaluation of waste chicken feathers as peptone source for bacterial growth.
AB  - AIMS: Peptones are one of the most expensive constituents of microbial media. This study was undertaken to prepare the peptone from waste chicken feathers through a new process. METHODS AND RESULTS: The chemical analysis of chicken feather peptone (CFP) was performed. The ability of CFP to support the growth of the three test bacteria in liquid and agar media was comparable to those of three commercial peptones [tryptone peptone (TP), fish peptone and protease peptone (PP)]. CONCLUSIONS: CFP was found to be rich in ash (42.1 g 100 g(-)(1)), protein (55.8 g 100 g(-)(1)) and mineral contents. The maximum biomass yield (3.13 g l(-)(1)) and colony number (83 x 10(8) CFU ml(-)(1) for bacterium Bacillus subtilis were attained with CFP. The maximum biomass yields and colony numbers for Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Escherichia coli were reached in TP medium. Second high biomass yield (2.64 g l(-)(1)) and colony number (75 x 10(8) CFU ml(-)(1)) for E. coli were achieved using CFP. Third high biomass yield (1.29 g l(-)(1)) and colony number (90 x 10(7) CFU ml(-)(1)) for Lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus were obtained in CFP medium. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Usability of waste chicken feathers as substrate for bacteria was investigated for the first time in the present study. The peptone may be used in industrial fermentations for production of antibiotics, organic acids, enzymes and biopolymer. It may be also used in clinical microbiology. A new chemical process was developed for peptone preparation. This process may be also employed for peptone preparation from other organic materials, especially fibrose protein-containing materials.
TI  - Antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. Intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. However, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. The benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. This study was performed to evaluate the interaction between Lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. RESULTS: Strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in McConkey Agar and identified using PCR with species-specific primers, and the BBL Enterotube II system for Enterobacteriaceae. Gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. The average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) CFU/g of faeces (p = 0.015). The following strains were identified: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterococcus faecalis. Then, 27 Lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii DSM 20074 and L. plantarum MB 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that two out of 27 strains of Lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. Our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which Lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.
TI  - Microbial growth at hyperaccelerations up to 403,627 x g.
AB  - It is well known that prokaryotic life can withstand extremes of temperature, pH, pressure, and radiation. Little is known about the proliferation of prokaryotic life under conditions of hyperacceleration attributable to extreme gravity, however. We found that living organisms can be surprisingly proliferative during hyperacceleration. In tests reported here, a variety of microorganisms, including Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Paracoccus denitrificans, and Shewanella amazonensis; Gram-positive Lactobacillus delbrueckii; and eukaryotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were cultured while being subjected to hyperaccelerative conditions. We observed and quantified robust cellular growth in these cultures across a wide range of hyperacceleration values. Most notably, the organisms P. denitrificans and E. coli were able to proliferate even at 403,627 x g. Analysis shows that the small size of prokaryotic cells is essential for their proliferation under conditions of hyperacceleration. Our results indicate that microorganisms cannot only survive during hyperacceleration but can display such robust proliferative behavior that the habitability of extraterrestrial environments must not be limited by gravity.
TI  - Purification, identification, and characterization of methylcobalamin from Spirulina platensis.
AB  - The present study reports methylcobalamin in Spirulina platensis using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), microbiological assay, chemiluminescence assay, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Extraction of vitamin B12 from S. platensis was carried out without using cyanide. Partial purification was achieved using Amberlite XAD-2 followed by elution with 80% (v/v) methanol. Activated charcoal facilitated removal of impurities in S. platensis extract and in further purification of vitamin B12. The purified fraction was identified to contain methylcobalamin as analyzed by HPLC and TLC. Authenticity of methylcobalamin was further confirmed by LC-MS and MS/MS. Quantitation of methylcobalamin in a test sample of S. platensis biomass was performed using microbiological assay and chemiluminescence assay and was found to be 38.5+/-2 and 35.7+/-2 mug/100 g of dry biomass, respectively.
TI  - Effect of size, quaternary structure and translational error on the static and dynamic heterogeneity of beta-galactosidase and measurement of electrophoretic dynamic heterogeneity.
AB  - Single enzyme molecule assays were performed using capillary electrophoresis-based protocols on beta-galactosidase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus helveticus and Bacillus circulans. The enzyme was found to show static heterogeneity with respect to catalytic rate and the variance in rate increased with protein size. This is consistent with the proposal that random errors in translation may be an important underlying component of enzyme heterogeneity. Additionally these enzymes were found to show static heterogeneity with respect to electrophoretic mobility. Comparison of wild-type and rpsL E. coli beta-galactosidase expressed in the presence and absence of streptomycin suggested that increases in error do not result in detectable increases in the dynamic heterogeneity of activity with increasing temperature. Finally, a method was developed to measure the dynamic heterogeneity in electrophoretic mobility.
TI  - Characterization of a novel LysM domain from Lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The endolysin Lyb5, from Lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phiPYB5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria. Sequence analysis revealed that the C terminus of the endolysin Lyb5 (Ly5C) contained three putative lysin motif (LysM) repeat regions, implying that Ly5C was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. To investigate the potential of Ly5C for surface display, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to Ly5C at its N or C terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. After being mixed with various cells in vitro, GFP was successfully displayed on the surfaces of Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lb. brevis, Lb. plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus cells. Increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated L. lactis and Lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for Ly5C. Moreover, the pH and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of GFP-Ly5C, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. All results suggested that Ly5C was a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (LAB). To demonstrate the applicability of the Ly5C-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) from Paenibacillus sp. strain K1, replacing GFP, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of LAB cells via Ly5C. The success in surface display of GFP and beta-Gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in LAB.
TI  - Characterization of a cryptic plasmid pD403 from Lactobacillus plantarum and construction of shuttle vectors based on its replicon.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid pD403 was isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum D403 derived from fermented dairy products. It was 2,791 bp in size with a G+C content of 37%. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2. ORF1 (318 amino acids) was identified as a replication protein (RepA). ORF2 (137 amino acids) shared 31% similarity with the transcriptional regulator of Ralstonia pickettii 12D. Functional investigation indicated that ORF2 (Tra) had the ability of improving the transformation efficiency. The origin of replication was predicted, suggesting that pD403 was a rolling-circle-replication (RCR) plasmid. An Escherichia coli/Lactobacillus shuttle vector pCD4032 was constructed based on the pD403 replicon, and proved to be successfully transformed into various lactobacilli including Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus brevis. The transformation efficiencies were ranged from 1.3 x 10(2) to 7 x 10(4) transformants per microgram DNA. Furthermore, an expression vector pCD4033 was developed with the promoter of the lactate dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii 11842. The green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a reporter was expressed successfully in various lactobacilli tested, suggesting that the expression vector pCD4033 had the potential to be used as a molecular tool for heterologous gene cloning and expression in lactobacilli.
TI  - Control of directionality in bacteriophage mv4 site-specific recombination: functional analysis of the Xis factor.
AB  - The integrase of the temperate bacteriophage mv4 catalyzes site-specific recombination between the phage attP site and the host attB site during Lactobacillus delbrueckii lysogenization. The mv4 prophage is excised during the induction of lytic growth. Excisive site-specific recombination between the attR and attL sites is also catalyzed by the phage-encoded recombinase, but the directionality of the recombination is determined by a second phage-encoded protein, the recombination directionality factor (RDF). We have identified and functionally characterized the RDF involved in site-specific excision of the prophage genome. The mv4 RDF, (mv4)Xis, is encoded by the second gene of the early lytic operon. It is a basic protein of 56 amino acids. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that (mv4)Xis binds specifically to the attP and attR sites via two DNA-binding sites, introducing a bend into the DNA. In vitro experiments and in vivo recombination assays with plasmids in Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus plantarum demonstrated that (mv4)Xis is absolutely required for inter- or intramolecular recombination between the attR and attL sites. In contrast to the well-known phage site-specific recombination systems, the integrative recombination between the attP and attB sites seems not to be inhibited by the presence of (mv4)Xis.
TI  - Exploring the acidotolerance of beta-galactosidase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus: an attractive enzyme for lactose bioconversion.
AB  - The LacZ gene encoding beta-galactosidase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 (L. bulgaricus) was cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli, followed by purification and characterization of the protein. The recombinant enzyme was shown to be a homotetramer and could be distinguished from homologues by its relatively low and broad optimal temperature range, from 35 to 50 degrees C, coupled with an optimal pH of 5.0-5.5. Remarkably, the E491A mutant showed the same optimal temperature, but displayed an optimal pH at 6.5-7.0. Whilst these beta-galactosidases are inhibited by Cu(2+) they require only 1mM Mn(2+) and 1mM Co(2+) for optimal activity and thermostability. The wild-type enzyme was remarkably stable at acid pH values when compared to mutant E491A. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the E491A mutation affected catalysis rather than enzyme affinity. Furthermore, the wild-type protein efficiently cleaved lactose extracted from whey; however, in milk the E491A mutant showed the highest lactose bioconversion rate. Thus, these enzymes are interesting at the industrial level for hydrolysis of lactose extracted from whey or milk, and thus could contribute to overcoming the lactose intolerance problem generated by milk products.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a strain-dependent cystathionine beta/gamma-lyase in Lactobacillus casei potentially involved in cysteine biosynthesis.
AB  - The trans-sulfuration pathways allow the interconversion of cysteine and methionine with the intermediary formation of cystathionine and homocysteine. The genome database of Lactobacillus casei ATCC 334 provides evidence that this species cannot synthesize cysteine from methionine via the trans-sulfuration pathway. However, several L. casei strains use methionine as the sole sulfur source, which implies that these strains can convert methionine to cysteine. Cystathionine synthases and lyases play a crucial role in the trans-sulfuration pathway. By applying proteomic techniques, we have identified a protein in cell-free extracts of L. casei, which showed high homology to a gene product encoded in the genome of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus but not in the genome of L. casei ATCC 334. The presence of the gene was only found in strains able to grow on methionine as the sole sulfur source. Moreover, two gene variants were identified. Both gene variants were cloned and expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzymes exhibited cystathionine lyase activity in vitro and also cleaved cysteine, homocysteine and methionine releasing volatile sulfur compounds.
TI  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii UFV-H2b20 induces type 1 cytokine production by mouse cells in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii UFV-H2b20 has been shown to increase clearance of bacteria injected into the blood of germ-free mice. Moreover, it induces the production of type 1 cytokines by human peripheral mononuclear cells. The objective of the present study was to investigate the production of inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-12 (IL-12 p40), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)] triggered in vitro by live, heat-killed or lysozyme-treated L. delbrueckii UFV-H2b20 and in vivo by a live preparation. Germ-free, L. delbrueckii-monoassociated and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-resistant C3H/HeJ mice were used as experimental models. UFV-H2b20 induced the production of IL-12 p40 and TNF-alpha by peritoneal cells and IFN-gamma by spleen cells from germ-free or monoassociated Swiss/NIH mice and LPS-hyporesponsive mice (around 40 ng/mL for IL-12 p40, 200 pg/mL for TNF-alpha and 10 ng/mL for IFN-gamma). Heat treatment of L. delbrueckii did not affect the production of these cytokines. Lysozyme treatment decreased IL-12 p40 production by peritoneal cells from C3H/HeJ mice, but did not affect TNF-alpha production by these cells or IFN-gamma production by spleen cells from the same mouse strain. TNF-alpha production by peritoneal cells from Swiss/NIH L. delbrueckii-monoassociated mice was inhibited by lysozyme treatment. When testing IL-12 p40 and IFN-gamma levels in sera from germ-free or monoassociated Swiss/NIH mice systemically challenged with Escherichia coli we observed that IL-12 p40 was produced at marginally higher levels by monoassociated mice than by germ-free mice (40 vs 60 ng/mL), but IFN-gamma was produced earlier and at higher levels by monoassociated mice (monoassociated 4 and 14 ng/mL 4 and 8 h after infection, germfree 0 and 7.5 ng/mL at the same times). These results show that L. delbrueckii UFV-H2b20 stimulates the production of type 1 cytokines in vitro and in vivo, therefore suggesting that L. delbrueckii might have adjuvant properties in infection in which these cytokines play a major role.
TI  - [Construction and property study of recombinant Lactococcus lactis with non-fusion expressing of beta-galactosidase].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct recombinant Lactococcus lactis strains exhibiting high beta-galactosidase activity in non-fusion way, and study their enzyme activities and enzyme secretion rates. METHODS: The recombinant plasmids pMG36e-lacZ 1.1480 and pMG36e-lacZ wch9901 which could express beta-galactosidase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in non-fusion way in Escherichia coli were obtained and transformed into Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MG1363. The beta-galactosidase activity of resulting recombinant L. lactis in different incubation periods and lactose concentrations, and their enzyme secretion rates in different culture conditions were examined. RESULTS: Recombinant L. lactis carrying pMG36e-lacZ wch9901 (MG1363/pMG36e-lacZ wch9901) exhibited the highest beta-galactosidase activity. Its enzyme activity was (16.95 +/- 0.09) U/mg pro, which was 2.75 folds of that of the native counterpart; recombinant L. lactis reached its enzyme producing peak after grown for 24 h; decreased enzyme activity of recombinant L. lactis were observed when incubated in medium containing lactose; the beta-galactosidase expressed by recombinant strains could be secreted into the culture medium, and the highest secretion rate (27.09 +/- 0.05)% was observed when the culture medium contained 20 g/L of lactose and without erythromycin. CONCLUSION: High level expression of non-fusion beta-galactosidase with secretion in recombinant L. lactis strains was obtained. This will be very helpful for the further developing of live delivery bacteria of beta-galactosidase.
TI  - [Beta-galactosidase gene from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus gets non-fusion expression in Escherichia coli].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct the food-grade recombinant probiotic strain with high activity beta-galactosidase, the beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ)from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was in non-fusion expressed in Escherichia coli. METHODS: From Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lacZ gene, the DNA sequence containing Shine-Dalgarno (SD) and ATGA sequences between upstream 18 bp and downstream 1 bp at start codon ATG was selected as upstream primer for PCR amplifying lacZ gene. Then lacZ cDNA was inserted into expression plasmid pMG36e to construct recombinant expression plasmid. Recombinant plasmids were introduced into E. coli, and positive clones were screened. To identify the gene recombination, the recombinant plasmid was cut by restriction enzyme and sequenced. To identify the protein expression, the beta-galactosidase activities of recombinant strains were determined. RESULTS: The restriction maps of recombinant plasmids were acceptable. The gene inserted into the recombinant plasmid had more than 99% homology with the lacZ gene of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The enzyme activity and enzyme activity ratio of E. coli DH5 alpha carrying pMG36e-lacZ 1.1480 were 3.074 U/mL and 6.939 U/mg pro respectively. The enzyme activity and enzyme activity ratio of E. coli DH5a carrying pMG36e-lacZ wch9901 were 4.755 U/mL and 8.537 U/mg pro respectively. CONCLUSION: lacZ from Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus have gotten non-fusion expression in E. coli. The SD and ATGA sequences we selected can introduce lacZ non-fusion expression in E. coli.
TI  - Probiotics protect mice against experimental infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our group has concerned itself with the study of the effect of probiotics on the resistance to infections using experimental models. Here, we will focus on evidence that the UFV-H2b20 strain of Lactobacillus delbrueckii var. bulgaricus may be considered a probiotic and has protective effects on mice against a variety of bacterial infections. METHODS: Germ-free, monoassociated, and conventional mice were used. Mice were treated with probiotics and challenged with Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, or Listeria monocytogenes, and the outcome of infection was measured as mortality, quantification of bacteria in target organs, and systemic of local cytokine production. RESULTS: L. delbrueckii increased clearance of E. coli and production of systemic inflammatory cytokines. This strain also protected monoassociated and conventional mice against infection with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. Finally, monoassociated mice were more resistant to L. monocytogenes as measured by mortality and the number of bacteria in spleen and liver. In addition, monoassociated mice challenged with L. monocytogenes showed increased production of inflammatory cytokines (interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and nitric oxide. Interestingly, interleukin-10 levels were not altered by monoassociation or infection. CONCLUSIONS: L. delbrueckii UFV-H2b20 protects mice against infection, apparently by eliciting the up-regulation of production of inflammatory cytokines.
TI  - Lactobacilli antagonize biological effects of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli in vitro.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the effect of two lactobacilli on the biological activity of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: Strains CIDCA 133 (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and CIDCA 83114 (Lactobacillus plantarum) were studied. Hep-2 cells were used as an in vitro model to assess the biological effect of a clinical isolate of EHEC. Preincubation of cell monolayers with lactobacilli before EHEC prevented detachment of eukaryotic cells and minimizes both F-actin rearrangements and morphological alterations. Interestingly, the protective effect could not be ascribed to pathogen exclusion. In addition, viability of the lactobacilli was not necessary for protection and other species of the genus Lactobacillus failed to protect eukaryotic cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that lactobacilli are antagonizing virulence mechanisms of EHEC either by modification of the microenvironment or by interfering with the signalling cascades triggered by the pathogen. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our findings give a rationale basis for the use of specific probiotic strains for the prophylaxis and prevention of intestinal infections due to EHEC.
TI  - Bidirectional cell-surface anchoring function of C-terminal repeat region of peptidoglycan hydrolase of Lactococcus lactis IL1403.
AB  - With the aim of constructing an efficient protein display system for lactic acid  bacteria (LABs), the effect of fusion direction on the cell-surface binding activity of the C-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (CPH) of Lactococcus lactis IL1403 was studied. CPH fused to the alpha-amylase (AMY) of Streptococcus bovis 148 either at its C-terminus (CPH-AMY) or at its N-terminus (AMY-CPH) was expressed intracellularly in Escherichia coli. This domain was able to direct binding of AMY to the surface of L. lactis ATCC 19435 in both constructs. However, the number of bound molecules per cell and the specific activity for starch digestion in the case of CPH-AMY were 3 and 14 times greater than those in the case of AMY-CPH, respectively. Of the LABs tested, L. lactis ATCC 19435 showed the highest binding capability for CPH-AMY, up to 6 x 10(4) molecules per cell, with a dissociation rate constant of 5.00 x 10(-5) s(-1). The binding of CPH-AMY to the surface of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC 9649 cells was very stable with a dissociation rate constant of 6.96 x 10(-6) s(-1). The production of CPH-AMY in the soluble form increased 3-fold as a result of coexpression with a molecular chaperone, trigger factor. The results of this study suggest the usefulness of CPH as a bidirectional anchor protein for the production of cell-surface adhesive enzymes in E. coli. Furthermore, the importance of the fusion direction of CPH in determining cell-surface binding and enzymatic activities was shown.
TI  - Production of D-lactic acid by Corynebacterium glutamicum under oxygen deprivation.
AB  - In mineral salts medium under oxygen deprivation, Corynebacterium glutamicum exhibits high productivity of L-lactic acid accompanied with succinic and acetic acids. In taking advantage of this elevated productivity, C. glutamicum was genetically modified to produce D-lactic acid. The modification involved expression of fermentative D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH)-encoding genes from Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus delbrueckii in L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH)-encoding ldhA-null C. glutamicum mutants to yield strains C. glutamicum DeltaldhA/pCRB201 and C. glutamicum DeltaldhA/pCRB204, respectively. The productivity of C. glutamicum DeltaldhA/pCRB204 was fivefold higher than that of C. glutamicum DeltaldhA/pCRB201. By using C. glutamicum DeltaldhA/pCRB204 cells packed to a high density in mineral salts medium, up to 1,336 mM (120 g l(-1)) of D-lactic acid of greater than 99.9% optical purity was produced within 30 h.
TI  - A novel bacteriocin-like substance produced by Enterococcus faecium 3587.
AB  - Secretion of a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance from Enterococcus faecium 3587 is described herein for the first time. Whereas some bacteriocins receive their denomination based on the species or genus name of the producer microorganism, the newly discovered bacteriocin-like substance was named "enterocin 3587." The growth characteristics of the producer strain, as well as the type of production and the primary characteristic of the peptide, were investigated. It was found by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that the molecule possesses a molecular weight <6.5 kDa; its secretion is growth-phase dependent; and it shows activities only against other closely related enterococci but not against other Gram-positive bacteria, such as L. innocua, S. aureus 209, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii B2, nor against some Gram-negative species, such as Escherichia coli HB101.
TI  - Isolation, taxonomic identification and hydrogen peroxide production by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis T31, isolated from Mongolian yoghurt: inhibitory activity on food-borne pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this work was to isolate lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains from Mongolian tarag (a traditionally homemade yoghurt) displaying antimicrobial activities against food-borne pathogens, identify inhibitory substances and study the kinetics of their production. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inhibitory substance-producing bacterial strains were isolated from tarag. From 300 bacterial clones, 31 were able to inhibit the growth of the indicator strain Lactobacillus bulgaricus 340. One of the most active strains was identified as Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis strain T31 by using cluster analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) DNA fingerprints. The antimicrobial substance was inactivated by catalase, demonstrating the production of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Production of H(2)O(2) was studied under aerated and nonaerated culture conditions. The amount of H(2)O(2) in the culture supernatant increased during bacterial growth and reached a maximum (5.12 mmol l(-1)) at the early stationary phase under aerated conditions (agitated cultures). H(2)O(2) was not detected in the culture performed without agitation. In mixed cultures performed in milk with either Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis T31 in the presence of Escherichia coli, or Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis T31 in the presence of Listeria innocua under aerated and nonaerated conditions, a significant decrease in pathogen count was observed in aerated cultures. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The significant decrease in Listeria viability observed in aerated mixed cultures of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis T31 is mainly because of H(2)O(2) production. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis T31 could be used as a protective culture in food industries or as a probiotic to prevent intestinal and urogenital infections.
TI  - Purification and characterization of corrinoid-compounds from the dried powder of an edible cyanobacterium, Nostoc commune (Ishikurage).
AB  - Vitamin B12 content (98.8 +/- 5.6 microg/100 g dry weight) of an edible cyanobacterium, Nostoc commune (Ishikurage) was determined by the Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC 7830 microbiological method. Bioautography with vitamin B12-dependent Escherichia coli 215 indicated that N. commune contained two (main and minor) corrinoid-compounds. These corrinoid-compounds were purified to homogeneity from the dried algal cells and characterized. The main and minor purified corrinoid-compounds were identified as pseudovitamin B12 and vitamin B12, respectively, on the basis of silica gel 60 TLC, C18 reversed-phase HPLC, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and UV-visible spectroscopy. These results suggest that the bacterial cells are not suitable for use as a vitamin B12 source, especially in vegetarians.
TI  - Comparative sequence analysis of plasmids from Lactobacillus delbrueckii and construction of a shuttle cloning vector.
AB  - While plasmids are very commonly associated with the majority of the lactic acid  bacteria, they are only very rarely associated with Lactobacillus delbrueckii, with only four characterized to date. In this study, the complete sequence of a native plasmid, pDOJ1, from a strain of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was determined. It consisted of a circular DNA molecule of 6,220 bp with a G+C content of 44.6% and a characteristic ori and encoded six open reading frames (ORFs), of which functions could be predicted for three-a mobilization (Mob) protein, a transposase, and a fused primase-helicase replication protein. Comparative analysis of pDOJ1 and the other available L. delbrueckii plasmids (pLBB1, pJBL2, pN42, and pLL1212) revealed a very similar organization and amino acid identities between 85 and 98% for the putative proteins of all six predicted ORFs from pDOJ1, reflecting a common origin for L. delbrueckii plasmids. Analysis of the fused primase-helicase replication gene found a similar fused organization only in the theta replicating group B plasmids from Streptococcus thermophilus. This observation and the ability of the replicon to function in S. thermophilus support the idea that the origin of plasmids in L. delbrueckii was likely from S. thermophilus. This may reflect the close association of these two species in dairy fermentations, particularly yogurt production. As no vector based on plasmid replicons from L. delbrueckii has previously been constructed, an Escherichia coli-L. delbrueckii shuttle cloning vector, pDOJ4, was constructed from pDOJ1, the p15A ori, the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pCI372, and the lacZ polylinker from pUC18. This cloning vector was successfully introduced into E. coli, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis. This shuttle cloning vector provides a new tool for molecular analysis of Lactobacillus delbrueckii and other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Single independent operator sites are involved in the genetic switch of the Lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  - The lysogeny region of the Lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4 contains two divergently oriented ORFs coding for the Rep (221 aa) and Tec (64 aa) proteins. The transcription of these two genes was analysed by primer extension and Northern blot experiments on lysogenic strains. The location of the transcription initiation sites of rep and tec in the intergenic region allowed the identification of the divergently oriented non overlapping promoters P(rep) and P(tec). Transcriptional fusions analysis showed that Rep negatively regulates the P(tec) promoter and activates its own transcription, and that Tec is a negative regulator of the two promoters. As demonstrated by gel mobility shift assays, the repressor Rep binds to a single specific 17 bp site located between the P(tec) -10 and -35 regions whereas Tec binds to a single specific 40 bp long complex operator site located between the two promoters. The presence of a single specific operator site for each repressor in the intergenic region is an unusual feature.
TI  - Factors influencing autoaggregation and aggregation of Lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp. bulgaricus isolated from handmade yogurt.
AB  - Of 26 Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains isolated from yogurt, strains B2 and 22, which produce low levels (28 and 21 mg liter(-1), respectively) of extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs), and strains B3 and G12, which produce high EPS levels (211 and 175 mg liter(-1), respectively), were selected for further study. The two high EPS-producing strains showed a significant autoaggregation and coaggregation ability with Escherichia coli ATCC 11230 (P < 0.05). Moreover, the effect of bile was evaluated on autoaggregation and hydrophobicity. Autoaggregation and hydrophobicity of these L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains decreased after treatment with bile. Only the high EPS-producing L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain B3 showed greater autoaggregation (80%) and hydrophobicity (86%) than the other strains after bile treatment. When these strains were assessed for the inhibition of E. coli ATCC 11230 in coculture, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus B3 completely inhibited E. coli during 24 and 48 h of incubation. This investigation showed that a high EPS production and coaggregation ability may be important in the selection of probiotic strains.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in aortic aneurysms determined by 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. Recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. The aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. METHODS: Universal eubacterial primers were used to amplify 16S rRNA bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. Subsequently, PCR amplicons were cloned into Escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in GenBank. RESULTS: Sequences of Stenotrophomonas spp., including S. maltophilia (formerly Pseudomonas homology group V) were detected in six aneurysm samples. Propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and Brevundimonas diminuta (formerly P. diminuta) in four samples. Other species previously assigned to the Pseudomonas genus such as Comamonas testosteroni, Delftia acidovorans, Burkholderia cepacia, Herbaspirillum sp., and Acidovorax sp. were also detected. Some clones fell into other environmental species, including Methylobacterium sp. and Bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria that have not yet been cultivated. DNA sequences from oral bacteria, including Streptococcus sanguinis, Tannerella forsythia, and Leptotrichia buccalis were detected. Sequences from Prevotella melaninogenica and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. Additional species included Dermacoccus spp. and Corynebacterium vitaeruminis. CONCLUSIONS: A wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development. Several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although Chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. Overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. In the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. The presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at C.pneumoniae.
TI  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp lactis strain CIDCA 133 inhibits nitrate reductase activity of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of strain CIDCA 133 on  the nitrate reductase activity of a non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain. Suspensions containing different ratios of the strains under study were coincubated in MRS or MRS without glucose. In some experiments lactobacilli were killed by UV treatment. The nitrate reductase activity was determined by using a diazotization reaction for nitrite. Presence of live lactobacilli leads to a dose-response diminution in the specific nitrate reductase of E. coli even when no acidification occurred. Killing of lactobacilli by UV treatment completely abolished the anti-nitrate reductase effect. In addition, the effect was only partially observed with filtered spent culture supernatants of lactobacilli. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp lactis strain CIDCA 133 is able to antagonize the nitrate reductase activity of E. coli. This effect is neither due to a diminution of the viability of E. coli nor is depending on the acidification of the medium by the lactobacilli. Viability is needed for maximal anti-nitrate reductase activity. Modulation of undesirable enzymatic activities of intestinal microorganisms by means of selected microorganisms constitutes a further insight on the mechanisms by which probiotics lead to beneficial effects. Administration of probiotic strains able to modulate microbial intestinal activities could lead to a protection of the host against harmful effects of some members of the intestinal microflora.
TI  - Yoghurt fermentation at elevated temperatures by strains of Streptococcus thermophilus expressing a small heat-shock protein: application of a two-plasmid system for constructing food-grade strains of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus S4 expressing a small heat-shock protein from the plasmid pSt04-encoded copy of shsp, is able to carry out fermentation at elevated temperature, i.e., at 50 degrees C. In yoghurt culture together with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, fermentation at elevated temperature results in a mild yoghurt with low post-acidification and improved stability of the starter bacteria during storage at 4 degrees C. To transfer pSt04 into commercial S. thermophilus yoghurt starter strains, a two-plasmid system was constructed. A helper plasmid providing a selectable antibiotic marker, but relying on the repA gene of pSt04, was transformed together with pSt04. After isolation of transformants, the helper plasmid was readily lost upon incubation of transformants in antibiotic-free medium, thus yielding food-grade strains carrying pSt04 only. Successful application of the system was demonstrated.
TI  - Culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the African traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different DNA extraction methods.
AB  - The microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the Rep. of Congo) and degue (a millet dough from Burkina Faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using TTGE to separate the amplified target V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from total microbial community, followed by DNA sequencing and homology search. Three different extraction methods were used. Guanidium thiocyanate-based DNA extraction provided better performance regarding purity and DNA yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of DNA bands by TTGE in poto poto. By contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the DNA extraction method largely depends on the food composition. Sequencing of DNA bands from TTGE gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of Lactobacillus gasseri, Enterococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus casei. The following bacteria were identified in degue: L. gasseri, Enterococcus sp., E. coli, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, and L. casei.
TI  - Kinetic and structural characterization of phosphofructokinase from Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
AB  - Phosphofructokinase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus (LbPFK)  has been reported to be a nonallosteric analogue of phosphofructokinase from Escherichia coli at pH 8.2 [Le Bras et al. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 198, 683-687]. A reexamination of the kinetics of this enzyme shows LbPFK to have limited binding affinity toward the allosteric ligands, MgADP and PEP, with dissociation constants of approximately 20 mM for both. Their allosteric effects are observed only at high concentrations of these ligands, with both exhibiting inhibitory effects on substrate binding. No pH dependence was observed for the binding and the influence of MgADP and PEP on the enzyme. To attempt to explain these results, the crystal structure of LbPFK was solved using molecular replacement to 1.86 A resolution. A comparative study of the LbPFK structure with that of phosphofructokinases from E. coli (EcPFK) and Bacillus stearothermophilus (BsPFK) reveals a structure with conserved fold and substrate binding site. The effector binding site, however, shows many differences that could explain the observed decreases in binding affinity for MgADP and PEP in LbPFK as compared to the other two enzymes.
TI  - Primary biliary cirrhosis is characterized by IgG3 antibodies cross-reactive with the major mitochondrial autoepitope and its Lactobacillus mimic.
AB  - The serological hallmark of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is the presence of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E2 subunit (PDC-E2) antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs). Anti-PDC-E2 antibodies cross-react specifically with mycobacterial hsp65, and we have demonstrated that the motif SxGDL[ILV]AE shared by PDC-E2(212-226) and hsp's is a cross-reactive target. Having found that this same motif is present only in beta-galactosidase of Lactobacillus delbrueckii (BGAL LACDE), we hypothesized that this homology would also lead to cross-reactivity. The mimics were tested via ELISA for reactivity and competitive cross-reactivity using sera from 100 AMA-positive and 23 AMA-negative PBC patients and 190 controls. An Escherichia coli (ECOLI) PDC-E2 mimic that has been pathogenetically linked to PBC but lacks this motif has been also tested. Anti-BGAL(266-280) LACDE antibodies were restricted to AMA-positive patients (54 of 95, 57%) and belonged to immunoglobulin (Ig) G3. Of the 190 controls, 22 (12%; P < .001) had anti-BGAL(266-280) antibodies, mainly of the IgG4 subclass. ECOLI PDC-E2 reactivity was virtually absent. BGAL(266-280)/PDC-E2(212-226) reactivity of the IgG3 isotype was found in 52 (52%) AMA-positive PBC patients but in only 1 of the controls (P < .001). LACDE BGAL(266-280)/PDC-E2(212-226) reactivity was due to cross-reactivity as confirmed via competition ELISA. Antibody affinity for BGAL(266-280) was greater than for PDC-E2 mimics. Preincubation of a multireactive serum with BGAL(266-280) reduced the inhibition of enzymatic activity by 40%, while marginal effect (12%) or no effect (2%) was observed in human or ECOLI PDC-E2 mimics. In conclusion, IgG3 antibodies to BGAL LACDE cross-react with the major mitochondrial autoepitope and are characteristic of PBC.
TI  - Screening of potential lactobacilli antigenotoxicity by microbial and mammalian cell-based tests.
AB  - Antigenotoxicity is considered an important property for probiotic lactobacilli.  The ability of non probiotic lactobacilli from dairy products and starters to inhibit two reference genotoxins: 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine was evaluated. The study was carried out using short-term assays with different targets, such as procaryotic cells (SOS-Chromotest for genotoxicity in Escherichia coli and Ames test for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium) and eucaryotic cells (Comet assay for genotoxicity in Caco-2 enterocytes). A high proportion of strains inhibiting 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide activity was found in Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus plantarum. Inhibition of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine activity occurred in only one L. acidophilus strain. All the strains with antigenotoxic properties also demonstrated antimutagenic activity and produced modifications in genotoxin spectroscopic profiles. Strain viability during and after genotoxin exposure was confirmed. Concordance of the results obtained with microbial and mammalian cell-based tests is underlined.
TI  - Effect of fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria in the prevention of an enteroinvasive Escherichia coli infection in mice.
AB  - This study investigated the protective capacity of the oral administration of fermented milk containing the probiotic strains; Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, against enteroinvasive Escherichia coli infection in a murine (BALB/ c mice) model. Mice were fed for 2, 5 or 7 consecutive days with fermented milk diluted to a concentration of viable Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus of 10(7) cfu/ml. Phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages and the number of IgA+ cells in small and large intestine were determined at the end of the feeding periods. For the preventive effect against Esch. coli, animals were fed for 5 days (selected dose). Mice were challenged with an infective dose of enteroinvasive Esch. coli of 10(8) cfu/mouse. The colonization of liver and spleen and the secretory IgA specific for the pathogen in the intestinal fluid were determined (ELISA test). Results showed that the unspecific immune response enhanced itself after 5 consecutive days of the administration of this fermented milk (increase in the percentage of phagocytosis and number of IgA+ cells in the small intestine). Treated animals showed less Esch. coli colonization of liver than control mice and a higher secretory anti-Esch. coli IgA in the intestinal fluids. These results suggest that the protection against enteroinvasive Esch. coli infection observed for the fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria may be associated with an enhance of the intestinal mucosa immunity.
TI  - Safety evaluation of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis UO 004, a probiotic  bacterium.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis UO 004 was evaluated for its use as a potential probiotic from a safety point of view. The strain did not exhibit mucinolytic or other enzymatic activities that might be detrimental, such as those involving glycosidases (beta-D-glucosaminidase or alpha-D-galactosidase) or arylamidases (factor Xa and quimotrypsin-like activities), frequently present in Lactobacillus strains isolated from patients with endocarditis, although it was able to express protein Ca and kallikrein-like activities. On the other hand, the presence of the strain did not interfere with the growth of certain species of normal intestinal microbiota, such as Enterococcus fecalis, Escherichia coli, Bifidobacterium bifidum or Bacteroides fragilis. Moreover, the potential probiotic strain UO 004 is sensitive to antibiotics with transmissible resistance mechanisms in Lactobacillus such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline and vancomycin. In addition, strain L. delbrueckii UO 004 was not able to translocate towards the intestinal barrier of mice or produce changes in their activity or general health status.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - [Hydrogen peroxide produced by Lactobacillus species as a regulatory molecule for vaginal microflora].
AB  - A total of 33 strains of Lactobacillus belonging to 9 species, isolated from vagina, were tested for production of hydrogen peroxide. We observed that the following species: L. delbrueckii, L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. johnsonii and L. gasseri dominated over other species in secretion of hydrogen peroxide to the growth medium. Concentration of this substance amounted from 0.05 to 1.06 mM (in case of strong aeration the concentration increased up to 1.8 mM). Moreover, killing properties of the pure hydrogen peroxide exerted toward Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were less prominent than these of the supernatants of cultures of Lactobacillus strains producing H2O2.
TI  - Free and microencapsulated Lactobacillus and effects of metabolic induction on urea removal.
AB  - We have previously reported the experimental use of genetically engineered Escherichia coli with microencapsulation to lower nitrogenous waste. Concern has surfaced, nonetheless, about safety of genetically engineered product. The purpose of this study is to explore the alternative use of probiotics in removal of plasma urea. After repeated cycles of exposure of Lactobacillus delbrueckii in urea-rich medium under anaerobic environment, the organisms were demonstrated to lower plasma urea concentration in vitro. Suspension of Lactobacillus in uremic plasma reduced the urea nitrogen levels from 51.5 +/- 5.2 mg/dL to 44.3 +/- 3.9 mg/dL (P = 0.02) after 24 hours. With microencapsulation of Lactobacillus (inside semipermeable alginate-polylysine-alginate polymeric membrane), further lowering of urea nitrogen levels was achieved (35.4 +/- 0.8 mg/dL, P = 0.03) at 24 hours. These preliminary data show that expression of certain enzymes could be induced in Lactobacillus delbrueckii and thus capable of lowering plasma urea. Further studies and molecular analysis would be indicated to explore and refine the techniques.
TI  - Lactobacillus reuteri CRL1098 produces cobalamin.
AB  - We found that Lactobacillus reuteri CRL1098, a lactic acid bacterium isolated from sourdough, is able to produce cobalamin. The sugar-glycerol cofermentation in vitamin B(12)-free medium showed that this strain was able to reduce glycerol through a well-known cobalamin-dependent reaction with the formation of 1,3-propanediol as a final product. The cell extract of L. reuteri corrected the coenzyme B12 requirement of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 7830 and allowed the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (metE cbiB) and Escherichia coli (metE) in minimal medium. Preliminary genetic studies of cobalamin biosynthesis genes from L. reuteri allowed the identification of cob genes which encode the CobA, CbiJ, and CbiK enzymes involved in the cobalamin pathway. The cobamide produced by L. reuteri, isolated in its cyanide form by using reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, showed a UV-visible spectrum identical to that of standard cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12).
TI  - Evaluation of a select strain of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis as a biological control agent for pathogens on fresh-cut vegetables stored at 7 degrees C.
AB  - Raw vegetables inoculated with selected pathogenic bacteria were treated with a strain of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, which was selected for its ability to produce hydrogen peroxide at refrigerated temperatures. The vegetables inoculated included broccoli, cabbage, carrots, and lettuce. Each vegetable was rinsed, chopped, and stored under conditions similar to those used for ready-to-eat vegetables sold at retail. Portions of each vegetable were separately inoculated with one of two pathogenic bacteria, Escherichia coli O157:H7 or Listeria monocytogenes. Prior to packaging, one portion of each inoculated vegetable was treated with a cell suspension of the selected strain of L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. The vegetables were stored at 7 degrees C for 6 days. The populations of pathogens and lactobacilli on each sample were enumerated on storage days 0, 3, and 6. Although populations of L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis remained at high levels during storage, there was no noticeable antagonistic action against the pathogens under conditions similar to those used for these products at the retail level. Each pathogen survived on all vegetables throughout storage. Further testing revealed that there was apparently sufficient catalase activity in the cut vegetables to destroy enough of the hydrogen peroxide to prevent antagonistic action against the pathogens.
TI  - Antagonistic action of cells of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis against pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in fresh meat systems.
AB  - Cells of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis RM2-5 were added to various meat model systems that had been inoculated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 or Salmonella Typhimurium to determine whether these lactobacilli were antagonistic to the pathogens during storage at 5 degrees C. Experiments in which L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis RM2-5 was directly applied to the surfaces of beefsteaks resulted in significant (P < 0.05) reductions in the growth of psychrotrophs and coliforms plus a slight decrease in the numbers of E. coli O157:H7 over time relative to those for control samples to which no lactobacilli had been added. Experiments involving the direct application of L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis RM2-5 to the surfaces of freshly slaughtered beef and pork carcass samples inoculated with either E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella Typhimurium showed significant (P < 0.05) declines in numbers of the pathogens as well as a reduction in the growth of psychrotrophs during storage at 5 degrees C for 6 days. The results of the experiments suggest that lactobacillus cultures have potential for use in an intervention technology for the control of foodborne pathogens, especially on the surfaces of beef and pork carcasses. The results of this study also suggest that an extension of the shelf life of meat can result from the decreased growth of psychrotrophic spoilage organisms.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy products inhibit genotoxic effect of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in SOS-chromotest.
AB  - Antigenotoxic activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial dairy products was studied using SOS-Chromotest. The supernatants from bacteria-genotoxin co-incubations in general exhibited a strong suppression on SOS-induction produced by 4-NQO on the tester organism Escherichia coli PQ37 (sfiA::lacZ). High genotoxicity inhibition (>75%) was found for 31/67 of the examined bacteria and the maximum values of some strains within the species were as follows: Lactobacillus casei, 99.1%; L. plantarum, 93.3%; L. rhamnosus, 93.4%; L. acidophilus, 90.9%; L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, 85.7% and Bifidobacterium bifidum, 89.6%; Strains with low antigenotoxicity (5-60%) were evidenced in both L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, whereas some inactive strains were found only in L. casei and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Cell exposure to 100 degrees C for 15 min prevented antigenotoxicity and no effect was evidenced for cell-free spent media. The active strains survived at 0.1 mM 4-NQO exposure and generally presented some relevant functional properties, such as tolerance to bile (0.5%) or acid environment (pH 2.0) and adherence to Caco-2 enterocytes. Antigenotoxicity was always associated with modification of the 4-NQO absorbance profile.
TI  - Molecular typing of Lactobacillus delbrueckii of dairy origin by PCR-RFLP of protein-coding genes.
AB  - Thirty-five strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and subsp. bulgaricus isolated from dairy products were typed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of protein-coding genes. The strains were analysed by RFLP of PCR amplified, infragenic fragments of the following housekeeping genes: beta-galactosidase, lactose permease, and proline dipeptidase. Sequencing of the variable regions of the 16S rDNA was then performed on a reduced number of strains. PCR-RFLP analysis evidenced wide strain heterogeneity. Strains were grouped into genotypes according to both subspecies assignment and infra-species genetic polymorphism. This polymorphism was related to the presence of microbial groups within subspecies populations. The low infra-species sequence polymorphism detected in the variable region of the 16S rRNA gene did not enable to group the strains with the same sensitivity reached by PCR-RFLP of protein-coding genes. PCR-RFLP of protein-coding genes applied to L. delbrueckii seems a promising tool to evaluate microbial diversity within bacterial subpopulations. Differences among bacterial subpopulations based upon molecular heterogeneity in protein-coding genes would enable to better understand the role of strains from different ecological niches.
TI  - Evolution of microbial populations during traditional Feta cheese manufacture and ripening.
AB  - In three different dairies (A, B and C) located in Peloponess region (Southern Greece), traditional Feta cheese trials took place February to March using mixtures of sheep's and goat's milk. Only small variations in the evolution of microbial groups were observed during the whole ripening period. The main groups, such as thermophilic cocci, mesophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB), presumptive Leuconostoc, enterococci and micrococci, reached their highest levels during the first 16 days, and then declined approximately 1-2 log units until the end of ripening. The remaining groups investigated, comprising yeasts, coliforms and Escherichia coli, were highest at day 4. The yeasts remained constant, while coliforms and E. coli decreased sharply and were not detectable after 120 days of ripening. A number of 146 isolates (dairy A) taken from all stages of the manufacturing and ripening process were purified and studied. Lactobacillus plantarum (58/146) and isolates of related species Lactobacillus pentosus and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (16/146) were the most common microorganisms found during cheese ripening. Streptococcus thermophilus (23/146) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (20/146) were detected in high levels up to 20 days, and then gradually reduced. Enterococcus faecium (29/146) was found in all manufacturing and ripening stages.
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in traditional African yoghurt fermentation.
AB  - Growth and survival of a nontoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43888) was determined in traditionally fermented pasteurized milk. Preheated milk was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of a mixed culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (NCIMB 11778) and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (NCIMB 110368) and incubated at 25, 30, 37 or 43 degrees C for 24 h. E. coli O157:H7 (10(5) CFU/ml) were introduced into the milk pre- and post-fermentation. Fermented milk samples were subsequently stored at either 4 degrees C (refrigerator temperature) or 25 degrees C (to mimic African ambient temperature) for 5 days. After 24 h of fermentation, the pH of the samples fermented at the higher temperatures of 37-43 degrees C decreased from 6.8 to 4.4-4.0 ( +/- 0.2) whereas at the lower temperature of 25 degrees C, the pH decreased to pH 5.0 +/- 0.1. During this period, viable counts for E. coli O157:H7 increased from 10(5) to 10(8) - 10(9) CFU/ml except in milk fermented at 43 degrees C wherein viability declined to 10(4) CFU/ml. In fermented (25-30 degrees C) milk stored at 4 degrees C for 5 days, E. coli O157:H7 viability decreased from 10(8-9) to 10(6-7) CFU/ml whereas milk fermented at 43 degrees C resulted in loss of detectable cells. In contrast, storage of fermented milk samples at 25 degrees C for 5 days eventually resulted in complete loss of viability irrespective of fermentation temperature. Stationary phase E. coli O157:H7 inoculated post-fermentation (25 and 43 degrees C) survived during 4 degrees C storage, but not 25 degrees C storage. Fermentation temperature and subsequent storage temperature are critical to the growth and survival of E. coli O157:H7 in traditional fermented products involving yoghurt starter cultures.
TI  - Isolation of the patC gene encoding the cystathionine beta-lyase of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and molecular analysis of inter-strain variability in enzyme biosynthesis.
AB  - The patC gene encoding the cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL) of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NCDO 1489 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Overexpression of CBL complemented the methionine auxotrophy of an E. coli metC mutant, demonstrating in vivo that this enzyme functions as a CBL. However, PatC is distinguishable from the MetC CBLs by a low identity in amino acid sequence, a sensitivity to iodoacetic acid, greater thermostability and a lower substrate affinity. Homologues of patC were detected in the 13 Lb. delbrueckii strains studied, but only seven of them showed CBL activity. In constrast to CBL(+) strains, all CBL-deficient strains analysed were auxotrophic for methionine. This supports the hypothesis that CBLs from lactobacilli are probably involved in methionine biosynthesis. Moreover, the results of this study suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms account for the differences in CBL activities observed between strains of Lb. delbrueckii.
TI  - Lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  - Samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for Lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. Yeasts (20.1%), Streptococcus spp. (8.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. The Lactobacillus isolates were L. brevis (24.6%) L. fermentum (18.5%) L. casei (16.9%), L. delbrueckii (15.4%), L. plantarum (9.23%), L. acidophilus (7.69%), L. jensenii (4.62%), L. salivarius (1.54%) and L. gasseri (1.54%). The most common species was L. brevis (24.6%). The strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. All the Lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei, Klebsiella spp. and Campylobacter sp. All the lactobacilli except L. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The involvement of Lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. The ability of Lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
TI  - Formulations and processing of yogurt affect the microbial quality of carbonated  yogurt.
AB  - Carbonation, flavor, culture type, pH, and storage time were varied to investigate the effects of these variables and their interactions on the growth of both typical and nontypical yogurt cultures and some contaminating bacteria. Two types of yogurt cultures (YC-470 and YC-180) were used as the source of typical yogurt bacteria, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. In addition, Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-K) and Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707 were added as nontypical yogurt cultures to make sweetened low fat (1%) Swiss-style plain, strawberry, and lemon yogurts. Samples were incubated at 43 degrees C until pH values of 5.0 or 4.2 were reached. Strawberry yogurts at low (4.2) and high (5.0) pHs were divided into three portions, which were separately inoculated with contaminating bacteria, Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 14580, Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, and Listeria monocytogenes Scott A. After incorporation of carbon dioxide (1.10 to 1.27 volume of CO2 gas dissolved in water), the yogurt was stored at 4 degrees C for a 90-d period. Carbon dioxide did not affect the growth of typical or nontypical yogurt bacteria. Also, CO2 did not inhibit the growth of undesirable microorganisms. In general, low levels of CO2 did not affect the bacterial population in yogurt. The microflora of yogurt were influenced by culture type, pH, flavor type, and storage time or their interactions.
TI  - Sequence analysis of the aminoacylase-1 family. A new proposed signature for metalloexopeptidases.
AB  - The amino acid sequence analysis of the human and porcine aminoacylases-1, the carboxypeptidase S precursor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Corynebacterium glutamicum, the acetylornithine deacetylase from Escherichia coli and Dictyostelium discoideum and the carboxypeptidase G(2) precursor from Pseudomonas strain, using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and the Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST), allowed us to suggest that all these enzymes, which share common functional and biochemical features, belong to the same structural family. The three amino acid blocks which were found to be highly conserved, using the CLUSTAL W program, could be assigned to the catalytic active site, based on the general three-dimensional structure of the carboxypeptidase G(2) from the Pseudomonas strain precursor. Six additional proteins with the same signature have been retrieved after performing two successive PSI-BLAST iterations using the sequence of the conserved motif, namely Lactobacillus delbrueckii aminoacyl-histidine dipeptidase, Streptomyces griseus aminopeptidase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae aminopeptidase Y precursor, two Bacillus stearothermophilus N-carbamyl-L-amino acid amidohydrolases and Pseudomonas sp. hydantoin utilization protein C. The three conserved amino acid motifs corresponded to the following blocks: (i) [S, G, A]-H-x-D-x-V; (ii) G-x-x-D; and (iii) x-E-E. This new sequence signature is clearly different from that commonly reported in the literature for proteins belonging to the ArgE/DapE/CPG2/YscS family.
TI  - Identification of stress-inducible proteins in Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) is a homofermentative bacterium that produces lactic acid during growth. We adapted the two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) technique to study the response of this bacterium to acidity. De novo protein synthesis was monitored by [35S]methionine labeling of exponentially growing cultures under standard (pH 6) and acidic (pH 4.75) conditions. After 2-DE separation, the protein patterns were compared. The protein spots showing increased radioactivity levels under acid conditions were considered acid-induced. We determined the N-terminal amino acid sequence of three highly induced proteins; comparing these proteins to databases we identified them to be the well-known heat shock proteins GroES, GroEL, and DnaK. Their induction levels were measured and compared. This is the first study by 2-DE of stress response in L. bulgaricus. We established the method and present a protein map which will be useful for future studies.
TI  - Expression of the phospho-beta-glycosidase ArbZ from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis in Lactobacillus helveticus: substrate induction and catabolite repression.
AB  - ArbZ from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis was previously shown to enable  utilization of the beta-glucoside arbutin by Escherichia coli. The arbZ gene was cloned and expressed in the industrially used beta-glucoside-negative strain Lactobacillus helveticus 3036(62). The transformants were able to ferment not only arbutin, but also cellobiose, salicin and methyl-beta-glucoside (MbetaGlc). Cleavage of beta-glucosides by the transformants depended on the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas in cell-free extracts only C(6)-phosphorylated substrates were hydrolysed. This suggested that ArbZ is a phospho-beta-glycosidase. ArbZ activity in transformants of Lb. helveticus was subject to substrate induction mediated by the beta-glucosides arbutin, salicin and MbetaGlc, whereas cellobiose or the beta-galactoside lactose had no inducing effect. Northern blot analysis proved that induction by MbetaGlc was due to enhanced transcription of arbZ. Catabolite repression of arbZ induction was observed with glucose, mannose, fructose and galactose. The induction kinetics observed in the presence of these sugars indicated that at least two different mechanisms are operative in catabolite repression of arbZ in Lb. helveticus.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase gene (pepX) is part of the glnRA operon in Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - A peptidase gene expressing X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (PepX) activity was cloned from Lactobacillus rhamnosus 1/6 by using the chromogenic substrate L-glycyl-L-prolyl-beta-naphthylamide for screening of a genomic library in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of a 3.5-kb HindIII fragment expressing the peptidase activity revealed one complete open reading frame (ORF) of 2,391 nucleotides. The 797-amino-acid protein encoded by this ORF was shown to be 40, 39, and 36% identical with PepXs from Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Lactococcus lactis, respectively. By Northern analysis with a pepX-specific probe, transcripts of 4.5 and 7.0 kb were detected, indicating that pepX is part of a polycistronic operon in L. rhamnosus. Cloning and sequencing of the upstream region of pepX revealed the presence of two ORFs of 360 and 1,338 bp that were shown to be able to encode proteins with high homology to GlnR and GlnA proteins, respectively. By multiple primer extension analyses, the only functional promoter in the pepX region was located 25 nucleotides upstream of glnR. Northern analysis with glnA- and pepX-specific probes indicated that transcription from glnR promoter results in a 2.0-kb dicistronic glnR-glnA transcript and also in a longer read-through polycistronic transcript of 7.0 kb that was detected with both probes in samples from cells in exponential growth phase. The glnA gene was disrupted by a single-crossover recombinant event using a nonreplicative plasmid carrying an internal part of glnA. In the disruption mutant, glnRA-specific transcription was derepressed 10-fold compared to the wild type, but the 7.0-kb transcript was no longer detectable with either the glnA- or pepX-specific probe, demonstrating that pepX is indeed part of glnRA operon in L. rhamnosus. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis further supported this operon structure. An extended stem-loop structure was identified immediately upstream of pepX in the glnA-pepX intergenic region, a sequence that showed homology to a 23S-5S intergenic spacer and to several other L. rhamnosus-related entries in data banks.
TI  - PepR1, a CcpA-like transcription regulator of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis.
AB  - The PepR1 protein from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM 7290 shares extensive homology with catabolite-control proteins from various Gram-positive bacteria. Expression of the subcloned pepR1 gene allowed for partial complementation of a ccpA defect in Staphylococcus xylosus. The influence of PepR1 on transcription of the prolidase gene pepQ, which is located adjacent to pepR1, was examined by use of lacZ reporter gene fusions in Escherichia coli. PepR1 stimulated transcription initiation at the pepQ promoter about twofold, and this effect required the integrity of a 14 bp palindromic cre-like sequence located 74 nt upstream of pepQ. In gel-mobility-shift assays, PepR1 specifically interacted with the pepQ promoter region and also with DNA fragments covering the promoters of the pepX, pepl and brnQ genes of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, which encode two additional peptidases and a branched-chain amino acid transporter, respectively. cre-like elements were identified in each of these DNA fragments. Catabolite control of PepQ was demonstrated in Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. During growth with lactose the enzyme activity was twofold higher than in the presence of glucose, and corresponding differences were also detected in the level of pepQ transcription.
TI  - Unusual structure of the attB site of the site-specific recombination system of Lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  - The temperate phage mv4 integrates its genome into the chromosome of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus by site-specific recombination within the 3' end of a tRNA(Ser) gene. Recombination is catalyzed by the phage-encoded integrase and occurs between the phage attP site and the bacterial attB site. In this study, we show that the mv4 integrase functions in vivo in Escherichia coli and we characterize the bacterial attB site with a site-specific recombination test involving compatible plasmids carrying the recombination sites. The importance of particular nucleotides within the attB sequence was determined by site-directed mutagenesis. The structure of the attB site was found to be simple but rather unusual. A 16-bp DNA fragment was sufficient for function. Unlike most genetic elements that integrate their DNA into tRNA genes, none of the dyad symmetry elements of the tRNA(Ser) gene were present within the minimal attB site. No inverted repeats were detected within this site either, in contrast to the lambda site-specific recombination model.
TI  - Integrative recombination of Lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4: functional analysis of the reaction and structure of the attP site.
AB  - The integrase of the temperate bacteriophage mv4 catalyzes site-specific recombination between the phage attP site and the attB site of the host during lysogenization of Lactobaccillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The mv4 integrase also functions in a wide variety of gram-positive bacteria and in Escherichia coli. In this report, in vitro and in vivo recombination assays were developed and the integrase was purified in order to study in greater detail the mv4 attP x attB recombination event. In a cell-free extract of E. coli at 42 degrees C, the mv4 integrase promotes efficient in vitro recombination between a supercoiled attP-containing plasmid and a linear attB fragment. The integrase, which was purified to apparent homogeneity, showed no absolute requirement for accessory factors, unlike the majority of the lambda Int family of recombinases. Deletion derivatives of the attP site were constructed and tested for recombination with the attB site in vitro. A 234-bp DNA fragment containing five scattered putative mv4 Int-binding sites was sufficient for function of the attP site. In contrast to the right arm of attP, most of the left arm could be deleted without drastically reducing the recombination efficiency. In vivo in E. coli, mv4 Int catalyzed recombination in trains between attP and attB sites present on two separate plasmids. This property was used to confirm in vivo the results of the deletion analysis of the attP site performed in vitro.
TI  - Strain dependency of the immunopotentiating activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  - To obtain strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus with high immunopotentiating activity, we screened 90 strains of this bacterial species for the proliferative response of murine spleen and beta-lactoglobulin-primed lymph node cells. In this screening, certain strains showed strong immunopotentiating activity. Among them, strain 1023 had the strongest mitogenic activity for murine Peyer's patch (PP) cells. Furthermore, strain 1023 induced IgA antibody production by PP cells as strongly as Bifidobacterium longum 6001, which had adjuvant activity when orally administered. Also in the assays using immune cells from human-flora-associated mice a few strains including 1023 showed strong immunopotentiating activity comparable to B. longum 6001. These results suggest that L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains such as 1023 may be useful for the production of fermented milk with a more beneficial effect on the systemic and mucosal immune system.
TI  - Characterization of a prolidase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus  CNRZ 397 with an unusual regulation of biosynthesis.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CNRZ 397 (Lb. bulgaricus) is characterized by a high level of peptidase activities specific to proline-containing peptides. A prolidase (PepQ, EC 3.4.13.9) was purified to homogeneity and characterized as a strict dipeptidase active on X-Pro dipeptides, except Gly-Pro and Pro-Pro. The values for Km and Vmax were, respectively, 2.2 mM and 0.33 mmol min(-1) mg(-1), with Leu-Pro as the substrate. The enzyme exhibited optimal activity at 50 degrees C and pH 6.0, and required the presence of Zn2+. Size exclusion chromatographies and SDS-PAGE analysis led to the conclusion that this prolidase was a homodimer. Antibodies raised against the purified protein allowed the detection of PepQ among several Lactobacillus species but not lactococci. The pepQ gene and the upstream region were isolated and sequenced. The deduced peptide sequence showed that PepQ belongs to the M24 family of metallopeptidases. The pepR1 gene is located immediately upstream of pepQ and its product is homologous to the transcription factor CcpA, which is involved in catabolite repression of catabolic operons from Gram-positive bacteria. The pepR1-pepQ intergenic region contains a consensus catabolite-responsive element (CRE) which could be a target for PepR1 protein. Moreover, in contrast to other proline-specific enzymes from Lb. bulgaricus, PepQ biosynthesis was shown to be dependent on the composition of the culture medium, but not on the peptide concentration. A possible regulation mechanism is discussed.
TI  - Persistence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in dairy fermentation systems.
AB  - We examined (i) the persistence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 as a postpasteurization contaminant in fermented dairy products; (ii) the ability of E. coli O157:H7 strains with and without the general stress regulatory protein, RpoS, to compete with commercial starter cultures in fermentation systems; and (iii) the survival of E. coli O157:H7 in the yogurt production process. In commercial products inoculated with 10(3) CFU/ml, E. coli O157:H7 was recovered for up to 12 days in yogurt (pH 4.0), 28 days in sour cream (pH 4.3), and at levels > 10(2) CFU/ml at 35 days in buttermilk (pH 4.1). For the starter culture competition trials, the relative inhibition of E. coli O157:H7 in the experimental fermentation systems was, in decreasing order, thermophilic culture mixture, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus R110 alone, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis D280 alone, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris D62 alone, and Streptococcus thermophilus C90 alone showing the least inhibition. Recovery of the rpoS mutant was lower than recovery of its wild-type parent by 72 h or earlier in the presence of individual starter cultures. No E. coli O157:H7 were recovered after the curd formation step in yogurt manufactured with milk inoculated with 10(5) CFU/ml. Our results show that (i) postprocessing entry of E. coli O157:H7 into fermented dairy products represents a potential health hazard; (ii) commercial starter cultures differ in their ability to reduce E. coli O157:H7 CFU numbers in fermentation systems; and (iii) the RpoS protein appears to most effectively contribute to bacterial survival in the presence of conditions that are moderately lethal to the cell.
TI  - Detection and characterization of a novel antibacterial substance produced by a Lactobacillus delbrueckii strain 1043.
AB  - A novel antibacterial substance produced by a strain isolated from Bulgarian yellow cheese was characterized. The producer strain was identified by molecular typing to belong to the species Lactobacillus delbrueckii, which is a rare producer of bacteriocins. The inhibitory agent was heat stable and active against lactic acid bacteria species and several food-borne pathogens: Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Its sensitivity to amylolitic enzymes and lipase suggested that a lipid and carbohydrate moiety could be important for the activity. The amino acid content of the purified bacteriocin was estimated to 29 amino acids. The bacteriocin was shown to be small (3.6-6 kDa) by three different methods: HPLC gel-filtration, SDS-PAGE and amino acid contents.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus thermophilus 81.
AB  - A new bacteriocin, produced by Streptococcus thermophilus 81 has been isolated, purified and characterized. By its heat sensitivity and broad inhibitory spectrum it does not resemble any other S. thermophilus bacteriocin. The mode of action is bacteriostatic. This peptide of 32 amino acids is efficient against several Bacillus species, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica. This bacteriocin is heat labile but its activity was not altered by pH variation from 3 to 10. Six months of storage at 40 degrees C did not influence the activity. The inactivation by detergents and the inability to resolve the protein in SDS-PAGE supposes a more complex structure or a possible stabilizing effect of other molecules. The low sensitivity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to the isolated bacteriocin suggests that S. thermophilus 81 may be used in yoghurt starters.
TI  - The arbZ gene from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis confers to Escherichia coli the ability to utilize the beta-glucoside arbutin.
AB  - From a genomic library of the industrially used strain Lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp. lactis DSM7290, a gene designated arbZ (869bp; encoding a 33.5kDa protein) was isolated by screening E. coli transformants for the ability to utilize the beta-glucoside arbutin. Out of 9000 transformants nine were able to ferment arbutin, whereas no utilization of the beta-glucosides salicin, esculin or cellobiose could be detected. Overexpression of arbZ using the T7-polymerase-T7-promoter-system resulted in the formation of insoluble, catalytically inactive protein aggregates (inclusion bodies). Accordingly, overexpression was not accompanied by an increase in ArbZ activity. Induction of arbZ controlled by the lac promoter under conditions that reduce protein aggregation resulted in a 12-fold increase in arbutin hydrolyzing activity of intact cells and a 13-fold increase in phospho-beta-glycosidase activity in cell-free extracts of the respective transformants. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a second gene upstream of arbZ that was designated arbX (830bp). ArbX (32.6kDa) shared similarity with several glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria. In Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM7290 two transcripts, one covering arbX together with arbZ and one covering arbZ alone were detected by Northern blot analysis.
TI  - Manufacture and quality of iron-fortified yogurt.
AB  - Yogurts (nonfat and low fat) were manufactured and fortified with 10, 20, and 40  mg of iron/kg of yogurt. Growth of starter culture bacteria and nonstarter culture bacteria as well as lipid oxidation of the yogurts were monitored over 30 d of storage at 4 degrees C. Sensory characteristics of the yogurts were determined during that time by a trained panel of judges, and consumer panels were used to test acceptability of iron-fortified yogurt. Counts of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricas and Streptococcus thermophilus after 1 d of storage in iron-fortified skim yogurts were 7.0 x 10(8) cfu/ml, which were not significantly different from numbers in unfortified yogurts. Counts decreased to 2.5 x 10(8) and 1.9 x 10(8) cfu/ml for L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, respectively, after 30 d of storage. Fortifying yogurt with iron did not support the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens or Escherichia coli. No significant increases in chemical oxidation, as measured using the thiobarbituric acid assay, were detected as a consequence of iron fortification. Trained panelists scored all yogurts for oxidized, metallic, bitter, and other off-flavors in the range of "not perceptible" to "very slightly perceptible". Iron-fortified yogurts had slightly higher oxidized flavor scores than did the control yogurt. There was no increase in metallic, bitter, or other off-flavors. The consumer panel did not detect any significant differences in the appearance, mouthfeel, flavor, or overall quality between fortified and unfortified flavored yogurts. All yogurt samples were liked by the consumer panelists, suggesting that yogurt is a suitable vehicle for iron fortification.
TI  - A continuous coupled spectrophotometric assay for tyrosine aminotransferase activity with aromatic and other nonpolar amino acids.
AB  - A continuous assay for Escherichia coli tyrosine aminotransferase (TATase) that employs Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase (HO-HxoDH) as a coupling enzyme is described. alpha-Keto acids, including those formed by TATase-catalyzed transamination of l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, l-tryptophan, l-methionine, and l-leucine, are converted to the corresponding alpha-hydroxy acids by the auxiliary enzyme. The concomitant reduction of NADH by this enzyme can be followed as a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Importantly, HO-HxoDHcatalyzed reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), a cosubstrate of TATase required to regenerate the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate cofactor of this enzyme from pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate, is a poor substrate and does not interfere with the assay. The kinetic parameters determined for the transamination of phenylalanine by TATase (kcat = 180 s-1, KM (L-Phe) = 0.56 mM, KM (alpha-KG) = 5 mM) with HO-HxoDH as a coupling enzyme are comparable to those reported in the literature, which were determined by direct monitoring of the formation of phenylpyruvate at 280 nm. This new assay offers the advantages of increased sensitivity and broad substrate specificity.
TI  - Inhibition of Salmonella typhimurium attachment to chicken cecal mucus by intestinal isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and lactobacilli.
AB  - The ability of selected strains of Enterobacteriaceae or lactobacilli isolated from the intestines of adult chickens to inhibit in vitro attachment of Salmonella typhimurium 3333/O to cecal mucus in the presence or absence of D-mannose was determined. Attachment in the absence of mannose was reduced by prior exposure of mucus to cultures of two isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, an Escherichia coli and a Hafnia alvei strain, but not to a third isolate, an Enterobacter agglomerans strain. Attachment of S. typhimurium was not inhibited when mannose was present in the blocking or attachment step. Formation of fimbriae by the two inhibitory Enterobacteriaceae strains and the S. typhimurium strain, as indicated by titers of mannose-sensitive hemagglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes was optimal in Z biphasic medium (consisting of tryptone, yeast extract, dextrose, and NaCl) incubated anaerobically at 42 C. Fimbriae of each of three strains prepared from these cultures also inhibited attachment. These are characteristics consistent with attachment and inhibition of attachment mediated by a mannose-sensitive adhesin associated with type 1 fimbriae on bacterial cells of Enterobacteriaceae strains. Attachment in the presence of mannose was significantly reduced by prior exposure of mucus to cultures of a Lactobacillus salivarius strain and a Lactobacillus delbrueckii delbrueckii strain but not to a strain of Lactobacillus for which the species had not been determined. Washed cells or spent culture supernatant fluid from brain-heart infusion broth, Z broth, or Z biphasic cultures of the inhibitory strains of lactobacilli incubated at 37 or 42 C inhibited this form of attachment. Of 27 intestinal isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and 21 of lactobacilli, the lactobacilli strains were generally more hydrophobic than the Enterobacteriaceae as determined by adherence to hexadecane. The lactobacilli isolates did not agglutinate guinea pig erythrocytes. The data suggest more than one mechanism for mediating attachment of inhibitory bacterial strains and for subsequent attachment of S. typhimurium.
TI  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM7290 pepG gene encodes a novel cysteine aminopeptidase.
AB  - A number of Escherichia coli clones were isolated from a Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis gene library capable of hydrolysing the chromogenic substrate Gly-Ala-beta-naphthylamide (Gly-Ala-beta NA). Some of the recombinant plasmids carried by these clones have been shown to encode the cysteine aminopeptidase gene pepC. Nucleotide sequence analyses of the plasmid inserts of the remaining clones resulted in the identification of two adjacent ORFs encoding proteins exhibiting a high degree of similarity between themselves (72.6%) and with PepC. One gene, designated pepG, was overexpressed in E. coli and the crude extracts obtained were shown to be peptidolytically active both against chromogenic substrates and peptides, and in a Salmonella typhimurium growth test. PepC and PepG activities were compared using chromogenic beta NA and p-nitroanilide substrates and leucine or proline-containing peptides were applied in growth experiments of recombinant Sal. typhimurium. The results indicate that the enzymes, although structurally related, have different substrate preferences. No enzyme activity could be ascribed to the second ORF (orfW), despite the production of a visible protein using a T7 RNA polymerase system. Primer extension analysis, using mRNA isolated from Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM7290 did establish that orfW was transcribed.
TI  - An operon from Lactobacillus helveticus composed of a proline iminopeptidase gene (pepI) and two genes coding for putative members of the ABC transporter family of proteins.
AB  - A proline iminopeptidase gene (pepI) of an industrial Lactobacillus helveticus strain was cloned and found to be organized in an operon-like structure of three open reading frames (ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3). ORF1 was preceded by a typical prokaryotic promoter region, and a putative transcription terminator was found downstream of ORF3, identified as the pepI gene. Using primer-extension analyses, only one transcription start site, upstream of ORF1, was identifiable in the predicted operon. Although the size of mRNA could not be judged by Northern analysis either with ORF1-, ORF2- or pepI-specific probes, reverse transcription-PCR analyses further supported the operon structure of the three genes. ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3 had coding capacities for 50.7, 24.5 and 33.8 kDa proteins, respectively. The ORF3-encoded PepI protein showed 65% identity with the PepI proteins from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis. The ORF1-encoded protein had significant homology with several members of the ABC transporter family but, with two distinct putative ATP-binding sites, it would represent an unusual type among the bacterial ABC transporters. ORF2 encoded a putative integral membrane protein also characteristic of the ABC transporter family. The pepI gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Purified PepI hydrolysed only di and tripeptides with proline in the first position. Optimum PepI activity was observed at pH 7.5 and 40 degrees C. A gel filtration analysis indicated that PepI is a dimer of M(r) 53,000. PepI was shown to be a metal-independent serine peptidase having thiol groups at or near the active site. Kinetic studies with proline-p-nitroanilide as substrate revealed Km and Vmax values of 0.8 mM and 350 mmol min-1 mg-1, respectively, and a very high turnover number of 135,000 s-1.
TI  - Genomic organization of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Current knowledge of the genomes of the lactic acid bacteria, Lactococcus lactis  and Streptococcus thermophilus, and members of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Carnobacterium, is reviewed. The genomes contain a chromosome within the size range of 1.8 to 3.4 Mbp. Plasmids are common in Lactococcus lactis (most strains carry 4-7 different plasmids), some of the lactobacilli and pediococci, but they are not frequently present in S. thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus or the intestinal lactobacilli. Five IS elements have been found in L. lactis and most strains carry multiple copies of at least two of them; some strains also carry a 68-kbp conjugative transposon. IS elements have been found in the genera Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc, but not in S. thermophilus. Prophages are also a normal component of the L. lactis genome and lysogeny is common in the lactobacilli, however it appears to be rare in S. thermophilus. Physical and genetic maps for two L. lactis subsp. lactis strains, two L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains and S. thermophilus A054 have been constructed and each reveals the presence of six rrn operons clustered in less than 40% of the chromosome. The L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 map contains 115 genetic loci and the S. thermophilus map has 35. The maps indicate significant plasticity in the L. lactis subsp. cremoris chromosome in the form of a number of inversions and translocations. The cause(s) of these rearrangements is (are) not known. A number of potentially powerful genetic tools designed to analyse the L. lactis genome have been constructed in recent years. These tools enable gene inactivation, gene replacement and gene recovery experiments to be readily carried out with this organism, and potentially with other lactic acid bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria. Integration vectors based on temperate phage attB sites and the random insertion of IS elements have also been developed for L. lactis and the intestinal lactobacilli. In addition, a L. lactis sex factor that mobilizes the chromosome in a manner reminiscent to that seen with Escherichia coli Hfr strains has been discovered and characterized. With the availability of this new technology, research into the genome of the lactic acid bacteria is poised to undertake a period of extremely rapid information accrual.
TI  - Detection and localization of peptidases in Lactococcus lactis with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of Lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: PEPN1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase PepN, PEPT1-5 against a tripeptidase PepT and PEPD1-3 against a dipeptidase PepD. These monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of Lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. A number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. PEPT1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kDa protein in Lactobacillus delbrueckii, while PEPT1 and PEPT2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of Streptococcus thermophilus and Clostridium fervidus. Of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against PEPN, only PEPN3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kDa protein in Escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against PEPN3 cross reacted with 80 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii, and Str. bovis, but not of Esch. coli. Of the three monoclonal antibodies against PepD, only PEPD1 and PEPD2 cross reacted with 40 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii and Str. bovis. All PEPN, PEPD and PEPT antibodies reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different Lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris WG2. However, Lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other Lc. lactis subspecies since only PEPT1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. Immunogold labelling of Lc. lactis WG2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that PepN, PepD and PepT were located intracellularly. The intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.
TI  - Characterization of pepR1, a gene coding for a potential transcriptional regulator of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM7290.
AB  - The gene designated pepR1, encoding a potential transcription regulator of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM7290, was identified by sequence similarity of an open reading frame located upstream of the prolidase pepQ orientated in opposite direction. pepQ and pepR1 coding regions are spaced by 152 nucleotides. Upstream of the -35 region of pepQ, a 14-bp palindromic sequence, homologous to the catabolite responsive element, could be identified. The pepRl gene has the potential to encode a protein of 333 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 36955 Da and a calculated pl of 5.5. The deduced protein sequence shows significant identity to the catabolite control protein of Bacillus. Co-expression in Escherichia coli was studied with the pepR1-pepQ intergenic region fused to the promoterless beta-galactosidase reporter gene. The pepQ-beta-galactosidase hybrid displayed an enhanced expression in the presence of cloned pepR1.
TI  - The potential of Lactobacillus as a carrier for oral immunization: development and preliminary characterization of vector systems for targeted delivery of antigens.
AB  - Oral administration of lactobacilli evokes mucosal and systemic immune responses  against epitopes associated with these organisms (Gerritse et al., 1990, 1991). The adjuvant function of different Lactobacillus species was investigated under the conditions of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or oral administration. After i.p. injection of trinitrophenylated chicken gamma-globulin, high DTH responses were observed with Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum, but low responses with Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. In different experimental model systems L. casei and L. plantarum consistently showed significant adjuvanticity. A series of expression and expression-secretion vectors containing the strong constitutive promoter of the L. casei L-ldh gene or the regulatable promoter of the Lactobacillus amylovorus amy gene (Pouwels and Leer, 1995) was used for the intracellular, extracellular and surface-bound expression of an influenza virus antigenic determinant fused to Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase. Intracellular expression of the fusion protein amounted to 1-2% of total soluble protein. Lactobacilli synthesizing the fusion protein intracellularly evoked an oral immune response after subcutaneous priming.
TI  - An X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (pepX) gene from Lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  - The X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase gene (pepX) of an industrially used Lactobacillus helveticus strain has been detected by nucleic acid hybridization, cloned, characterized and sequenced. One ORF of 2379 bp with coding capacity for a 90.6 kDa protein (PepX) was found. The ORF was preceded by a typical prokaryotic promoter region. An inverted repeat structure with delta G of -84.1 kJ mol-1 was found downstream of the coding region. The deduced amino acid sequence of the 90.6 kDa protein showed 49.3, 49.4 and 77.7% homology with the PepX proteins from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, respectively. Northern blotting revealed a 2.6 kb transcript and one transcription start site was identified via primer extension analysis using an A.L.F. sequencer. In a bioreactor study, the expression of pepX in Lb. helveticus was studied as a function of growth. Transcription of pepX was typical of exponential growth phase expression. The pepX gene has been cloned into pKK223-3 and expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli JM105. PepX was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Optimum PepX activity was observed at pH 6.5 and 45 degrees C. According to gel filtration analysis, PepX is a dimer of 165 kDa. The enzyme was inactivated by heavy metal ions such as Cu2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+. EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline did not decrease PepX activity significantly. It was completely inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and reactivated by adding DTT, and strongly inhibited by PMSF. PepX is thus a metal-independent serine peptidase having functional sulfhydryl groups at or near the active site.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.  lactis bacteriophage LL-H lysin.
AB  - LL-H, a virulent phage of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, produces a peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme, Mur, that is effective on L. delbrueckii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Pediococcus damnosus cell walls. In this study, the LL-H gene mur was cloned into Escherichia coli, its nucleotide sequence was determined, and the enzyme produced in E. coli was purified and biochemically characterized. Mur was purified 112-fold by means of ammonium sulfate precipitation and cation-exchange chromatography. The cell wall-hydrolyzing activity was found to be associated with a 34-kDa protein. The C-terminal domain of Mur is not essential for catalytic activity since it can be removed without destroying the lytic activity. The N-terminal sequence of the purified lysin was identical to that deduced from the nucleotide sequence, but the first methionine is absent from the mature protein. The N-terminal part of this 297-amino-acid protein had homology with several Chalaropsis-type lysozymes. Reduction of purified and Mur-digested L. delbrueckii cell wall material with labeled NaB3H4 indicated that the enzyme is a muramidase. The temperature optimum of purified Mur is between 30 and 40 degrees C, and the pH optimum is around 5.0. The LL-H lysin Mur is stable at temperatures below 60 degrees C.
TI  - Sequence analysis, distribution and expression of an aminopeptidase N-encoding gene from Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32 [gene 155 (1995) 89-93].
AB  - Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus CNRZ32 possesses a 97-kDa metalloenzyme with aminopeptidase activity (PepN; EC 3.4.11.2). A 3.8-kb fragment encoding PepN was cloned into pIL253 and designated pSUW34. Transformation of Lactococcus (Lc.) lactis LM0230 with pSUW34 resulted in > 180-fold increase in general aminopeptidase (AP) activity using L-lysine-p-nitroanilide. Southern hybridization was conducted to determine the distribution of homology to the CNRZ32 pepN gene among lactic-acid bacteria (LAB). Hybridization was observed with strains of lactobacilli, pediococci, leuconostoc, streptococci and lactococci. The pepN gene was sequenced and found to encode a protein containing 844 amino acid (aa) residues. A comparison of Lb. helveticus CNRZ32 pepN to Lb. delbrueckii ssp. lactis DSM7290 pepN indicated 69.5% nucleotide (nt) identity and 71.8% aa identity, while comparison to pepN from Lc. lactis ssp. cremoris MG1363 indicated 61.1% nt identity and 49.2% aa identity. Alignment of peptidase aa sequences of LAB, Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian origin display homology in the zinc-binding domain, as well as a conserved region upstream from the putative active site.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacterial culture liquid on mutagenesis induced by 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium strains].
AB  - It was shown that cell extracts and cells of Streptococcus faecalis decrease the  mutagenic effect of 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1538 by 73 and 48%, respectively. Cell extracts and cells of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Propionibacterium shermanii exhibited weak antimutagenic activity. No antimutagenic effect was found in Escherichia coli AB1157, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, or Streptococcus thermophilus. Antimutageneicity of the cell extract of Str. faecalis is both associated with extracellular factors interacting with 2-nitrofluorene (desmutagenesis) and with factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagen biotransformation and mutation induction. Thiol compounds produced by growing Str. faecalis may be desmutagenic factors. A relatively heat-stable substance or substances of a peptide nature with a MM less than 12 kDa are antimutagenic factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagenesis.
TI  - Cloning and DNA sequence analysis of pepQ, a prolidase gene from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM7290 and partial characterization of its product.
AB  - From a genomic library of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis (DSM7290) DNA,  in the low-copy-number vector pLG339, a recombinant clone was selected, which complemented a mutation in the prolidase gene (pepQ) of Escherichia coli UK173. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1104 nucleotides corresponding to a protein of 368 amino acids with a calculated pI of 4.64 and a molecular mass of 41,087 Da. The start site of pepQ transcription was determined by primer extension analysis with mRNA prepared from L. delbrueckii. Based on homology of the gene product to various peptidases and on the substrate specificity determined, the peptidase was designated PepQ. The influence of various protease inhibitors and cations on peptidase activity indicated that PepQ is a metalloprotease. The absence of a membrane-spanning domain and a signal peptide sequence argues for a cytoplasmic localization of the enzyme.
TI  - Sequence analysis, distribution and expression of an aminopeptidase N-encoding gene from Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32.
AB  - Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus CNRZ32 possesses a 97-kDa metalloenzyme with aminopeptidase activity (PepN; EC 3.4.11.2). A 3.8-kb fragment encoding PepN was cloned into pIL253 and designated pSUW34. Transformation of lactococcus (Lc.) lactis LM0230 with pSUW34 resulted in > 180-fold increase in general aminopeptidase (AP) activity using L-lysine-p-nitroanilide. Southern hybridization was conducted to determine the distribution of homology to the CNRZ32 pepN gene among lactic-acid bacteria (LAB). Hybridization was observed with strains of lactobacilli, pediococci, leuconostoc, streptococci and lactococci. The pepN gene was sequenced and found to encode a protein containing 844 amino acid (aa) residues. A comparison of Lb. helveticus CNRZ32 pepN to Lb. delbrueckii ssp. lactis DSM7290 pepN indicated 69.5% nucleotide (nt) identity and 71.8% aa identity, while comparison to pepN from Lc. lactis ssp. cremoris MG1363 indicated 61.1% nt identity and 49.2% aa identity. Alignment of peptidase aa sequences of LAB, Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian origin display homology in the zinc-binding domain, as well as a conserved region upstream from the putative active site.
TI  - Molecular cloning and DNA sequence analysis of pepL, a leucyl aminopeptidase gene from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM7290.
AB  - A genomic library of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM7290 DNA fragments from a Sau3A partial digestion in the low-copy-number vector pLG339, was used to screen Escherichia coli for the presence of peptidases. Using the chromogenic substrate leucine-beta-naphthylamide (Leu-NH-Nap) and E. coli strain CM89 lacking the corresponding enzyme activity in an enzymic plate assay, allowed the isolation of two peptidase genes; the newly described pepL and the recently cloned and sequenced pepN. Clones could be distinguished not only by the restriction pattern of isolated plasmids but also by the rate and intensity of their colour reaction with Leu-NH-Nap. Three out of five clones were identified to express the Lactobacillus pepN gene; the others were shown to express a second aminopeptidase gene, designated pepL. This gene, together with 200 bp upstream of the proposed AUG initiation codon, was further subcloned and sequenced. The corresponding open reading frame of 897 nucleotides is predicted to encode a protein of 299 amino acids (34,541 Da). Searching the EMBL database revealed similarity to the prolinase of Lactobacillus helveticus (45.8% identity), to the iminopeptidases of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (25.5%), and to the Bacillus coagulans prolinase (21.5%). Minor similarities were detected for hydrolytic enzymes with serine active sites. The product encoded by the pepL gene was functional but could not be visualized on Coomassie-blue-stained polyacrylamide gels. High level expression of peptidase L in E. coli was achieved by placing the gene under the control of the T7 promoter.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in Salmonella typhimurium].
AB  - It is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of Propionibacterium shermanii, P. pentosaceum, P. thoenii, P. coccoides, P. acnes, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus, Str. faecalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Escherichia coli AB 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) in Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 decreases significantly. The highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. The cells passaged in the medium containing 4-NQO demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. Young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of Str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. Thiol accumulation in culture liquid from P. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. Over 24 h thiol content decreased. The maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. It is suggested that desmutagenesis of the bacteria studied towards 4-NQO is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of the Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis DSM7290 cysteine aminopeptidase gene pepC.
AB  - A genomic library of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis DSM7290 in the low copy number vector pLG339, was screened for the presence of peptidase genes. Using the chromogenic substrate gly-ala-beta-naphthylamide, which is not a substrate for any of the recently cloned peptidases of DSM7290, and the multiple peptidase deficient Escherichia coli strain CM89, allowed the isolation of clones, which contained the equivalent hydrolytic activity. To identify genes encoding the conserved catalytic active site of cysteine proteases, partial nucleotide sequencing with a degenerate oligonucleotide was performed on recombinant plasmids isolated from such clones. This allowed to identify two out of nine clones to carry the Lactobacillus pepC gene. A total of 2026 nucleotides were determined, and sequence analysis revealed a gene with strong homology to the recently cloned Lb. helveticus (73.2%) and Lactococcus lactis (51.03%) pepC genes, and the derived protein showed homology with the active site of a large number of cysteine proteases. The predicted open reading frame consists of 449 codons, coding for a protein of 50,909 Da. The enzyme is functional and extremely overexpressed in E. coli.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of pepV, a carnosinase gene from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM 7290, and partial characterization of the enzyme.
AB  - Cell extracts of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM 7290 were found to exhibit unique peptolytic ability against unusual beta-alanyl-dipeptides. In order to clone the gene encoding this activity, designated pepV, a gene library of strain DSM 7290 genomic DNA, prepared in the low-copy-number plasmid pLG339, was screened for heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. Recombinant clones harbouring pepV were identified by their ability to allow the utilization of carnosine (beta-alanyl-histidine) as a source of histidine by the E. coli mutant strain UK197 (pepD, hisG). Complementation was observed in a colony harbouring a recombinant plasmid (pKV101), carrying pepV. A 2.4 kb fragment containing pepV was subcloned and its nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 1413 nucleotides, corresponding to a protein with predicted molecular mass of 51998 Da. A single transcription initiation site 71 bp upstream of the ATG translational start codon was identified by primer extension. No significant homology was detected between pepV or its deduced amino acid sequence with any entry in the databases. The only similarity was found in a region conserved in the ArgE/DapE/CPG2/YscS family of proteins. This observation, and protease inhibitor studies, indicated that pepV is of the metalloprotease type. A second ORF present in the sequenced fragment showed extensive homology to a variety of amino acid permeases from E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
TI  - Determination and comparison of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis DSM7290 promoter sequences.
AB  - The transcriptional start points of ten Lactobacillus delbruckii ssp. lactis DSM7290 genes were determined by primer extension. The upstream located promoter regions, including potential -35 and -10 regions and the spacing between them were compared to the well-known Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis promoters. The Lb. delbruckii -35 consensus sequence (TTGACA) seems to be less conserved then the E. coli sequence. The nucleotides TGC were often found upstream of the -10 region (TATAAT). The most frequently observed spacing between the two core promoter regions was 17 nt and the main distance between the -10 region and the transcriptional start point was mostly determined to be 6 nt in contrast to 7 nt, as described for E. coli promoters. The preferred initiation nucleotides in Lb. delbruckii were shown to be definitely purines (A or G). The ribosome binding sites located downstream of the promoters revealed the consensus sequence 3'-UCCUCCU-5', being the predicted 3'-OH end of the Lactobacillus 16S rRNA with a high degree of homology to known 16S rRNAs.
TI  - NAD(+)-dependent D-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Gene cloning and enzyme characterization.
AB  - A genomic library from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was used to complement an Escherichia coli mutant strain deficient for both lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate lyase, and thus unable to grow anaerobically. One recombinant clone was found to display a broad specificity NAD(+)-dependent D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase activity. The corresponding gene (named hdhD) was subcloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the encoded enzyme indicates a 333-residue protein closely related to D-2-hydroxyisocaproate (i.e. 2-hydroxy-4-methyl-pentanoate) dehydrogenase (D-HO-HxoDH) of Lactobacillus casei and other NAD(+)-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenases (D-LDH) from several other bacterial species. The hdhD gene was overexpressed under the control of the lambda phage PL promoter and the enzyme was purified with a two-step method. The L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus enzyme, like that of L. casei, was shown to be active on a wide variety of 2-oxoacid substrates except those having a branched beta-carbon.
TI  - Cloning, molecular characterization, and expression of the genes encoding the lytic functions of lactococcal bacteriophage phi LC3: a dual lysis system of modular design.
AB  - The genes encoding the lysis proteins of Lactococcus lactis bacteriophage phi LC3 were cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The phi LC3 lysis genes, lysA and lysB, encode a membrane-disrupting protein (LysA) of 88 amino acids, and a cell wall degrading protein (LysB) of 429 amino acids, which shares significant sequence similarity with lysins from the Streptococcus pneumoniae phages Cp-1, Cp-7, and Cp-9, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii phage mv1. Both LysA and LysB function in E. coli, as judged by lysis of the E. coli host cells and by lytic activity against lactococcal cells when the cloned lysA and lysB genes are expressed. The LysA protein possesses two putative transmembrane helices and highly charged N- and C-termini, and is structurally similar to phage holins that are known to induce lesions in the inner membrane through which phage endolysin can be released to its cell wall substrate. The C-terminal end of LysB contains two highly homologous sequence repeats of 43 amino acids. The LysB repeats show strong sequence similarity to repeats found in lytic enzymes from other Gram-positive bacteria and from Bacillus subtilis phage phi 29 and PZA, as well as in some functionally unrelated proteins, and they are possibly involved in binding of the enzyme to the cell wall substrate. The organization of the dual phi LC3 lysis system supports earlier suggestions that exchange of modular units is an important principle in protein evolution.
TI  - Cloning, heterologous expression, and sequencing of a novel proline iminopeptidase gene, pepI, from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM 7290.
AB  - The gene for proline iminopeptidase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  DSM 7290 coding for an enzyme that hydrolyses the synthetic substrate L-prolyl-beta-naphthylamide (Pro-beta NA) was cloned in Escherichia coli. An enzymic plate assay was used to screen for positive clones. The gene, designated pepI, was subcloned into vector pUC18 and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence revealed an 882 bp open reading frame encoding 294 amino acids, coding for an enzyme with a calculated molecular mass of 32883 Da. By cloning under control of the lac promoter the peptidase was highly expressed. Sequence analysis showed that pepI is of a new sequence type, distinct from all peptidases so far sequenced. Amino acid homology to the active site of a Pseudomonas putida esterase and inhibitor studies of the enzyme imply involvement of a serine residue in catalysis.
TI  - Generation and Characterization of Environmentally Sensitive Variants of the beta-Galactosidase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  - A method is described for generating and screening variants of the beta-galactosidase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus sensitive to several environmental stresses, with potential application in the food industry. Chemical mutagenesis with hydroxylamine or methoxylamine was performed on the beta-galactosidase gene carried on an Escherichia coli expression vector. Mutants sensitive to cold, heat, low pH, low magnesium concentration, and the presence of urea were isolated by screening for reduced color development on beta-galactosidase indicator plates. The mutations responsible for three variant beta-galactosidases were localized, and the base substitutions were determined by DNA sequencing. The amino acid alterations associated with one low-pH-sensitive (pHs) and two urea-sensitive (Us) variants correspond to P584L (pHs1), G400S/R479Q (Us26), and G167E/E168K/E363K/V492M (Us17), respectively. Mutant pHs1 is also heat, cold, low magnesium, and urea sensitive; Us26 is also cold sensitive; and Us17 is also low-pH sensitive.
TI  - Proline iminopeptidase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CNRZ 397: purification and characterization.
AB  - Proline iminopeptidase (PepIP) is a major peptidase in Lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp. bularicus CNRZ397, encoded by the pepIP gene. Amplification and expression of this gene in Escherichia coli K12 resulted in a very high level of enzyme production. Moreover, export into the E. coli periplasm of 45% of PepIP activity allowed us to purify the enzyme easily by a single ion-exchange chromatography step. PepIP is a trimer of Mr 100000 , composed of three identical subunits. In the presence of 0.1% BSA, PepIP activity was optimal at pH 6-7 and stable at temperatures below 40 degrees C. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, a serine protease inhibitor, by bestatin and by heavy metal ions. It was also inactivated by p-chloromercuribenzoate, but was reactivated by adding dithiothreitol. PepIP is characterized by a high specificity towards di- or tripeptides with proline at the NH2-terminal position, but is not able to hydrolyse longer peptides, or peptides with hydroxyproline at the NH2-end. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified PepIP corresponds to the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the pepIP gene.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and characterization of the pepIP gene encoding a proline iminopeptidase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CNRZ 397.
AB  - The proline iminopeptidase (PepIP) of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is a major peptidase located in the cell envelope. Its structural gene (pepIP) has been cloned into pUC18 and expressed at a very high level in Escherichia coli to give a PepIP activity 15,000-fold higher than that found in L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The nucleotide sequence of the pepIP gene revealed an open reading frame of 295 codons encoding a protein with a predicted M(r) of 33,006, which is consistent with the apparent size of the gene product. The amino acid sequence of PepIP shows significant homology with those of other hydrolases involved in the degradation of cyclic compounds. In particular, there is a region which includes an identified catalytic site containing a serine residue and a motif specific for the active sites of prolyloligopeptidases (Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly-Gly). The PepIP opens a new way for supplying cells with proline using the peptides resulting from the proteolytic degradation of caseins.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the lactacin F operon.
AB  - Lactacin F is a nonlantibiotic, heat-stable, peptide bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus johnsonii VPI11088. Molecular analysis of the lactacin F DNA region characterized a small operon that codes for three open reading frames, designated lafA, lafX, and ORFZ. The peptide encoded by lafA, the lactacin F structural gene, was compared with various peptide bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria, and similarities were identified in the amino and carboxy termini of the propeptides. Site-directed mutagenesis of the LafA precursor at the two glycine residues in positions -1 and -2 defined an essential motif for processing of mature lactacin F. The involvement of the peptides encoded by lafX and ORFZ in bacteriocin expression was investigated by subcloning various fragments from the lactacin F region into the shuttle vector pGKV210. In addition to lafA, expression of lafX is essential to lactacin F activity. The lactacin F operon resembles the genetic organization of lactococcin M. Although no function has been assigned to ORFZ by genetic analysis, both peptide Z and the lactococcin M immunity protein are predicted to be integral membrane proteins with four putative transmembrane segments. Lactacin F activity, defined by bactericidal action on Lactobacillus delbrueckii, is dependent on the expression of two genes, lafA and lafX.
TI  - Differentiation of Lactobacillus strains by ribotyping.
AB  - Fifty-four lactobacillus strains were differentiated by ribotyping. The stability of ribotypes characteristic of four strains of lactobacilli inhabiting the digestive tract of mice was investigated. One of four isolates of Lactobacillus delbrueckii GT21, which had been associated with mice for 22 months, had an altered ribotype.
TI  - Organization and nucleotide sequence of the glutamine synthetase (glnA) gene from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  - A 3.3-kb BamHI fragment of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus DNA was cloned and sequenced. It complements an Escherichia coli glnA deletion strain and hybridizes strongly to a DNA containing the Bacillus subtilis glnA gene. DNA sequence analysis of the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus DNA showed it to contain the glnA gene encoding class I glutamine synthetase, as judged by extensive homology with other prokaryotic glnA genes. The sequence suggests that the enzyme encoded in this gene is not controlled by adenylylation. Based on a comparison of glutamine synthetase sequences, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is much closer to gram-positive eubacteria, especially Clostridium acetobutylicum, than to gram-negative eubacteria and archaebacteria. The fragment contains another open reading frame encoding a protein of unknown function consisting of 306 amino acids (ORF306), which is also present upstream of glnA of Bacillus cereus. In B. cereus, a repressor gene, glnR, is found between the open reading frame and glnA. Two proteins encoded by the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus gene were identified by the maxicell method; the sizes of these proteins are consistent with those of the open reading frames of ORF306 and glnA. The lack of a glnR gene in the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus DNA in this position may indicate a gene rearrangement or a different mechanism of glnA gene expression.
TI  - Cloning of the D-lactate dehydrogenase gene from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus by complementation in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A strain of Escherichia coli (FMJ144) deficient for pyruvate formate lyase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was complemented with a genomic DNA library from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. One positive cloned showed LDH activity and production of D(-)lactate was demonstrated. The nucleotide sequence of the D-LDH gene (ldhA) revealed the spontaneous insertion of an E. coli insertion sequence IS2 upstream of the gene coding region. The open reading frame encoded a 333-amino acid protein, showing no similarity with known L-LDH sequences but closely related to L. casei D-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase (D-HicDH).
TI  - Purification and properties of the phosphofructokinase from Lactobacillus bulgaricus. A non-allosteric analog of the enzyme from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Phosphofructokinase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in Lactobacillus bulgaricus (Lactobacillus delbrueckii, subspecies bulgaricus) has been purified to homogeneity and some of its structural and functional properties have been studied. The enzyme is a tetramer composed of four 35-kDa subunits. Its N-terminal sequence determined on 38 residues is homologous to those of the major allosteric enzymes from Escherichia coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus, suggesting that the three proteins have closely related structures. The maximum velocity of the enzyme from L. bulgaricus increases with pH according to the ionization of a group with a pK of 6.2. At all pH values, the saturation by fructose 6-phosphate is hyperbolic. At the optimum pH of 8.2, the maximum velocity and the affinities for the ATP and fructose 6-phosphate substrates are not modified by the presence of ADP or GDP nor by phosphoenolpyruvate. Partial inhibition by phosphoenolpyruvate exists at acidic pH, but is not related to an allosteric mechanism similar to that in E. coli. This inhibition results from a shift from 6.2 to 7.1 of the pK of an ionizable group which controls Vmax. Protection against thermal denaturation shows that the enzyme binds phosphoenolpyruvate and not GDP. The phosphofructokinase from L. bulgaricus appears as a structural analog of the E. coli enzyme which does not undergo an allosteric transition between two states R and T, but instead remains in a unique conformational state, intermediate between the R and T states; the active sites have an R-like conformation since they bind fructose 6-phosphate, whereas the regulatory sites have a T-like conformation since they bind phosphoenolpyruvate and not GDP.
TI  - Cloning, expression and sequence analysis of an endolysin-encoding gene of Lactobacillus bulgaricus bacteriophage mv1.
AB  - The lysA gene specifying an endolysin of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus bacteriophage mv1, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The 4.05-kb restriction fragment containing this gene was analysed by restriction and deletion mapping, and by subcloning. The nucleotide sequence of a 1150-bp fragment coding for an active lysin was determined. The lysA gene consists of 585 bp and codes for a protein of a deduced Mr of 21,120, which agrees with the size based on in vivo transcription/translation studies. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mv1 lysin (LysA) was compared to that of other known lytic enzymes. Significant homology was observed with the N-terminal portion of the muramidase of the fungus Chalaropsis and that of the muramidase of the Streptococcus pneumoniae phage Cp-1, suggesting that LysA might be a muramidase. In E. coli, the cloned lysA gene was able to complement the muramidase-defective bacteriophage lambda Ram5, proving that the products of these two genes are interchangeable. The lysA gene is preceded by an open reading frame with unknown function and no characteristic prokaryotic promoter sequences could be detected upstream from lysA, suggesting that this gene is part of an operon.
TI  - DNA Probe for Lactobacillus delbrueckii.
AB  - From a genomic DNA library of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, a clone was isolated which complements a leucine auxotrophy of an Escherichia coli strain (GE891). Subsequent analysis of the clone indicated that it could serve as a specific DNA probe. Dot-blot hybridizations with over 40 different Lactobacillus strains showed that this clone specifically recognizes L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, bulgaricus, and lactis. The sensitivity of the method was tested by using an alpha-P-labeled DNA probe.
TI  - Cloning the Gene for the Malolactic Fermentation of Wine from Lactobacillus delbrueckii in Escherichia coli and Yeasts.
AB  - The gene responsible for the malolactic fermentation of wine was cloned from the  bacterium Lactobacillus delbrueckii into Escherichia coli and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This gene codes for the malolactic enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of l-malate to l-lactate. A genetically engineered yeast strain with this enzymatic capability would be of considerable value to winemakers. L. delbrueckii DNA was cloned in E. coli on the plasmid pBR322, and two E. coll clones able to convert l-malate to l-lactate were selected. Both clones contained the same 5-kilobase segment of L. delbrueckii DNA. The DNA segment was transferred to E. coli-yeast shuttle vectors, and gene expression was analyzed in both hosts by using enzymatic assays for l-lactate and l-malate. When grown nonaerobically for 5 days, E. coli cells harboring the malolactic gene converted about 10% of the l-malate in the medium to l-lactate. The best expression in S. cerevisiae was attained by transfer of the gene to a shuttle vector containing both a yeast 2-mum plasmid and yeast chromosomal origin of DNA replication. When yeast cells harboring this plasmid were grown nonaerobically for 5 days, ca. 1.0% of the l-malate present in the medium was converted to l-lactate. The L. delbrueckii controls grown under these same conditions converted about 25%. A laboratory yeast strain containing the cloned malolactic gene was used to make wine in a trial fermentation, and about 1.5% of the l-malate in the grape must was converted to l-lactate. Increased expression of the malolactic gene in wine yeast will be required for its use in winemaking. This will require an increased understanding of the factors governing the expression of this gene in yeasts.
