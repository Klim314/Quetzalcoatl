TI  == augmentation of vaccenate production and suppression of vaccenate biohydrogenation in cultures of mixed ruminal microbes.
AB  == to increase ruminal outflow of trans-vaccenic acid (t-va), a new strain of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (mdt-10) was isolated that has a great ability to hydrogenate linoleic acid (la) to t-va. when strain mdt-10 was added to the batch cultures of mixed ruminal microbes (1% of the total number of viable ruminal bacteria), la conversion to t-va increased greatly; after 3 h, t-va levels were > 4-fold higher than the control. by 10 h, all of the t-va was hydrogenated to stearic acid. however, when a new strain of bifidobacterium adolescentis (hf-11), which has a high capacity for incorporation of t-va, was added in conjunction with mdt-10 (1% of the total number of ruminal bacteria), t-va levels after 10 h  were 6 times higher than with mdt-10 alone. these results suggest that t-va produced by mdt-10 was incorporated into hf-11 cells, resulting in protection of  t-va from t-va-hydrogenating microbes. similar results were obtained in a continuous culture of mixed ruminal microbes in which addition of hf-11 simultaneously with mdt-10 increased the amount of t-va in the effluent 2.5-fold. both mdt-10 and hf-11 appeared to grow readily in the presence of mixed ruminal microbes. sixty-two percent of t-va incorporated by hf-11 was present in the free form, whereas 19, 15, and 3%, respectively, were incorporated into monoacylglycerol, glycerophospholipid, and diacylglycerol fractions. because these lipids can be digested in the small intestine, it is likely that most t-va  in hf-11 cells is absorbed. thus, introduction of mdt-10 and hf-11 simultaneously to the rumen might increase the amount of t-va absorbed and might consequently increase the conversion of t-va to conjugated linoleic acid in tissue.
