TI  == bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == objectives: to assess the bacteriology of beta-lactamase (bl) enzyme activity in  sputum of 40 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (aecb). methods: the microbiology, bl production by the different isolates, and bl contents in the sputum were determined. results: eighty-four isolates were recovered (2.1 isolates per specimen), 44 aerobic and facultative (1.1 isolates per specimen), and 40 anaerobic (1.0 isolate per specimen). aerobic bacteria were recovered in only 9 (22.5%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria in 9 (22.5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 22 (55%). the predominant aerobic isolates were streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), haemophilus influenzae (11), moraxella catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (19), prevotella sp. (11), and fusobacterium sp.(6). mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. the predominant aerobic blpb were h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the predominant anaerobic blpb were prevotella sp. and fusobacterium sp. beta-lactamase activity  was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which blpb were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor blpb. conclusions: the rapid detection of bl activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with aecb.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of otorrhea associated with tympanostomy tubes in children.
AB  == the microbiology of in 55 ear aspirates obtained from 34 children with chronic otorrhea was studied. aspiration of the middle ear exudate was done immediately following removal of tympanostomy tube (tt). the middle ear aspirates and swab specimens of the external auditory canals were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. sixty-five isolates were recovered only from the middle ears, 73 only from the external ear canals, and 73 were present at both sites. analysis of the  138 middle ear isolates demonstrated the recovery of aerobic bacteria only in 28  patients (50%), anaerobes only in seven (13%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in  20 (36%). there were 77 aerobic and 61 anaerobic isolates. commonly recovered aerobes were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 isolates), staphylococcus aureus (11), proteus sp. (7), moraxella catarrhalis (6), klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable haemophilus influenzae (5). commonly isolated anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), prevotella sp. (10), bacteroides sp. (8) and fusobacterium sp. (6). pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of tt-related otorrhea in children. specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the tt or  through the open perforation after their removal.

TI  == expression of capsules by haemophilus influenzae in mixed infections.
AB  == the pathogenicity of eight clinical isolates of non-type b haemophilus influenzae was investigated by inoculating them subcutaneously into mice, alone or mixed with viable or non-viable bacteria of certain other species. three of the h. influenzae isolates were non-capsulated while five were slightly capsulated (less than 1% of organisms had capsules). the other strains of bacteria tested were four isolates of capsulated and four isolates of non-capsulated pigmented strains of prevotella sp. and porphyromonus sp. as well as a capsulate klebsiella pneumoniae ("helpers"). none of the non-capsulated strains induced an abscess when inoculated alone. following co-inoculation of viable or non-viable "helpers" with h. influenzae, abscesses were formed in all instances in which the "helper"  had a capsule. profusely capsulated cells of h. influenzae were recovered, however, only from abscesses induced with the five slightly capsulated strains of h. influenzae. these capsulated organisms were found serologically to be of type  b and induced abscesses when inoculated alone. our findings illustrate the ability of non-capsulated strains of h. influenzae to produce progeny of capsulated type b organisms after co-inoculation with certain other species.

TI  == microbiology of chronic suppurative otitis media in children in surabaya, indonesia.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of 38 children from surabaya, indonesia, who suffered from chronic suppurative otitis media (csom) was studied using strict microbiological methodology. a total of 106 isolates (49 anaerobic and 57  aerobic) were recovered. aerobic organisms alone were isolated from 11 (29%), anaerobic bacteria only in 4 (11%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were present in 23 (60%). the predominant organisms were peptostreptococcus sp., prevotella sp., bacteroides sp., staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and fusobacterium sp. thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing  bacteria were recovered from 22 (58%) patients. these findings demonstrate the role of penicillin resistant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial  etiology of csom in children from indonesia. judicious use of antimicrobial therapy may prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
