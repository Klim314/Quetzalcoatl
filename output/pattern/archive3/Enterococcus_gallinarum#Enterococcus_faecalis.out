study of vancomycin resistance in faecal enterococci from healthy humans and dogs in spain a decade after the avoparcin ban in europe.
one hundred and 26 faecal samples from healthy dogs (2009) and 157 faecal samples from healthy humans (2007) from la rioja region (spain) were tested to know the carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). vre with intrinsic resistance (vanc) were found in 12% of healthy dogs and humans (29 enterococcus gallinarum and four enterococcus casseliflavus). nevertheless, vre with acquired mechanism of resistance were not detected among these samples. four enterococcus faecalis isolates with vancomycin mic of 8-16 mg l(-1) were recovered in human samples, but no single organism with known mechanism of acquired resistance could be identified. these 37 vre isolates (33 e. gallinarum/e. casseliflavus and four e. faecalis) of dog and human origin were further characterized (pcr detection of antibiotic resistance, virulence and bacteriocin genes). high prevalence of tetracycline resistance was identified (70%), especially among dog isolates harbouring tet(m) +/- tet(l) genes; erythromycin resistance was also higher among isolates from dogs and they harboured the erm(b) gene, associated with erm(a) gene in one case. virulence genes were only identified among e. faecalis isolates of human origin (agg, cpd and/or gele) and never among e. gallinarum/e. casseliflavus of human or dog origin. five e. gallinarum isolates of dog and three e. faecalis of human origin expressed bacteriocin activity; among them, only one e. faecalis presented activity against listeria monocytogenes. the bacteriocin structural gene ef1097 was identified in 3 bacteriocin-producing e. faecalis isolates, associated with ent1071 in one of them.
first detection of the staphylococcal trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk and the dfrk-carrying transposon tn559 in enterococci.
the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk has been recently described in staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. a total of 166 enterococci of different species (e. faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrk gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. the dfrk gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=2 mg/l or </=1 mg/l, respectively). the tet(l)-dfrk linkage was detected in 21% of dfrk-positive enterococci. the chromosomal location of the dfrk gene was identified in one e. faecium isolate in which the dfrk was not linked to tet(l) gene but was part of a tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radc gene. this tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. all combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrk, dfrg, dfrf, dfrk+dfrg, dfrk+dfrf, dfrf+dfrg, and dfrf+dfrg+dfrk). the gene dfrk gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. this study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrg.
antimicrobial resistance of enterococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples in korea.
the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance of various species of enterococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples. a total of 105 enterococci isolates were examined: enterococcus faecalis (n = 47), enterococcus faecium (n = 39), enterococcus gallinarum (n = 6), enterococcus avium (n = 6), enterococcus hirae (n = 5) and enterococcus durans (n = 2). all the isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin, and only a single e. hirae isolate was resistant to ampicillin. in general, the most frequently observed resistance among the enterococcal isolates was to tetracycline (69.5%), followed by penicillin (64.7%), erythromycin (57.1%) and cephalothin (44.7%). a similar antimicrobial resistance pattern was observed among individual species except e. durans, which exhibited only tetracycline resistance. resistance observed among isolates of e. hirae and e. gallinarum was almost as high as e. faecium and e. faecalis. of 105 isolates, only six (5.7%) strains of e. faecium were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested and about 52% (55/105) showed resistance to more than three antimicrobials. the most common multiple resistance pattern was penicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin, which was observed in 32 of 105 (30.4%) isolates. this study demonstrates that enterococcal isolates belonging to minor species showed antimicrobial resistance rates as high as those of e. faecium and e. faecalis, and that monitoring of antimicrobial resistance should not be restricted only to those two major species.
a "retrocidal" plasmid in enterococcus faecalis: passage and protection.
enterococcus faecalis mc4 harbors a 130 kb conjugative, pheromone (ccf10)-responding plasmid, pams1, conferring chloramphenicol, streptomycin and tetracycline resistances. a plasmid-borne class iia bacteriocin (mc4-1) determinant and cognate immunity gene were present, but not expressed in mc4. however, pams1 transfer to e. faecalis jh2-2 (but not to the non-isogenic og1ss) generated the surprising ability to express bacteriocin activity against the plasmid donor, mc4. the bacteriocin target spectrum includes e. faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, and listeria monocytogenes. those donors unable to express bacteriocin or immunity could protect themselves from the "retrocidal" behavior of transconjugants by a switch to bacteriocin resistance at a frequency of approximately 10(-3). reversion to sensitivity occurred at a relatively high frequency, suggestive of involvement of a phase variation event. these observations concerning a conjugative plasmid with novel "retrocidal" properties, coupled with a defense mechanism independent of plasmid-borne immunity functions, may relate to phenomena exploiting regulatory features with broader ecological and evolutionary implications.
antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus species isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
three hundred and ten enterococcal isolates (178 enterococcus faecium, 68 e. durans, 49 e. faecalis, 8 e. italicus, 3 e. gallinarum, 3 e. casseliflavus, and 1 e. hirae) from slovak bryndza cheese were evaluated for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents (vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, rifampicin, nitrofurantoin, and ciprofloxacin). all enterococcal isolates from bryndza cheese were susceptible to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin as determined by the disk diffusion method. vancomycin resistance genes vana and vanb were not detected. resistance rates of enterococcal isolates to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin were 24, 26, 2, and 1 %, respectively. thirty-six % of e. faecium isolates and 22 % of the e. faecalis isolates were resistant to erythromycin. resistance to rifampicin was similar in e. faecium (31 %) and e. faecalis (29 %). both e. faecium and e. faecalis strains showed the same resistance to ciprofloxacin (2 %). e. durans isolates showed low levels of resistance to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin (1-4 %). forty-eight (30 %) of the e. faecium isolates, two (3 %) of the e. durans isolates, and six (12 %) of the e. faecalis isolates exhibited multidrug resistance. the highest frequency of resistant enterococci was observed in bryndza produced in winter season.
role of the transmembrane domain of the vant serine racemase in resistance to vancomycin in enterococcus gallinarum bm4174.
enterococcus gallinarum bm4175 (a vancomycin-susceptible derivative of bm4174 obtained by insertional inactivation of vanc-1) was transformed with plasmid constructs pca10 (containing the genes necessary for resistance, vanc-1-xyc-t), pjp1 (with a fragment lacking the dna encoding the transmembrane region of vant, -vanc-1-xyc-t((delta))(2-322)-) and with plasmids containing fragments encoding either the transmembrane (mvant(1-322)) or racemase (svant(323-698)) domains of vant under the control of a constitutive promoter. accumulated peptidoglycan precursors were measured in all strains in the presence of l-ser, d-ser (50 mm) or in the absence of any growth supplement. uptake of 0.1 mm l-[(14)c]serine was also determined in bm4174, bm4175 and bm4175/pca10. vancomycin resistance was restored in bm4175 transformed with pca10(c-1-xyc-t), and the profile of peptidoglycan precursors was similar to wild-type e. gallinarum bm4174. transformation of e. gallinarum bm4175 with plasmid pjp1(vanc-1-xyc-t((delta))(2-322)) resulted in: (i) vancomycin mics remaining within susceptible levels (< or =4 mg/l) in the absence of any growth supplement, but increasing to 8 mg/l when either l-ser or d-ser was added to the medium; and (ii) the relative amounts of accumulated udp-murnac-pentapeptide[d-ser] and tetrapeptide precursors decreasing substantially compared with bm4175/pca10 and bm4174. the effect on the appearance of tetrapeptide appeared to be host dependent, since a substantial amount was present when the same plasmid construct pjp1(vanc-1-xyc-t((delta))(2-322)) was electroporated into enterococcus faecalis jh2-2. the uptake of l-[(14)c]ser at 240 s was decreased by approximately 40% in bm4175 compared with bm4174. plasmid pca10(c-1-xy(c)-t) restored uptake of l-[(14)c]ser at 180 and 240 s in bm4175. the results suggest that the transmembrane domain of vant is likely to be involved in the transport of l-ser, and that in its absence the resistance phenotype is compromised.
enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl. tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
effects of different test conditions on mics of food animal growth-promoting antibacterial agents for enterococci.
the influence of the addition of sheep blood to mueller-hinton ii agar and the effects of aerobic incubation with or without co2 and of anaerobic incubation were tested with bacitracin, tylosin, avoparcin, virginiamycin, avilamycin, narasin, and flavomycin on enterococci. the antibacterial activity of bambermycin (flavomycin) was strongly inhibited by the addition of blood, except with the species enterococcus faecium, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus casseliflavus, and enterococcus gallinarum, which were not susceptible to this antibiotic on blood-free medium. with all other antimicrobials except avoparcin and tylosin, the presence of blood resulted in mic increases of 1 to 3 log2 differences. incubation in aerobic or anaerobic atmospheres enriched with co2 lowered the susceptibility of enterococci to tylosin and increased their susceptibility to avilamycin, narasin, and avoparcin. this effect was most pronounced in tests on blood-free media. results of susceptibility tests incubated under anaerobiosis and in a co2-enriched atmosphere did not differ. for all enterococcal species, the preferred conditions for testing the susceptibility are mueller-hinton ii medium supplemented with blood and incubation in a co2-enriched atmosphere. however, when only e. faecium and enterococcus faecalis are being tested, mueller-hinton ii medium without blood incubated aerobically gives satisfactory results.
semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from ly264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
