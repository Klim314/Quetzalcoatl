TI  == cyclohexane-1,2-dione hydrolase from denitrifying azoarcus sp. strain 22lin, a novel member of the thiamine diphosphate enzyme family.
AB  == alicyclic compounds with hydroxyl groups represent common structures in numerous  natural compounds, such as terpenes and steroids. their degradation by microorganisms in the absence of dioxygen may involve a c-c bond ring cleavage to form an aliphatic intermediate that can be further oxidized. the cyclohexane-1,2-dione hydrolase (cdh) (ec 3.7.1.11) from denitrifying azoarcus sp. strain 22lin, grown on cyclohexane-1,2-diol as a sole electron donor and carbon source, is the first thiamine diphosphate (thdp)-dependent enzyme characterized to date that cleaves a cyclic aliphatic compound. the degradation of cyclohexane-1,2-dione (cdo) to 6-oxohexanoate comprises the cleavage of a c-c  bond adjacent to a carbonyl group, a typical feature of reactions catalyzed by thdp-dependent enzymes. in the subsequent nad(+)-dependent reaction, 6-oxohexanoate is oxidized to adipate. cdh has been purified to homogeneity by the criteria of gel electrophoresis (a single band at approximately 59 kda; calculated molecular mass, 64.5 kda); in solution, the enzyme is a homodimer ( approximately 105 kda; gel filtration). as isolated, cdh contains 0.8 +/- 0.05 thdp, 1.0 +/- 0.02 mg(2+), and 1.0 +/- 0.015 flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad) per monomer as a second organic cofactor, the role of which remains unclear. strong reductants, ti(iii)-citrate, na(+)-dithionite, and the photochemical 5-deazaflavin/oxalate system, led to a partial reduction of the fad chromophore.  the cleavage product of cdo, 6-oxohexanoate, was also a substrate; the corresponding cyclic 1,3- and 1,4-diones did not react with cdh, nor did the cis- and trans-cyclohexane diols. the enzymes acetohydroxyacid synthase (ahas) from saccharomyces cerevisiae, pyruvate oxidase (pox) from lactobacillus plantarum, benzoylformate decarboxylase from pseudomonas putida, and pyruvate decarboxylase  from zymomonas mobilis were identified as the closest relatives of cdh by comparative amino acid sequence analysis, and a thdp binding motif and a 2-fold rossmann fold for fad binding could be localized at the c-terminal end and central region of cdh, respectively. a first mechanism for the ring cleavage of cdo is presented, and it is suggested that the fad cofactor in cdh is an evolutionary relict.

TI  == characterization of a nitroreductase with selective nitroreduction properties in  the food and intestinal lactic acid bacterium lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1.
AB  == nitroreductases reduce nitroaromatic compounds and other oxidants in living organisms, having interesting implications in environmental and human health. a putative nitrobenzoate reductase encoding gene (lp_0050) was recently annotated in the completed dna sequence of lactic acid bacterium lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 strain. in this research, this l. plantarum gene was cloned and expressed,  and the corresponding protein (pnba) was biochemically characterized. this l. plantarum pnba reductase is a 216 amino acid residue fmn-flavoprotein, which exhibits 23% identity with pseudomonas putida and ralstonia eutropha nitroreductases and <11% identity with those from enterobacteria such as e. cloacae . this reductase also showed 32-43% identity (65-72% similarity) to predicted pnba proteins from other lactic acid bacteria. it utilized a wide range of electron acceptors including dichlorophenolindophenol (dcpip), nitroblue tetrazolium (nbt), ferricyanide, and quinones (menadione, benzoquinone), but not  pyridinium cations (paraquat and n-methyl-beta-carbolines), and it was inhibited  by dicoumarol and diphenyliodonium. hplc-ms and spectroscopic data showed that it specifically catalyzed the reduction of the 4-nitroaromatic group to the corresponding hydroxylamine in the presence of nad(p)h. kinetics parameters (v(max) and k(m)) showed a higher efficiency for the reduction of 2,4-dinitrobenzoate than for the reduction of 4-nitrobenzoate. it was chemoselective for the reduction of 4-nitrobenzoates, being unable to reduce other nitroaromatics. then, l. plantarum pnba reductase might be more specific than other microbial nitroreductases that reduce a wider range of nitroaromatic compounds. the physiological and functional role of nitroreductases remain unknown; however, their presence in lactic acid bacteria widely occurring in foods and the human intestinal tract should be of further interest.

TI  == elucidation of the chemistry of enzyme-bound thiamin diphosphate prior to substrate binding: defining internal equilibria among tautomeric and ionization states.
AB  == both solution and crystallographic studies suggest that the 4'-aminopyrimidine ring of the thiamin diphosphate coenzyme participates in catalysis, likely as an  intramolecular general acid-base catalyst via the unusual 1',4'-iminopyrimidine tautomer. it is indeed uncommon for a coenzyme to be identified in its rare tautomeric form on its reaction pathways, yet this has been possible with thiamin diphosphate, in some cases even in the absence of substrate [nemeria, n., chakraborty, s., baykal, a., korotchkina, l., patel, m. s., and jordan, f. (2007) proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 104, 78-82.]. the ability to detect both the aminopyrimidine and iminopyrimidine tautomeric forms of thiamin diphosphate on enzymes has enabled us to assign the predominant tautomeric form present in individual intermediates on the pathway. herein, we report the ph dependence of these tautomeric forms providing the first data for the internal thermodynamic equilibria on thiamin diphosphate enzymes for the various ionization and tautomeric forms of this coenzyme on four enzymes: benzaldehyde lyase, benzoylformate decarboxylase, pyruvate oxidase, and the e1 component of the human pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex. evidence is provided for an important function of the enzyme environment in altering both the ionization and tautomeric equilibria on the coenzyme even prior to addition of substrate. the pka for the 4'-aminopyrimidinium moiety coincides with the ph for optimum activity thereby ensuring that all ionization states and tautomeric states are accessible during the catalytic cycle. the dramatic influence of the protein on the internal equilibria also points to conditions under which the long-elusive ylide intermediate could be stabilized.

TI  == interactions between high pressure homogenization and antimicrobial activity of lysozyme and lactoperoxidase.
AB  == it was the objective of this work to evaluate the effect of high pressure homogenization on the activity of antimicrobial enzymes such as lysozyme and lactoperoxidase against a selected group of gram positive and gram negative species inoculated in skim milk. lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and listeria monocytogenes were the most pressure resistant species while bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas putida, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris and salmonella enteritidis were found to  be very sensitive to the hyperbaric treatment. the enzyme addition enhanced the instantaneous pressure efficacy on almost all the considered species as indicated by their instantaneous viability loss following the treatment. moreover, the combination of the enzyme and high pressure homogenization significantly affected the recovery and growth dynamics of several of the considered species. although l. monocytogenes was slightly sensitive to pressure, the combination of the two stress factors induced a significant viability loss within 3 h and an extension of lag phases in skim milk during incubation at 37 degrees c. the hypothesis formulated in this work is that the interaction of high pressure homogenization and lysozyme or lactoperoxidase is associated to conformational modifications of  the two proteins with a consequent enhancement of their activity. this hypothesis is supported by the experimental results also regarding the increased antimicrobial activity against l. plantarum of the previously pressurised lysozyme with respect to that of the native enzyme.

TI  == sensorial and microbial effects of gaseous ozone on fresh scad (trachurus trachurus).
AB  == the bactericidal activity of gaseous ozone was investigated using a commercial ozone generator. five species of fish bacteria, pseudomonas putida, shewanella putrefaciens, brochothrix thermosphacta, enterobacter sp. and lactobacillus plantarum, were inoculated on agar surfaces and exposed to different ozonation times in a gas chamber. results showed ozone in relatively low concentrations (<  0.27 x 10(-3) g l-1) was an effective bactericide of vegetative cells of the five fish bacteria. the age of the cell culture was shown to influence the cell response following exposure. survival rate was not linearly related to ozonation  time, but exhibited biphasic death over an extended period. similar bactericidal  effects were observed on fish skin treated with ozone daily in the laboratory, with decreases of 1.0 log cfu cm-2 for the micro-organisms studied. whole fish treated daily in the laboratory using a commercial ozone generator showed improved scores for sensory analyses compared with the controls. the results were statistically significant. fish treated on board ships were also analysed for microbiological and sensory changes. controls were obtained from a similar vessel without the ozone facility in the hold. similar trends to those recorded in the laboratory for the microbiological and sensory results on ozonated fish were observed.

TI  == permeabilization of mycolic-acid-containing actinomycetes for in situ hybridization with fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes.
AB  == the application of whole-cell hybridization using labelled oligonucleotide probes in microbial systematics and ecology is limited by difficulties in permeabilizing many gram-positive organisms. in this investigation paraformaldehyde treatment, acid methanolysis and acid hydrolysis were evaluated as a means of permeabilizing mycolic-acid-containing actinomycetes prior to hybridization with a fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probe designed to bind to a conserved sequence of bacterial 16s rrna. methods were evaluated on stationary-phase cultures of gordona bronchialis, mycobacterium fortuitum, nocardia asteroides, n. brasiliensis, rhodococcus equi, r. erythropolis, r. fascians, r. rhodochrous and  tsukamurella paurometabola, none of which could be probed following 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde fixation. for comparison and to test the general applicability of mild acid pretreatments, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus plantarum, escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida were also studied. the data showed that most of the mycolic-acid-containing organisms were successfully permeabilized by  mild acid hydrolysis in 1 m hcl at 37 degrees c. cells were treated for different lengths of time. in general, the mycolic-acid-containing organisms required between 30 and 50 min hydrolysis, whereas b. subtilis, e. coli and p. putida were rendered permeable in only 10 min. interestingly, l. plantarum could not be permeabilized using acid hydrolysis even after 60 min exposure to 1 m hcl.

TI  == identification and evaluation of volatile compounds of vacuum and modified atmosphere packaged beef strip loins.
AB  == beef strip loins were packaged and stored for up to 28 days at 3 degrees c in high-oxygen barrier film under vacuum and in 100% co(2), 40% co(2)/60% n(2) and 20% co(2)/80% o(2). as storage progressed, loins packaged and stored in 20% co(2)/80% o(2) developed strong off-odors. 1-hexene, methyl thiirane, ethyl acetate, benzene and 1-heptene were detected in these packaged loins beginning at 7 to 14 days of storage. with the exception of 1-hexene, these compounds were not consistently detected in loins stored in vacuum, in 100% co(2), or in 40% co(2)/60% n(2), and these packaged loins developed much less off-odor during storage than loins packaged and stored in 20% co(2)/80% o(2). a large number of volatile compounds from the headspace of the packaged loins originated from the packaging material. lactobacillus plantarum became the dominant flora on loins stored under vacuum and under 40% co(2)/60% n(2) while leuconostoc mesenteroides  subsp. mesenteroides predominated in loins stored in 100% co(2). pseudomonas putida eventually dominated on loins stored in 20% co(2)/80% o(2).
