TI  == competition for glucose between candida albicans and oral bacteria grown in mixed culture in a chemostat.
AB  == the competition for glucose as a growth-limiting substrate between candida albicans and a mixed community of oral bacteria was investigated. a chemostat was operated under glucose-limiting and glucose excess conditions at a dilution rate  of 0.05/h. a mixed population of oral bacteria was established and after a steady state had been reached the chemostat was inoculated with c. albicans. seven bacterial species streptococcus sanguis, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, lactobacillus casei, veillonella dispar, eubacterium saburreum and fusobacterium nucleatum - were able to establish stable populations under glucose-limiting conditions. the  yeast was unable to grow with the bacteria under glucose limitation. only three bacterial species, s. sobrinus, l. casei and e. saburreum, became established under glucose-excess conditions. c. albicans was also able to become established  in the glucose-excess chemostat and could grow and maintain a steady state in a mixed culture with these organisms. l. casei, s. mitis and s. sobrinus had faster glucose consumption rates than c. albicans. all the bacteria, except for e nucleatum, had maximum specific growth rates higher than c. albicans. the results suggest that glucose may act as a growth-limiting substrate for c. albicans in the establishment and growth of the yeast in a mixed community of oral bacteria.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == the establishment of a community of oral bacteria that controls the growth of candida albicans in a chemostat.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to establish and identify a community of oral bacteria that controls the growth of candida albicans in the chemostat. the chemostat was operated under glucose-limiting conditions at a dilution rate of 0.05 h-1 and inoculated with a yeast-free suspension of a tongue scraping. after  a steady state had been reached, it was inoculated with c. albicans to establish  the yeast and determine whether its growth could be contained. the steady-state community comprised the species streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, lactobacillus casei, eubacterium saburreum, veillonella dispar and fusobacterium nucleatum. bacteroides gracilus and haemophilus segnis were also detected but infrequently. yeast growth was suppressed and yeast cells  were lost at the same rate as the theoretical washout rate. it is concluded that  this mixed community of oral bacteria can be used to identify the parameters that maintain the equilibrium between oral bacteria and c. albicans in the oral cavity.

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

TI  == sugar, fluoride, ph and microbial homeostasis in dental plaque.
AB  == factors that may contribute to the maintenance or breakdown of the oral microflora have been studied in the laboratory using a mixed culture chemostat system. carbohydrate type had relatively little influence of the proportions of individual species at neutral ph. in contrast, when the ph was allowed to fall following carbohydrate metabolism, the stability of the microflora was markedly perturbed. the proportions of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and veillonella dispar increased and they became the predominant species, while levels of other gram-negative organisms and s. gordonii declined. low levels (1 mmol/l) of sodium fluoride (naf) had little effect on the microflora at neutral ph. however, when the ph fell following carbohydrate metabolism, 1 mmol/l of naf  slowed acid production and, in so doing, reduced the inhibition of acid-sensitive species, and suppressed the selection of s. mutans under otherwise favourable conditions. these data (and others) suggest that the mode of action of fluoride in human beings might include a subtle but clinically significant antimicrobial effect. these findings have also led to the proposal of a modified hypothesis (the "ecological plaque hypothesis") to explain the role of the resident oral microflora in dental disease. the hypothesis also has implications for treatment  and prevention strategies.
