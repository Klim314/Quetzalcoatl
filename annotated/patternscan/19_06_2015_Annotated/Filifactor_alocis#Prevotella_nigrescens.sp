TI  == an investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  == different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the  pulp chambers (pcs) and root canals (rcs) of infected primary teeth using pcr methods. paired pc and rc samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii. the frequency of each species was  determined in the pc and rc of each case. the species most frequently detected in pcs were p. nigrescens (86.7%), p. gingivalis (73.3%), and f. alocis (73.3%). of  the pc samples, 13.3% contained p. micra and t. denticola, and 6.7% contained t.  forsythia. the species most frequently detected in rcs were p. gingivalis (100%)  and p. nigrescens (93.3%). p. tannerae, p. micra, and t. denticola were found in  40% of the rc samples; t. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the rc samples. the "red complex", which comprises p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, was not found in the pc of any tooth but was found in 30% of the rc samples. the detection of p. nigrescens in the pc was statistically associated with the presence of p. nigrescens in the rc (p = 0.04). the results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.

TI  == clustering behavior in microbial communities from acute endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: acute endodontic infections harbor heterogeneous microbial communities in both the root canal (rc) system and apical tissues. data comparing the microbial structure and diversity in endodontic infections in related ecosystems, such as rc with necrotic pulp and acute apical abscess (aaa), are scarce in the literature. the aim of this study was to examine the presence of selected endodontic pathogens in paired samples from necrotic rc and aaa using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) followed by the construction of cluster profiles. methods: paired samples of rc and aaa exudates were collected from 20 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of selected strict and facultative anaerobic strains. the frequency of species was compared between the rc and the aaa samples. a stringent neighboring clustering algorithm was applied to investigate  the existence of similar high-order groups of samples. a dendrogram was constructed to show the arrangement of the sample groups produced by the hierarchical clustering. results: all samples harbored bacterial dna. porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella nigrescens, filifactor alocis, and tannerela forsythia were frequently detected in both rc and aaa samples. the selected anaerobic species were distributed in diverse small bacteria consortia.  the samples of rc and aaa that presented at least one of the targeted microorganisms were grouped in small clusters. conclusions: anaerobic species were frequently detected in acute endodontic infections and heterogeneous microbial communities with low clustering behavior were observed in paired samples of rc and aaa.

TI  == antigenic activity of bacterial endodontic contents from primary root canal infection with periapical lesions against macrophage in the release of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha.
AB  == introduction: periradicular tissue chronic stimulation by endotoxin may cause apical periodontitis. this study investigated the microbial profile and the levels of endotoxin found in primary root canal infection with apical periodontitis, determined their antigenicity against macrophages through the levels of interleukin (il)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and evaluated their relationship with clinical and radiographic findings. methods: samples were taken from 21 root canals with primary endodontic infection and apical periodontitis with paper points. pcr technique (16s rdna) was used for the detection of the target bacteria. limulus amebocyte lysate (lal) was used to measure endotoxin. the amounts of il-1ss/ tnf-alpha in macrophages supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay--duoset-kit (elisa). results:  prevotella nigrescens (13/21), porphyromonas endodontalis (6/21), and treponema socranskii (6/21) were the most frequently detected gram-negative bacterial species. the presence of the sinus tract (2/21) was related to the detection of filifactor alocis (p < 0.05), whereas a tooth with a radiolucent area > or = 2 mm was related to the detection of treponema denticola. a correlation was found between the number of gram-negative bacteria and the levels of il-1beta/tnf-alpha (p < 0.05). increased levels of endotoxin were followed by tnf-alpha release (p < 0.05). higher levels of il-1beta (p < 0.05) and endotoxin contents were related to the larger size of the radiolucent area. conclusion: the antigenicity of the endodontic contents is not only related to the amount of endotoxin found in the root canal but also to the number of different species of gram-negative bacteria  involved in the infection. moreover, a larger size (> or = 2 mm) of the radiolucent area was related to il-1beta and endotoxin.

TI  == a microbiological study in relation to the presence of caries and calculus.
AB  == objective: to examine whether oral microflora in individuals with caries differs  from that of individuals with calculus in thai adolescents with poor oral hygiene. material and methods: one hundred 13-year-old schoolchildren from southern thailand were examined for the presence of caries, calculus and plaque and saliva ph was also determined. saliva samples were analysed by culture and approximal supragingival plaque samples were analysed with the dna-dna hybridization method ('checkerboard'). results: among the 100 children, mean dmfs was 3.43 [standard deviation (sd) 2.82] and 90% had calculus. the correlation between dmfs and the calculus index was 0.064. a total of 36 children were caries-free and 56 had calculus including teeth other than those in the lower anterior region (calculus score > or =3). a total of 23 caries-free children with a high calculus score (> or =3) were compared with 22 children with the highest dmfs [mean 11.19 (sd 5.58)] and a calculus score < 3. no significant difference was obtained for saliva and plaque ph. the salivary levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were low. significantly more children in the caries group had high levels of glycolytic prevotella nigrescens and filifactor alocis in plaque compared with the calculus group. calculus cases had a significantly higher total viable count in saliva. conclusions: there was no inverse correlation between the presence of caries and calculus at a population level and a high calculus score only marginally reduced the individual likelihood of having caries. several glycolytic bacteria were related to caries, while no specific bacteria could be related to calculus formation. calculus seemed to be more closely related to poor oral hygiene.

TI  == microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. dna was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. a pcr assay using species-specific primers of 16s  rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. moreover, pcr detected filifactor alocis in 26.7%, treponema denticola in 24.4%, and tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. t. denticola and p. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). p. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). p. endodontalis and p. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. the results of this study indicated that e. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by pcr in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == selected endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals: a molecular investigation.
AB  == bacteria located at the apical portion of the root canals are conceivably in a strategic position to induce damage to the periradicular tissues and resulting inflammatory diseases. this study sought to investigate the prevalence of 11 selected putative endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals associated with periradicular lesions. the apical root portion of 23 extracted teeth with carious pulpal exposures and attached periradicular lesions  was sectioned, and the root canals were sampled for microbiological investigation. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed for the presence of 11 bacterial species using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. the results showed that pseuramibacter alactolyticus occurred in 10 cases (44%), treponema denticola in 6 (26%), fusobacterium nucleatum in 6 (26%), porphyromonas endodontalis in 4 (17%), filifactor alocis in 2 (9%), dialister pneumosintes in 1 (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis in 1 (4%), and tannerella forsythensis in 1 (4%).  no sample yielded prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, or campylobacter  rectus. of the samples examined, 17 were positive for at least 1 of the target species. occurrence of these bacterial species in the apical third of infected root canals suggests that they can be involved in causation of periradicular lesions.
