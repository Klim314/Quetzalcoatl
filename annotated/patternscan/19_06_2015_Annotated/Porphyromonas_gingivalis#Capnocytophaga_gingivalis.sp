TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of subgingival microbiota in distinct periodontal conditions.
AB  == subgingival microorganisms are potentially associated with periodontal diseases.  however, changes in the subgingival microbiota during the progress of periodontal diseases are poorly understood. in this study, we analyzed bacterial communities  in the subgingival paper point samples from 32 korean individuals with no sign of disease, gingivitis, or periodontitis using 454 flx titanium pyrosequencing. a total of 256,113 reads representing 26 phyla, 433 genera, and 1,016 species were  detected. bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, synergistetes, and spirochaetes were the abundant phyla in periodontitis subjects, whereas firmicutes and proteobacteria were identified as the dominant phyla in the gingivitis and healthy subjects, respectively. although high levels of porphyromonas, fusobacterium, fretibacterium, rothia, filifactor, and treponema genera were observed in the periodontitis subjects, streptococcus, capnocytophaga, leptotrichia, and haemophilus genera were found at high frequency in the gingivitis subjects. species including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and fretibacterium fastidiosum were significantly increased in periodontitis subjects. on the other hand, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and leptotrichia hongkongensis were preferentially observed in the gingivitis subjects. intriguingly, the halophile halomonas hamiltonii was revealed as a predominant species in the healthy subjects. based on fast unifrac  analysis, distinctive bacterial clusters were classified for the healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis state. the current findings might be useful for understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of periodontitis by curcumin.
AB  == aims and objectives: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of locally delivered 1% curcumin gel as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. materials  and methods: the study group consisted of 25 patients, belonging to both sex, aged between 21-45 years. all patients diagnosed as chronic periodontitis with periodontal pockets of depth >5mm bilaterally were randomly selected. a split mouth design was followed and the patients received a complete prophylaxis including scaling and root planing. examination of plaque index, bleeding index,  probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level were measured for each patient. the test group received 1% curcumin gel along with scaling and root planing whereas the control group received scaling and root planing alone followed by microbiological samples taken at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months interval. results: the 1% curcumin gel appeared to provide significant improvements in clinical parameters. microbiological counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga showed significant reduction in periopathogens at the test sites after six months when compared with that of control sites. conclusion: locally delivered 1% curcumin gel was more effective in inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria when used as an adjunct to srp in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.

TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == phototargeting human periodontal pathogens in vivo.
AB  == the effects of blue light at 455 nm were investigated on the bacterial composition of human dental plaque in vivo. eleven subjects who refrained from brushing for 3 days before and during phototherapy participated in the study. light with a power density of 70 mw/cm(2) was applied to the buccal surfaces of premolar and molar teeth on one side of the mouth twice daily for 2 min over a period of 4 days. dental plaque was harvested at baseline and again at the end of 4 days from eight posterior teeth on both the exposed side and unexposed sides of the mouth. microbiological changes were monitored by checkerboard dna probe analysis of 40 periodontal bacteria. the proportions of black-pigmented species porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were significantly reduced on  the exposed side from their original proportions by 25 and 56 %, respectively, while no change was observed to the unexposed side. five other species showed the greatest proportional reduction of the light-exposed side relative to the unexposed side. these species were streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ss. vincentii, fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum, and capnocytophaga sputigena. at the same time, the percentage of  gingival areas scored as being red decreased on the side exposed to light from 48 to 42 %, whereas the percentage scored as red increased on the unexposed side from 53 to 56 %. no adverse effects were found or reported in this study. the present study proposes a new method to modify the ecosystem in dental plaque by phototherapy and introduces a new avenue of prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.

TI  == smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. this study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. materials and methods: this case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (il)-1ss, il-10, prostaglandin e2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum igg antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, prevotella loescheii, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga ochracea). results: the patients were stratified into  health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only il-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. as might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. il-1ss and antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. conclusions: generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.

TI  == efficacy of a new mouth rinse formulation based on 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride in the control of plaque and gingivitis: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == aim: to assess the efficacy of a 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) mouth rinse in the control of plaque and gingival inflammation during a 6-month period. material and methods: adult subjects with moderate gingivitis were selected [>/=40% bleeding on marginal probing (bomp)]. after retrieving microbiological samples and evaluating the clinical parameters (plaque, bomp and stain indexes),  a professional prophylaxis was performed and subjects were randomly assigned to the test (cpc mouth rinse) or to the placebo group. subjects were re-assessed after 3 and 6 months. results: a total of 67 patients (35 test, 32 placebo) were  included in the analysis. at 6 months, intra-group significant plaque reductions  were observed in the test group (0.691, p < 0.001), but not in the placebo (0.181, p = 0.653). at 6 months, the mean bomp values were lower in the test group (p = 0.052). changes between baseline and 6 months were significantly higher in the test group both for plaque (p = 0.002) and bomp (p = 0.037) when compared with the placebo. a microbiological impact was observed in the test group, especially for prevotella intermedia. conclusion: the evaluated 0.07% cpc-based mouth rinse, used three times per day adjunctively to mechanical tooth  cleaning, prevents plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation, as compared to  the placebo, for at least 6 months.

TI  == the association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in brazilian adults with hiv: a multilevel analysis.
AB  == background: this study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load (hvl) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with hiv. methods: thirty-seven individuals with hiv were divided into two groups: 1) detectable hvl (n = 15); and 2) undetectable hvl (n = 22). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, fisher exact test, and mann-whitney u test were used to compare groups. multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between hvl and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. results: of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable hvl group than undetectable hvl group (p <0.001). these species included actinomyces naeslundii  ii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and candida  albicans. significant associations between detectable hvl and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for a. naeslundii i, actinomyces gerencseriae, c. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythia, and dialister pneumosintes. conclusion: detectable plasmatic hvl in individuals with hiv was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as p. nigrescens, t. forsythia, and e. corrodens, as well as c. concisus, c. gingivalis, and d. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == discrimination based on gly and arg/ser at position 673 between dipeptidyl-peptidase (dpp) 7 and dpp11, widely distributed dpps in pathogenic and environmental gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, an asaccharolytic gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium, expresses the novel asp/glu-specific dipeptidyl-peptidase (dpp) 11 (ohara-nemoto, y. et al. (2011) j. biol. chem. 286, 38115-38127), which has been categorized as  a member of the s46/dpp7 family that is preferential for hydrophobic residues at  the p1 position. from that finding, 129 gene products constituting five clusters  from the phylum bacteroidetes have been newly annotated to either dpp7 or dpp11,  whereas the remaining 135 members, mainly from the largest phylum proteobacteria, have yet to be assigned. in this study, the substrate specificities of the five clusters and an unassigned group were determined with recombinant dpps from typical species, i.e., p. gingivalis, capnocytophaga gingivalis, flavobacterium psychrophilum, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, and shewanella putrefaciens. consequently, clusters 1, 3, and 5 were found to be dpp7 with rather broad substrate specificity, and clusters 2 and 4 were dpp11. an unassigned s. putrefaciens dpp carrying ser(673) exhibited asp/glu-specificity more preferable to glu, in contrast to the asp preference of dpp11 with arg(673)  from bacteroidetes species. mutagenesis experiments revealed that arg(673)/ser(673) were indispensable for the asp/glu-specificity of dpp11, and that the broad specificity of dpp7 was mediated by gly(673). taken together with  the distribution of the two genes, all 264 members of the s46 family could be attributed to either dpp7 or dpp11 by an amino acid at position 673. a more compelling phylogenic tree based on the conserved c-terminal region suggested two gene duplication events in the phylum bacteroidetes, one causing the development  of dpp7 and dpp11 with altered substrate specificities, and the other producing an additional dpp7 in the genus bacteroides.

TI  == association between periodontal status and pre-term and/or low-birth weight in spain: clinical and microbiological parameters.
AB  == background and objective: studies performed over the last 15 years have suggested that periodontal diseases may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. however, this association has not been found in all populations. the aim of this  study was to evaluate whether periodontal status and the presence of specific periodontal pathogens may influence the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes.  material and methods: pregnant women were clinically examined before 26th week of gestation, and divided in two groups: non-periodontitis and periodontitis. microbial samples were obtained in the periodontitis group and processed by anaerobic culturing. after delivery, data on the pregnancy outcome were taken; mother's socio-demographic and risk factors were obtained at inclusion. simple and multiple regression analysis were performed. results: one hundred and seventy women were included in the study (116 non-periodontitis and 54 with periodontitis). the incidence of preterm (ptb) and low-birth weight (lbw) was 2.94% and 3.53%, respectively. periodontal status did not show any association with adverse pregnancy outcomes. the presence of eikenella corrodens was significantly related to ptb (p = 0.022) and the presence capnocytophaga spp. was related to lbw (p = 0.008). the multivariate analyses showed a significant association between ptb and newborn weight and counts of e. corrodens. maternal health and counts of e. corrodens were significantly associated with ptb or lbw.  conclusion: the clinical periodontal condition was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in a spanish caucasian population with medium-high educational level. the presence and counts of e. corrodens and the presence of capnocytophaga spp. showed a significant association with ptb and lbw, respectively, in the bivariate and/or multivariate model.

TI  == a microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. methods: samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, tannerella forsythia, enterococcus faecalis, neisseria  mucosa, campylobacter gracilis, and prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp  space cases they were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, n. mucosa, e. faecalis, e. saburreum, c. gracilis, and porphyromonas gingivalis. counts of f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, campylobacter sputigena, capnocytophaga showae, treponema socrenskii,  porphyromonas endodontalis, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (p < .05). conclusions: the data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and  an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp  space cases.

TI  == probiotic effects of orally administered lactobacillus reuteri-containing tablets on the subgingival and salivary microbiota in patients with gingivitis. a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of an orally administered probiotic on the  oral microbiota. methods: a placebo-controlled, parallel study was conducted in 40 gingivitis subjects during 8 weeks. treatment consisted on the administration  of a daily tablet, either containing lactobacillus reuteri or placebo. unstimulated saliva and subgingival samples were collected and analysed by culture and pcr. clinical and microbiological outcome variables were compared between and within groups. results: there were no significant changes between and within the groups in the clinical variables. in saliva, total anaerobic counts after 4 weeks (p = 0.021) and counts of prevotella intermedia after 8 weeks (p =  0.030), showed reductions in the test group. in subgingival samples, significant  reductions in the changes baseline to 4 weeks were observed for p. gingivalis counts (p = 0.008). with pcr, l. reuteri atcc-pta-5289 was more frequently detected than l. reuteri dsm-17938. conclusions: the effect of l. reuteri administered in tablets resulted in a reduction in the number of selected periodontal pathogens in the subgingival microbiota, without an associated clinical impact.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == oral microbiota in swiss adolescents.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a swiss adolescent population. materials and methods: ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. plaque index, bleeding on probing (bop), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (dmft) index were recorded. samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. additionally, counts of streptococus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined by real-time pcr. results: periodontitis was  not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival  inflammation displaying a mean bop of 28%. ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for p. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia, (47.5%) for t. denticola. t. denticola and s. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas t. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. dmft was associated with s. mutans counts, and bop correlated with counts of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusions: the present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in swiss adolescents with gingivitis. clinical relevance: although gingivitis was a frequent finding in swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. the dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == evaluation of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals. methods: the study was conducted with 49 alcoholic and 49 non-alcoholic males of the philippe  pinel institute, rio de janeiro, brazil. the subjects were selected by convenience and two criteria were used to diagnose alcohol dependence: the cage (cut-down, annoyed, guilt, eyes-opener) questionnaire and the international statistical classification of diseases, 10th edition (who). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 4 sites, 2 with probing depth (pd) >/= 4 mm and 2 sites with pd < 4 mm. the presence and levels of 45 bacterial taxa were analysed  using the checkerboard technique. results: the prevalence of bacterial species was not significantly different between groups. however, alcoholics showed significantly higher mean counts of aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis (adjusted p < 0.001). moreover, alcoholics harboured significantly higher mean levels of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, f. nuc. nucleatum, gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, p. gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii, and tannerella forsythia at sites with pd < 4 mm or >/= 4 mm compared to non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). of interest, shallow sites of alcoholics presented  significantly higher mean levels of f. nuc. vincentii, f. nuc nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia than sites with pd >/= 4 mm of non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). conclusions: alcoholics and non-alcoholics present a diverse and complex  microbiota; however, alcoholics harbour significantly higher levels of periodontopathic species in the subgingival microbiota than non-alcoholics.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == killing of anaerobic pathogens by predatory bacteria.
AB  == recently, the predation of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on a periodontal pathogen has been described. the current study explores the potential antimicrobial activity of a range of predatory bacteria against key periodontal pathogens. a number of representatives from the bdellovibrio, bacteriovorax and peredibacter lineages (called 'balos') were tested for their activity towards a group of key periodontal pathogens and an optimal multiplicity of infection was established. as the oral cavity contains a wide variety of bacteria that are not preyed upon,  it was investigated if they can have an effect on the predation efficiency of balos. it was concluded that a number of important variables involved in bacterial predation are found to be compatible with the composition of the oral microbiota. this finding makes the case for continued study of the potential for  balos to combat periodontal pathogens.

TI  == il6 -174 genotype associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in indians.
AB  == aim: genetic factors have recently been associated with presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans subgingivally in populations living in industrialized countries. the aim of this study was to analyse associations between interleukin-6 (il6) single nucleotide polymorphisms and presence and levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans and other subgingival microbes in a rural indian population. subjects and methods: a total of 251 individuals from a rural  village in india with a periodontal phenotype ranging from healthy to severe periodontitis were included. checkerboard dna-dna analysis was performed to detect 40 periodontal taxa in subgingival plaque samples. genomic dna was extracted to genotype five polymorphisms in the il6 promoter region. results: the il6-74 gg genotype was associated with high (above median) counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans (both in all subjects and in periodontally healthy only) and with presence and counts of capnocytophaga sputigena. differences in detection of several other bacteria were noted between periodontitis and healthy  subjects. conclusions: these findings support the influence of genetic factors on the subgingival microbiota.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == changes in the incidence of periodontal pathogens during long-term monitoring and after application of antibacterial drugs.
AB  == the incidence of potential periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, formerly actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella  forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga ochracea) was monitored in patients with chronic periodontitis and in healthy control subjects. two types of studies were carried out in which the composition of the bacterial communities in different niches of the same oral cavity ecosystem was investigated. fluctuation or at least pronounced quantitative changes in the incidence of individual species in time were documented in the long-term study as well as after the local administration of antibacterial drug chlo-site or metronidazole. even within two weeks, a turnover  of the monitored bacteria in separate niches of the oral biotope can be detected. a relatively high incidence of the tested periopathogens in the clinically healthy teeth of patients implies that even the "healthy" niches in the periodontal biotope function as a dynamic reservoir of periopathogenic microorganisms. this should be kept in mind when a local application of antibacterial compounds is used in the therapy of periodontal disease.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == comparison between polymerase chain reaction-based and checkerboard dna hybridization techniques for microbial assessment of subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == aim: to compare polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization (micro-ident test) and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for the identification of 13 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were taken using paper points and curettes from two sites each with pocket depth <4, 4-6 and >6 mm at baseline and  3 months in 25 periodontitis subjects and two sites in 25 periodontally healthy subjects. samples were analysed for their content of 13 bacterial species using both assays. similarities for each species between techniques were determined using regression analysis. differences between health and periodontitis were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: three hundred and fifty samples  were evaluated using both techniques. regression analysis indicated that 10/13 test species showed significant positive correlations between the counts determined by checkerboard analysis and levels determined by the pcr-based test after adjusting for 13 comparisons. the highest rank correlations of 0.58, 0.49 and 0.46 were seen for treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum and eubacterium nodatum, respectively (p<0.0001). both tests could distinguish samples from healthy and periodontitis subjects. conclusion: detection patterns of 10/13 test species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis and healthy subjects were similar using the two molecular techniques.

TI  == are putative periodontal pathogens reliable diagnostic markers?
AB  == periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. a number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease and are used as diagnostic markers. in the present study, we compared the prevalence of oral bacterial species in the subgingival biofilm of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gap) (n = 44) and chronic periodontitis (cp) (n = 46) patients with that of a periodontitis-resistant control group (pr) (n = 21). the control group consisted of subjects at least 65 years of age with only minimal or no periodontitis and no history of periodontal treatment. a total of 555 samples from 111 subjects were included in this study. the samples were analyzed by pcr of 16s rrna gene fragments and subsequent dot blot hybridization using oligonucleotide probes specific for aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, a treponema denticola-like phylogroup (treponema phylogroup ii), treponema lecithinolyticum, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium spp., and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as capnocytophaga ochracea. our data confirm a high prevalence of the putative periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia in the periodontitis groups. however, these species  were also frequently detected in the pr group. for most of the species tested, the prevalence was more associated with increased probing depth than with the subject group. t. lecithinolyticum was the only periodontopathogenic species showing significant differences both between gap and cp patients and between gap  patients and pr subjects. c. ochracea was associated with the pr subjects, regardless of the probing depth. these results indicate that t. lecithinolyticum  may be a diagnostic marker for gap and c. ochracea for periodontal health. they also suggest that current presumptions of the association of specific bacteria with periodontal health and disease require further evaluation.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients on periodontal maintenance: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  == recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested the potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, currently, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of the adjunctive use of pdt in non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients receiving supportive periodontal therapy. twenty-four patients receiving regularly supportive periodontal therapy  were randomly treated with either subgingival scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or subgingival scaling and root planing alone (control). the following parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy: full mouth plaque score (fmps), full mouth bleeding score (fmbs), bleeding on probing (bop) at experimental sites, probing pocket depth (ppd), gingival recession (rec), and clinical attachment level (cal). primary outcome variables were changes in ppd and cal. microbiological evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), tannerella forsythensis (t.f.), treponema denticola (t.d.), peptostreptococcus micros (p.m.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), campylobacter rectus (c.r.), eubacterium nodatum (e.n.), eikenella corrodens (e.c.), and capnocytophaga species (c.s.) was also performed at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy, using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. no differences in any of the investigated parameters were observed at baseline between the two groups. at 3 months and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of ppd, cal and fmps. at 3 months and 6 months, a statistically significantly higher improvement of bop was found in the test group. at 3 months  after therapy, the microbiological analysis showed a statistically significant reduction of f.n. and e.n. in the test group. at 6 months, statistically significantly higher numbers of e.c. and c.s. were detected in the test group. the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of ppd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in significantly higher reduction of bleeding scores than following scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == bacterial species in subgingival plaque and oral bone loss in postmenopausal women.
AB  == background: oral bacteria are widely recognized in the etiology of periodontal disease. we investigated the prevalence of subgingival bacterial infection with eight species, tested associations between infection and oral bone loss, and assessed potential confounding factors and effect modifiers of those associations in a large community-based cohort of postmenopausal women. methods: a cross-sectional study of oral health and osteoporosis in 1,256 postmenopausal women recruited from the buffalo, new york women's health initiative observational study was conducted. standardized dental radiographs were used to measure alveolar crestal height (ach). subgingival plaque samples were taken, and the presence of eight bacterial species was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy in each participant. results: the most prevalent infection was streptococcus sanguis (59.5%), followed by prevotella intermedia (43.4%), tannerella forsythensis (37.9%), capnocytophaga sp. (36.9%), eubacterium saburreum (32.7%), campylobacter rectus (17.4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (15.1%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (14.2%). infections with p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, p. intermedia, and c. rectus were associated with an increased likelihood of having oral bone loss as measured by ach, even after adjustment for age, smoking, and income. the body mass index (bmi) was a modifier of this association. overweight women with t. forsythensis infection were more likely to  have oral bone loss (or = 3.37; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 2.08 to 5.46) than  normal weight (or = 1.27; 95% ci: 0.82 to 1.98) or obese (or = 1.26, 95% ci: 0.72 to 2.20) women with t. forsythensis infection. conclusions: the prevalence of specific bacterial infections was determined for a large group of postmenopausal  women. those with infection were more likely to have oral bone loss. further studies should investigate potential modifying effects of bmi and/or inflammatory factors.

TI  == infection at titanium implants with or without a clinical diagnosis of inflammation.
AB  == objectives: to assess the microbiota at implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis, implant mucositis, or being clinically healthy. material and methods: clinical and microbiological data were collected from 213 subjects (mean age: 65.7+/-14) with 976 implants in function (mean: 10.8 years, sd+/-1.5). forty species were identified by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: implant mean % plaque score was 41.8+/-32.4%. periodontitis defined by bone loss was found in 44.9% of subjects. implant mucositis was diagnosed in 59% and peri-implantitis in 14.9% of all cases. neisseria mucosa, fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, f. nucleatum sp. polymorphum, and capnocytophaga sputigena dominated the implant sub-mucosal microbiota and the sub-gingival microbiota at tooth sites. implant probing pocket depth at the implant site with the deepest probing depth was correlated with levels of eikenella corrodens (r=0.16, p<0.05), the levels of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (r=0.15, p<0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (r=0.14, p<0.05), and micromonas micros (r=0.17, p=0.01). e. corrodens was found in higher levels at implants with mucositis compared with implant health (p<0.05). subjects who lost teeth due to periodontitis had higher yields of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (p<0.02) and n. mucosa (p<0.05). independent of implant status subjects with teeth had higher levels of p. gingivalis (p<0.05), and leptotrichia buccalis (p<0.05). conclusions: at implant sites studied, few bacteria differed by whether subjects were dentate or not or by implant status.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrate and nitrite on six common oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == background: salivary nitrate is positively correlated with plasma nitrate and its level is 9 times the plasma level after nitrate loading. nitrate in saliva is known to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva are 3 - 5 times those in serum in physiological conditions respectively in our previous study. the biological functions of high salivary nitrate and nitrite are still not well understood. the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate  the antimicrobial effects of nitrate and nitrite on main oral pathogens under acidic conditions. methods: six common oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans nctc 10449, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646, porphyromonas gingivalis  atcc 33277, capnocytophaga gingivalis atcc 33624, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, and candida albicans atcc 10231 were cultured in liquid medium. sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to the medium to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/l. all of the microorganisms were incubated for 24 to 48 hours. the optical densities (od) of cell suspensions were determined and the cultures were transferred to solid nutrient broth medium to observe the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration for the six tested pathogens. results: nitrite at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mmol/l  had an inhibitory effect on all tested organisms at low ph values. the antimicrobial effect of nitrite increased with the acidity of the medium. streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 was highly sensitive to nitrite at low ph values. lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were relatively resistant to acidified nitrite. nitrate at the given concentrations and under acidic conditions had no inhibitory effect on the growth of any of the  tested pathogens. conclusion: nitrite, at a concentration equal to that in human  saliva, is both cytocidal and cytostatic to six principal oral pathogens in vitro, whereas nitrate at a similar concentration has no antimicrobial effect on  these organisms.

AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with  chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. method: subgingival  plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. the samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples = 21,832). mean counts, % dna probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. significance of difference between groups was determined using the mann-whitney test. association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of p. gingivalis plus t. forsythia  less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. all analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: for the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia as well as eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. there were significantly more capnocytophaga gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii and veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. e. nodatum, t. denticola, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher  counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions  of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. conclusions: this investigation confirmed the strong association of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of e. nodatum and t. denticola  with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. other species, including s. oralis, eikenella corrodens, s.  intermedius and f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were present in low proportions.

TI  == supragingival plaque may modify the effects of subgingival bacteria on attachment loss.
AB  == background: bacterial interactions in response to local and systemic factors may  explain important features of the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. this study evaluates the role of supragingival plaque level on the relationship between subgingival microorganisms and the risk of attachment loss. methods: the study population consisted of 386 white women aged 45 years and older who had at least  seven teeth. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesio-buccal surface  of six maxillary and six mandibular teeth using paper point technique. the samples were pooled, and immunofluorescence microscopy was performed to identify  the following target microorganisms: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythensis (tf), campylobacter rectus (cr), prevotella intermedia (pi), capnocytophaga species (cs), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), eubacterium saburreum (es), and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). the presence or absence of supragingival plaque and clinical attachment loss (cal) were assessed at the same 12 sites where subgingival plaque samples were taken. the association of each microorganism with cal was tested using multiple logistic regressions controlling for age, smoking status, and diabetes. odds ratios (or) and their 95% confidence  intervals (ci) were calculated. results: at low supragingival plaque levels, only the presence of pg was significantly associated with cal (or: 6.41, 95% ci: 1.30  to 31.70); all remaining microorganisms were also associated with increased but non-significant risk of cal. at high supragingival plaque levels, the presence of tf (or: 2.40, 95% ci: 1.42 to 4.04) and pg (or: 3.71, 95% ci: 1.63 to 8.42) was significantly associated with increased risk of attachment loss. by contrast, the presence of cs (or: 0.55, 95% ci: 0.30 to 1.01) and es (or: 0.35, 95% ci: 0.15 to 0.82) was associated with decreased risk of attachment loss. fn, pi, and cr were  not significantly associated with cal at either low or high supragingival plaque  levels. conclusions: this study suggests that the association of certain subgingival microorganisms with cal changes in relation to supragingival plaque levels in older adult women. it also suggests that the overall effect of dental plaque is a function of the balance between pathogenic and other microorganisms that colonize this environment. therefore, all microorganisms in the biofilm, including those with no apparent association with overt disease and those with negative associations, may play roles in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria in saliva samples from japanese children  and their mothers.
AB  == objective: we analyzed the distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola) in children, and then compared their distribution in those children and their mothers, with special attention given to three of the species  known as the red complex (p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, and t. denticola) whose presence has been shown to be associated with conditions related to periodontal diseases. methods: one hundred thirteen pairs of children and their mothers were  randomly selected from patients treated at the pedodontic clinic of osaka university dental hospital. saliva samples were taken at the second visit prior to receiving professional tooth brushing instruction. genomic dna was extracted from each saliva sample, followed by a polymerase chain reaction assay with species-specific sets of primers. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans was the most  frequently detected species in the mothers, followed by c. sputigena, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis, while c. sputigena had the highest detection rate, followed by a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola in the children. the  detection rate of the red complex species in children whose mothers possessed the same species was significantly higher than in those whose mothers did not possess them. conclusions: our results indicate a correlation between the presence of periodontal bacteria in children and their mothers, while the presence of red complex bacteria in children was highly associated with that in their mothers.

TI  == identification of candidate periodontal pathogens and beneficial species by quantitative 16s clonal analysis.
AB  == most studies of the bacterial etiology of periodontitis have used either culture-based or targeted dna approaches, and so it is likely that pathogens remain undiscovered. the purpose of this study was to use culture-independent, quantitative analysis of biofilms associated with chronic periodontitis and periodontal health to identify pathogens and beneficial species. samples from subjects with periodontitis and controls were analyzed using ribosomal 16s cloning and sequencing. several genera, many of them uncultivated, were associated with periodontitis, the most numerous of which were gram positive, including peptostreptococcus and filifactor. the genera megasphaera and desulfobulbus were elevated in periodontitis, and the levels of several species or phylotypes of campylobacter, selenomonas, deferribacteres, dialister, catonella, tannerella, streptococcus, atopobium, eubacterium, and treponema were  elevated in disease. streptococcus and veillonella spp. were found in high numbers in all samples and accounted for a significantly greater fraction of the  microbial community in healthy subjects than in those with periodontitis. the microbial profile of periodontal health also included the less-abundant genera campylobacter, abiotrophia, gemella, capnocytophaga, and neisseria. these newly identified candidates outnumbered porphyromonas gingivalis and other species previously implicated as periodontopathogens, and it is not clear if newly identified and more numerous species may play a more important role in pathogenesis. finally, more differences were found in the bacterial profile between subjects with periodontitis and healthy subjects than between deep and shallow sites within the same subject. this suggests that chronic periodontitis is the result of a global perturbation of the oral bacterial ecology rather than  a disease-site specific microbial shift.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a chilean population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == killing of periodontopathogenic bacteria by photodynamic therapy.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to evaluate a new approach for killing periodontopathogenic bacteria using photodynamic therapy (pdt). methods: in this  study, we investigated the photosensitizers chlorin e6, blc 1010, and blc 1014 by three different methods for their effect in pdt on the viability of periodontopathogenic bacterial species. the methods included examination of inhibition zones on agar plates, determination of colony-forming units (cfu), and the use of a bacterial viability kit. results: using the cfu method, we were able to demonstrate that the anaerobic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and capnocytophaga gingivalis can be photoinactivated completely by illumination with an intensity of 5.3 j/cm2 in the presence of 10 microm chlorin e6 and 10 microm blc 1010. with the photosensitizers chlorin e6 and blc 1010, we were able to induce zones of inhibition on agar plates. blc 1014 failed to produce a zone of inhibition. the results of the bacterial viability test also showed that the photosensitizer blc 1014 provides the lowest photodynamic effect in comparison to the others. conclusion: the data collected to date suggest that photodynamic therapy with chlorin e6 and blc 1010 is advantageous for suppressing periodontopathogenic bacteria.

TI  == rate of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == although microbiological studies have identified more than 400 bacterial species  in periodontal pockets, only a limited number have been implicated as periodontal pathogens. the purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis. bacterial samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets ((5 mm) of 203 patients: 92 males and 111 females, aged 35-55 years. the samples were cultured under anaerobic and capnophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and a commercial rapid test system. the isolates were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (26.8%), porphyromonas gingivalis (21.9%), capnocytophaga sputigena (16.7%), eikenella corrodens (13.2%), prevotella intermedia (10.5 %), prevotella disiens (3.1%), peptostreptococcus micros (2.9%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (2.2%), prevotella corporis (1.8%), peptostreptococcus magnus (1.3%) and fusobacterium nucleatum (0.4%). no periodontopathogenic bacterial growth was observed in 14 of the samples (6.2%). the number of samples associated with monobacterial growth and polybacterial growth were 74.9% and 18.2% respectively. it is concluded that the  bacterial composition associated with a number of patients' samples is quite complex, and that some of cultivable anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria act as periodontal pathogens in chronic periodontitis.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis subjects from different geographic locations.
AB  == background: most clinical studies assume that the subgingival microbiota is similar from one geographic location to another. the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the composition of the subgingival microbiota in chronic periodontitis subjects from four countries. method: subjects with chronic periodontitis (n, sweden=101; usa=115; brazil=58; chile=26) were recruited. subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bleeding on probing (bop), suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) at six sites per  tooth. subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples=6036). % dna probe counts comprised by each species was determined for each site and averaged across sites  in each subject. significance of differences in proportions of each species among countries was determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status. p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: on average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in the four countries. thirteen species differed significantly in adjusted mean proportions among countries even after adjusting for multiple comparisons. porphyromonas gingivalis, one species that differed in proportions among countries, comprised adjusted means of 7.5, 11.9, 1.6 and 6.6% of the microbiota  in subjects from brazil, chile, sweden and usa (p<0.001), while mean proportions  of treponema denticola were 6.7, 4.2, 0.8 and 2.3, respectively (p<0.001). in contrast, a key periodontal pathogen, tannerella forsythensis, exhibited mean proportions ranging from 6.2-8.5% and did not differ significantly among countries. besides these species, prominent species in brazil were actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 (8.4%, 7.2%) and prevotella intermedia (6.5%); in  chile, prevotella melaninogenica (6.4%) and neisseria mucosa (5.3%); in sweden a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (8.4%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (7.1%) and peptostreptococcus micros (5.0%); in usa a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (7.5%), p. intermedia (6.8%) and c. gingivalis (6.1%). conclusions: the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from chronic periodontitis subjects in four countries showed surprisingly marked differences. these differences persisted after adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal bacteria in healthy children: a 2-year longitudinal study.
AB  == objectives: to examine the occurrence of specific periodontal bacteria in children and adolescents. methods: ten putative periodontal bacteria were longitudinally examined in plaque and saliva samples from 119 periodontally healthy children (2-15 years old) using a polymerase chain reaction method. results: capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently found in saliva, and tended to persist in saliva for the remainder of the study, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia were rarely detected. p. nigrescens was more frequently detected in plaque and its prevalence increased with age. eikenella corrodens and campylobacter rectus were sometimes detected in both plaque and saliva, while tannerella forsythensis was occasionally detected in saliva. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, p. nigrescens, c. rectus, and e. corrodens are common members of the oral microbial  flora of healthy children, whereas p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola appear to be transient organisms.

TI  == gingival crevice microbiota from chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug). subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in eastern china. samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. the analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (fusobacterium nucleatum/fusobacterium periodonticum, leptotrichia buccalis, tannerella forsythensis, and capnocytophaga sp.), campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces gerencseriae were much more  prevalent in the nug group. quantitatively, most taxa, including p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. only p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, s. sputigena, a. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the nug group. the present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in nug-associated plaque are of  prime importance.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus salivarius with periodontopathogens: evidence for  involvement of fimbriae in the interaction with prevotella intermedia.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is divided into two serological subgroups that carry either fibrils or fimbriae. although fimbriae have been observed on up to 50% of  s. salivarius strains in the human oral cavity, no function has yet been assigned to them. to determine whether s. salivarius fimbriae have a role in adhesion, we  examined the ability of s. salivarius to coaggregate with selected microorganisms involved in periodontal diseases. our results show that s. salivarius coaggregated with fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. however, only fimbriated s. salivarius cells were able to  coaggregate with p. intermedia, suggesting a specific role for these structures in the interaction. heat treatment, sensitivity to sugars, amino acids, and edta, as well as protease treatment were also used to further characterize coaggregation between s. salivarius and periodontopathogens.

AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to evaluate microbiota and radiographic peri-implant bone loss associated with ligature-induced peri-implantitis. materials and methods: thirty-six dental implants with 4 different surfaces (9 commercially pure titanium, 9 titanium plasma-sprayed, 9 hydroxyapatite, and 9 acid-etched) were placed in the edentulous mandibles of 6 dogs. after 3 months with optimal plaque control, abutment connection was performed. on days 0, 20, 40, and 60 after placement of cotton ligatures, both microbiologic samples and periapical radiographs were obtained. the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, campylobacter spp, capnocytophaga spp, fusobacterium spp,  beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and candida spp were evaluated culturally. results: p intermedia/nigrescens was detected in 13.89% of implants at baseline and 100% of implants at other periods. p gingivalis was not detected at baseline, but after 20 and 40 days it was detected in 33.34% of implants and at 60 days it was  detected in 29.03% of dental implants. fusobacterium spp was detected in all periods. streptococci were detected in 16.67% of implants at baseline and in 83.34%, 72.22%, and 77.42% of implants at 20, 40, and 60 days, respectively. campylobacter spp and candida spp were detected in low proportions. the total viable count analysis showed no significant differences among surfaces (p = .831), although a significant difference was observed after ligature placement (p < .0014). however, there was no significant qualitative difference, in spite of the difference among the periods. the peri-implant bone loss was not significantly different between all the dental implant surfaces (p = .908). discussion and conclusions: these data suggest that with ligature-induced peri-implantitis, both time and periodontal pathogens affect all surfaces equally after 60 days.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.

AB  == epileptic patients taking phenytoin with gingival-overgrowth and those without gingival-overgrowth were compared for daily drug dose, plasma total phenytoin concentration, plasma free-phenytoin concentration and serum igg antibody titre against 13 periodontal bacteria. significantly higher daily drug dose was noted in patients with gingival overgrowth (p < 0.05) when compared with those without  overgrowth. in addition, both total and free forms of plasma phenytoin concentration were significantly higher in sera of patients with gingival growth  than of those without overgrowth (p < 0.01). strong positive correlation was found between daily drug dose and serum phenytoin concentration in patients with  gingival overgrowth, while weak correlation was found in patients without gingival overgrowth, suggesting a difference in drug metabolism in these two groups. however, no differences were found in serum igg antibody titres to 13 periodontal bacteria examined between two groups. these results suggest that metabolic ability of phenytoin is one of the factors for developing gingival overgrowth, and that periodontal infection may not be a primary causative factor  for gingival overgrowth but act as an additive factor which increase tissue mass  for this unwanted side effect.

AB  == periodontal disease is a complication of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (t1dm), although the mechanisms responsible for this relationship remain unclear. the aim of this study was to examine oral manifestations and the prevalence of periodontal pathogens from subgingival plaque samples and serum igg antibody levels against them in young japanese type 1 diabetic subjects. one hundred and seventeen japanese t1dm subjects (53 male, 64 female, mean age +/- sd, 16 +/- 6.5 years) participated in this study. thirty-nine periodontally healthy, age-matched nondiabetics served as controls. t1dm subjects were clinically assigned into three groups: 12 periodontitis, 32 gingivitis and 73 periodontally healthy. microbiological tests for four periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga ochracea were performed using 16s ribosomal rna-based polymerase chain reaction methods. serum igg antibody levels against 12 periodontal bacteria including the  four species assessed by polymerase chain reaction were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. in the t1dm subjects, the periodontitis group had a significantly longer mean duration of diabetes and a higher percentages of subjects harbouring p. gingivalis and p. intermedia than the periodontally healthy group. serum igg antibody levels against p. gingivalis were significantly elevated in the periodontitis group compared with gingivitis and periodontally healthy groups. these results indicate that japanese t1dm subjects are a high-risk group for periodontal disease and both p. gingivalis infection and duration of t1dm are risk factors for the progression of periodontitis in patients with t1dm.

TI  == stress and the periodontal diseases: effects of catecholamines on the growth of periodontal bacteria in vitro.
AB  == microorganisms possess the ability to recognize hormones within the host and utilize them to adapt to their surroundings. noradrenaline and adrenaline, which  are released during human stress responses, may act as environmental cues to alter the growth of individual organisms within subgingival biofilms. the aims of this study were to modify, for anaerobic culture, existing methodology used in determining microorganism catecholamine responses and to investigate the growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline of 43 microorganisms found within subgingival microbial complexes. we established initial inocula for each strain using anaerobic culture, re-inoculated into a minimal serum-based medium and grown anaerobically at 35 degrees c. we assessed organism growth by optical density (od(600nm)) readings, with test and control cultures performed in triplicate. test cultures were supplemented with 50 microm noradrenaline or 100 microm adrenaline. we observed significant growth effects for supplementation with noradrenaline (20 species responding positively) and adrenaline (27 species  responding positively), with differences in growth response observed within bacterial species and within and between microbial complexes. the most pronounced positive growth effects of noradrenaline were demonstrated in actinomyces naeslundii (+ 49.4%), actinomyces gerenscseriae (+ 57.2%), eikenella corrodens (+ 143.3%) and campylobacter gracilis (+ 79.9%). we also observed inhibitory effects of noradrenaline supplementation for porphyromonas gingivalis (- 11.9%) and bacteroides forsythus (- 22.2%). responses to adrenaline tended to mirror the responses seen with noradrenaline. individual organisms from different microbial  complexes vary in their in vitro growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline. such variation may influence the in vivo composition of the subgingival biofilm in response to stress-induced changes in local catecholamine  levels and play a significant role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of the periodontal diseases.

TI  == microbiological, immunological and genetic factors in family members with periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease, associated with hematological disorders.
AB  == the microflora, immunological profiles of host defence functions, and human leukocyte antigen (hla) findings are reported for a mother, son and daughter who  were diagnosed as having 'periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic diseases,  associated with hematological disorders'. examinations were made of the bacterial flora from the periodontal pocket, neutrophil chemotaxis, neutrophil phagocytosis, and the genotypes (dqb1) and serotypes (dr locus) of hla class ii antigens. phenotypic analyses of the peripheral lymphocytes were also conducted.  the subgingival microflora from the mother was dominated by gram-negative rods, especially porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum. subgingival microflora samples from the son and daughter were dominated by gram-positive cocci and gram-positive rods. through the use of polymerase chain reaction, campylobacter rectus and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in all subjects, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, p. intermedia, and treponema denticola were not detected in any subjects. all three subjects showed a remarkable level of depressed neutrophil chemotaxis to n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, although their phagocyte function levels were normal, in comparison to healthy control subjects. each subject had the same genotype, hla-dqb1*0601, while the mother had hla-dr2 and hla-dr8, and the son and daughter had hla-dr2 only. in summary, the members of this family showed a similar predisposition to periodontitis with regard to certain host defence functions. it is suggested that the depressed neutrophil chemotaxis that was identified here could be a significant risk factor for periodontitis in this family.

AB  == oral gram-negative bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga sputigena, provotella intermedius, provotella melaninogenicus, have been associated with destructive periodontal infection. an ultrasensitive antibacterial assay was applied to determine the sensitivity of a battery of oral gram-negative bacteria to the bactericidal effects of the isolated human neutrophil defensins (hnp) and two kinds of rabbit  defensins np1 and np2. all species tested were killed by hnp, np1 and np2 except  that porphyromonas gingivalis was resistant to hnp. however, there was strain-to-strain variation in sensitivity. it was concluded that the oral gram-negative bacteria were sensitive to the cidal mechanism involved in defensinmediated bacterial killing.

TI  == long-term follow-up of osseointegrated titanium implants using clinical, radiographic and microbiological parameters.
AB  == the aim of this study was to longitudinally follow up osseointegrated titanium implants in partially dentate patients by clinical, radiographic and microbiological parameters in order to evaluate possible changes in the peri-implant health over time. fifteen individuals treated with titanium implants, ad modum branemark, and followed for ten years were included in the study. before implant placement ten years previously, the individuals had been treated for advanced periodontal disease and thereafter been included in a maintenance care program. the survival rate of the implants after ten years was 94.7%. the bone loss was 1.7 mm when using the abutment-fixture junction as a reference point. of the individuals, 50% were positive for plaque at the implants. bleeding on sulcus probing was present at 61% of the implant surfaces.  ten years previously, the individuals had been carriers of putative periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and campylobacter rectus, and were also carriers of these species at the current examination. the results of the present study suggest that the presence of these putative periodontal pathogens at implants may not be associated with an impaired implant  treatment. these species are most likely part of the normal resident microbiota of most individuals and may therefore be found at random at both stable and progressing peri-implant sites.

TI  == periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

TI  == lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga ochracea are antagonists for human toll-like receptor 4.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlrs) 2 and 4 have recently been identified as possible signal transducers for various bacterial ligands. to investigate the roles of tlrs in the recognition of periodontopathic bacteria by the innate immune system, a chinese hamster ovary (cho) nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab)-dependent reporter cell line, 7.7, which is defective in both tlr2- and tlr4-dependent signaling pathways was transfected with human cd14 and tlrs. when the transfectants were exposed to freeze-dried periodontopathic bacteria, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, and fusobacterium nucleatum, and a non-oral bacterium, escherichia coli, all species of the bacteria induced nf-kappab-dependent cd25 expression in  7.7/hutlr2 cells. although freeze-dried a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and e. coli also induced cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells, freeze-dried p. gingivalis did not. similarly, lipopolysaccharides (lps) extracted from a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and e. coli induced cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells, but lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea did not. furthermore, lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea attenuated cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells induced by repurified lps from e. coli. lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea also inhibited the secretion of interleukin-6 (il-6) from u373 cells, the secretion of il-1beta from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and icam-1 expression in human gingival fibroblasts induced by repurified lps from e. coli. these findings indicated that lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea worked as antagonists for human tlr4. the antagonistic activity of lps from these periodontopathic bacteria may be associated with the etiology of periodontal diseases.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles in children with chronic neutropenia under supervised oral hygiene.
AB  == background: this is the first known case report that used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method to help identify the oral microflora in patients with chronic neutropenia. in this study, we report clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles of 2 children, 1 with severe congenital neutropenia (scn, kostmann type) and 1 with cyclic neutropenia (cn). methods: the scn patient had severe gingivitis, whereas the patient with cn had mild gingivitis in the gingival margins. monthly oral cleaning instruction and review were performed without subsequent periodontal therapy. oral hygiene conditions remained satisfactory and visible plaque was scarce, despite the persistence of mild gingivitis. under supervised oral hygiene, we examined the presence of periodontal pathogens from patient plaque samples. results: by a pcr-based method, prevotella nigrescens, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in the scn patient and p. intermedia, c.  rectus, c. gingivalis, and c. sputigena in the cn patient, suggesting the existence of periodontal pathogens. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and c. ochracea were not found in  either patient. conclusions: use of 1% povidone iodine solution and local antibiotic application under supervised oral hygiene were helpful to improve gingival conditions in patients with chronic neutropenia.

TI  == change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == microbiological characteristics of subgingival microbiota in adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis subjects.
AB  == objective: to describe the prevalence of the cultivable subgingival microbiota in periodontal diseases and to draw attention to the polymicrobial nature of periodontic infections. methods: the study population consisted of 95 patients, 51 females and 44 males, aged 14-62 years. twenty-nine patients exhibited adult periodontitis (ap), six localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), and 60 rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp). two to four pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets. the samples were cultured under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and by a commercial rapid test system. results: prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga spp. were the most frequently detected microorganisms in all diagnostic groups. porphyromonas gingivalis and peptostreptococcus micros were found more frequently in ap and rpp patients, while actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella  corrodens were associated with ap, ljp and rpp patients. the other bacterial species, including actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp. and eubacterium spp., were detected at different levels in the three disease groups. conclusions: the data show the complexity of the subgingival microbiota associated with different  periodontal disease groups, indicating that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens are different in teeth affected by different forms of periodontal disease.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in down's syndrome.
AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

TI  == comparison of microbial composition in the subgingival plaque of adult crowded versus non-crowded dental regions.
AB  == it has been reported in the literature that certain species of bacteria (periodontopathogens) present in the subgingival plaque are associated with destructive periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the presence and proportional distribution of periodontopathogens in the  subgingival plaque of adult crowded versus non-crowded dental regions. thirty adult patients with anterior dental crowding were selected from the orthodontic clinic of the university of pennsylvania. after orthodontic records were taken and the periodontal examination was performed, subgingival plaque samples were collected from crowded (experimental) and contralateral non-crowded regions (control) of each patient. the presence of 9 periodontopathic species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species, fusobacterium species, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus, was determined using culture and immunofluorescence techniques. the bacterial morphotype was also determined by the use of dark-field microscopy. it was found  that supragingival plaque accumulation in crowded regions was significantly greater than in non-crowded regions. analysis of the bacteria showed that the samples from crowded regions consistently contained more species of periodontopathogens than the samples from non-crowded regions. morphologically, more spirochetes and motile rods were present in the crowded-region samples. in terms of the presence of individual periodontopathogens, fusobacterium species, capnocytophaga species, c rectus, and p micros were significantly more common in  the crowded samples than in the non-crowded samples. it was concluded that: (1) more plaque accumulated in crowded areas; (2) more species of periodontopathogens were present in the subgingival plaque of crowded regions; (3) morphologically, more spirochetes and motile rods were present in crowded areas; and (4) fusobacterium species, capnocytophaga species, c rectus, and p micros were present more often in crowded areas than in non-crowded areas (p < 0.05).

TI  == [bacterial virulence in the etiology of periodontal diseases].
AB  == strong relationships have been very often described between various form of periodontal disease (pd) and certain bacterial species, so that nowadays periodontal disease is recognized as an infectious disease. destruction of periodontal supporting tissues happens as a response to very intricate host-parasite interactions. when the clinician will be able to fully understand and identify such phenomena it would be possible to succeed in a properly diagnosis and control of the active phase of periodontal disease. the first step  in such a direction would be to analyze the common characteristic of some bacterial species, the so called suspected periodontopathogens. such species namely gram-negative, associated with the outbreak of periodontal disease have in common the capacity to disrupt the integrity of the host defences by means of the so called virulence factors. these factors may enhance the bacterial colonization or may interfere with the host response that ultimately results in periodontal support breakdown. the present review focuses on the virulence factors of the main suspected periodontopathogens evaluating the effects on the host immune response and directly on the periodontal tissues.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == checkerboard assessments of serum antibodies to oral microbiota as surrogate markers of clinical periodontal status.
AB  == background: this study addresses whether checkerboard assessments of serum igg antibodies to oral bacteria may serve as surrogate markers of clinical periodontal status in epidemiologic studies. method: the analysis involved data from 205 subjects, 132 periodontitis patients and 73 periodontally-intact controls, from whom full-mouth clinical periodontal data and serum igg titers against 19 periodontal bacterial species were available. results: a logistic regression model involving titers against 6 species (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2) classified correctly 74.5% of the subjects examined, with 84% sensitivity, 57.5% specificity, 78% positive predictive value and 66.7% negative predictive value. conclusions: checkerboard serology may be useful in providing surrogate markers for clinical periodontal status when such data are not readily available and, thus may serve as a valuable complement in the armamentarium of epidemiologic tools suited for the study of periodontal diseases.

AB  == background, aims: polymorphisms in the cluster of il-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in il-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. method: the study included 108 subjects in good general health. clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment  level. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of  up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. fingerstick blood samples were collected for il-1a (+4845) and il-1b (+3954) genotyping using pcr-based methods. results: the proportion of  il-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola,  the fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, fusobacterium periodonticum, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter showae and streptococcus constellatus. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus gordonii and 3 capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. significantly higher mean counts of b. forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, the f. nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum, campylobacter rectus, c. showae, eubacterium nodatum, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius  were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. the increase was due to increased  numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. conclusion: the data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had  higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == the short-term effect of apically repositioned flap surgery on the composition of the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to examine the short-term effect of apically repositioned flap surgery on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with adult periodontitis. a total of 11 patients with moderate to advanced periodontitis received apically repositioned flap surgery. subjects were monitored during a 3-month pretreatment phase, the baseline surgical phase, and for 3 months post-surgery. clinical assessments including plaque accumulation, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment  level were made at 6 sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples were taken from  the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 29 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and percentage of sites colonized by each species  (prevalence) were computed for each subject at each visit. after surgery, there was a significant decrease in mean pocket depth and percentage of sites exhibiting gingival redness. significant decreases were seen in the percentage of sites that had attachment levels < 4 mm, with a significant increase in the percentage of sites with attachment levels of 4 to 6 mm after therapy. the mean total dna probe count for all bacterial species was significantly decreased by both scaling and root planing and surgical therapy. p gingivalis and b forsythus, 2 bacteria previously shown to be susceptible to mechanical therapy, exhibited statistically significant decreases in mean total dna probe count. because surgical therapy decreased levels of the suspected periodontal pathogens c rectus, p nigrescens, and c gracilis, it may be speculated that there was a potential added beneficial effect of surgery on the periodontal microbiota.

TI  == herpesviruses and periodontopathic bacteria in trisomy 21 periodontitis.
AB  == background: little is known about the etiology and pathogenesis of periodontal disease in trisomy 21 patients. this study determined the occurrence of herpesviruses and putative periodontopathic bacteria in trisomy 21 periodontitis. methods: nineteen trisomy 21 patients (17 to 37 years of age) contributed subgingival samples from molar and bicuspid teeth presenting interproximal periodontitis lesions (probing depths, 5 to 8 mm) and from shallow periodontal sites (probing depths, 1 to 3 mm). samples were obtained at baseline, and at 1 and 4 weeks after subgingival debridement by means of hand instruments and ultrasonic scalers. epstein-barr virus type 1 and 2 (ebv-1 and ebv-2), human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), and herpes simplex virus (hsv) were identified by sensitive and specific nested polymerase chain reaction. putative periodontopathic bacteria were identified by means of non-selective and selective culture. results: of 19 trisomy 21 periodontitis lesions, 6 (32%) were positive for ebv-1, 5 (26%) were positive for hcmv, 3 (16%) were positive for hsv, and 2 (11%) showed viral co-infection. of 19 shallow periodontal sites, only one revealed hcmv. prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, and capnocytophaga species were detected in higher proportions in deep than in shallow periodontal pockets (p = 0.02). subgingival debridement did not reduce genomic herpesvirus presence but caused a decrease in proportions of porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga species. conclusions: periodontal herpesvirus-bacteria coinfections may play important roles in the pathogenesis of destructive periodontal disease in trisomy 21 patients. herpesviruses may reduce the periodontal defense and promote growth of subgingival bacteria capable of causing periodontal breakdown.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria in children with down syndrome.
AB  == background: it is widely known that individuals with down syndrome (ds) often develop severe early-onset periodontal diseases. in this study, we examined the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in ds children to determine if specific pathogens are acquired in their childhood. methods: the subjects were 60 ds children (2 to 13 years old, 5 in each age bracket) and 60 age-matched controls.  ten pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, p nigrescens,  capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, campyrobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were surveyed in subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction. periodontal status was evaluated by probing depth, bleeding on probing, and gingival index. results: no significant difference in periodontal status was  observed between the ds and control groups, however, all of the pathogens were detected with greater frequency in the ds children. b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and c. rectus were significantly prevalent throughout all age brackets of the ds children (p <0.01 or 0.05). the occurrence of p. gingivalis was also significant in the ds subjects over 5 years old. a cluster analysis of the microbial profiles of the ds subjects showed that gingivitis severity was associated with increased varieties of the harboring pathogens and the distribution of p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that various periodontopathogens can colonize in the very early childhood of ds patients and maturation of subgingival components, including p. gingivalis, plays an important role in the initiation of gingival inflammation.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

TI  == flow cytometry to monitor phagocytosis and oxidative burst of anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == the reduced susceptibility to phagocytosis found among some periodontopathogenic  anaerobes may account for the differences between invasive and non-invasive strains. we applied flow cytometry as a powerful tool to analyze and quantify phagocytosis using standardized cultures of oral anaerobes (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros) and heparinized whole blood. bacteria were labeled by a fluorescein-methylester and their esterase activity, resulting in green fluorescence. ingested bacteria could be detected easily and quantified by a shift towards green fluorescence in  the pmnl population involved and a concomitant decrease in the bacterial population. furthermore, the oxidative burst of pmnls was detected in parallel assays using the dye dhr123 which becomes fluorescent upon oxidation during the oxidative burst process. we found a great diversity in phagocytosis susceptibility determined by estimating the portion of phagocytosing pmnls, ranging from 10.6% (strain w83) to > 99.4% (e.g. atcc 33277t) in p. gingivalis and from 15.9% (strain mh5) to > 95% (atcc 33563t) in p. nigrescens. in contrast, almost all p. intermedia strains as well as the representatives of the other anaerobic, putative periodontopathic species tested showed no or only moderate resistance in the phagocytosis assay. comparison of clinical data of patients and the extent of phagocytosis resistance of the corresponding p. gingivalis strains  suggests that this virulence factor may contribute to the clinical outcome.

TI  == changes of periodontal status in patients with down syndrome during a 7-year period.
AB  == the development of periodontal disease in down syndrome adolescents (n = 34) was  studied clinically and on intraoral radiographs during a 7-yr period. the occurrence of gingival inflammation (gbi), pathological periodontal pockets (>4 mm), sub- and supragingival calculus, alveolar bone height, alveolar bone loss, and the occurrence of the periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga, and porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque were determined. of the subjects, 41% had one or more pathological periodontal pockets at baseline compared to 65% at follow-up. at the baseline examination, 35% of the individuals exhibited alveolar bone loss compared to 74% at the follow-up. the median value of sites with alveolar bone loss increased from 0 to 1, the new lesions mainly being located in the incisor region. the estimated annual reduction of alveolar bone height in each subject was 0.04 mm on average. the occurrence of the periodontal pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga, and p. gingivalis in subgingival plaque did not differ between baseline and follow-up. the results of the present study indicate that the frequency of periodontitis, mainly located on the lower incisors, markedly increased during a 7-yr period in down syndrome individuals, although the severity and progression was limited compared to what has previously been described.

TI  == induction of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte antibodies in mice injected with lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == we examined the levels of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte autoantibody (ata) in the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from periodontopathic bacteria; porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, and non-oral escherichia coli. all of the lps induced igm-ata. among these, lps from  c. ochracea induced the highest level of igm-ata, whereas that of p. gingivalis induced the lowest. the peritoneal t lymphocytes of mice injected with lps were bound by igm-ata. peritoneal b-1 (cd5+b) cells stimulated by each lps produced much more igm-ata than splenic b-2 (cd5-b) cells, suggesting that b-1 cells might be responsible for the production of these antibodies. serum of mice injected with c. ochracea and f. nucleatum lps showed cytotoxicity against thymocytes in the presence of rabbit complements. binding and cytotoxicity were confirmed by igm purified from serum of the mice injected with c. ochracea lps. furthermore, serum of mice treated with c. ochracea, f. nucleatum or a. actinomycetemcomitans  lps inhibited the proliferation of thymocytes. however, purified igm from the serum of mice treated with c. ochracea lps failed to produce the same inhibition. our results suggest that lps from certain species of periodontopathic bacteria can induce igm-ata in the serum and these antibodies may modulate the local immune network in periodontal tissues.

TI  == microbiota of successful osseointegrated dental implants.
AB  == background: the long-term survival of dental implants depends, in part, on control of bacterial infection in the peri-implant region. periodontal pathogens  colonized implants symptomatic through infection, whereas the microbiota of successful implants was similar to that of periodontal health. this study examined the impact on the peri-implant microbiota of crown restorations; implant type; length of time of loading; history of implant or periodontal infections; and whether implants replaced single or multiple teeth. it was of particular interest to evaluate implant colonization by species in a newly described red complex of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus. methods: this study sampled 43 partially edentulous subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium root-form dental implants. eighty-one (81)  non-submerged and 20 submerged asymptomatic implants, 83 crowned, and 36 uncrowned teeth were sampled from peri-implant or subgingival sites. the microbiota of samples was evaluated using whole genomic dna probes in a checkerboard assay to 23 subgingival species. results: implants were colonized principally by oral streptococci, capnocytophagae, veillonella parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the periodontal species,  p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and campylobacter rectus were detected in a few subjects. the microbiota around crowned implants and crowned teeth was similar. streptococcus oralis, p. intermedia, and selenomonas noxia were elevated in samples from uncrowned teeth compared to crowned teeth and implants. microbial complexity increased as loading time increased, but colonization by periodontal pathogens, including red complex  species, was higher in subjects with previous periodontal disease. no differences were observed in the microbiota of 1- and 2-stage implants, or between implants supporting single or multiple restorations. conclusions: while presence of crowns had only a minor impact on the peri-implant microbiota, microbial changes were observed the longer the implants had been in function and in those patients with  a history of periodontal or peri-implant infections. a history of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant microbiota than implant loading time. the major influence on the peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on remaining teeth. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, red complex periodontal pathogens, colonized several implants, although all implants were successfully osseointegrated.

TI  == relationship of the subgingival microbiota to a chairside test for aspartate aminotransferase in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between  the occurrence of certain specific periodontal pathogens and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf). methods: thirty systemically healthy subjects with moderate to advanced periodontitis were selected. within each subject, the ast contents of gcf from sites with probing depth between 5 mm and 7 mm were measured using a chairside colorimetric test. ast-positive site refers to one that had an ast level > or = 800 microiu. subgingival plaque samples from one ast-positive and one negative site were collected for microbiological examination. one site with probing depth < or = 3 mm and no gingival inflammation was selected as a healthy control. clinical parameters of the chosen sites, including the plaque index and gingival index scores, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were measured. culture and immunofluorescence (if) were used for detecting common periodontal pathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, and porphyromonas gingivalis. logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between the ast test and certain specific pathogens. results: the gcf scores and  total cultivable bacterial counts were higher in ast-positive sites than either ast-negative or healthy sites. the prevalence and proportions of specific periodontal pathogens such as c rectus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, p. intermedia, and p. gingivalis were significantly higher in positive than in negative sites. in analyzing the correlation of the proportion of 6 pathogens with the ast test by logistic regression, only p. gingivalis showed a significant positive correlation. the odds ratio of having a  high proportion of p. gingivalis in the presence of a positive ast test was 1.21. conclusions: the present study showed that at ast-positive sites, there is a higher prevalence and higher proportion of certain periodontal pathogens. although only the correlation of p. gingivalis and ast values was statistically significant, the results imply that certain periodontal pathogens may be associated with elevation of ast levels in gcf.

TI  == microbiological features and crevicular fluid aspartate aminotransferase enzyme activity in early onset periodontitis patients.
AB  == gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) reflects the immune and inflammatory reactions and the specific host-microbe interactions that lead to periodontal diseases. aspartate aminotransferase enzyme (ast) is one of the components of gcf that is released as a result of cell death. in this study, periodontal sites (4 sites/patient) with a probing depth of > or =5 mm in early onset periodontitis (eop) patients were first examined for the ast levels in gcf by the periogard periodontal tissue monitor. to be eligible for the study, each of the patients had at least 1 ast positive site with clinical inflammatory changes (ast+, cic+)  and 1 ast negative site with no or minimum clinical inflammatory changes (ast-, cic-). in 15 eop patients who met the entry criteria, 30 ast+, cic+ sites (1st group) and 19 ast-, cic- sites (2nd group) were evaluated for microbiological variables. certain microbial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected more frequently (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively) in the 1st group, while gram-positive facultative organisms such as actinomyces species were found more often (p<0.001) in the 2nd group. parallel to the ast levels, the 2nd group had a lower number of total bacteria and proportion of obligate anaerobic and capnophilic micro-organisms than the first group (p<0.05 and p<0.05, respectively). within the scope of this study, ast activity and microbiological data were found in agreement in the examined groups. these findings are encouraging and indicate the need for further studies to evaluate the ability of  the ast test to differentiate the microbial flora of progressing sites and those  that are inflamed, but not progressing.

TI  == preparation and characterization of an actinomyces naeslundii aggregation factor  that mediates coaggregation with porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == intergeneric coaggregation is responsible for the complexity of the microbiota in human dental plaque and is believed to be important in the initial bacterial colonization of the human oral cavity. actinomyces naeslundii, an early colonizer of the tooth surface, may enhance subsequent colonization by porphyromonas gingivalis which is associated with adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to isolate and characterize the a. naeslundii aggregation factor (anaf) that mediates coaggregation with p. gingivalis. anaf was isolated from a. naeslundii sonic extract (se) by gel filtration on a sephacryl s-400hr, by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a hitrap octyl sepharose 4ff, and by ion exchange chromatography on a hitrap q. the specific activity increased 12-fold with a yield of 2.5%. sds-page analysis of anaf revealed a protein band of high molecular weight in excess of 200 kda. carbohydrate was detected as the only material coinciding with the protein band, indicating that the anaf was a glycoprotein. immunoblotting analysis indicated that anaf directly bound to p. gingivalis cells. anaf was sensitive to sodium metaperiodate treatment but not to heat or protease treatments. these results suggest that the anaf carbohydrate component mediated coaggregation with p. gingivalis cells. anaf also inhibited coaggregation with other periodontal disease-associated bacteria such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, but not  streptococci.

AB  == serum antibody specificity to oral micro-organisms was used to delineate the pathogens associated with early-onset periodontal diseases in a turkish population. additionally, comparison of the findings to those derived from a clinically similar us patient population described differences in bacterial specific antibody between these 2 geographic regions. serum from 89 (ljp), 86 (rpp) and 94 (normal) subjects was analyzed (elisa) to determine igg antibody to  14 oral micro-organisms. all ljp patients from turkey exhibited elevated antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes c and a significantly increased), while antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 and jp2 (serotype b) were significantly higher in us ljp patients. 50% of the turkish rpp patients also showed elevated anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans antibody, although the us rpp patients exhibited significantly higher antibody levels and frequency of elevated antibody to the a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. healthy subjects and ljp and  rpp patients from the us exhibited higher antibody levels to all 3 p. gingivalis  serogroups compared to those from turkey, although, the frequency of elevated antibody to the p. gingivalis serogroups was significantly higher in ljp and rpp  patients from turkey than from the us. interestingly, 87% and 77% of the ljp patients in the turkish population had elevated antibody responses to p. gingivalis and e. corrodens, respectively, which was not observed in the us ljp patients. these data suggested that considerable variation exists in the systemic antibody levels to periodontopathogens between these 2 countries. this supports potential differences in subgingival colonization or antigenic composition of these pathogens between patient populations from different geographical regions.

TI  == subgingival microflora and treatment in prepubertal periodontitis associated with chronic idiopathic neutropenia.
AB  == prepubertal periodontitis affects both primary and permanent dentition. the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival microflora of the permanent dentition in an 11-year-old caucasian female, who had premature exfoliation of her deciduous teeth on her 5th year of age, and the response of this condition to the antibiotic therapy and supportive periodontal care. gingival tissues were highly inflamed and alveolar bone loss was detected radiographically. the girl had experienced frequent upper respiratory tract infections, tonsilitis and recurrent otitis media. her mother had history of early onset periodontitis associated with chronic idiopathic neutropenia. blood chemistry tests and immunological examinations were also performed. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the proximal sites of permanent molars, incisors, canines and maxillary premolars. 27 different microbial species were isolated from the subgingival microflora. among the predominant species were porphyromonas gingivalis (17.6%-7.3%), prevotella intermedia (12.4%-4.7%), capnocytophaga sputigena (14.4%-10.4%), capnocytophaga ochracea (13.2%-6.9%) and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.3%-5.5%). periodontal treatment consisted of scaling, root planing in conjunction with antibiotic administration of augmentin 312.5 mg and flagyl 200 mg, each t.i.d. for 10 days. 3 weeks after the  antibiotic therapy, bacterial samples were collected from the same sites. all the periodontal pathogens were recovered in lower levels and a.actinomycetemcomitans  was almost eliminated in the 3-week period. the evaluation of clinical indices at 3, 6 and 12 months showed that periodontal treatment in conjunction with antibiotics was effective and rapidly followed by marked clinical improvement. the microbiological monitoring at 3, 6 and 12 months after antibiotic treatment and each time prior to supportive periodontal care, revealed that the periodontal pathogens fluctuated in low levels even 12 months after treatment and could be maintained at low level by supportive periodontal care at 3-month intervals.

TI  == beta-sheet antibiotic peptides as potential dental therapeutics.
AB  == small, cysteine-rich, beta-sheet peptide antibiotics are found throughout the animalia. though broad spectrum in potential, they may exert selective antimicrobial effects under certain conditions. we have explored the antimicrobial properties of two families of beta-sheet peptide antibiotics, defensins and protegrins, against periodontopathic bacteria. the rabbit defensin  np-1 was active against facultative gram-negative bacteria associated with early  onset periodontitis, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the capnocytophaga spp. porcine protegrins showed even greater activity against those organisms, as well as against anaerobic bacteria associated with adult periodontitis, including porphyromonas gingivalis prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. based on these observations, we believe that protegrin-like beta-sheet peptide antibiotics may be useful dental therapeutics.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of several periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis, their in vitro susceptibility to minocycline-hcl, and whether the efficacy of the drug changes with a decrease  in bacterial susceptibility. twenty-one patients (43 to 75 years old) with 62 periodontal lesions from pockets > or =4 mm participated in the study. after subgingival sampling, an ointment containing 2% minocycline-hcl was applied locally to the selected pockets once a week for 4 weeks. the lesions were clinically examined after 1 and 4 weeks of administration. the distribution of the subgingival microorganisms included capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), prevotella intermedia (22.6%), porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%), and eikenella corrodens (4.8%). the distribution was complex, with 76.8% of the sites containing 1 to 3 bacterial spieces. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of minocycline-hcl for each organism showed that most were inhibited by a minocycline-hcl concentration equal to or less than the mic for reference strains. however, some clinical strains of prevotella intermedia seemed to exihibit low susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. there were no significant differences among sites with strains exhibiting low or normal susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. the concentration of the drug applied to deep periodontal pockets inhibited the growth of most of the microorganisms investigated in this study.

TI  == periodontal status and subgingival microbiota of insulin-dependent juvenile diabetics: a 3-year longitudinal study.
AB  == this study examined for 3 years the changes in periodontal status and the possible correlations with selected subgingival microbiota and diabetic conditions in a group of 16 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm, jd) patients as compared with their 16 healthy cohabiting siblings (hs). jd patients  were monitored every 3 months for levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (hba1c). clinical and microbiological parameters were measured 6 weeks before drawing blood to determine levels of hba1c. periodontal parameters were measured at baseline (to), year 2 (t2), year 3 (t3) and included: probing depth (pd), attachment level (al), sulcus bleeding index (sbi), and plaque index (pi). two sites in each patient were selected for microbial samples: a mesio-facial aspect  of the maxillary right first molar (defined as constant site, cs) and a site with the greatest probing depth (defined as deepest site, ds). microbial samples were  analyzed by culture techniques. no significant differences in clinical parameters were found between diabetics and healthy siblings at any examination. the sbi in  the non-diabetic group at t2 and at t3 was significantly lower than at baseline.  pd and al of constant sites in the diabetic group at t3 were significantly higher than baseline. there was a significant increase in prevotella intermedia at t3 as compared with baseline for deepest sites in the diabetic group. cluster analysis  revealed, in a former study, two clusters (iv and v) at baseline which were significantly different from the overall mean regarding composition of porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga spp. they were not significantly different for periodontal parameters from to to t3. these data would suggest no significant differences in clinical parameters between the diabetics and non-diabetic siblings throughout this 3-year longitudinal study.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis-susceptible subjects.
AB  == the present study evaluated the long-term effect of (i) meticulous self-performed, supragingival plaque control and (ii) the use of a triclosan/copolymer containing dentifrice in adult subjects susceptible to destructive periodontitis. 40 individuals were recruited into the trial. 3-5 years prior to the baseline examination, they had all been treated by nonsurgical means- for advanced periodontal disease. during the subsequent maintenance phase, all subjects had at different time intervals exhibited sites with recurrent periodontitis. at a baseline examination, 6 surfaces per tooth were examined regarding bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, and probing attachment level. the deepest pocket site in each quadrant (i.e. 4 sites per subject) was selected and samples of the subgingival bacteria were taken. at baseline, all volunteers received detailed information on proper oral hygiene techniques. this  information was repeated on an individual need basis during the course of the subsequent 36-months. no professional subgingival therapy was delivered between the baseline and the 36-month examinations. the subjects were randomly distributed into 2 equal groups of 20 individuals each, 1 test and 1 control group. the members of the test group were supplied with a fluoridated dentifrice  containing triclosan/copolymer (total, colgate), while the controls received a corresponding dentifrice but without triclosan/copolymer. the findings demonstrated that in subjects with advanced and recurrent periodontitis, carefully practiced supragingival plaque control had some effects on the subgingival microbiota, but also that this was insufficient to prevent disease progression. in a corresponding group of subjects, however, who used a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice, the subgingival microbiota was reduced in both quantitative and qualitative terms and recurrent periodontitis was almost entirely prevented.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of subjects with adult periodontitis who responded poorly to scaling and root planing.
AB  == in a previous report, it was shown that scaling and root planing (srp) decreased  mean pocket depth and attachment level in subjects with adult periodontitis, as well as the levels and prevalence of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. however, a subset of subjects in that study exhibited mean loss of attachment following srp. the purpose of the present investigation was to seek clinical and microbiological differences between subjects who responded well or poorly to srp. 57 subjects with adult periodontitis were treated by full-mouth srp under local anaesthetic. clinical assessments of plaque, redness, suppuration, bop, pocket depth and attachment level were made at 6 sites per tooth prior to and 3 months post-srp. attachment level measurements were repeated at each visit and differences in means between visits used to assess change. 18 subjects showed mean attachment loss 3 months post-srp (poor response group), while 39 showed mean attachment level gain (good  response group). the prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa in subgingival  plaque samples from the mesiobuccal site of each tooth (maximum 28 sites) in each subject prior to and 3 months post-srp were assessed using checker-board dna-dna  hybridization. the prevalence of each species was computed for each subject and averaged across subjects in the 2 treatment-response groups at each visit. differences between groups were sought using the mann-whitney test. there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 response groups in any clinical parameter prior to therapy. subjects in the good response group showed more attachment level gain at sites with baseline pocket depths of < 4 mm, 4-6 and > 6 mm than poor response subjects. of 40 species evaluated, a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus), t. denticola, c. gracilis and c. rectus were significantly higher and more prevalent pre-therapy in the good response subjects. mean attachment level change post srp could be predicted using multiple linear regression with a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) and t. denticola as the predictor variables (r2 = 0.373, p < 0.00001). sites that gained > or = 2  mm of attachment post therapy showed a significant decrease in the counts of p. gingivalis (7.5 +/- 3.5 to 0.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(5)), t. denticola (8.2 +/- 3.5 to 1.8 +/- 1.1 x 10(5)) and b. forsythus (11.1 +/- 5.7 to 0.3 +/- 0.2 x 10(5)). the data of the present investigation indicate that srp is most effective in subjects and  sites with high levels of the subgingival species that this therapy affects.

TI  == characterization of protease activities in capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == protease activities in cell sonicates of defined bacterial strains were examined  using peptide substrates and class-specific inhibitors. capnocytophaga spp. all produced serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine/lysine, elastase- and  chymotrypsin-like enzymes with some metalloprotease characteristics. the elastase-like activity was strongest in capnocytophaga sputigena, but the others  were greatest in capnocytophaga gingivalis. the latter also had a separate arginine-specific enzyme which appeared not to be present in the other two species. porphyromonas gingivalis showed serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and very strong arginine and lysine cysteine protease activities. prevotella spp. had inhibitor-resistant dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine cysteine protease  activity that was much weaker but biochemically similar to p. gingivalis. treponema denticola possessed a strong trypsin-like serine protease activity as well as very weak dipeptidyl peptidase and chymotrypsin-like activities that were sensitive to some cysteine protease reagents. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans showed a novel alanine- and lysine-specific activity, but its nature was unclear.

TI  == extracts of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
AB  == in order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as escherichia coli on bone formation, clone mc3t3-e1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. the addition of the sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration  range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. by contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis, and escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. the addition of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the  cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. polymyxin b did  not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. the inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kda eluted from sephadex g-200 column. the inhibitory substances of prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these results indicate that prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.

TI  == subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that  of non-smokers. the study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. the samples were cultured aerobically  and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the differences in bacterial counts using  the mann whitney u test were statistically significant for staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens, escherichia coli, bacteroides forsythus, bacteroides gracilis, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis,  selenomonas sputigena and candida albicans in smokers. statistically significant  differences for peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, eubacterium lentum and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. the isolation  of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like e. coli, c. albicans and s. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

TI  == secretion of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha, il-8 and il-1ra by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) are the first cells that migrate into periodontal tissues and gingival crevices in response to invading pathogens. it was recently demonstrated that pmn have the ability to synthesize and release cytokines following appropriate stimulation, while it is not clear whether these  capacities are directly related to periodontal destructive processes. we therefore investigated the amounts of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-8 and il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) secreted by pmn from healthy donors following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (lps) from 4 periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea and fusobacterium nucleatum, and the non-oral bacterium escherichia coli. a actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. coli lps stimulated the release of significantly greater amounts of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 than the control unstimulated pmn (p < 0.01). the levels of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 released from cells stimulated with p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps were significantly lower than those of cells stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans or e. coli lps (p < 0.05). on the other hand, substantially greater amounts of il-1ra were released from pmn stimulated with each lps and from control unstimulated pmn during the first 6 h, and then significantly greater amounts of il-1ra were secreted by pmn stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans and e.coli lps during the following 12 h (p < 0.01). the inhibitory effects of il-1ra on the biological activity of il-1 in the supernatants of pmn were examined by the thymocyte comitogen proliferation assay. the supernatants of pmn stimulated with each lps showed less biological il-1 activity as compared with the same doses of recombinant human il-1 beta detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. furthermore, no activity was detected in the supernatants of pmn stimulated with  p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps. these findings demonstrated that lps from periodontopathic bacteria were capable of stimulating pmn to release not only pro-inflammatory cytokines but also their inhibitors such as il-1ra. different secretion levels of these cytokines and their biological activities induced by the various lps might be important in the onset and progression of periodontal diseases.

TI  == degradation of lactoferrin by periodontitis-associated bacteria.
AB  == the degradation of human lactoferrin by putative periodontopathogenic bacteria was examined. fragments of lactoferrin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measured by densitometry. the degradation of lactoferrin was more extensive by porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga sputigena, slow by capnocytophaga ochracea, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia, and very slow or absent by prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and peptostreptococcus micros. all strains of p. gingivalis tested degraded lactoferrin. the degradation was sensitive to protease inhibitors, cystatin c and albumin. the degradation by c. sputigena was not affected by the protease inhibitors and the detected lactoferrin fragments exhibited electrophoretic mobilities similar to those ascribed to deglycosylated forms of lactoferrin. furthermore a weak or absent reactivity of these fragments with sialic acid-specific lectin suggested that they are desialylated. the present data indicate that certain bacteria colonizing the periodontal pocket can degrade lactoferrin. the presence of other human proteins as specific inhibitors and/or as substrate competitors may counteract this degradation process.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on peripheral blood leukocyte interleukin-6 and soluble interleukin-6 receptor production.
AB  == to determine the effect of pathogenic oral bacteria on interleukin 6 (il-6) and soluble il-6 receptor production, we measured their release by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes (monocyte depleted), pure t cells, or monocytes were cultured with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum or porphyromonas gingivalis for  24 h. supernatants were tested for il-6 and soluble il-6 receptor by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. only monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells responded with significant il-6 release in the presence of all  bacteria tested. however, peripheral blood lymphocytes were capable of producing  il-6 when activated by phytohemagglutinin or il-2 followed by bacteria, though substantially less than cultures containing monocytes. no bacteria tested increased soluble il-6 receptor release over spontaneous soluble il-6 receptor release. we conclude that monocytes release il-6 after contact with oral pathogens; however, soluble il-6 receptor from t cells and monocytes is constitutively produced and may modulate il-6 actions.

AB  == serum rheumatoid factor (rf) level and peritoneal and splenic cd5+b (b-1) cells in mice were examined after intraperitoneal administration of purified lipopoly-saccharides (lps) from oral periodontopathic bacteria; porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga ochracea. f. nucleatum and c. ochracea lps induced higher levels of serum igm- and igg-rf, while p. gingivalis lps showed the least induction. in  addition, wet weights of spleen and serum igm and igg concentration were markedly increased in f. nucleatum lps injected group. on the other hand, the proportion of cd5+ b cells to lymphocytes in the peritoneal cavity and spleen did not increase. the reason for this was not clear but conventional b cells (cd5- b cells) might increase more rapidly with splenic enlargement than cd5+ b cells. these results suggested that rf induced by bacterial lps may modulate immune responses against bacteria and plays an important role for defence and destruction of periodontal tissue.

TI  == pcr reaction and dot-blot hybridization to monitor the distribution of oral pathogens within plaque samples of periodontally healthy individuals.

AB  == the microbial colonization of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane by putative periodontopathogens at 3 minutes of intraoral manipulation was determined in 42 patients with 42 mandibular posterior two- to three-wall defects. twenty patients exhibited no periodontal pockets of > or = 5 mm, other than the study site, and low levels of pathogens (group a). twenty-two patients revealed multiple periodontal pockets of 5 mm or more and numerous pathogens (group b). within the preceding 3 months of regenerative surgery, group a patients had received apically positioned flap surgery with osseous recontouring  (except for the study site), and group b patients had been enrolled in a non-surgical maintenance program. the subgingival microbiota was examined prior to regenerative therapy, and the membrane microbiota was examined at 3 minutes and at the time of removal at 6 weeks by culture, dna probes, and phase-contrast  microscopy. the mean initial defect depth was 7.4 mm for group a and 7.2 mm for group b. at 6 months, the difference in mean clinical attachment gain was statistically significant (p < 0.001; group a: 3.4 mm; group b: 1.4 mm). at 3 minutes, putative pathogens were detected in seven (16.7%) membranes in group b (group binfected), and the associated sites gained only 0.6 mm in clinical attachment at 6 months. clinical attachment gain was modeled as a linear function of the explanatory variables (r2 = 86%). the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis detected by dna probe at 3 minutes was associated with 1.5 mm less expected gain  (p = 0.0002). total microbial counts and the percentage of peptostreptococcus micros and capnocytophaga species at baseline, and of motile rods on the membrane surface facing the gingiva at 6 weeks, were statistically significant negative predictors of clinical attachment. for each week the membrane remained covered, an additional 0.5 mm gain could be expected (p = 0.002); and for every 10 sites that exhibited bleeding on probing, the clinical attachment gain was 0.6 mm less  at the site of regeneration (p < 0.0001). the present results showed that putative pathogens may colonize membranes within 3 minutes of intraoral manipulation. the patient group treated with periodontal osseous surgery revealed the lowest levels of periodontal pathogens in the membranes and exhibited the most gain in clinical attachment.

TI  == chemiluminescent assay of alkaline phosphatase in human gingival crevicular fluid: investigations with an experimental gingivitis model and studies on the source of the enzyme within crevicular fluid.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate how levels of gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) alkaline phosphatase (alp) change in relation to levels of plaque and gingival inflammation in 20 adults during a 21 day period of experimental gingivitis. the source of alp within gcf was also investigated using a repeat sampling protocol; by determining enzyme levels derived from 30 putative periodontal pathogenic and non-pathogenic species; and by examining inhibition profiles from a variety of host and bacterial alp isoenzymes. total 30-s gcf alp  levels increased significantly (p < 0.002) during experimental gingivitis and preceded an increase in gingival index (gi) by approximately 7 days. enzyme levels correlated with gcf volume (r = 0.7; p < 0.0001), but repeat sampling indicated that entry of alp into the gingival crevice was independent of the rate of fluid flow. only 5 of the bacterial species investigated produced clearly detectable levels of alp in culture supernatants, these were p. gingivalis (381), p. intermedia (581), p. nigrescens (8944), dentin p. gingivalis (tw 471: clinical isolate) and c. ochracea (25). levamisole inhibition and studies on suspensions of washed plaque demonstrated that host-derived alp contributed to > 80% of the enzyme in gcf. we conclude that elevated 30-s gcf alp levels measured using the chemiluminescent assay reported, are detectable before increases in gingival indices and appear to be a better marker of gingival inflammation than alp concentrations. the major source of alp within gcf is host derived and in early inflammatory disease is likely to be of polymophonuclear leukocyte origin.

TI  == degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. in the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. the activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin iii, antiplasmin and cystatin c) was evaluated by sds-page. the 80 kda trypsin-like protease of p. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kda chymotrypsin-like protease of  t. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin c. when whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and capnocytophaga spp. peptostreptococcus micros and propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and fusobacterium nucleatum, had no  effect on the protease inhibitors. the 80 kda protease of p. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kda protease of t. denticola. this study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. this may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.

TI  == histological and microbiological aspects of ligature-induced periodontitis in beagle dogs.
AB  == this study was designed to investigate, using 6 beagle dogs, the levels of selected putative pathogens in healthy sites, in gingivitis sites, and in sites with histologically confirmed attachment loss. levels of attachment loss increased with increasing periods of ligation and reached a maximum of 0.15 mm at 57 days. both histological attachment level and histological pocket depth were found to vary significantly with health/disease status (p < 0.0001). higher numbers of total colony-forming units were seen for ligated sites than for healthy and gingivitis sites. levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia also changed significantly with health/disease status (p < 0.001). these organisms showed their greatest increases at the time of the most intense attachment loss. higher levels of fusobacterium nucleatum were seen in the gingivitis sites than in healthy or ligated sites. low levels of campylobacter rectus and capnocytophaga spp. were detected throughout. the morphometric microbiological analysis revealed unexpectedly high %s of motile rods, while spirochetes were found in very low %s. the total number of bacterial cells detected using phase contrast microscopy was not found to vary significantly. none of the morphotypes were demonstrated as showing significant changes with health/disease status.

AB  == detection of putative pathogens is critical for delineating the etiology and progression of periodontitis. in the present study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay utilizing primers specific for the lkt a gene of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the fimbrial gene of porphyromonas gingivalis, and tdp a gene of treponema denticola in order to determine the presence of these pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites. these gene specific primers were also used to assess the detection of different strains of bacteria in the pcr assays. primers for p. gingivalis detected p. gingivalis strain 33277, but no product was detected when primers were used with extracts from 4 species of capnocytophaga, 3 species of prevotella, 2 species of porphyromonas other than p. gingivalis, bacteroides levii, escherichia coli, 3 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 3 strains of t. denticola. pcr analysis using primers for the lkt a gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans also did not result in a product with any of these bacteria with the exception of a positive result with 3 different strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans. primers selected from the tdp a gene of t. denticola did not identify any of the bacteria strains tested except t. denticola serovars a, b, and c. thus, these primers were shown to amplify gene segments that are specific to either p. gingivalis (33277), a. actinomycetemcomitans (33384, 43717  and 43718) or t. denticola (35405, 33521 and 35404). the pcr assay may be used to rapidly detect the presence of periodontal pathogens in the future.

TI  == prevalence of 6 putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from romanian adult periodontitis patients.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to determine by standard cultivation procedures  the detection frequencies of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, and capnocytophaga species as well as various enteric rods in subgingival plaque samples form romanian adult periodontitis patients. dna probe  analysis (affirm dp microbial identification test) was also used, parallel to cultivation, to identify p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus, in deep (> or = 6 mm) and intermediate (4-5 mm) pockets in some of the subjects investigated. paper points were used to sample 86 deep pockets in 36 patients and 27 intermediate pockets in 9 of the 36 patients. the chi 2 test was  used to test for significance of differences between results obtained by cultivation and dna analysis in both intermediate and deep pockets. p. gingivalis was recovered in a high percentage of the patients (75.8%) and sites (63.6%) examined, followed by p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans,  respectively. capnocytophaga species were present in almost all subjects. enteric rods were recovered in 61.1% of the patients and 55.8% of the sites. except for this high prevalence of enteric rods, the present group of patients had the periodontal species monitored in %s similar to those commonly perceived in the west. the affirm dp test and cultivation showed poor correlation in detecting p.  gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus. the cultivation prevalence of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in deep pockets was similar to their prevalence in intermediate ones. overall, the prevalence of the periodontal pathogens investigated in the present romanian periodontitis patients is similar  to what has been revealed in matching norwegian and other western periodontitis patient populations. the high prevalence of enteric rods in the romanian patients may have been an artifact resulting from prolonged transport of the samples in vmga iii.

TI  == rapid characterization of periodontal bacterial isolates by using fluorogenic substrate tests.
AB  == eighty-nine species of subgingival bacteria, represented by 121 reference strains and 892 patient isolates, including gram-negative, gram-positive, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic species, were characterized with a panel of fluorogenic, 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrate  tests. identifications of all patient isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of whole-cell proteins relative to reference strains. characteristic profiles of positive fluorogenic reactions differentiated most of the species, including five porphyromonas species, six pigmenting and five nonpigmenting prevotella species, bacteroides forsythus, three capnocytophaga species, six actinomyces species, four propionibacterium species, and eight streptococcus species. two mannoside isomers differentiated actinomyces israelii and actinomyces gerencseriae. in addition to  porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus, and capnocytophaga species, fusobacterium alocis, actinomyces odontolyticus, actinomyces meyeri, and bifidobacterium dentium were all positive for so-called trypsin-like activity. fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter species were nonreactive with the carbohydrate-based substrates tested. fluorogenic substrate tests provided a sensitive and simple method for biochemical characterization that could presumptively identify to species level most subgingival isolates within 4 h. the method was ideal for rapidly obtaining  presumptive identifications of isolates prior to confirming identifications by definitive methods, such as sds-page.

TI  == comparison of randomly cloned and whole genomic dna probes for the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus.
AB  == whole genomic and randomly-cloned dna probes for two fastidious periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus were labeled with digoxigenin and detected by a colorimetric method. the specificity and sensitivity of the whole genomic and cloned probes were compared. the cloned probes were highly specific compared to the whole genomic probes. a significant degree of cross-reactivity with bacteroides species, capnocytophaga sp. and prevotella sp. was observed with the whole genomic probes. the cloned probes were less sensitive than the whole genomic probes and required at least 10(6) target cells or a minimum of 10 ng of target dna to be detected during hybridization. although a ten-fold increase in sensitivity was obtained with the whole genomic probes, cross-hybridization to closely related species limits their reliability in identifying target bacteria in subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == cell envelope and cell wall immunization of macaca fascicularis: effect on the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis.
AB  == the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and actinomyces viscosus. serum immunoglobulin g (igg), igm and iga isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. the high p. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low p. gingivalis numbers being recovered. p. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable p. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, bacteroides macacae and prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of fusobacterium spp. decreased. plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth.  attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups, and the f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. although immunization with p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted  in greater bone loss than immunization with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.

TI  == [subgingival distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontic patients and susceptibility of these bacteria to minocycline-hcl].
AB  == the present study was carried out to examine the distribution of six periodontopathic bacteria in deep periodontal pockets and to reconfirm the effect of periocline on these periodontopathic bacteria. samples from sixty-two periodontal pockets were collected at pocket depths of over 4 mm in twenty-one periodontitis patients aged 43 to 75 years. after sampling, periocline was applied topically to the selected pockets once a week for four weeks and reexamined. the detected rates of the periodontopathic bacteria were capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), prevotella intermedia (22.6%), porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%) and eikenella corrodens (4.8%). the distribution of  the bacteria was compound because two or three bacterial species were found to coexist. in view of the mic of minocycline-hci for these bacteria, increase of most of the measured bacteria was suppressed by the concentration of drugs, including periocline. however, clinical strains of p. i. were considered to have  low susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. in view of the effect of topical application of drugs, no significant differences were found. from these results,  it was suggested that periocline contained effective concentration of minocycline-hcl.

TI  == clinical and microbiological changes associated with an altered subgingival environment induced by periodontal pocket reduction.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to study the effect of an altered subgingival environment, induced by changing the local soft tissue morphology, i.e., pocket depth reduction, on the subgingival microbiota and the clinical conditions. 7 patients aged 30-60 years with generalized marginal periodontitis were selected. patients were instructed in proper oral hygiene and all teeth were cleaned supragingivally. mucoperiosteal flaps were raised and the bone re-contoured to eliminate angular bony defects. while the control teeth were carefully debrided and thoroughly root planed, no root instrumentation was performed on the test teeth. calculus deposits visible to the naked eye were only chipped-off with the tip of a scaler. the flaps were apically repositioned and sutured at the level of the bone crest. clinical parameters showed a similar pattern of response in the test and control sites over a one year observation period post therapy. probing depths and probing attachment levels were significantly reduced one month after surgery and remained at a lower level. a significant decrease was also noted for total anaerobic viable bacterial counts.  the proportion of the gram-negative anaerobic rods decreased significantly in both groups. p. gingivalis, fusobacterium sp., c rectus were detected significantly less often after treatment in both groups. capnocytophaga and a. odontolyticus, on the other hand, were more frequently isolated after therapy. these findings corroborate the concept that the reduction of selected subgingival microorganisms is the key element for the success of periodontal therapy, rather  than the removal of tooth substance and mineralized deposits by root instrumentation.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis outer membrane vesicles promote bacterial resistance to  chlorhexidine.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis has been frequently associated with some types of periodontal diseases and possesses various mechanisms favoring the pathogenic process. it has been recently observed that vesicles elaborated by p. gingivalis  are able to protect bacteria from the bactericidal activity of human serum. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the ability of vesicles from p.  gingivalis in protecting oral bacteria against chlorhexidine. data indicate that  vesicles released by p. gingivalis may bind chlorhexidine, thus allowing protection for itself and for other oral bacterial species. it has also been demonstrated that lipopolysaccharides are the major component involved in the binding of chlorhexidine by vesicles. the mechanism of resistance reported in this study indicates that bacterial interactions in the oral cavity may influence the sensitivity of microbes.

TI  == microbial alterations in supragingival dental plaque in response to a triclosan-containing dentifrice.
AB  == a total of 325 subjects were entered into a double-blind, stratified 2-treatment  clinical study that examined the effects of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan, 2% gantrez copolymer and 0.243% sodium fluoride on supragingival dental plaque and gingivitis. a subset of 159 subjects including 72 men and 87 women participated in the microbiological component of this study, which was designed to detect shifts in supragingival bacterial species in response to triclosan. subjects were divided into two groups: one performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice and a control group used a placebo dentifrice without triclosan. at baseline, 3 and 6 months during treatment and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks post-treatment, supragingival dental plaque was collected from the buccal and lingual surfaces of the 4 first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase-contrast microscopy; 2)  select bacterial groups and bacterial species by culture; and 3) target periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia by immunofluorescence microscopy. there were few statistically significant differences between treatment groups in any of the 90 microbiological parameters  measured at the 7 different time points. the control group demonstrated significantly higher levels of cultivable neisseria and higher proportions at the 3-month treatment period of p. gingivalis-infected subjects and mean cells. after 6 months of treatment, the triclosan group demonstrated higher levels of fusiforms. analysis of triclosan resistance data failed to detect a shift towards increased proportions of bacteria resistant to triclosan, and both treatment groups demonstrated triclosan-resistant strains, predominantly veillonella dispar. this study confirms the microbiological safety of triclosan-containing dentifrices and suggests that continued use can be associated with beneficial alterations in the bacterial composition of supragingival dental plaque.

TI  == comparison of host tissue and bacterial dipeptidyl peptidases in human gingival crevicular fluid by analytical isoelectric focusing.
AB  == earlier work has shown that gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) contains dipeptidyl peptidase (dpp) activities that resemble those in host tissue. here, further comparisons were made with enzymes from suspected periodontal pathogens. gingival tissue and gcf were collected from patients with chronic periodontitis. dpp ii and dpp iv fractions with acid and alkaline ph optima, respectively, were separated from crude tissue extracts by gel-filtration chromatography. bacterial  cell sonicates were prepared from broth cultures of reference strains. there was  moderate to strong dpp activity with capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella spp., very weak activity with treponema denticola and no detectable activity with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or fusobacterium nucleatum. banding patterns in gcf, tissue and bacterial samples were compared on substrate-impregnated overlay membranes applied to isoelectric focusing gels. in  gels washed with acid buffer, gcf had bands corresponding to tissue dpp ii. use of an alkaline washing buffer showed gcf activity which closely matched tissue dpp iv that had been pretreated with neuraminidase, an enzyme found by others in  the gingival crevice. p. gingivalis gave multiple bands and several of these had  counterparts in gcf. the apparent presence in gcf of the dpp from p. gingivalis is consistent with the association of this organism with destructive periodontitis.

TI  == occurrence of certain bacterial species and morphotypes in juvenile periodontitis in chile.
AB  == the occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species, and certain bacterial morphotypes was determined in 18 affected and 18 unaffected sites in 10 localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients, and in 10 affected and 10 unaffected sites in 5 generalized juvenile periodontitis (gjp) patients. the subgingival proportion of  the 7 bacterial species was determined by selective and nonselective culturing. the results showed that when considering the pure prevalence of bacteria ( > 0%)  there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the subgingival plaque microflora of the affected sites versus those of the unaffected sites for p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, c. rectus, and f. nucleatum in ljp, and for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum in gjp. the mean proportions of cocci, motile rods and spirochetes were also significantly different (p < 0.05) in affected sites compared to unaffected sites. capnocytophaga sp, f. nucleatum, p. intermedia, and e. corrodens were found in more than 75% of affected sites in ljp. when taking the approach that an organism, to be associated with periodontal disease, has to be detected above a certain minimum threshold, the results indicated that bacteria most frequently associated with ljp and gjp in chile are p. gingivalis (66% of ljp and 80% of gjp affected sites), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (44% of ljp and 50% in gjp affected sites). different bacterial species may be judged to be important in the disease  process depending upon whether a pure bacterial prevalence, or a prevalence above a certain detection level, is considered.

TI  == effect of whole oral bacteria and extracted lipopolysaccharides on peripheral blood leukocyte interleukin-2 receptor expression.
AB  == expression of the interleukin-2 receptor (il-2r) on t cells is the molecular mechanism that initiates the g0 to g1 transition and is the critical first step for t cell proliferation in response to antigen. the effect of whole periodontal  bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (lps) on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) il-2r expression was examined in vitro. lps induced a modest but significant increase in high affinity il-2r alpha/beta (p55/p75 positive) expression on pbmc over untreated cells after 48 h culture. addition of lps to pbmc cultures depleted of monocytes had no effect on il-2r expression compared to untreated cultures. interleukin-1 (il-1) caused a similar effect to lps in 48 h pbmc cultures but il-1 also increased high affinity il-2r expression in cultures  depleted of adherent mononuclear cells. when antibody to il-1 was simultaneously  added with lps to pbmc cultures, the high affinity il-2r inductive effect was reversed at 48 h, suggesting that the lps effect on pbmc il-2r was indirect, via  monocytes. whole pathogenic oral bacteria cultured with pbmc at high (100:1), but not low (10:1) bacteria:pbmc ratios had a similar effect to lps, inducing high affinity il-2r expression at 48 h. increases in soluble il-2r alpha were also measured in supernatants of pbmc incubated with periodontal bacteria compared to  untreated controls. in this system, a critical threshold of bacteria was required to activate pbmc perhaps related to the quantity of cell-surface lps presented to adherent mononuclear cells.

AB  == serum igg antibody titers to 7 periodontopathic bacteria in periodontitis patients were measured at the 1st visit and after various periodontal treatments  with clinically successful improvement, in order to evaluate what kind of factors are associated with changes of serum antibody titers. 20 patients (10 male and 10 female from 23 to 61 years old) with adult, rapidly progressive periodontitis were enrolled in this study. all patients received initial preparation and most of them also underwent surgical procedure. after the treatments, the mean probing pocket depths decreased from 3.72 mm to 1.56 mm. serum samples were collected from patients at the initial and final examinations. serum igg antibody titers against sonicated antigens of porphyromonas gingivalis fdc 381, prevotella intermedia atcc 25611, prevotella loescheii atcc 15930, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum atcc 25586, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdc y4, eikenella corrodens fdc 1073 and capnocytophaga ochracea # m 12 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the mean antibody titers to p. gingivalis and p. intermedia decreased significantly after the treatment as compared to their pretreatment levels. the antibody titer to p. gingivalis, especially, decreased in all of the patients examined. a significant relationship was found between the decreased antibody titer to p. gingivalis and the number of teeth which received periodontal surgery, as well as treatment length, and the relationship between the decreased antibody titer to p. intermedia and the number of extracted teeth was also significant. these results suggest that the changes of serum igg titers against p. gingivalis and p. intermedia are related to the suppression of such pathogens in subgingival plague.

TI  == periodontopathogens in elderly chinese with different periodontal disease experience.
AB  == if an etiological relationship exists between destructive periodontal disease and putative periodontopathogens, they would be expected to have a very low prevalence in periodontally healthy elderly persons. to test this hypothesis, 2 subgroups of elderly, rural chinese (a periodontally "best" and a "worst" group,  each comprising 15 persons) were identified in 1990 from a cohort aged 55-69 years, examined in 1984. assessment of changes in periodontal status over the 6-year period were possible by comparing detailed clinical recordings performed by the same examinator. subgingival microbial samples were taken at the mesial aspects of an upper central incisor and a lower canine and examined for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia group, prevotella melaninogenica group, capnocytophaga, selenomonas, campylobacter rectus as well as predominant streptococcus and actinomyces species. during the 6 years prior to microbiological sampling, persons in the "best" group had lost an average of 1.21 +/- 0.48 mm attachment, while persons in the "worst" group had lost an average of 1.60 +/- 0.94 mm. the latter group had lost 53.3 teeth, predominantly for periodontal reasons, in contrast to 1.8 teeth lost in the "best" group. "best" persons did not differ from "worst" persons with respect to the occurrence of the putative periopathogens, total viable count, and total streptococcal and actinomyces recovery. similarly, sites which had experienced an attachment loss > or = 2 mm during the 6-year period did not differ microbiologically from sites with less attachment loss. it is concluded that subgingival microbial characterization does not allow for a distinction between elderly individuals with markedly different periodontal disease experiences.

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.

TI  == degradation of immunoglobulin g by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin g (igg) as a substrate for growth. this was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with igg. stimulation of growth was observed for capnocytophaga ochracea, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, lactobacillus catenaforme and streptococcus intermedius. immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and a protein assay demonstrated that p. intermedia and p. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of igg. partial breakdown of igg was observed for p. asaccharolytica and c. ochracea, whereas p. oralis cleaved the igg heavy chain, yielding fc and fab fragments. all these bacteria utilized igg as a substrate for growth. binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific igg with p. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with  p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, c. ochracea or fusobacterium nucleatum. degradation or inactivation of igg by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.

AB  == a gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella  corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, capnocytophaga ochracea, eubacterium nodatum and fusobacterium nucleatum and one  nonoral microorganism, porphyromonas asaccharolytica. of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were e. nodatum (72%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). more juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to p. intermedia, c. ochracea, e. nodatum and p. micros. no significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. cluster analysis revealed  the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of p. micros and  c. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. the data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.

TI  == coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == to elucidate an ecological profile of several periodontopathogens, the authors examined the coaggregation between cells of porphyromonas gingivalis and oral bacterial strains including treponema denticola in vitro. coaggregation between cells of plaque bacteria was examined by visual assay and phase-contrast microscope. p. gingivalis cells coaggregated with strains of t. denticola and treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii, but did not coaggregate with t. socranskii subspecies buccale, t. socranskii subspecies paredis, treponema vincentii, or treponema pectinovorum. the extracted hemagglutinin from p. gingivalis was active agglutinating t. denticola cells. addition of serum and saliva somewhat affected the coaggregation, but no effects of tested sugars or amino acids were found. heat treatment of t. denticola cells did not reduce the coagregation: heat treatment of p. gingivalis cells eliminated it. growth inhibitory activity among these bacterial species was examined by the stab culture method. strains of t. denticola atcc 35404 and 35405 and t. vincentii inhibited the growth of some p. gingivalis strains, but not others. no strain of  treponema was inhibited by black-pigmented anaerobic rods. the coaggregation observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola indicates the potential importance of their simultaneous existence in human periodontal pockets and development of the disease.

TI  == microbiota of rapidly progressive periodontitis lesions in association with clinical parameters.
AB  == the microbial population in 73 rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp) lesions in 10 young adults aged 25 to 35 years (5 males, 5 females) was studied in relation  to the clinical parameters probing depth, bleeding on probing, and suppuration, which were recorded at the sampled sites. porphyromonas gingivalis was found to predominate (26.7%) in 73 periodontal lesions with clinical probing depth > 6 mm, followed by bacteroides forsythus (23.6%), and prevotella intermedia (15.7%). the prevalence of p. gingivalis was 91.7%, fusobacterium nucleatum, 90.4%; streptococcus intermedius, 87.7%; and b. forsythus, 53.4%. significant differences between bleeding index 0, 1, and 2 (p < 0.05) in frequency of detection were found for p. intermedia, campylobacter concisus, selenomonas sputigena, and peptostreptococcus micros at bleeding sites and for streptococcus  sanguis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus (p < 0.001) at non-bleeding sites. between suppurating and non-suppurating sites, significant differences (p < 0.05) in frequency of isolation were found for p. intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, and a. actinomycetemcomitans at suppurating sites and for f. nucleatum at non-suppurating sites.

TI  == comparative detection frequency of 6 putative periodontal pathogens in sudanese and norwegian adult periodontitis patients.
AB  == twenty-five sudanese and 18 norwegian adult periodontitis patients were selected  to participate in this study. the purpose was to compare cultivation results of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and capnocytophaga species as well as various enteric rods in both populations. in addition, dna probe analysis was used to identify p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and bacteroides forsythus in the sudanese patients and results were compared with those obtained by cultivation. the paper point technique was used to sample 99 sites in the sudanese group (4 paper points/site) and 119 sites in the norwegian patients (3 paper points/site). in the sudanese subjects, the fourth paper point was used for the dna probe analysis. the chi-square test and the wilcoxon signed rank test were used to test for statistically significant differences between sudanese and norwegian cultivation results as well as between cultivation and dna results in the sudanese group. cultivation results indicated  that the sudanese subjects had significantly lower prevalence of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum (p < 0.01), significantly higher prevalence of capnocytophaga species (p < 0.05), and similar prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. almost all sudanese subjects tested positive for various enteric rods, while none of the norwegians did so. the extent to which unrestricted use of antibiotics and transport media influenced the levels of enteric species is not known, however.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effect of treatment on some periodontopathogens and their antibody levels in periodontal abscesses.
AB  == twenty patients suffering from abscess of periodontal origin were treated and followed clinically and microbiologically for 6 months. microbiological examination was performed by culture technique. one deep and one shallow periodontal pocket in the same patient were examined concomitantly. serum was collected and analyzed for specific antibody level using elisa methodology. treatment included supragingival scaling, drainage, and irrigation of the periodontal pocket with 0.85% sodium chloride and systemic tetracycline administration, 1 g per day for 2 weeks. at baseline, 90% of the abscesses harbored porphyromonas gingivalis and/or prevotella intermedia. after 6 months, abscess sites demonstrated a reduced probing depth, less bleeding on probing, and gain of attachment. abscess sites showed no p. gingivalis and the proportion of p. intermedia was significantly reduced 6 months after treatment. in deep periodontal pockets a similar pattern was seen. shallow pockets demonstrated few  clinical signs of inflammation and the number of bacteria was generally low. campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp, and fusobacterium nucleatum were frequently seen in low numbers in most sites during the study period, while actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was detected only in a few sites. the igg levels in patient sera against antigens of homologous bacterial strains remained  fairly constant for 6 months. the result of the present study indicates that p. gingivalis and p. intermedia are involved in periodontal abscess formation. also, treatment where drainage is combined with tetracycline administration promotes healing and reattachment.

TI  == effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

TI  == identification and analyses of periodontal pathogens in taiwan by microbiological tests.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to use microbiological tests for diagnosis of periodontal diseases in taiwan. anaerobic culture, direct microscopy, indirect immunofluorescence (if), and biochemical tests were used to examine 336 samples for the specific microorganisms in subgingival plaque. the results indicated that gram-negative species and motile bacteria were less frequently detected, and in lower proportion, in samples from healthy sites. the bacteria found frequently in healthy group were the coccal forms. however, bacteroides forsythus detected by if showed a close association with periodontal inflammation. porphyromonas gingivalis was found with about 53% frequency in the periodontitis group; in more than half the samples the proportion was above 5%. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was recovered with 48% frequency of periodontitis group. other cultivable species including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species,  centipeda periodontii, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas species, and the spirochetes were detected in a significantly higher proportion in periodontitis group. the results strongly support the use of microbiological tests as adjuncts to diagnosis, and for assessment of the importance of microbiota in periodontal disease.

TI  == effective method for discriminating between oral bacterial and human alkaline phosphatase activity.
AB  == alkaline phosphatase (alpase) activity was quantitatively compared in various kinds of oral bacteria. high alpase activity was detected in 3 species of periodontal bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga sputigena. the alpase activity detected in these bacteria was almost completely inhibited in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds). by contrast, the activity of mammalian alpase isoenzymes was not inhibited at all even in the presence of 1% sds. these results indicate that the alpase assay in combination with 1% sds can identify the origin of alpase detected in gingival crevicular fluid as being from bacteria or from a host response. clinical examination with adult periodontitis revealed that alpase activity in gingival crevicular fluid from the patients consisted of a combination of sds-sensitive and sds-resistant activities. these findings indicate that alpase activity detected in gingival crevicular fluid originates not only from bacteria but also  from a host response.

TI  == modeling the relationship between clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters and alveolar bone levels in an elderly population.
AB  == a cross-sectional periodontal study of 74 subjects aged 65 to 75 years was performed. clinical data were collected and related to microbiological and immunological data. a statistical model (step-wise multiple regression) of factors related to bone loss was created initially using clinical data only; then by adding either the microbiologic or immunologic data; and then by using clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic data together. when only clinical data were considered, three factors were found to have significant positive correlations with bone loss. tooth mobility accounted for 17% of the variability  in the alveolar bone level measurements, probing depth for 12%(r2), and plaque index for 3%, for a total of 32% of the variability explained by these clinical factors. tooth mobility and probing depth were clinical factors which remained significant in the model when the microbiological data were also considered. as percentages of the total cultivable microbiota, e. corrodens (r2 = 14%) and black-pigmenting prevotella intermedia (r2 = 4%) correlated positively with alveolar bone loss. the addition of the microbiologic data only increased the r2  to 33%. when immunological data were considered with the clinical data, pocket depth and tooth mobility were the clinical parameters which remained in the model. igg antibody levels to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 24%) a. actinomycetemcomitans 627 (r2 = 2%) were the significant immunologic measures having a positive correlation with bone loss. anti-f. nucleatum levels had a significant negative correlation. a total of 50% of the variability in alveolar bone level was accounted for in the model by the addition of specific serum antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms. when clinical, microbiological, and immunological measurements were all considered together, antibody to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 42%), percentage of b-lymphocytes  (r2 = 3%), probing depth (r2 = 4%), anti-e. corrodens levels (r2 = 2%), and anti-p. gingivalis 33277 levels (r2 = 4%) all had significant positive correlation with loss of alveolar bone. the number of enteric bacteria, anti-f. nucleatum levels, and anti-p. intermedia levels each had a significant negative correlation with alveolar bone heights. the r2 for this model was 75%. these results indicated that antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms and tooth mobility were the best predictors of bone loss in the elderly patients tested in this study.

TI  == detection of porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival exudate by a dipeptide-enhanced trypsin-like activity.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque is an important risk factor for future periodontal attachment loss in susceptible adults. the elimination of p. gingivalis is usually concomitant with a healing process. therefore, it should be valuable to have an easy chairside method to follow the effect of periodontal treatment on p. gingivalis detection as well as on its eventual reappearance during the maintenance period. we have previously reported the stimulation of amidolytic activity of p. gingivalis by the addition of glycyl-glycine to the assay buffer. in this study we determined the proportions of p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga spp, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens by cultivation technique and the amidolytic activity, using n-benzoyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (bapna) as substrate, in gingival exudate before and during a 3-year treatment and maintenance period. p. gingivalis was the only species yielding a high and persistent correlation to stimulated amidolytic activity (p values < or = 0.0001) on both site (r = 0.5) and subject (r = 0.8) level. testing pure cultures of suggested periodontal pathogens for effect of glycyl-glycine on amidolytic activity, we found that of p. gingivalis to be 5.9-fold increased. the amidolytic activity of treponema denticola was only slightly stimulated (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 1.2) and that of capnocytophaga slightly inhibited (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 0.8). the  outcome of this study has the potential to be used for the development of a simple, rapid, and inexpensive assay for a qualitative and quantitative determination of p. gingivalis in gingival crevicular fluid.

TI  == hla-d and t lymphocyte reactivity to specific periodontal pathogens in type 1 diabetic periodontitis.
AB  == bacterial antigen fragments complexed with class ii major histocompatibility molecules (hla-d) on antigen presenting cells (apcs) stimulate cd4+ t lymphocyte  proliferation, presumably to protect the host. this study examined these responses to antigens of two periodontal pathogens in four groups (n = 15) of age- (young adult) and sex-matched caucasian subjects with or without type 1 diabetes and moderate to severe periodontitis: group dp = diabetics with periodontitis; group dnp = diabetics without periodontitis; group ndp = nondiabetics with periodontitis; and group ndnp = nondiabetics without periodontitis. hla-d phenotypes for each subject were determined by lymphocytotoxicity assays. t lymphocytes purified from peripheral blood were stimulated in cell culture with apc pulsed with various concentrations of tetanus toxoid, porphyromonas gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sputigena antigens. t lymphocyte reactivity (3h thymidine incorporation) was numerically lower in cultures from diabetics stimulated with unpulsed apc (not significant), and antigen-pulsed cultures showed low proliferation and no significant differences among groups. stimulation indices in cultures from diabetic patients stimulated with p. gingivalis or c. sputigena, however, were significantly elevated at all antigen concentrations compared to nondiabetic cultures. the occurrence of hla-dr4 was moderately associated with diabetes (p < 0.05) and highly associated  with periodontitis (p < 0.001, log-linear model for categorical variables); and hla-dr53 and hla-dq3 were significantly associated with periodontitis (p < or = 0.02). hla-dr was crucial to lymphocyte stimulation (anti-hla-dr blocking experiments), but the low peripheral blood t cell reactivity to antigens of periodontal pathogens could not be linked with hla-d type or periodontitis susceptibility.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == a longitudinal microbiological study on osseointegrated titanium implants in partially edentulous patients.
AB  == the aim was to longitudinally follow the colonization of putative periodontal pathogens on titanium implants in partially edentulous patients. nineteen individuals, who were partially edentulous and were on the waiting-list to be treated with titanium fixtures, were included in the study. they were treated for periodontal disease with oral hygiene instructions and supra- and subgingival debridement and were left for maintenance. full-mouth recordings of each patient  were performed at baseline, including attachment level and probing pocket depth.  bleeding was provoked and visible plaque were registered. subgingival samples were taken for examination of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. bridge connection was completed 1 month after abutment connection. the bone level was registered on radiographs. the patients were followed with clinical registrations and subgingival samples at 6,  12, 24 and 36 months. no significant changes in pocket depth, attachment level, bleeding on probing or plaque score occurred during the experimental period. the  number of individuals positive at teeth and abutments for the various bacterial species reached approximately similar levels at 6 months. no significant changes  over time were seen. comparison between bone height, seen on radiographs, at abutments after 2, 12 and 36 months gave only 3 sites with bone loss of > 0.5 mm. all these sites were found in one patient and were accompanied by p. intermedia.

TI  == detection of porphyromonas gingivalis in oral plaque samples by use of the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == periodontitis is believed to be caused by bacteria which inhabit periodontal pockets. the identification of these periodontal pathogens by currently available methods requires considerable time and expertise. in this study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay that is quick, relatively simple, and can detect low numbers of a putative periodontal pathogen. primers specific for the fimbrial gene of porphyromonas gingivalis were selected from the published sequence and used for amplification of a 131-basepair sequence of genomic dna. the pcr detected as few as 100 p. gingivalis cells obtained from pure cultures. three other bacteria (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and capnocytophaga gingivalis) that are also putative periodontal pathogens yielded no pcr product at any of the cell concentrations used. this assay was also used for detection of p. gingivalis in subgingival plaque. five of 13 subgingival bacterial plaque samples obtained from four advanced adult periodontitis patients and two samples from a prepubescent child with advanced periodontitis contained p. gingivalis. the protocol developed is relatively simple and can be completed within four hours of the time of sample acquisition.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of acacia gum was assessed using fresh isolates and reference strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. a fine aqueous suspension of gum was produced by sonication and then a soluble fraction  isolated by centrifugation and membrane filtration. these preparations were incorporated into columbia agar at doubling concentrations. growth of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia cultures on the agar was inhibited by whole gum sonicate at concentrations of 0.5-1.0% w/v. both species showed reduced susceptibility when horse blood was present in the agar. the gum soluble fraction did not inhibit growth of any bacterial culture. the effect of acacia on bacterial proteases was examined with cell sonicates from log phase broth cultures. enzyme activities were determined by fluorimetric assay with various synthetic peptide substrates. most protease activities reduced in the presence of 0.5% w/v gum sonicate, with the trypsin-like activities of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia proving most sensitive. the gum soluble fraction was nearly always less inhibitory than the sonicate. the action of acacia gum against suspected periodontal pathogens and their enzymes suggests that it may be of clinical value.

TI  == microbial composition and pattern of antibiotic resistance in subgingival microbial samples from patients with refractory periodontitis.
AB  == a series of 993 subgingival microbial samples sent to a diagnostic microbiology laboratory included 196 samples that could be identified as compatible with a clinical diagnosis of refractory or recurrent periodontitis. in descending order  of prevalence the associated microbiota included bacteroides forsythus (84%), spirochetes (83%), motile rods (76%), fusobacterium species (68%), porphyromonas  gingivalis (63%), campylobacter rectus (47%), capnocytophaga species (38%), prevotella intermedia (23%), peptostreptococcus micros (18%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (16%), candida (14%), enteric rods (9%), staphylococcus species, not including aureus (5.6%). eikenella corrodens (3%), staphylococcus aureus (1.5%), and enterococcus species (< 1%). antibiotic resistance to tetracycline, penicillin g, or metronidazole was particularly noticeable for enteric rods, fusobacterium species, capnocytophaga species, staphylococcus, and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. it was largely absent for campylobacter rectus. no antibiotic sensitivity data were obtained for porphyromonas gingivalis or bacteroides forsythus, as these species were detected by immunofluorescence. the results indicate that a substantial number of microorganisms associated with  refractory periodontitis are variably resistant to commonly-used antibiotics. diagnostic microbiology must be considered an essential adjunct to the therapist  faced with periodontal lesions refractory to conventional treatment.

TI  == microbiota associated with residual clefts and neighboring teeth in patients with cleft lip, alveolus, and palate.
AB  == twenty patients with residual clefts or pronounced soft tissue grooves, treated for uni- or bilateral cleft lip, alveolus, and palate were included in this study. ten patients were recalled for dental prophylaxis at regular intervals, 10 patients were not. one microbiologic sample was obtained from the cleft area and  two samples from a tooth adjacent to the cleft (sites adjacent and distant to the cleft). between the recall and the nonrecall group there were notable differences in the presence of anaerobic gram-negative organisms. fusobacterium spp., prevotella melaninogenica, and p. intermedia were more often found in nonrecall patients. while rarely seen in recall patients, spirochetes and motile rods were  a common feature of nonrecall patients. the putative periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were not detected in either group. the differences between the recall and the nonrecall groups were more pronounced when the respective samples from teeth were related to each other than when the samples obtained from the clefts were compared. the cleft flora was less complex irrespective of how good maintenance was and resembled the flora of teeth of well-maintained patients. samples from clefts were never wolinella positive, and harbored significantly less capnocytophaga and actinomyces viscosus than samples from dental sites.

TI  == role of porphyromonas gingivalis 40-kda outer membrane protein in the aggregation of p. gingivalis vesicles and actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, an important pathogen in periodontitis, produces extracellular vesicles that aggregate with actinomyces viscosus cells. a 40-kda outer membrane protein (omp)-coding gene from p. gingivalis was cloned and the protein was found to be localized in these vesicles. the recombinant 40-kda omp did not show aggregation activity. however, affinity-purified antibody against the recombinant protein significantly inhibited aggregation of p. gingivalis vesicles with a. viscosus cells. the antibody also inhibited cellular coaggregation of several strains of p. gingivalis with a. viscosus cells, but not with other periodontal pathogens. moreover, aggregation of a. viscosus cells with p. gingivalis vesicles was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pre-treatment  of the a. viscosus cells with the recombinant protein. these findings suggest that the 40-kda omp may be an important aggregation factor of p. gingivalis.

TI  == putative periodontal pathogens on titanium implants and teeth in experimental gingivitis and periodontitis in beagle dogs.
AB  == the microflora around titanium implants and teeth in 4 beagle dogs was analyzed in order to follow the longitudinal development from healthy conditions to experimental gingivitis and periodontitis. a 2-month plaque control program was performed to establish healthy conditions on titanium implants and control teeth  (baseline, day 0). subgingival bacterial samples and radiographs were obtained. the plaque control was ceased and all measurements were repeated on day 21 (gingivitis). a new period of plaque control was initiated to re-establish healthy conditions (day 49). a cotton ligature was placed subgingivally around the implants and the control teeth to induce tissue breakdown. the ligatures were removed on day 91. the study was completed with registrations on day 121 (periodontitis). no significant microbiological difference was found between titanium implants and teeth in healthy conditions and in gingivitis and periodontitis. the mean total viable count increased 10 times on implants as well as on teeth. streptococci were dominating at baseline: 40.2% on implants and 60.6% on teeth and decreased in gingivitis to 11.7% and 5.4%. when periodontitis  had developed, the proportion of streptococci was < 1%. at baseline few porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were detected. they increased  at gingivitis to 37.4% and 21.0%; when periodontitis developed, they comprised about 25.0%. microbial colonization and establishment on titanium implants with healthy gingiva, experimental gingivitis and periodontitis follow the same pattern as on teeth.

TI  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga and porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque of adolescents with down's syndrome.
AB  == levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga and porphyromonas  gingivalis were determined in subgingival plaque samples from 37 adolescents with down's syndrome and 37 healthy controls matched with respect to age and sex. gingival inflammation, supra- and subgingival calculus, periodontal pockets ( > 4 mm) and alveolar bone loss were registered. alveolar bone loss was more frequent  in down's syndrome subjects (32%) than in the controls (3%). a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in the subgingival plaque in 35% of the down's syndrome adolescents and in 5% of the controls. on site level, a. actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga were more frequent in the subgingival plaque samples of down's syndrome children than in those of controls. comparing down's syndrome subjects positive or negative for a. actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga, no significant differences were found in terms of gingival inflammation, periodontal pockets ( > 4 mm) or number of sites with alveolar bone loss. the results indicate an altered microbial composition of the subgingival plaque of down's syndrome subjects compared with healthy controls, with higher frequency of a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == immunoglobulins in milk from cows immunized with oral strains of actinomyces, prevotella, porphyromonas, and fusobacterium.
AB  == immunization of pregnant cows with bacteria leads to the presence of high concentrations of specific antibodies in colostrum and milk. a total of 14 cows was immunized with single strains of heat-killed oral bacteria or pools of strains of actinomyces, porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium. two cows were treated with adjuvant alone. the mean percentages of igg1, igg2, igm, and iga in all of the milks were 83.8, 3.8, 9.3, and 3.1, respectively. elisa and whole cell agglutination assays demonstrated high titers in the milks from the cows immunized with either individual strains or the bacterial pools. the highest titers determined by elisa belonged to the igg1 isotype and in several milks were 64-fold greater than titers in milk from cows treated with adjuvant alone. the concentrations of all antibodies and the titers determined by elisa and whole cell agglutination assays markedly decreased from the first to the sixth milkings. the functional specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by agglutination tests against a wide range of bacteria including members of actinomyces, fusobacterium, porphyromonas, prevotella, streptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides, actinobacillus,  haemophilus, capnocytophaga, and wolinella. minimal cross-reactions with bacteria in other genera were observed with all of the milks. high-titer milk preparations have been obtained from immunized cows, and the capacity of the bovine antibodies to agglutinate target bacteria indicates their potential usefulness in oral passive immunization studies.

TI  == e-test: a new technique for antimicrobial susceptibility testing for periodontal  microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to validate the epsilometer test (e-test) method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of selected periodontopathic microorganisms  using the agar dilution method as a standard. the e-test has been developed to provide a direct quantification of antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms. the device consists of a predefined, continuous, and exponential  gradient of antibiotic concentrations immobilized along a rectangular plastic test strip. after 48 hours incubation a drop-shaped inhibition zone intersects the graded test strip at the inhibitory concentration (ic) of the antibiotic. twenty-two subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites were plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% rabbit blood or 5% sheep blood and trypticase soy agar supplemented with vancomycin and bacitracin. a total of 60 strains of key periodontal pathogens (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga) isolated from 22 sites of 12 patients were studied. the antibiotics tested were clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and ampicillin at concentrations above and below the achieved blood or gingival crevicular fluid levels. as a standard reference the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the  agar dilution method. mics were compared with ics determined using the e-test method. the results showed an agreement ranging from 67% to 100%; sensitivity ranging from 75% to 100%; predictability ranging from 56% to 100% and specificity ranging from 33% to 96%. the e-test ics for ampicillin, cefoxitin, and metronidazole against the gram-negative capnophilic and microaerophilic rods and  the black-pigmented anaerobic rods ics for ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline showed a high percentage of agreement with the agar dilution mics.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == subgingival temperature (iii). relation to microbial counts.
AB  == the present investigation examined the relationship of selected bacterial species and subgingival temperature. 35 subjects were measured at 6 sites per tooth for clinical parameters and subgingival temperature. measurements were repeated for 21 subjects at 2 month intervals providing a total of 66 subjects visits. at each visit, subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non-selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species  detected using digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. species enumerated were; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes a and b, b. forsythus, b. gingivalis, b. intermedius i and ii, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, p.  micros, s. intermedius, s. sanguis i and ii, v. parvula and w. recta. total viable counts and counts of capnocytophaga sp. were determined directly from the  primary isolation plates. a total of 1581 samples were evaluated. subject visits  with higher mean subgingival temperatures had significantly higher mean %s of b.  intermedius i and p. micros, and lower mean %s of capnocytophaga sp. sites with higher subgingival temperatures had elevated proportions of b. intermedius i and  ii, a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a and b. gingivalis more frequently than sites with lower temperatures, while capnocytophaga sp. were elevated more often  at cooler sites. 43 of the subject visits had follow up attachment level measurements at 2 months. the 1026 microbial samples and the subgingival temperature measurements from these visits were related to longitudinal attachment change.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == early effects of periodontal therapy on the detection frequency of four putative  periodontal pathogens in adults.
AB  == this study aimed to examine early posttreatment changes in the periodontal microflora. paper point sampling and conventional bacterial cultivation were used to monitor the effects of surgical and non-surgical periodontal therapy on the detection frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and capnocytophaga species in deep periodontal pockets. ten patients, 5 men and 5 women (mean age 44 years), with advanced periodontal disease were selected from the dental school patient population for the study. a total of 245 teeth in 10 defined areas of the dentition were treated by oral hygiene instruction followed by scaling and root planing alone (121 sites) or with surgical interventions (124 sites). ninety sites, 47 surgical and 43 non-surgical, with initial pocket depth greater than or equal to 6 mm were sampled at baseline and 3 months after completion of therapy.  treatment by both procedures resulted in significant clinical improvements as assessed by all clinical parameters used. baseline results may indicate that the  level of p. gingivalis was reduced in the presence of p. intermedia, while a. actinomycetemcomitans seemed to be reduced in the presence of p. gingivalis and/or p. intermedia. three months after therapy, the detection frequency of p. gingivalis was significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) in surgical and non-surgical sites while the reduction for p. intermedia was significant only for surgical sites (p less than 0.05).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == immunoglobulin-degrading enzymes in localized juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == previous reports have indicated the association of periodontal diseases with elevated levels of serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies to periodontally relevant bacteria. recent results from this laboratory suggest that enzymes proteolytic for immunoglobulins are important virulence factors of several periodontal bacteria. specifically, enzymes from porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis culture supernatant fluid (sf) cleaved human igg (4 subclasses), iga1  and iga2, igm, igd and ige. proteolytic enzymes from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans culture sf cleaved igg, iga and igm. an enriched ig proteolytic preparation from capnocytophaga ochracea culture sf was shown to extensively cleave all 4 subclasses of human igg. extensive degradation of igg and iga in crevicular fluid samples on sds-page from periodontal disease sites of localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients in comparison to little degradation in healthy sites indicated the potential role the proteolytic enzymes from periodontopathogenic bacteria may play in situ. treatment of igg with p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. ochracea sf resulted in similar patterns of degradation. ljp patients had significantly higher levels of igg and  iga proteolytic activity in whole saliva than age-, sex-, and race-matched periodontal disease-free controls. however, not all of the proteolytic activity could be ascribed to bacterial proteases since neutrophils are also present in large numbers at diseased sites. using similar techniques, lysates of neutrophils from healthy controls cleaved igg, iga and igm. the observation of enhanced ig cleavage activity in crevicular fluid and saliva in ljp patients suggest a role for ig proteolytic enzymes in ljp.

TI  == inactivation of human serum bactericidal activity by a trypsinlike protease isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == a protease was isolated from an outer membrane vesicle preparation of porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and assessed for its ability to inactivate the bactericidal activity of normal human serum. the enzyme, which was activated  by reducing agents, was found to be a trypsinlike protease with a molecular mass  of approximately 80 kda. prior to being tested in the bactericidal assay, pooled  human serum was preincubated with the partially purified enzyme. under conditions in which the trypsinlike protease was activated, a strong reduction of the serum  bactericidal activity against capnocytophaga ochracea was noted. on the other hand, no reduction of the bactericidal action of serum was observed when the serum-protease mixture was preincubated in the presence of an inhibitor of the enzyme. as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the protease was shown to degrade immunoglobulins g and m as well as complement factor c3. this study confirms the previous hypothesis that the proteases of p. gingivalis can interfere with the protective action of human  serum.

TI  == microbial etiology of periodontal diseases. where are we? where are we going?
AB  == many studies indicate a strong association of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans with localized juvenile periodontitis. species associated with adult periodontitis include bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and wolinella recta. capnocytophaga species may be important in pubertal gingivitis. an unnamed spirochete related to treponema pallidum has been identified in acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis lesions. species isolated from prepubertal periodontitis, peri-implantitis, pericoronitis, and human immunodeficiency virus gingivitis and  periodontitis are similar to those isolated from periodontal and gingival infections. species identification in combination with clinical characteristics facilitates periodontal diagnosis. dna probes, immunoassays, and benzoyl-arginine naphthylamide reactivity methods can be used to indicate putative pathogens in plaque samples. microbial identification aids in antibiotic selection and planning a treatment regimen.

TI  == a sensitive enzymatic method (sk-013) for detection of treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivals and bacteroides forsythus in subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == an enzymatic method, sk-013, was developed for rapid detection of the peptidase activity in subgingival plaque samples. this method was found to have specificity for porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, and some capnocytophaga strains. the purpose of this study was to determine whether sk-013 could indicate the presence of periodontopathic bacteria, including t. denticola, p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, which produce trypsin-like enzymes. subgingival plaque samples were taken from 10 clinically healthy sites and 30 periodontally diseased sites with 3 paper points. sk-013 activity of plaque samples was assayed, and the numbers of t. denticola, p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in the sample were counted by immunofluorescence technique. in diseased sites, the sk-013 activity was significantly correlated with clinical parameters  such as gingival index, plaque index, probing depth and bleeding on probing. a significant correlation was found between the presence of these organisms and sk-013 activity. correlation coefficients between the presence of t. denticola and sk-013 activity were higher than those with other organisms. these findings indicate that the sk-013 is useful as an indicator of cell population of t. denticola, p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in subgingival plaque.

TI  == a sensitive enzymatic method (sk-013) for detection and quantification of specific periodontopathogens.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola have been found to predominate in periodontal pockets of patients with adult periodontitis. these microorganisms hydrolyze the synthetic peptide n-benzoyl-dl-arginine-2-naphthylamide (bana). in this study, we developed an enzymatic method, designated sk-013, to detect the existence of these microorganisms in subgingival plaque bacteria. this enzymatic method was based on the observation of the hydrolysis of n-carbobenzoxy-glycyl-glycyl-arginyl-3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyaniline (n-cbz-gly-gly-arg-dbha) and made more sensitive by adding an enhancing system. the sk-013 was specifically positive for p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, t. denticola, and some strains of capnocytophaga species, but was not specific for any of the other bacterial strains tested. this sk-013 system may be valuable for detection and quantification of periodontal disease-associated bacteria in subgingival plaque and thus for diagnosis of periodontal infections.

"no other bacterial group discriminated significantly between test and control sites or between diseased and non-diseased subjects. the surprisingly high occurrence of p. gingivalis in non-diseased subjects, both subgingivally and on tongue, indicates that deep periodontal pockets are not prerequisite ecological environments for p. gingivalis establishment.

TI  == use of synthetic oligonucleotide dna probes for the identification of different strains of fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the ability of three different oligonucleotide probes to identify different oral  strains of fusobacterium nucleatum was tested. probes 119 and 214 were designed on the basis of known amino acid sequences from the n-terminal end of an outer membrane protein of f. nucleatum strain fev1. probe h 2.1, was a randomly cloned  chromosomal dna fragment of 2.1 kbp. the specificities of the probes were examined by testing each of them against a panel of five other species of fusobacterium (six strains), oral and non-oral, and also against seven different  oral species of six other genera. the chromosomal dna of the bacteria to be examined was digested to completion using the restriction enzymes hincii, hindiii, ecori, ecorv and sau3ai. digests were run on agarose gels and subjected  to southern blotting before being hybridized with the probe in question. the results were confirmed by running a slot blot of genomic dna from all of the 19 strains and hybridizing with a probe h 2.1. probe h 2.1 turned out to be the most specific and useful of the three probes investigated. by use of this probe, interstrain identification of the six different strains of f. nucleatum could be  performed and the strains could be distinguished from other oral species found in the oral cavity, such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, eikenella corrodens and leptotrichia buccalis. the probe reacted weakly with other non-oral species of the genus fusobacterium, and there was no problem in distinguishing between the different strains.

AB  == the present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of porphyromonas gingivalis outer membrane vesicles on the bactericidal activity of human serum. human serum was pretreated with extracellular vesicles and then incubated with a  cell suspension of capnocytophaga ochracea. after 2 h at 37 degrees c, the percent viability of c. ochracea was determined by cultivation on blood agar plates. at a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml, outer membrane vesicles completely inhibited the serum bactericidal activity against c. ochracea. boiling the vesicles prevented this inhibition. however, partial inhibition of the serum lethal action was obtained when a higher concentration (1.5 mg/ml) of boiled vesicles was used, which indicates the involvement of both heat-labile and heat-stable components associated with vesicles. combining vesicles at a suboptimal concentration (0.1 mg/ml) with a reducing agent brought back inhibition of the bactericidal activity, whereas combining vesicles at an optimal concentration (0.3 mg/ml) with a thiol-blocking reagent caused a restoration of the bactericidal activity. when a purified preparation of p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharides was used instead of vesicles, inhibition of the bactericidal  activity was also observed. these results indicate that the lipopolysaccharides and the proteolytic enzyme(s) associated with p. gingivalis outer membrane vesicles are likely to represent the heat-stable and the heat-labile components,  respectively. it is possible that outer membrane vesicles released by p. gingivalis protect other bacterial species from complement action, thus favoring  the pathogenic process of periodontal disease.

TI  == isolation and purification of bacteriocin from prevotella intermedia (bacteroides intermedius).
AB  == thirty-three out of 46 strains of prevotella intermedia (bacteroides intermedius) isolated from gingival deposits of patients with adult periodontitis possessed the ability to inhibit growth of p. intermedia strain atcc 25611, and 6 of the 33 showed strong inhibitory activity. thirteen isolates did not have the ability to  inhibit the growth of p. intermedia strain atcc 25611. an inhibition factor from  one of the isolates, p. intermedia th14 which had strong inhibition, was purified and characterized. bacteriocin th14 activity was effective against only p. intermedia atcc 25611 and fusobacterium nucleatum, but not against other crevicular bacteria, including p. intermedia atcc 33563, porphyromonas gingivalis (bacteroides gingivalis), capnocytophaga sputigena and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. streptococci, actinomyces, and veillonellas were not inhibited by bacteriocin th14. bacteriocin th14 was heat sensitive, proteinaceous with molecular weight of 1,700 daltons and inhibited the growth of strain atcc 25611 in 15 minutes. the growth inhibition of p. intermedia atcc 25611 by bacteriocin th14 was found to be due to the bactericidal activity of the bacteriocin.

TI  == incidence of periodontitis recurrence in treated patients with and without cultivable actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas gingivalis: a prospective study.
AB  == a total of 98 adults previously treated for moderate to advanced periodontitis and on a trimonthly recall schedule were screened for the presence of critical levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, and porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis. patients with at least 2  positive sites were placed in a positive group and patients without or with low levels of these bacteria in a negative group. during the 30-month study the incidence of disease recurrence was greater in the positive group, but did not reach statistical significance. positive patients with deeper pockets tended to be at greater risk of developing recurrent disease than those with shallower pockets. in the positive group only, both a. actinomycetemcomitans recovery and antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans strain nctc 9710 (serotype c) were inversely correlated with disease recurrence. the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. intermedia above critical levels did not reliably predict future episodes of disease recurrence in this population. the sparse recovery of p. gingivalis did not permit us to assess its diagnostic value. with  the exception of p. gingivalis, for which insufficient data were available, the results indicate that the presence or absence of the above bacterial species cannot of itself serve as a reliable predictor of future episodes of recurrent disease in a population of treated patients on a regular trimonthly recall schedule.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == microbiological and immunological aspects of experimental periodontal disease in  rats: a review article.
AB  == animal models in which microbiological and immunological aspects of periodontal disease can be studied prospectively seem well warranted. the rat bears much resemblance to man with respect to periodontal anatomy, development and composition of dental plaque, histopathology of periodontal lesions, and basic immunobiology. furthermore, reproducible methods are available for assessment of  periodontal disease in rats, and detectable periodontal destruction can be induced in a few weeks in these animals without traumatizing periodontal tissues  with ligatures. experimental periodontitis studies in germ-free rats have confirmed the pathogenicity of several suspected periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum). the studies also suggest that the number of periodontal pathogens may be higher than generally believed, since species like streptococcus sobrinus and actinomyces viscosus are  associated with periodontal bone loss in rats. studies in rats with congenital or induced immune defects indicate that generalized or selective immunosuppression at the time of infection with periodontal pathogens may aggravate periodontal disease. studies in immunized rats indicate that periodontal disease can be prevented by immunization against periodontal pathogens. however, it is also possible by immunization to induce periodontal destruction; i.e., the immune system has a destructive potential which should not be overlooked. in the future, the rat model may prove valuable for initial screening of antigen preparations and immunization regimens in the search for a periodontitis vaccine.

TI  == development of a diagnostic test for anaerobic periodontal infections based on plaque hydrolysis of benzoyl-dl-arginine-naphthylamide.
AB  == treponema denticola, porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus are among the anaerobic species frequently associated with adult forms  of periodontal disease. these organisms hydrolyze the synthetic peptide benzoyl-dl-arginine-naphthylamide (bana), and such enzyme activity can be detected in the plaque and related to clinical disease and the presence of spirochetes. in this investigation, the liquid bana assay was compared with a commercially developed bana assay which employed a paper format and which could be read after a 15-min incubation. in the paper format, strips of a whatman filter paper were impregnated with bana and strips of nitrocellulose paper were impregnated with fast black k salt. both strips were applied lengthwise across a  paper card (3 by 5 in. [7.6 by 12.7 cm]). the bana strip at the bottom was inoculated with the test sample (pure culture, plaque), folded back so that it contacted the fast black strip, and then incubated for 15 min at 55 degrees c. t. denticola, p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus always gave a positive reaction, whereas 51 other plaque species were always negative. six bacteroides and capnocytophaga species on occasion had weak reactions. the proportional agreement between bana positiveness and clinical disease was similar for both the liquid and the paper assays. the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy relative to the  clinical standard of the liquid assay were 74, 76, and 77%, respectively, while those of the paper assay were 81, 78, and 80%, respectively. the paper assay was  significantly associated with the presence of either t. denticola or p. gingivalis or both in the plaque samples, with a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 53%, and an accuracy of 79%. these findings indicate that a rapid  paper assay for bana hydrolysis gives data comparable to those obtained with the  liquid bana assay.

TI  == sialidase (neuraminidase) activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic  bacteria.
AB  == a filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. a total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the bacteroides fragilis group,  98% of 66 b. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): b. capillosus, 4; b. levii, 2; b. denticola, 22; b. loescheii, 23; b. melaninogenicus, 32; b. forsythus, 44; and b. buccalis,  2. however, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 b. buccae isolates,  79% of 14 b. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 b. oralis isolates. sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of b. gracilis, 12 isolates of b. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of b. intermedius, or 26 isolates of b. corporis. porphyromonas (bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and p. endodontalis (8  isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of p. gingivalis were sialidase positive. sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of  10 isolates of capnocytophaga ochracea of c. sputigena but not in any of 4 c. gingivalis isolates. other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; wolinella recta, 19 isolates; eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. these data demonstrate sialidase activity in  several species of the genera bacteroides and porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.

TI  == microbiology of subgingival plaque from children with localized prepubertal periodontitis.
AB  == localized prepubertal periodontitis has been described as a host-defect mediated  form of bacterially induced periodontitis, with an early onset and rapid progression around a few teeth in children prior to puberty. to further our understanding of the etiology of this disease, we have examined the microbiological components of subgingival dental plaque in 9 children with localized prepubertal periodontitis to determine if patterns of putative pathogens existed, and have compared these results with those obtained from 4 children with no periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples were plated onto a selective medium for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and onto a non-selective medium for anaerobes, and the predominant cultivable microbiota of  2 sites per child was determined. the subgingival microbiota of children with localized prepubertal periodontitis clearly differs from non-diseased children in the detection of high levels of several suspected pathogens, including a. actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga sputigena. these putative pathogens were found in various combinations. these findings suggest that localized prepubertal periodontitis is  associated with specific subgingival bacteria which are generally not found in children without periodontitis.

TI  == suspected periodontopathic microorganisms and their oral habitats in young children.
AB  == samples of subgingival plaque from 67 children, 5-7 years of age, were examined for the presence of certain suspected periodontal pathogenic species using the conventional technique of anaerobic sonification, dilution and spiral plating. when this technique was compared with a direct plating procedure which involved no preliminary dispersion and dilution of plaque specimens, it was found that the direct method resulted in double the frequency of children in whom black-pigmented bacteroides (bpb) were detected and a 10-times increase in the number of subjects harbouring actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. samples from  the tongue, tonsils and saliva were also plated using the direct technique. bpb were detected less commonly in the plaque specimens (61.3% of children) than in saliva (89.5%), or on the tongue (86.6%) and tonsils (97.1%). expressed as percentages of a pooled sample of the total bpb population, the most frequently detected species in plaque were bacteroides intermedius (44.4%) and bacteroides melaninogenicus (48.0%). the most prevalent isolate in all other oral sites was b. melaninogenicus. expressed as percentages of children in whom bpb were detected, the most frequently isolated species from plaque using the conventional dilution technique was b. intermedius (21.3%), whereas other bpb species were present in fewer than 5% of children. fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga  species were isolated most frequently from plaque but were also commonly detected in the various other oral sites.
