TI  == microbial community in persistent apical periodontitis: a 16s rrna gene clone library analysis.
AB  == aim: to characterize the microbial composition of persistent periapical lesions of root filled teeth using a molecular genetics approach. methodology: apical lesion samples were collected from 12 patients (23-80 years old) who visited the  kyushu university hospital for apicectomy with persistent periapical lesions associated with root filled teeth. dna was directly extracted from each sample and the microbial composition was comprehensively analysed using clone library analysis of the 16s rrna gene. enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans and specific fima genotypes of porphyromonas gingivalis were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis with specific primers. results: bacteria were detected in all samples, and the dominant findings were p. gingivalis (19.9%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.2%) and propionibacterium acnes (9%). bacterial diversity was greater in symptomatic lesions than in asymptomatic ones. in addition, the following bacteria or bacterial combinations were characteristic to symptomatic lesions: prevotella spp., treponema spp., peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113, olsenella uli, slackia exigua, selemonas infelix, p. gingivalis with type iv fima, and a combination of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113 and predominance of streptococcus spp. on the other hand, neither enterococcus faecalis nor c. albicans were detected in any of the samples. conclusion: whilst a diverse bacterial species were observed in the  persistent apical lesions, some characteristic patterns of bacterial community were found in the symptomatic lesions. the diverse variation of community indicates that bacterial combinations as a community may cause persistent inflammation in periapical tissues rather than specific bacterial species.

TI  == analysis of bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis using obligate anaerobic culture technique and 16s rdna gene sequence.
AB  == purpose: to analyze and characterize the predominant bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis by using culture techniques under obligate anaerobic conditions and 16s rdna gene sequences. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from 30 patients: control (n = 15), consisting of  patients with only healthy implants; and test (n = 15), consisting of patients with peri-implantitis. in both groups, subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from the deepest sites. an anaerobic glove box system was used to cultivate bacterial strains. the bacterial strains were identified by 16s rdna genebased polymerase chain reaction and comparison of the gene sequences. results: peri-implantitis sites had approximately 10-fold higher mean colony forming units (per milliliter) than healthy implant sites. a total of 69 different bacterial species were identified in the peri-implantitis sites and 53 in the healthy implant sites. the predominant bacterial species in the peri-implantitis sites were eubacterium nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, parascardovia denticolens, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, centipeda periodontii, and parvimonas micra. the predominant bacteria in healthy implant sites apart from streptococcus were pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, veillonella species, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces species, propionibacterium acnes, and parvimonas micra. conclusion: these results suggest that the environment in the depths of the sulcus showing peri-implantitis is well suited for growth of obligate anaerobic bacteria. the present study demonstrated that the sulcus around oral implants with peri-implantitis harbors high levels of asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods (aagprs) such as e. nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, and gram-negative anaerobic rods, suggesting that conventional periodontopathic bacteria are not the only periodontal pathogens active in peri-implantitis, and that aagprs may also play an important role.

TI  == advancement in the routine identification of anaerobic bacteria by maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
AB  == we evaluated matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) biotyper as a tool for the identification of anaerobic bacteria compared with 500 base-pair (bp) 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) gene sequencing analysis, which is considered to be the "gold standard" method. a total of 484 anaerobic bacteria were retrieved from the clinical specimens of 318 pediatric patients. molecular identification resulted in 18 genera and 51 species. the most prevalent genus was clostridium (76.85 %),  with 70 % c. difficile isolates. the concordance and sensitivity determined by maldi-tof ms for c. difficile, the most prevalent species isolated, was 94.08 %,  whereas the specificity was 100 %. for the other anaerobes, the sensitivity and specificity were 94.07 % and 81.82 %, respectively, with a concordance of 93.15 %. low performance was observed for propionibacterium acnes and fusobacterium nucleatum, for which a dedicated pretreatment procedure should likely be set up.  maldi-tof ms was shown to be a valid alternative for the fast and reliable identification of the most clinically relevant anaerobic bacteria; moreover, it is less time-consuming, the cost for reagents is minimized, and it does not require dedicated personnel.

TI  == comprehensive analysis of bacterial flora in postoperative maxillary cyst fluid by 16s rrna gene and culture methods.
AB  == intracystic fluid was aseptically collected from 11 patients with postoperative maxillary cyst (pomc), and dna was extracted from the pomc fluid. bacterial species were identified by sequencing after cloning of approximately 580 bp of the 16s rrna gene. identification of pathogenic bacteria was also performed by culture methods. the phylogenetic identity was determined by sequencing 517-596 bp in each of the 1139 16s rrna gene clones. a total of 1114 clones were classified while the remaining 25 clones were unclassified. a total of 103 bacterial species belonging to 42 genera were identified in pomc fluid samples by 16s rrna gene analysis. species of prevotella (91%), neisseria (73%), fusobacterium (73%), porphyromonas (73%), and propionibacterium (73%) were found  to be highly prevalent in all patients. streptococcus mitis (64%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (55%), propionibacterium acnes (55%), staphylococcus capitis (55%), and streptococcus salivarius (55%) were detected in more than 6 of the 11 patients. the results obtained by the culture method were different from those obtained by  16s rrna gene analysis, but both approaches may be necessary for the identification of pathogens, especially of bacteria that are difficult to detect  by culture methods, and the development of rational treatments for patients with  pomc.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in adult down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the subgingival microbiota in down syndrome and non-down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. material and methods: a total of 44 down syndrome, 66 non-down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. this involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within down syndrome and non-down syndrome subject groups were quantified using pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. results: down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than  non-down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). most microbial species were present in down  syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of selenomonas noxia, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis in down syndrome subjects  compared with non-down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of treponema socranskii in down syndrome subjects compared with non-down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of streptococcus constellatus in down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of t. socranskii than down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). higher subgingival proportions of s. constellatus, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, s. noxia  and prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42)  and higher proportions of actinomyces naeslundii ii and actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in down syndrome adults. conclusion: individuals with down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. these findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in down syndrome.

TI  == analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic primary root canal infections in adult norwegian patients.
AB  == introduction: this molecular study analyzed the microbiota of primary root canal  infections from adult norwegian patients. methods: samples were taken from the necrotic root canals of teeth with symptomatic (n = 13) or asymptomatic (n = 21)  apical periodontitis and chronic apical abscesses (n = 9). dna was extracted from samples, and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 50 candidate endodontic pathogens. results: bacterial dna was detected in all cases. in teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis, the most frequent taxa were dialister invisus  (71%), fusobacterium nucleatum (62%), and porphyromonas endodontalis (62%). in chronic apical abscesses, the most prevalent taxa were p. endodontalis (100%), d. invisus (89%), parvimonas micra (78%), and solobacterium moorei (78%). in teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis, the most prevalent taxa were d. invisus, p. endodontalis, s. moorei, propionibacterium acnes, and streptococcus species (all in 69%). none of the targeted taxa were significantly associated with either sinus tract or pain (p > .05), except for selenomonas sputigena, which was more frequently found in painful cases (p = .04). no taxa were found in significantly  higher levels in any conditions (p > .05). cluster analyses revealed bacterial groupings that differed between cases with and without pain. conclusions: although basically the same species were highly prevalent in the different conditions examined and none of the most prevalent taxa were positively associated with symptoms, results revealed that species formed different partnerships and associations in samples from teeth with or without pain. therefore, it is possible that more virulent multispecies communities can form as a result of overall bacterial combinations and give rise to acute inflammation.

TI  == isolation of a novel bacteriophage specific for the periodontal pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum is a periodontal pathogen that has been directly associated with the development and progression of periodontal disease, a widespread pathology that affects the support tissues of the tooth. we isolated a new bacteriophage (fnpphi02) that specifically infects this bacterium. transmission electron microscopy showed that the virion is composed of an icosahedral head and a segmented tail. the size of the phage genome was estimated to be approximately 59 kbp of double-stranded dna. the morphological features and the genetic characteristics suggest that fnpphi02 is part of the siphoviridae family. using one-step growth and adsorption experiments, the latent period, burst size, and adsorption rate were estimated to be 15 h, 100 infectious units per cell, and 7.5 x 10(-)(1)(0) ml min(-)(1), respectively. a small fragment of phage dna was cloned and sequenced, showing 93% nucleotide identity with the phage pa6 of propionibacterium acnes and amino acid identity with fragments of two proteins (gp3 and gp4) of this phage. to our knowledge, fnpphi02 is the first phage described to infect fusobacterium nucleatum and provides the base for future exploration of phages in the control of periodontal disease.

TI  == apical root canal microbiota as determined by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis of cryogenically ground root samples from teeth with apical periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: bacteria located in the apical root canal system potentially participate in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. detection and identification of apical bacteria can be compromised because of limitations in conventional sampling and identification procedures. this study identified several bacterial taxa in the apical and middle/coronal segments of primarily infected root canal system by using pulverized root segments and a culture-independent molecular method. methods: seventeen extracted teeth with attached apical periodontitis lesions were sectioned to obtain 2 root fragments (apical and middle/coronal segments). root fragments were cryogenically ground, and dna was extracted from samples. after multiple displacement amplification, dna from samples was used as template in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay targeting 28 bacterial taxa. results: bacterial dna was detected in all samples. the most prevalent taxa in the apical root canal system  were olsenella uli (76.5%), prevotella baroniae (71%), porphyromonas endodontalis (65%), fusobacterium nucleatum (53%), and tannerella forsythia (47%). o. uli, p.  endodontalis, and propionibacterium acnes were as frequently detected in apical samples as they were in middle/coronal samples. p. baroniae, t. forsythia, and f. nucleatum were found more frequently in the apical part of the canal as compared  with matched coronal segments. streptococcus species were more prevalent in middle/coronal samples. the median and mean of shared bacterial taxa between matched apical and middle/coronal segments were 27% and 41%, respectively. conclusions: several candidate endodontic pathogens were very prevalent in the apical root canal system. the apical microbiota was usually complex and differed  in species composition when compared with the microbiota of middle/coronal samples from the same tooth.

TI  == identification of bacteria enduring endodontic treatment procedures by a combined reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and reverse-capture checkerboard  approach.
AB  == introduction: this study identified the bacterial taxa enduring endodontic treatment procedures by using a combined 16s ribosomal rna-based reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization approach. methods: samples were taken from infected canals of 15 teeth with apical periodontitis before treatment (s1), after chemomechanical preparation with naocl as the irrigant (s2), and after interappointment medication with a calcium hydroxide paste (s3). bacterial presence was first screened by a dna-based single pcr assay. rna extracts were subjected to rt-pcr, and the resulting products were surveyed for the presence of 28 targeted taxa by using the checkerboard method. results: bacteria were found in all s1 samples. detectable levels of bacterial ribosomal rna, used as an indicator of viability, were observed in 60% of the cases after chemomechanical preparation and 53% after intracanal medication. the most prevalent taxa in s1 were olsenella uli (67%), pyramidobacter piscolens (60%), streptococcus species (53%), and bacteroidetes clone x083 (53%). streptococcus species (47%), fusobacterium nucleatum (40%), and o. uli (33%) prevailed in s2, whereas streptococcus species (47%), propionibacterium acnes (27%), and o. uli (27%) were the most frequent taxa in s3. conclusions: the present study with a combined molecular approach revealed that bacterial diversity was overall markedly reduced by treatment procedures. although bacterial taxa more frequently identified in post-treatment samples emerge as potential risk factors for persistent disease, this remains to be determined by longitudinal studies.

TI  == characterization of bacterial flora in persistent apical periodontitis lesions.
AB  == introduction: microorganisms are able to survive and induce persistent infection  in periapical tissues. the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of the microflora of persistent apical periodontitis lesions. methods: twenty apical lesion samples were obtained from 20 patients with chronic apical periodontitis by root end surgery and processed using aerobic or anaerobic culture techniques. all isolated strains were identified by 16s ribosomal dna sequence analysis. results: seventy-four strains were isolated, belonging to 31 bacterial species obtained from the 20 apical lesions that were isolated. the majority of the strains were facultative anaerobes (51.6%). propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and fusobacterium nucleatum were isolated from 16.2, 9.5, 6.8 and 5.4% of the samples, respectively. fifteen samples harboured more than one species. the predominant association was p. acnes, s. epidermidis and f. nucleatum. conclusion: the microbiota of persistent apical periodontitis lesions is composed by diverse types of microorganisms with biofilm-forming capacity, including p. acnes, s. epidermidis and f. nucleatum.

TI  == effects of er:yag laser irradiation on biofilm-forming bacteria associated with endodontic pathogens in vitro.
AB  == with the development of dental laser delivery systems that can enter into the root canals, it is possible to use er:yag lasers to remove the residual biofilm associated with infected root canals. we examined their effects against biofilms  made of actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, propionibacterium acnes, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, or prevotella nigrescens in vitro. after er:yag laser irradiation with energy densities ranging between 0.38-0.98 j/cm(2), the biofilm samples on hydroxyapatite disks were quantitatively and morphologically evaluated. the er:yag laser was effective against biofilms of 6 of the bacterial species examined, with the exception of those formed by l. casei. after irradiation, the  numbers of viable cells in the biofilms were significantly decreased, whereas atrophic changes in bacterial cells and reductions in biofilm cell density were seen morphologically. er: yag lasers might be suitable for clinical application as a suppressive and removal device of biofilms in endodontic treatments.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the effect of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on oral microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on the viability of some oral bacterial species. it also evaluated the ability of these bacteria to metabolize those substances. single-species biofilms of streptococcus gordonii, porphyromonas gingivalis, or fusobacterium nucleatum and dual-species biofilms of s. gordonii -- f. nucleatum and f. nucleatum -- p. gingivalis were grown on hydroxyapatite discs. seven species were studied as planktonic cells, including streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, and the species mentioned above. the viability of planktonic cells and biofilms was analyzed by susceptibility tests and time-kill assays, respectively, against different concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine. high-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations in the culture media after the assays. susceptibility tests and viability assays showed  that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine cannot reduce or stimulate bacterial growth. high-performance liquid chromatography results showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations were not altered after bacteria exposure. these findings indicate that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine, in the concentrations used, cannot affect significantly the growth of these oral bacterial strains. moreover, these species do not seem to metabolize these substances.

TI  == a microbiological profile of symptomatic teeth with primary endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections associated with symptomatic teeth. samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 symptomatic (n = 30) or asymptomatic (n = 30) single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in symptomatic cases were fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, veillonella parvula, treponema socranskii, enterococcus faecalis, and campylobacter gracilis  and in asymptomatic cases were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, e. faecalis, eubacterium saburreum, and neisseria mucosa. total bacterial counts and counts of tannerella forsythia were significant higher in symptomatic cases (p < 0.05), whereas levels of propionibacterium acnes were reduced in this group of teeth. the data of the present investigation suggested an association between higher total bacterial counts and levels of t. forsythia and the presence of pain.

TI  == an in vitro study of antimicrobial activity and efficacy of iodine-generating hydrogel dressings.
AB  == objective: to determine the antimicrobial activity and efficacy of different formulations of novel bioxygenating hydrogel dressings (which deliver both iodine and oxygen into the wound) against various target organisms by means of an in vitro test system that more effectively mimics the conditions encountered when dressings are in contact with wounds. method: three bioxygenating hydrogels were  tested: oxyzyme, which releases low levels of iodine into the wound, and iodozyme 402 and iodozyme 401, which release higher levels of iodine, with iodozyme 402 releasing twice the amount of 401. cellulose filter disks (n = 32) were inoculated with indicator species and placed equidistant from each other as a matrix onto agar test beds. cut squares of control or test dressings were placed  on top of each disk. kill curves were constructed from determinations of the numbers of survivors (log cfu per disk) over time by removing disk samples at various time points. results: significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the controls and test samples. the order of sensitivity for oxyzyme was fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the order of efficacy of the three hydrogel dressings (iodozyme 402, followed by iodozyme 401 and then oxyzyme) was  the same regardless of the target species. conclusion: the novel hydrogel skin surface wound dressings are broad-spectrum in activity, encompassing antibiotic-resistant organisms, anaerobes and yeasts; their antimicrobial function appears to be rapidly effective.

TI  == microbial changes in conjunctival flora with 30-day continuous-wear silicone hydrogel contact lenses.
AB  == purpose: to determine the effect of 30-day continuous-wear silicone hydrogel contact lenses on the conjunctival flora in asymptomatic wearers. methods: the authors studied 29 eyes of 15 patients wearing focus night & day silicone hydrogel contact lenses for up to 30 nights of continuous wear. the average age of the patients was 25.54 +/- 8.98 years. cultures of the inferior cul-de-sac were taken bilaterally from all eyes, before and after lens wear in asymptomatic  patients. the isolation and identification of bacteria were made by standard clinical laboratory methods. results: the number of eyes whose conjunctival cultures were sterile before using the lenses significantly decreased (p = 0.0005), and the number of eyes with a growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci and diphtheroid rods in their conjunctival cultures significantly increased after using these lenses (p = 0.001 and p = 0.031, respectively). conversely, a statistically significant difference was not found in the number of eyes that carried propionibacterium acnes and fusobacterium nucleatum in their conjunctival cultures before and after using the 30-day continuous-wear silicone hydrogel lenses (p = 0.998 and p = 0.488, respectively). conclusions: the results suggest  that the sterility of the conjunctiva significantly decreased after using 30-day  continuous-wear silicone hydrogel contact lenses. in addition, the number of bacteria of the normal conjunctival flora significantly increased after the use of these lenses. contamination by the bacteria of the eyelids may be a possible colonization factor in this study group. therefore, it is appropriate to examine  the patients who wear these lenses more frequently.

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the usa. beta-lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition,  the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases  (esbls). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. the most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus prevotella. other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp. facultative bacteria, such as burkholderia spp., ralstonia pickettii, capnocytophaga spp., bacillus spp., staphylococcus spp. and neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ampicillin and  amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the prevotella species. all prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. two of the prevotella isolates had high mics of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. esbl activity was not detected in any of the  beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the etest method. thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a  role in refractory periodontal disease.

TI  == relationship between periodontal pocket sulfide levels and subgingival species.
AB  == background: many species implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease produce volatile sulfur compounds (vsc). this investigation examined the relationship between levels of sulfide and subgingival bacterial species in the same periodontal pockets. material and methods: twenty chronic periodontitis subjects were measured clinically at six sites per tooth for plaque, gingivitis,  bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level. subgingival  plaque samples, taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth, were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. sulfide levels were measured at the same sites using a diamond probe/perio 2000 system. clinical and microbiological data were averaged for sulfide-positive and -negative sites separately in each subject and then averaged across subjects. significance differences in clinical and microbial parameters between sulfide-positive and -negative sites were sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. results: mean total dna probe counts (x10(5), +/-sem) at sulfide-negative and -positive sites were 44.0 +/- 9.9 and 65.0 +/- 13.3, respectively (p < 0.01). seventeen species were found at significantly higher levels in sulfide-positive than -negative sites. these included abundant producers of vsc such as members of the genera fusobacterium, campylobacter, prevotella, treponema and eubacterium, and bacteriodes forsythus, selenomonas noxia and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella intermedia, bacteriodes forsythus,  prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and treponema denticola exhibited the greatest difference in mean counts between sulfide-negative and -positive sites. orange and red complex species were at higher counts at shallow (< 4 mm) sulfide-positive than shallow sulfide-negative  sites. although not statistically significant, mean clinical parameters were somewhat higher at sulfide-positive than sulfide-negative sites. conclusions: intra-pocket sulfide levels reflect the levels of sulfide-producing species and may provide useful diagnostic information.

TI  == palmitoleic acid isomer (c16:1delta6) in human skin sebum is effective against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the percent lipid composition of pooled human sebum analyzed by thin-layer chromatography was: ceramides (13%), fatty acid (47%), cholesterol (7%), cholesterol esters (2%), squalene (11%), triglycerides (3%), and wax esters (17%). total sebum lipids (2- 4 mg/ml), sonicated into bacterial culture medium,  caused 4- to 5-fold log reduction in growth of gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius and the anaerobe fusobacterium nucleatum, but was ineffective against most gram-negative bacteria. fractionation of the sebum lipids showed that both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids contained the bulk of the antimicrobial activity. lauric acid (c12:0) was the most active saturated fatty acid. the unsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid (c16:1delta6, cpa) was both the most predominant monoene and the most active antimicrobial fatty acid. purified cpa (>99%) yielded typical minimal inhibitory  concentration (mic) values of 10-20 microg/ml against gram-positive bacteria. organically synthesized cpa isomer gave mic values comparable to the natural material. both natural and synthetic cpa were found to be the most active sebum lipid fraction in blocking the adherence of a pathogenic strain of candida albicans to porcine stratum corneum. ethanol in combination with cpa exerts a synergistic bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, and  several methacillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. palmitoleic acid may be useful in topical formulations for treatment of secondary gram-positive bacterial infections, as a gram-positive bacteria antimicrobial in wound dressings, and as  a natural gram-positive antimicrobial preservative in skin and hair care products.

TI  == enumeration of viable anaerobic bacteria by solid phase cytometry under aerobic conditions.
AB  == classical enumeration methods for anaerobes are time-consuming and require special conditions. solid phase cytometry (spc) is a recent laser scanning technique for the quantitative detection of fluorescently labelled bacteria on a  membrane filter that eliminates the need for a growth phase. fluorescent labelling of cells results from the cleavage by intracellular esterases of a fluorescein type ester to yield a free fluorescein derivative, which is retained  only in cells with an intact cytoplasmic membrane. however, as the standard labelling procedure is carried out under the conditions of aerobiosis, labelling  of anaerobic bacteria does not appear to be obvious. we have labelled eight strains of vegetative anaerobic bacteria (i.e. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium bifermentans, c. butyricum, c. perfringens, fusobacterium nucleatum,  porphyromonas canoris, p. gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes) and two strains of spores (c. butyricum, c. perfringens,) within 4 h under aerobic conditions. however, anaerobiosis remained necessary for spores of c. sordellii, c. sporogenes, c. tyrobutyricum. for vegetative cells of all strains, plots of spc versus plate counts were linear with slopes exceeding 1.0, indicating that spc consistently yielded higher numbers of bacteria.

AB  == the purpose of the study was to determine the effect of electron beam sterilization on gutta-percha cones (gpcs) at different times after sterilization. an agar diffusion test was used with -one aerobic bacterium (bacillus subtilis) and five oral anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes, and veillonella parvula). with each microorganism 30 agar plates were prepared, evenly distributed among three groups (group 1: unsterilized gpcs; groups 2 and 3: gpcs sterilized by electron beam irradiation 5 months and 5 yr before, respectively). one gpc of the selected group was placed in each plate. after incubation the area of inhibition was read on the agar plates. inhibition of growth was significantly different for the tested microorganisms. however no significant difference was observed between the sterilized and unsterilized gpcs. both the tested sterilized and unsterilized gpcs impair the growth of endodontic  pathogens, with no influence of the time elapsed since sterilization.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == dexamethasone differentially regulates cytokine transcription and translation in  macrophages responding to bacteria or okadaic acid.
AB  == many microorganisms and microbial products induce expression of pro-inflammatory  cytokines such as interleukin-1 (il-1alpha/beta) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) in macrophages, primarily by transcriptional activation. we show here, by using mouse macrophages in primary culture, that pre-treatment with dexamethasone inhibits bacteria-induced il-1beta expression as mrna and cellular  pro-il-1beta in parallel, consistent with an effect primarily on transcriptional  activation. in contrast, the expression of tnf-alpha mrna was only partly inhibited despite virtually complete inhibition of tnf-alpha protein formation. furthermore, the selective induction of primarily cell-associated 26,000 m, pro-tnf-alpha by the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid also was partly inhibited at the mrna level by dexamethasone, whereas additional translational inhibition appeared to be lacking. this latter finding is reminiscent of earlier  findings regarding signalling to activation of cytosolic phospholipase a2, which  is sensitive to dexamethasone when elicited by bacteria, but not when elicited by okadaic acid. the present results raise the possibility that the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on tnf-alpha translation, but not on transcriptional activation, is mediated by one or more okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases.

TI  == bacterial eradication from root dentine by ultrasonic irrigation with sodium hypochlorite.
AB  == the study aimed to evaluate intracanal irrigation procedures in eradicating bacteria from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine using extracted human teeth. artificial bacterial smear layer was successfully produced by rubbing a mixture of dental plaque and artificially decalcified dentine or carious dentine on root canal walls. the reservoir holes were 3.5 mm in depth, 1  mm in diameter prepared 1.5 mm apart and parallel to the root canals on the decrowned planes, in which five separate bacterial species were placed (actinomyces israelii, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis). bacterial eradication after irrigation of the prepared canals was determined by bacterial recovery (i) from the root canal surfaces and shallow layers where bacteria were smeared artificially and (ii) from deeper layers of root canal dentine reservoir holes. ultrasonic irrigation with 5.5% and 12% naocl eradicated bacteria from artificial smear layer (p < 0.0001), whilst 12% naocl irrigation with a syringe was insufficient. ultrasonic irrigation with water or 15% edta-failed to eradicate bacteria from smeared surfaces. ultrasonic irrigation with 12% naocl killed a. israelii, f. nucleatum, p. acnes, s. mutans, and s. sanguis placed in reservoir channels, although for f. nucleatum, a very small number of bacteria remained in  five samples out of 12. ultrasonic irrigation with less concentrated naocl failed to eliminate bacteria completely from reservoir channels in most samples. ultrasonic irrigation with 12% naocl appeared to eliminate bacteria efficiently from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (go). age was inversely associated with the go. plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with go, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of go. the gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the go. statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of go were detected for propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium and selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species eubacterium alactolyticum, campylobacter concisus, c. gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, f. mortiferum, f. nucleatum, and f. varium from the more enlarged lesions (go >3).

TI  == evaluation of root canal bacteria and their antimicrobial susceptibility in teeth with necrotic pulp.
AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the microbiota of necrotic pulp in teeth without carious lesions where the crown and root were intact and to test the sensitivity  of this microbiota to antibiotics in order to improve treatment. the necrotic pulp was sampled from 26 single-rooted teeth in intact pulp chambers. a total of  84 strains were isolated. the number of species isolated per tooth varied from 2  to 8, with a strong component (81%) of anaerobic bacteria. the most commonly represented species were bacteroides gracilis, propionibacterium acnes, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella buccae and eubacterium lentum. the sensitivity of these organisms to amoxicillin, amoxicillin combined with clavulanate and tetracycline was evaluated by etest on 38 isolates. for all strains tested, the minimum inhibitory concentration values obtained were low and substantially below effective serum concentrations for these antibiotics. these data enable us to devise suitable treatments for acute development of apical lesions and to prevent dissemination of this source of infection to the rest of the host.

TI  == electrophoresis of whole-cell soluble proteins of microorganisms isolated from bacteremias in endodontic therapy.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that anaerobic bacteria are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from blood following endodontic therapy of teeth with apical periodontitis. phenotypic characterisation of the isolates suggested that  the bacteria in the blood originated from the root canal. the present experiment  using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was carried out in an effort to verify these findings, and to further study the microorganisms involved in endodontic bacteremias. soluble cellular proteins were extracted from 11 reference strains and 26 bacterial isolates recovered from the  root canal and blood. these included propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus  prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia. actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis. the electrophoretic patterns mostly confirmed the identity of the isolates as determined by the biochemical and antimicrobial resistance tests. furthermore, with this typing method the species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens could be differentiated.  these species had been recovered from both root canal and blood. also, differences between subspecies of fusobacterium nucleatum became evident with sds-page, and the results indicated that the organism recovered from the root canal and blood was fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii. the electrophoretic patterns of the different organisms isolated from the root canal and the blood were similar, providing further evidence that the bacteria found in the blood originated from the root canal.

TI  == degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. in the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. the activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin iii, antiplasmin and cystatin c) was evaluated by sds-page. the 80 kda trypsin-like protease of p. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kda chymotrypsin-like protease of  t. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin c. when whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and capnocytophaga spp. peptostreptococcus micros and propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and fusobacterium nucleatum, had no  effect on the protease inhibitors. the 80 kda protease of p. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kda protease of t. denticola. this study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. this may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.

TI  == bacteremia in conjunction with endodontic therapy.
AB  == this study characterizes oral microorganisms believed to have spread from the root canal into the blood stream during and after endodontic therapy of teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis. microbiological samples were taken under  aseptic conditions from the root canal of 26 single-rooted teeth in 26 patients.  in the endodontic treatment of 13 of the patients (group 1), the first 3 reamers, sizes 15, 20 and 25, were used to a level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. in the  other 13 patients (group 2), the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. blood samples were taken from the patients during the instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from all root canals. in 7 patients of group 1, propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and saccharomyces cerevisiae were recovered from the blood. in 4 patients of group 2, p. intermedia, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus sanguis were isolated from the blood. biochemical tests and antibiograms revealed that the isolates from the root canal and blood had identical profiles within the patients, strongly suggesting that the microorganisms isolated from the blood had the root canal as their source.

TI  == protein-kinase-c-independent activation of arachidonate release and prostaglandin e2 formation in macrophages interacting with certain bacteria.
AB  == certain bacterial species, of which we selected fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes, were found to induce release of arachidonic acid in a dose- and time-dependent manner in mouse macrophages. the release of arachidonic acid showed a characteristic lag period of approximately 10 min and was accompanied by selective transformation into prostaglandin e2. bacteria killed by various methods caused a similar response, indicating that bacterial surface structures rather than secreted products were involved. down-regulation of protein kinase c  by treatment of macrophages with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate hardly affected the response to bacteria at all, except for a partial inhibition in the  case of p. acnes. furthermore, the generation of prostaglandin e2 was synergistically enhanced when macrophages were exposed to both bacteria and phorbol ester. it is also unlikely that bacterial activation was mediated exclusively via a rise in cytosolic [ca2+], since bacteria stimulated the release of arachidonic acid also when [ca2+] was clamped at various levels and since the  response to bacteria was enhanced in an additive to synergistic manner when combined with calcium ionophore. changes in protein phosphorylation in macrophages exposed to f. nucleatum (gram-negative) were virtually identical to those seen with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, while p. anaerobius (gram-positive) induced enhanced labeling of a single detectable phosphoprotein. in both cases, the changes in protein phosphorylation showed a time lag of 4-8 min and occurred  independently of protein kinase c, consistent with a possible role in signal transduction. these results demonstrate that certain bacteria cause activation of arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin e2 formation in mouse macrophages; that the response is independent of protein kinase c and that it is not wholly mediated via a rise in cytosolic [ca2+].

TI  == frequency distributions of periodontal attachment loss. clinical and microbiological features.
AB  == the present investigation attempted to determine if the pattern of past periodontal destruction could be concisely summarized, and related to other clinical and microbiological parameters. 61 subjects between the ages of 12 and 61 years with destructive periodontal disease were evaluated at 6 sites per tooth for redness, plaque, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment level. the frequency distribution of baseline attachment level measurements was computed for each individual. a curve fitting algorithm was used to fit the frequency distribution to 1-, 2-, and 3-term normal distributions. the parameters of the fit could be used to summarize concisely all of the frequency distributions. 3 major patterns of attachment loss could be distinguished. pattern i required a two-term distribution with localized destruction at less than 34% of sites and was further divided into 3 groups, depending on average attachment loss at diseased sites. the means of the second peak for the subgroups were 2.7, 5.3, and 8.6 mm, respectively. pattern ii exhibited more widespread disease (greater than 33% of sites affected) with multiple peaks in the frequency distribution requiring a 3-term distribution for satisfactory fit. however, a significant proportion of sites was not affected. pattern iii exhibited a single-peaked normal distribution in which virtually all sites were affected. mean attachment levels of the peaks in this group ranged from 2.7 to 8.4 mm. 23 of the 61 subjects showed significant attachment loss at 1 or more sites during the course of bi-monthly monitoring, as determined by the tolerance method of analysis. subgingival plaque samples were taken from these active sites and matched with control sites prior to therapy. the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus intermedius, and eikenella corrodens were significantly  elevated in active and control sites of subjects in groups ii and iii combined (the widespread disease groups), and proportions of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and propionibacterium acnes were elevated in active and control sites of the more localized disease group i subjects. group i subjects showed a 13- to 15-fold decrease in hazard rates of periodontal sites after widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline, whereas groups ii and iii subjects showed 2-to 6-fold decreases.

AB  == twenty-nine anaerobic isolates were recovered from 28 pediatric patients with anaerobic bacteremia: 14 bacteroides sp (11 in the b fragilis group); four anaerobic gram-positive cocci; four clostridium sp; four propionibacterium acnes; and three fusobacterium sp. no aerobic bacteria were isolated from these patients. the gastrointestinal tract was the possible portal of entry in 13 instances, eight of which were due to bacteroides organisms, four to clostridium  sp, and one to f nucleatum. the ear, sinus, and oropharynx were probable portals  of entry in seven instances, four of which were due to peptococcus sp and two to  fusobacterium sp. five patients (18%) died; four had bacteremia caused by b fragilis group, and one had bacteremia caused by p acnes. the average duration of antimicrobial therapy was 20 days (range, seven to 72 days). the early recognition and rapid institution of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy are of utmost importance in improving the outcome of these patients.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cervical adenitis in children.
AB  == needle aspirates from 53 inflamed cervical lymph glands were studies for aerobic  and anaerobic bacteria and mycobacteria. bacterial growth was achieved in 45 patients (85%). sixty-six bacterial isolates were recovered, averaging 1.5 isolates per specimen (0.8 aerobes and 0.7 anaerobes), with as many as 4 isolates in some specimens. aerobic organisms alone were recovered in 27 aspirates (60%) of the 45 culture-positive aspirates, anaerobic bacteria alone in 8 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 9 specimens (20%). mycobacterium scrofulaceum was recovered in one (2%). the predominant aerobic organisms were staphylococcus aureus (14 isolates) and group a beta hemolytic streptococci (8).  a total of 31 anaerobes were recovered, including gram-positive cocci (9, including 6 peptococcus sp. and 3 peptostreptococcus sp.), 8 bacteroides sp. (including 3 b. melaninogenicus), 5 propionibacterium acnes, and 4 fusobacterium  nucleatum. these data demonstrate the role of anaerobic organisms in cervical lymphadenitis and the need to culture aspirated material for both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

TI  == in vitro activity of tiamulin (81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin derivative, against clinically significant anaerobes.
AB  == the susceptibility of more than 40 strains of gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes to tiamulin (sandoz 81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin (pleuromutilin) derivative, was determined by broth dilution and agar dilution tests. the influences of density of the inoculum upon mics was studied by a specially designed pour plate-technique. bacteroides fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. splanchnicus, b. oralis, b. asaccharolyticus, b. melaninogenicus, fusobacterium fusiforme (f. nucleatum), sphaerophorus necrophorus, clostridium perfringens, c.  fallax, propionibacterium acnes and several species of peptococcaceae showed broth dilution mics of 0.03 similar to 1 microgram/ml. members of b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum) were inhibited by 8 similar to 32 microgram/ml and 2 strains of s. varius had a broth dilution mic  of 256 microgram/ml. with most strains, the agar dilution mics were 2 similar to  4 similar to 8 times the broth dilution mics. in pour plate-tests, the mics were  not considerably influenced influenced by varying initial concentrations of viable cells. with most anaerobes, the mbcs of tiamulin were more than 100-fold higher than the mics. the results obtained indicated that, apart from s. varius,  b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum), members of 16 other anaerobic species including b. fragilis were without exception sensitive to tiamulin.
