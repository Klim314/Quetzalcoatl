TI  - Genetic and technological characterisation of vineyard- and winery-associated lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Vineyard- and winery-associated lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from two major PDO regions in Greece, Peza and Nemea, were surveyed. LAB were isolated from grapes, fermenting musts, and winery tanks performing spontaneous malolactic fermentations (MLF). Higher population density and species richness were detected in Nemea than in Peza vineyards and on grapes than in fermenting musts. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus graminis were the most abundant LAB on grapes, while Lactobacillus plantarum dominated in fermenting musts from both regions. No particular structure of Lactobacillus plantarum populations according to the region of origin was observed, and strain distribution seems random. LAB species diversity in winery tanks differed significantly from that in vineyard samples, consisting principally of Oenococcus oeni. Different strains were analysed as per their enological characteristics and the ability to produce biogenic amines (BAs). Winery-associated species showed higher resistance to low pH, ethanol, SO2, and CuSO4 than vineyard-associated isolates. The frequency of BA-producing strains was relatively low but not negligible, considering that certain winery-associated Lactobacillus hilgardii strains were able to produce BAs. Present results show the necessity of controlling the MLF by selected starters in order to avoid BA accumulation in wine.
TI  - Assessment of probiotic properties in lactic acid bacteria isolated from wine.
AB  - Probiotic properties are highly strain-dependent but rarely studied in enological lactic acid bacteria (LAB). In this study, the probiotic features of 11 strains of Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp., and Oenococcus oeni, including saliva and acid resistance, bile tolerance and exopolysaccharides' production, were investigated. The assays included two probiotic reference strains (Lactobacillus plantarum CLC 17 and Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716). The Lactobacillus and Pediococcus strains showed high resistance to lysozyme (>80% resistance to 100 mg/L of lysozyme under conditions simulating the in vivo dilution by saliva) and were capable of surviving at low pH values (pH 1.8) and bile salts, suggesting good adaptation of the wine strains to gastrointestinal conditions. The ability of the strains to adhere to the intestinal mucosa and the inhibition of the adhesion of Escherichia coli to human intestinal cells were also evaluated. Adhesion levels of enological LAB to Caco-2 cells varied from 0.37% to 12.2%, depending on the strain. In particular, Pediococcus pentosaceus CIAL-86 showed a high percentage of adhesion to intestinal cells (>12%), even higher than that shown by the probiotic reference strains, and a high anti-adhesion activity against E. coli CIAL-153 (>30%), all of which support this wine LAB strain as a potential probiotic.
TI  - Fast identification of wine related lactic acid bacteria by multiplex PCR.
AB  - The microflora of must and wine consists of yeasts, acetic acid bacteria and lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The latter group plays an important role for wine quality. The malolactic fermentation carried out by LAB leads to deacidification and stabilisation of wines. Nevertheless, LAB are often associated with wine spoilage. They are mainly responsible for the formation of biogenic amines. Furthermore, some strains produce exopolysaccharide slimes, acetic acid, diacetyl and other off-flavours. In this context a better monitoring of the vinification process is crucial to improve wine quality. Moreover, a lot of biodiversity studies would also profit from a fast and reliable identification method. In this study, we propose a species-specific multiplex PCR system for a rapid and simultaneous detection of 13 LAB species, frequently occurring in must or wine: Lactobacillus brevis, Lb. buchneri, Lb. curvatus, Lb. hilgardii, Lb. plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Oenococcus oeni, Pediococcus acidilactici, P. damnosus, P. inopinatus, P. parvulus, P. pentosaceus and Weissella paramesenteroides.
TI  - Comparative study of the inhibitory effects of wine polyphenols on the growth of  enological lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - This paper reports a comparative study of the inhibitory potential of 18 phenolic compounds, including hydroxybenzoic acids and their derivatives, hydroxycinnamic acids, phenolic alcohols and other related compounds, stilbenes, flavan-3-ols and flavonols, on different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains of the species Oenococcus oeni, Lactobacillus hilgardii and Pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from wine. In general, flavonols and stilbenes showed the greatest inhibitory effects (lowest IC(5)(0) values) on the growth of the strains tested (0.160-0.854 for flavonols and 0.307-0.855 g/L for stilbenes). Hydroxycinnamic acids (IC(5)(0) > 0.470 g/L) and hydroxybenzoic acids and esters (IC(5)(0) >1 g/L) exhibited medium inhibitory effect, and phenolic alcohols (IC(5)(0) > 2 g/L) and flavanol-3-ols (negligible effect) showed the lowest effect on the growth of the LAB strains studied. In comparison to the antimicrobial additives used in winemaking, IC(5)(0) values of most phenolic compounds were higher than those of potassium metabisulphite for O. oeni strains (e.g., around 4-fold higher for quercetin than for potassium metabisulphite), but lower for L. hilgardii and P. pentosaceus strains (e.g., around 2-fold lower for quercetin). Lysozyme IC(5)(0) values were negligible for L. hilgardii and P. pentosaceus, and were higher than those corresponding to most of the phenolic compounds tested for O. oeni strains, indicating that lysozyme was less toxic for LAB than the phenolic compounds in wine. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed damage of the cell membrane integrity as a consequence of the incubation with antimicrobial agents. These results contribute to the understanding of the inhibitory action of wine phenolics on the progress of malolactic fermentation, and also to the development of new alternatives to the use of sulphites in enology.
TI  - Role of specific components from commercial inactive dry yeast winemaking preparations on the growth of wine lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The role of specific components from inactive dry yeast preparations widely used  in winemaking on the growth of three representative wine lactic acid bacteria (Oenococcus oeni, Lactobacillus hilgardii and Pediococcus pentosaceus) has been studied. A pressure liquid extraction technique using solvents of different polarity was employed to obtain extracts with different chemical composition from the inactive dry yeast preparations. Each of the extracts was assayed against the three lactic acid bacteria. Important differences in the effect of the extracts on the growth of the bacteria were observed, which depended on the solvent employed during the extraction, on the type of commercial preparations and on the lactic acid bacteria species. The extracts that exhibited the most different activity were chemically characterized in amino acids, free monosaccharides, monosaccharides from polysaccharides, fatty acids and volatile compounds. In general, specific amino acids and monosaccharides were related to a stimulating effect whereas fatty acid composition and likely some volatile compounds seemed to show an inhibitory effect on the growth of the lactic acid bacteria. These results may provide novel and useful information in trying to obtain better and more specific formulations of winemaking inactive dry yeast preparations.
TI  - Detection of arc genes related with the ethyl carbamate precursors in wine lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Trace amounts of the carcinogen ethyl carbamate can appear in wine by the reaction of ethanol with compounds such as citrulline and carbamyl phosphate, which are produced from arginine degradation by some wine lactic acid bacteria (LAB). In this work, the presence of arc genes for the arginine-deiminase pathway was studied in several strains of different species of LAB. Their ability to degrade arginine was also studied. To detect the presence of arc genes, degenerate primers were designed from the alignment of protein sequences in already sequenced LAB. The usefulness of these degenerate primers has been proven by sequencing some of the amplified PCR fragments and searching for homologies with published sequences of the same species and related ones. Correlation was found between the presence of genes and the ability to degrade arginine. Degrading strains included all heterofermentative lactobacilli, Oenococcus oeni , Pediococcus pentosaceus , and some strains of Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Lactobacillus plantarum .
TI  - Molecular screening of wine lactic acid bacteria degrading hydroxycinnamic acids.
AB  - The potential to produce volatile phenols from hydroxycinnamic acids was investigated for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from Spanish grape must and wine. A PCR assay was developed for the detection of LAB that potentially produce volatile phenols. Synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides for the specific detection of the pdc gene encoding a phenolic acid decarboxylase were designed. The pdc PCR assay amplifies a 321 bp DNA fragment from phenolic acid decarboxylase. The pdc PCR method was applied to 85 strains belonging to the 6 main wine LAB species. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, and Pediococcus pentosaceus strains produce a positive response in the pdc PCR assay, whereas Oenococcus oeni, Lactobacillus hilgardii, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides strains did not produce the expected PCR product. The production of vinyl and ethyl derivatives from hydroxycinnamic acids in culture media was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. A relationship was found between pdc PCR amplification and volatile phenol production, so that the LAB strains that gave a positive pdc PCR response produce volatile phenols, whereas strains that did not produce a PCR amplicon did not produce volatile phenols. The proposed method could be useful for a preliminary identification of LAB strains able to produce volatile phenols in wine.
TI  - Role of hypermutability in the evolution of the genus Oenococcus.
AB  - Oenococcus oeni is an alcohol-tolerant, acidophilic lactic acid bacterium primarily responsible for malolactic fermentation in wine. A recent comparative genomic analysis of O. oeni PSU-1 with other sequenced lactic acid bacteria indicates that PSU-1 lacks the mismatch repair (MMR) genes mutS and mutL. Consistent with the lack of MMR, mutation rates for O. oeni PSU-1 and a second oenococcal species, O. kitaharae, were higher than those observed for neighboring taxa, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Sequence analysis of the rpoB mutations in rifampin-resistant strains from both oenococcal species revealed a high percentage of transition mutations, a result indicative of the lack of MMR. An analysis of common alleles in the two sequenced O. oeni strains, PSU-1 and BAA-1163, also revealed a significantly higher level of transition substitutions than were observed in other Lactobacillales species. These results suggest that the genus Oenococcus is hypermutable due to the loss of mutS and mutL, which occurred with the divergence away from the neighboring Leuconostoc branch. The hypermutable status of the genus Oenococcus explains the observed high level of allelic polymorphism among known O. oeni isolates and likely contributed to the unique adaptation of this genus to acidic and alcoholic environments.
TI  - Assessment of antibiotic susceptibility within lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from wine.
AB  - Susceptibility to 12 antibiotics was tested in 75 unrelated lactic acid bacteria  strains of wine origin of the following species: 38 Lactobacillus plantarum, 3 Lactobacillus hilgardii, 2 Lactobacillus paracasei, 1 Lactobacillus sp, 21 Oenococcus oeni, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 2 Pediococcus parvulus, 1 Pediococcus acidilactici, and 3 Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations of the different antibiotics that inhibited 50% of the strains of the Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus genera were, respectively, the following ones: penicillin (2, < or =0.5, and < or =0.5 microg/ml), erythromycin (< or =0.5 microg/ml), chloramphenicol (4 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (64, 8, and 128 microg/ml), vancomycin (> or =128 microg/ml), tetracycline (8, 2, and 8 microg/ml), streptomycin (256, 32, and 512 microg/ml), gentamicin (64, 4, and 128 microg/ml), kanamycin (256, 64, and 512 microg/ml), sulfamethoxazole (> or =1024 microg/ml), and trimethoprim (16 microg/ml). All 21 O. oeni showed susceptibility to erythromycin, tetracycline, rifampicin and chloramphenicol, and exhibited resistance to aminoglycosides, vancomycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, that could represent intrinsic resistance. Differences were observed among the O. oeni strains with respect to penicillin or ciprofloxacin susceptibility. Antibiotic resistance genes were studied by PCR and sequencing, and the following genes were detected: erm(B) (one P. acidilactici), tet(M) (one L. plantarum), tet(L) (one P. parvulus), aac(6')-aph(2") (four L. plantarum, one P. parvulus, one P. pentosaceus and two O. oeni), ant(6) (one L. plantarum, and two P. parvulus), and aph(3')-IIIa (one L. plantarum and one O. oeni). This is the first time, to our knowledge, that ant(6), aph(3')-IIIa and tet(L) genes are found in Lactobacillus and Pediococcus strains and antimicrobial resistance genes are reported in O. oeni strains.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - rpoB gene: a target for identification of LAB cocci by PCR-DGGE and melting curves analyses in real time PCR.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are essential in the quality of many fermented beverages like beer, cider and wine. In the two later cases, they convert malic acid into lactic acid during the malolactic fermentation. After fermentation, microbial stabilization is needed to prevent the development of spoilage bacteria species. Among them, cocci lead to different alterations: Pediococcus sp., and some strains of Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Oenococcus oeni can produce exopolysaccharides which modify wine viscosity and lead to ropiness. They also can produce acetic acid, biogenic amine, ethyl carbamate and volatile phenols. Therefore detection and identification are crucial. Results of phenotypic tests and DNA-DNA probes are not accurate enough. 16S RNA gene which is currently used for bacterial species identification presents intraspecies heterogeneity. The rpoB gene is an alternative to this limitation. However previous PCR targeting partial sequence of rpoB gene could not delimit cocci species. Therefore we compared the rpoB gene sequence of the six main cocci species found in fermented beverages: P. damnosus, P. dextrinicus, P. parvulus, P. pentosaceus, L. mesenteroides and O. oeni. The most discriminating partial sequence of the rpoB gene was chosen for designing primers. By PCR-DGGE the reliability of these primers was verified. It was controlled in a mixture of several cocci and other lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus sp.). Then we adapted the primers and the PCR conditions in order to achieve the identification of cocci species by real time PCR program including the fluorescent dye SYBR Green I, which gives faster results. PCR melt curves were established and a specific T(m) was attributed to each species.
TI  - Growth response and modifications of organic nitrogen compounds in pure and mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria from wine.
AB  - The interactions between the proteolytic X2L strain of Oenococcus oeni and the non-proteolytic 12p strain of Pediococcus pentosaceus were assayed. The characteristics of cell growth, protein degradation, and amino acid production of both strains were determined in pure and mixed cultures. O. oeni showed poor cell growth and greater ability in the release of amino acids to the extracellular medium, whereas P. pentosaceus showed a higher yield in cell production with a decrease in the amino acid concentration in the medium. P. pentosaceus especially consumed essential amino acids for growth, and O. oeni released several of the essential amino acids important for growth of P. pentosaceus. In the mixed culture, mutualism was observed. The higher activity of the proteolytic system of O. oeni in mixed culture produced an increase in cell growth and in the amount of essential amino acids released. These findings provide new knowledge about the metabolic interactions between lactic acid bacteria isolated from wine when proteins are degraded in mixed bacterial populations.
TI  - 16S-ARDRA, a tool for identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from grape  must and wine.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are found in a great variety of habitats, including grape must and wines. There is a close relationship between the species of LAB which develop during fermentation and the eventual quality of the wine. For these reasons analytical techniques allowing fast and reliable identification of wine LAB are needed. In this work a simple and accurate protocol for identifying species of LAB isolated from grape must and wine is presented. This protocol is based on the amplification, directly from colony, of 16S rDNA and later digestion with one of the following restriction enzymes BfaI, MseI and AluI. A sequential use of the three enzymes is proposed to simplify LAB wine identification, first MseI, then BfaI and finally, if necessary, AluI digestion. The technique was able to discriminate 32 of the 36 LAB reference species tested and allowed the identification of 342 isolates from musts and wines. The isolates belonged to the species: Lactobacillus brevis, L. collinoides, L. coryniformis, L. bilgardii, L. mali, L. paracasei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Oenococcus oeni, Pediococcus parvulus and P. pentosaceus.
TI  - Pediocin PD-1, a bactericidal antimicrobial peptide from Pediococcus damnosus NCFB 1832.
AB  - Pediocin PD-1, produced by Pediococcus damnosus NCFB 1832, is inhibitory to several food spoilage bacteria and food-borne pathogens. However, pediocin PD-1 is not active against other Pediococcus spp. and differs in this respect to other pediocins produced by Pediococcus acidilactici and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Production of pediocin PD-1 starts during early growth and reaches-a plateau at the end of exponential growth. Pediocin PD-1 was partially purified and its size was determined by tricine-SDS-PAGE as approximately 3.5 kDa. The isoelectric point (pI) of pediocin PD-1 is approximately 3.5, as determined with the Rotofor electrofocusing cell (BioRad). Pediocin PD-1 is heat-resistant (10 min at 121 degrees C) and remains active after 30 min of incubation at pH 2-10. Pediocin PD-1 is resistant to treatment with pepsin, papain, alpha-chemotrypsin and trypsin, but not Proteinase K. Pediocin PD-1 is bactericidal against sensitive cells of Oenococcus oeni (previously Leuconostoc oenos).
