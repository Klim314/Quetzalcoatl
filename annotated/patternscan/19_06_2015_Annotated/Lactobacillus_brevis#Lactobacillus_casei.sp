TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == examination of the technological properties of newly isolated strains of the genus and possibilities for their application in the composition of starters.
AB  == the ability of four lactobacillus strains - lactobacillus brevis lbrz7 (isolated  from fermented cabbage), lactobacillus plantarum lbrz12 (isolated from fermented  cabbage), lactobacillus fermentum lbrh9 (of human origin) and lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus lbrc11 (isolated from home-made cheese) - to grow in flour/water environment and to accumulate high concentrations of viable cells was examined. two starters for sourdough were created for lab-scale production of wheat bread:  a two-strain starter and a four-strain starter. wheat bread with improved properties - greater loaf volume, enhanced flavour and softer and brighter crumb  - was obtained from the 7% four-strain starter sourdough. the addition of sourdough in the production of wheat bread affected positively the technological  and organoleptic characteristics of the final bread by inhibiting the growth of wild yeasts and mold and bacillus spores without the addition of preservatives. the inclusion of 15% of the four-strain starter sourdough in the bread-making process led to enhanced safety and longer shelf life of the baked bread.

TI  == a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of multispecies probiotics on cognitive reactivity to sad mood.
AB  == background: recent insights into the role of the human microbiota in cognitive and affective functioning have led to the hypothesis that probiotic supplementation may act as an adjuvant strategy to ameliorate or prevent depression. objective: heightened cognitive reactivity to normal, transient changes in sad mood is an established marker of vulnerability to depression and is considered an important target for interventions. the present study aimed to test if a multispecies probiotic containing bifidobacterium bifidum w23, bifidobacterium lactis w52, lactobacillus acidophilus w37, lactobacillus brevis w63, lactobacillus casei w56, lactobacillus salivarius w24, and lactococcus lactis (w19 and w58) may reduce cognitive reactivity in non-depressed individuals. design: in a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, pre- and  post-intervention assessment design, 20 healthy participants without current mood disorder received a 4-week probiotic food-supplement intervention with the multispecies probiotics, while 20 control participants received an inert placebo  for the same period. in the pre- and post-intervention assessment, cognitive reactivity to sad mood was assessed using the revised leiden index of depression  sensitivity scale. results: compared to participants who received the placebo intervention, participants who received the 4-week multispecies probiotics intervention showed a significantly reduced overall cognitive reactivity to sad mood, which was largely accounted for by reduced rumination and aggressive thoughts. conclusion: these results provide the first evidence that the intake of probiotics may help reduce negative thoughts associated with sad mood. probiotics supplementation warrants further research as a potential preventive strategy for  depression.

TI  == fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity of tropical grass-legumes silages.
AB  == calliandra calothyrsus preserved in silage is an alternative method for improving the crude protein content of feeds for sustainable ruminant production. the aim of this research was to evaluate the quality of silage which contained different  levels of c. calothyrsus by examining the fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity. silage was made in a completely randomized design consisting of five treatments with three replications i.e.: r0, pennisetum purpureum 100%; r1, p. purpureum 75%+c. calothyrsus 25%;, r2, p. purpureum 50%+c. calothyrsus 50%; r3, p. purpureum 25%+c. calothyrsus 75%; and r4, c. calothyrsus 100%. all silages were prepared using plastic jar silos (600 g) and incubated at room temperature for 30 days. silages were analyzed for fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity. increased levels of c. calothyrsus in silage had a significant effect (p<0.01) on the fermentation characteristics. the microbial diversity index decreased and activity was inhibited with increasing levels of c. calothyrsus. the microbial community indicated that there was a population of lactobacillus plantarum, l. casei, l. brevis, lactococcus lactis, chryseobacterium sp., and uncultured bacteria. the result confirmed that silage with a combination of grass and c. calothyrsus had good fermentation characteristics and microbial communities were dominated by l. plantarum.

TI  == inhibitory activity in vitro of probiotic lactobacilli against oral candida under different fermentation conditions.
AB  == clinical studies have shown that probiotics positively affect oral health by decreasing gum bleeding and/or reducing salivary counts of certain oral pathogens. our aim was to investigate the inhibitory effect of six probiotic lactobacilli against opportunistic oral candida species. sugar utilisation by both lactobacilli and candida was also assessed. agar overlay assay was utilised  to study growth inhibition of candida albicans, candida glabrata and candida krusei by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus  reuteri sd2112, lactobacillus brevis cd2, lactobacillus bulgaricus lb86 and l. bulgaricus lb lact. the inhibitory effect was measured at ph 5.5, 6.4, and 7.2, respectively, and in the presence of five different carbohydrates in growth medium (glucose, fructose, lactose, sucrose, and sorbitol). growth and final ph values were measured at two-hour time points to 24 h. l. rhamnosus gg showed the  strongest inhibitory activity in fructose and glucose medium against c. albicans, followed by l. casei shirota, l. reuteri sd2112 and l. brevis cd2. none of the lactobacilli tested affected the growth of c. krusei. only l. rhamnosus gg produced slight inhibitory effect on c. glabrata. the lower ph values led to larger inhibition zones. sugar fermentation profiles varied between the strains.  l. casei shirota grew in the presence of all sugars tested, whereas l. brevis cd2 could utilise only glucose and fructose. all candida species metabolised the available sugars but the most rapid growth was observed with c. glabrata. the results suggest that commercially available probiotics differ in their inhibitory activity and carbohydrate utilisation; the above properties are modified by different ph values and sugars with more pronounced inhibition at lower ph.

TI  == antimutagenic and anticancer effects of lactic acid bacteria isolated from tarhana through ames test and phylogenetic analysis by 16s rdna.
AB  == deaths due to cancer have been increasing in many countries in recent years. one  of the beneficial probiotic properties is potential of antimutagenic and anticancer effects. the aim of this study was to investigate antimutagenic and anticancer effects of 25 strains of lactobacilli spp isolated from tarhana in vitro conditions and to identify selected strains based on molecular biology. antimutagenicity and anticarcinogenicity tests were performed based on proposed method of professor ames et al. identification of selected strains was performed  based on biochemical and molecular tests. study of antimutagenic and anticancer effects of 25 different strains led to identification of 4 isolates of lactobacillus spp. higher antimutagenic activities against sodium azide were observed in cell suspensions of 4 strains as compared with their supernatants. so the inhibitory percentage of cell suspensions among 4 strains was equal to 60.38% in its highest level. antimutagenicity of these strains was also increased in the presence of rat s9. four selected strains were identified based on 16s rdna sequence. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus brevis  isolated from tarhana exhibited high antimutagenic and anticancer activity. of 25 strains of lactobacilli, 4 strains with the highest antimutagenicity effect were  chosen as new potential probiotic strains.

TI  == novel starch based nano scale enteric coatings from soybean meal for colon-specific delivery.
AB  == soybean meal was used to isolate resistant starch and produce nanoparticles, which could be potential coating materials for colonic nutrient and drug deliveries. the nanoparticles were in 40 +/- 33.2 nm ranges. these nanoparticles  were stable under simulated human physiological conditions. the degrees of dissolution in both stomach and intestinal conditions were less than 30%. furthermore, the nanoparticles were less susceptible to pancreatic enzymatic digestion (20%), which was also evidenced by the co-existence of b-type crystalline pattern. in addition to the dissolution and digestion studies in the  upper gastrointestinal tract, the nanoparticles were subjected to in vitro fermentation by bifidobacterium brevis and lactobacillus casei. both species showed an increase in growth and activity, while producing short chain fatty acids: acetate, propionate, and butyrates in varying amounts. overall this study  clearly demonstrated a novel method that can be used for colon-specific delivery  of bioactive compounds such as drugs and nutrients.

TI  == probiotic lactic acid bacteria detoxify n-nitrosodimethylamine.
AB  == humans can be exposed to n-nitroso compounds (nocs) due to many environmental sources, as well as endogenous formation. the main nitrosamine found in food products and also synthesised in vivo by intestinal microbiota is n-nitrosodimethylamine (ndma). it can cause cancer of the stomach, kidney and colon. the effect of four probiotic lactobacillus strains on ndma was studied under different culture conditions (24 h in mrs, 168 h in modified mrs n, and 168 h in phosphate buffer). hplc and gc-tea methods were used for ndma determination  in supernatants. the influence of lactic acid bacteria on ndma genotoxicity was investigated by means of the comet assay. additionally, the effect of ndma (2-100 microg ml(-)(1)) on the growth and survival of the probiotic strains was studied. the results indicate that the bacteria decreased ndma concentration by up to 50%, depending on the culture conditions, time of incubation, ndma concentration, ph and bacterial strain. lb. brevis 0945 lowered the concentration and genotoxicity  of ndma most effectively by up to 50%. this could be due to either adsorption or  metabolism. the growth and survival of the bacteria was not affected by any of the tested ndma concentrations.

TI  == expression of bioactive porcine interferon-alpha in lactobacillus casei.
AB  == in this study, we constructed an expression cassette containing the inducible lac promoter and the secretion signal from an s-layer protein of lactobacillus brevis for the expression of porcine interferon-alpha (ifn-alpha) in lactobacillus casei (lb. casei). reverse-transcriptase pcr verified the presence of porcine ifn-alpha mrna in the recombinant lb. casei. the porcine ifn-alpha protein expressed in the recombinant lb. casei was identified by both western blot analysis and elisa. we  used various ph values and induction times to optimize the yield of ifn-alpha, and found that induction with 0.8% lactose for 16 h under anaerobic conditions produced the highest concentrations of ifn-alpha. furthermore, the activity of porcine ifn-alpha in the cultural supernatant was evaluated on st cells infected  with pseudorabies virus. the results revealed that porcine ifn-alpha inhibited virus replication in vitro. the findings of our study indicate that recombinant lb. casei producing porcine ifn-alpha has great potential for use as a novel oral antiviral agent in animal healthcare.

TI  == detection, partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 isolated from freshwater fish: bacteriocin from lb. brevis fptlb3.
AB  == lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 was isolated from freshwater fish, capable of producing bacteriocin that had broad spectrum of inhibition (3200 au/ml) against  escherichia coli mtcc 1563, enterococcus faecalis mtcc 2729, lactobacillus casei  mtcc 1423, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923. the antimicrobial activity of crude supernatant fluid was stable after heating at 121 degrees c for 60 min and declined thereafter. stability of antimicrobial activity was observed at ph range of 2.0 to 8.0. its active principle was proteinaceous in nature since the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not by other non-proteolytic enzymes. mitomycin c and uv light did not affect the activity of the bacteriocin, while chloroform extraction completely destroyed their activity. exposure to surfactant resulted in an increase in titre, except nonidet p-40, which led to total loss of activity. no bacteriocin adsorption was detected at ph 1 to 2, whereas 100% bacteriocin adsorption was found at ph 6.5. based on tricine sds-page the estimated molecular mass of bacteriocin was 54 kda. no plasmid was found to present in the isolate.

TI  == molecular identification of lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  == puba or carima is a brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. a total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de man, rogosa and sharpe agar (mrs); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. in all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 cfu/g). 16s-23s rrna ardra pattern assigned 116 isolates to the lactobacillus genus, represented by the species lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). reca gene-multiplex pcr analysis revealed that l. plantarum group isolates belonged to lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based pcr using the primer eric2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). the lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. all the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. this antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. this study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of lactobacillus spp. of puba.

TI  == removal of 3-methylindole by lactic acid bacteria
AB  == 3-methylindole (3mi) is a substance with an unpleasant odor that is found in intact male pigs and is known to negatively affect consumers of pork. the growth  of four strains of lactic acid bacteria [lactobacillus brevis 1.12 (l. brevis 1.12), l. plantarum 102, l. casei 6103 and l. plantarum atcc8014] in incubation medium with 3mi was studied. the four strains were tested for their ability to remove 3mi from the medium. the growth of l. brevis 1.12 remained steady as the levels of 3mi increased 3mi from 0.2 to 1.0 mug/ml. the 3mi removal ability of l. brevis 1.12 was the strongest among the four strains, and the highest removal rate was 65.35+/-0.3% in 1 ml incubation medium containing 1.0 mug/ml 3mi for 120 h. furthermore, the supernatant fluid of the fermentation broth of l. brevis 1.12 had a stronger ability to remove 3mi than cell pellets and cell extracts and the  removal rate was 14.4+/-0.3% in 24 h. further results indicate that the mode of removal of 3mi was not through the physical binding of cells by l. brevis 1.12.

TI  == a review on traditional turkish fermented non-alcoholic beverages: microbiota, fermentation process and quality characteristics.
AB  == shalgam juice, hardaliye, boza, ayran (yoghurt drink) and kefir are the most known traditional turkish fermented non-alcoholic beverages. the first three are  obtained from vegetables, fruits and cereals, and the last two ones are made of milk. shalgam juice, hardaliye and ayran are produced by lactic acid fermentation. their microbiota is mainly composed of lactic acid bacteria (lab).  lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei in shalgam fermentation and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei and lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum in hardaliye fermentation are predominant. ayran is traditionally prepared by mixing yoghurt with water and salt. yoghurt starter cultures are used in industrial ayran production. on the other hand, both alcohol and lactic acid fermentation occur in boza and kefir. boza is prepared by using a mixture of maize, wheat and rice or their flours and  water. generally previously produced boza or sourdough/yoghurt are used as starter culture which is rich in lactobacillus spp. and yeasts. kefir is prepared by inoculation of raw milk with kefir grains which consists of different species  of yeasts, lab, acetic acid bacteria in a protein and polysaccharide matrix. the  microbiota of boza and kefir is affected from raw materials, the origin and the production methods. in this review, physicochemical properties, manufacturing technologies, microbiota and shelf life and spoilage of traditional fermented beverages were summarized along with how fermentation conditions could affect rheological properties of end product which are important during processing and storage.

TI  == putrescine production from different amino acid precursors by lactic acid bacteria from wine and cider.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the production of biogenic amines and particularly putrescine in lactic acid bacteria (lab) related to wine and cider.  we applied an analytical protocol that involves the use of pcr and tlc techniques to determine the production of putrescine from different precursors. moreover, we also studied the ability of the lactobacillus and pediococcus tested to produce histamine and tyramine. the results showed that the majority of the lactobacillus brevis analyzed harbour both agdi and tdc genes and are tyramine and putrescine producers. conversely, among the other lab tested, only one lactobacillus hilgardii and one pediococcus pentosaceus produced putrescine. the agdi gene was  also detected in two other lab (lactobacillus mali and pediococcus parvulus), but no putrescine production was observed. finally, hdc gene and histamine production were found in strains (l. hilgardii 5211, isolated from wine, and lactobacillus casei 18, isolated from cider) that were not putrescine producers.

TI  == immunomodulatory and anti-allergic effects of orally administered lactobacillus species in ovalbumin-sensitized mice.
AB  == we investigated the effects of orally administered probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus species) as allergic immune modulators in ovalbumin (ova)-sensitized mice. balb/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with ova twice at a 2-week interval for allergy sensitization. the mice were then orally administered lactobacillus casei yit9029 (l1), l. casei hy7201 (l2), l. brevis hy7401 (l3), or l. plantarum hy20301 (l4) every 2 days for 3 weeks. total ige levels significantly decreased in sera of l3-administered mice but increased in the other groups. ova-specific ige levels decreased slightly in sera of mice administered l1, l3, and l4 but increased significantly in l2-administered mice.  in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (pca) using sera from administered mice, only the l3-administered group showed reaction inhibition. high expression of tlr-2 with interferon (ifn)-gamma stimulation on peripheral blood mononuclear cells occurred in l3- or l4-administered mice. th1 cytokines, including ifn-gamma and interleukin (il)- 12, increased in splenocytes of l3-administered mice; however,  il-4 decreased in l1- and l4-administered groups; il-5 decreased in all experimental groups. il-6 decreased in the l3-administered group; and il-10 decreased in l1-, l2-, and l3-administered groups. l3 induced antiallergic effects by increasing th1 cytokines, decreasing th2 cytokines, and inhibiting the pca reaction, whereas l2 administration increased allergic effects.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == probiotic potential of lactobacillus spp. isolated from brazilian regional ovine  cheese.
AB  == twelve lactobacillus isolates from brazilian starter-free ovine cheeses were evaluated for their probiotic potential. the strains were identified by 16s rdna  sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (7), lb. brevis (2), lb. casei (2) and lb.  parabuchneri (1). all strains showed variable resistance to gastric juices and relative tolerance to pancreatin and bile salts. only five strains of lb. plantarum could not deconjugate the sodium salt of taurodeoxycholic acid. autoaggregation ability after 24 h was above 50% and hydrophobicity was higher than 60% for most strains. all lactobacilli could inhibit linolenic acid oxidation, except lb. parabuchneri strain, whereas none of them could scavenge dpph radical. beta-galactosidase activity ranged from 47.7 to 2503 miller units.  inhibition of food pathogens listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium was demonstrated and the production of organic acids could be associated with this effect. the lactobacillus strains from brazilian regional ovine cheese showed interesting functional characteristics, mainly the strains lb. brevis sm-b and lb. plantarum  sm-i. both presented high acid tolerance. in addition, lb. brevis sm-b also displayed remarkable antioxidant activity and lb. plantarum sm-i was the highest  beta-galactosidase producer, exhibited high autoaggregation and hydrophobicity properties.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

TI  == fermentation quality and chemical composition of shrub silage treated with lactic acid bacteria inoculants and cellulase additives.
AB  == effects of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inoculants and cellulase additives on fermentation quality and chemical compositions of shrub silages were studied by using a small-scale fermentation system. two lab inoculants of qingbao (lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus acidilacticii, lactobacillus casei and clostridium phage) and caihe (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis and pediococcus acidilactici) and a commercial cellulase made from trichoderma reesei were used as additives for intermediate pea-shrub, rush bushclover, arborescent ceratoides and shrubby silage preparation. the crude protein, neutral detergent fiber and water-soluble carbohydrate contents of the four shrub materials were 10.1-14.2, 62.6-67.2 and 1.9-3.5% on a dry matter basis, respectively. all shrub  silages had ph 3.40-4.43, ammonia-n 0.1-0.2% g/kg and lactic acid 1.3-2.9% on a fresh matter basis. the silage quality of lab-inoculated silages did not have a greater effect than control silages, except shrubby silage preparation. silages treated with the cellulase, the ph of rush bushclover and shrubby sweetvetch silage were significantly (p < 0.05) lower and the lactic acid content were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the control silages. the results confirmed that shrub contained a relatively high content of crude protein; its silages can  be preserved in good quality, and they are new potential resources for livestock  feed.

TI  == fructooligosaccharides metabolism and effect on bacteriocin production in lactobacillus strains isolated from ensiled corn and molasses.
AB  == fructo- (fos) and galacto-oligosaccharides have been used to promote the growth of probiotics, mainly those from lactobacillus genus. however, only few reports have evaluated the effect of prebiotics on bacteriocins activity and production.  in this work, we characterized the effect of fos supplementation on the growth, lactic and acetic acids production, and antimicrobial activity of crude extracts  obtained from lactobacillus strains isolated from ensiled corn and molasses. seven out of 28 isolated lactobacillus, belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus brevis, showed antimicrobial activity  against listeria innocua. among them, the strain l. plantarum le5 showed antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes and enteroccocus faecalis;  while the l. plantarum le27 strain showed antimicrobial effect against l. monocytogenes, e. faecalis, escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis. this antimicrobial activity in most of the cases was obtained only after fos supplementation. in summary, these results show the feasibility to increase the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus bacteriocins by supplementing the growth  medium with fos.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == [comparative clinical efficacy of a probiotic vs. an antibiotic in the treatment  of patients with intestinal bacterial overgrowth and chronic abdominal functional distension: a pilot study].
AB  == introduction: patients with intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) are usually treated with different antibiotics. certain probiotics have proved to be clinically effective in patients with abdominal distension. objective: to compare the short-term clinical efficacy of metronidazol vs. a probiotic in patients with sibo and functional chronic abdominal distension. patients and methods. this was  a randomized prospective pilot study. the study population consisted of 50 patients with chronic abdominal distension (rome iii criteria) and diagnosis of sibo made by a lactulose h2 breath test. patients were consecutively randomized to receive either metronidazol or a probiotic. the metronidazol group consisted of 25 subjects (23 women, median age 49 +/- 19 years old), who received metronidazol (flagyl), 500 mg bid for 5 days. the probiotic group consisted of 25 subjects (20 women, median age 58 +/- 19 years old). the probiotic administered to the latter group contained lactobacillus casei (3.3 x 10(7) ufc), lactobacillus plantarum (3.3 x 10(7) ufc), streptococcus faecalis (3.3 x 10(7) ufc) and bifidobacterium brevis (1.0 x 10(6) ufc) (bioflora) and 5 ml bid were administered for 5 days. both groups went on the same diet, which consisted in reduced consumption of alcohol, legumes, dairy products and leafy green vegetables. response to treatment was assessed by an independent questioner 15 days post treatment. a five-level overall response questionnaire was used. responses included much better, better, the same, worse, and much worse. better and much better were considered positive responses. results: thirteen (52%) subjects receiving metronidazol and 20 (82%) receiving the probiotic referred clinical improvement after the treatment. a statistically significant difference  favoured the use of the probiotic (p = 0.036). all the study patients completed treatment. no adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were observed.  conclusions: based on this pilot study results, we can suggest that the probiotic herein used has a higher efficacy than metronidazol in the early clinical response of patients with chronic abdominal distension and sibo.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == growth characterization of individual rye sourdough bacteria by isothermal microcalorimetry.
AB  == aims: the present work tests the feasibility of the isothermal microcalorimetry method to study the performance of individual lactic acid bacteria during solid-state fermentation in rye sourdough. another aim was to elucidate the key factors leading to the formation of different microbial consortia in laboratory and industrial sourdough during continuous backslopping propagation. methods and  results: strains of the individual lab isolated from industrial and laboratory sourdough cycle were grown in 10 kgy irradiated rye dough in vials of an isothermal calorimeter and the power-time curves were obtained. sugars, organic acids and free amino acids in the sourdough were measured. the od-time curves of  the lab strains during growth in flour extract or mrs (de man, rogosa and sharpe) broth were also determined. the maximum specific growth rates of lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus and leuconostoc citreum strains that dominated in backslopped laboratory sourdough were higher than those of lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus panis, lactobacillus vaginalis, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus pontis strains originating from industrial  sourdough. industrial strains had higher specific growth rates below ph 4.8. it was supposed that during long-run industrial backslopping processes, the oxygen sensitive species start to dominate because of the o(2) protective effect of rye  sourdough. conclusions: measurements of the power-time curves revealed that the lab strains dominating in the industrial sourdough cycle had better acid tolerance but lower maximum growth rate and oxygen tolerance than species isolated from a laboratory sourdough cycle. significance and impact of the study: isothermal microcalorimetry combined with chemical analysis is a powerful method  for characterization of sourdough fermentation process and determination of growth characteristics of individual bacteria in sourdough.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei strain shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in mice.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == development of a highly efficient protein-secreting system in recombinant lactobacillus casei.
AB  == the available techniques for heterologous protein secretion in lactobacillus strains are limited. the aim of the present study was to develop an efficient protein-secretion system using recombinant lactobacilli for various applications  such as live delivery of biotherapeutics. for the construction of expression vectors, the lactobacillus brevis slpa promoter, lactobacillus casei prtp signal  sequence, and mouse il-10 sequences were used as a model system. interestingly, the slpa promoter exhibited strong activity in l. casei contrary to previous observations. in order to stabilize replication of the plasmid in e. coli, a removable terminator sequence was built into the promoter region. for the improvement of secretion efficiency, a dtnsd oligopeptide was added to the cleavage site of signal peptidase. the resulting plasmids provided remarkably efficient il-10 secretion. accumulation of the protein in the culture supernatant varied widely according to the ph conditions. by analysis of the secreted protein, formation of homodimers and biological activity, il-10 was confirmed to  be functional. the presently constructed plasmids could be useful tools for heterologous protein-secretion in l. casei.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

AB  == aims: to study glycosidase activities of a lactobacillus brevis strain and to isolate an intracellular beta-glucosidase from this strain. methods and results:  lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from a commercially available starter culture preparation for malolactic fermentation were tested for beta-glycosidase activities. a strain of lact. brevis showing high intracellular beta-d-glucosidase, beta-d-xylosidase and alpha-l-arabinosidase activities was selected for purification and characterization of its beta-glucosidase. the pure  glucosidase from lact. brevis has also side activities of xylosidase, arabinosidase and cellobiosidase. it is a homotetramer of 330 kda and has an isoelectric point at ph 3.5. the k(m) for p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside is 0.22 and 1.14 mmol l(-1), respectively. the beta-glucosidase activity was strongly inhibited by gluconic acid delta-lactone, partially by glucose and gluconate, but not by fructose. ethanol and methanol were found to increase the activity up to twofold. the free  enzyme was stable at ph 7.0 (t(1/2) = 50 day) but not at ph 4.0 (t(1/2) = 4 days). conclusions: the beta-glucosidase from lact. brevis is widely different to that characterized from lactobacillus casei (coulon et al. 1998) and lactobacillus plantarum (sestelo et al. 2004). the high tolerance to fructose and ethanol, the low inhibitory effect of glucose on the enzyme activity and the good long-term stability could be of great interest for the release of aroma compounds during winemaking. significance and impact of the study: although the release of  aroma compounds by lab has been demonstrated by several authors, little information exists on the responsible enzymes. this study contains the first characterization of an intracellular beta-glucosidase isolated from a wine-related strain of lact. brevis.

TI  == kinetics of microbial hydrogenation of free linoleic acid to conjugated linoleic  acids.
AB  == aims: to investigate the ability of selected probiotic bacterial strains to produce conjugated linoleic acid (cla) and also to estimate the biohydrogenation  kinetics of lactobacillus acidophilus on the production of cla from free linoleic acid (la). methods and results: six probiotic bacteria, lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus gg, lact. acidophilus adh, and bifidobacterium longum b6, lact. brevis, and lact. casei, were used to examine their ability to convert la to cla. la tolerance was evaluated by addition of different la concentrations in mrs broth.  lact. acidophilus showed the major tolerant to la and the greatest cla-producing  ability (36-48 microg ml(-1) of cla). the rate-controlling steps were k(2) and k(1) for the addition of 1 and 3 mg ml(-1) of la, respectively. the percentage of cla conversion was higher in mrs broth supplemented with 1 mg ml(-1) (65%) than 3 mg ml(-1) (26%). conclusion: the results provide useful information and new approach for understanding the biohydrogenation mechanisms of cla production. significance and impact of the study: this study would help elucidate the pathway from la to stearic acid (sa), known as biohydrogenation. in addition, the use of  selected probiotic bacteria might lead to a significant improvement in food safety.

TI  == evidence for in vitro anti-genotoxicity of cheese non-starter lactobacilli.
AB  == the inhibition of direct acting dna reactive agents by 63 non-starter lactobacilli isolated from raw ewes milk cheeses was examined by short-term assay (sos-chromotest) and compared with already characterized starter lactobacilli. the screening revealed strains active against the nitroarene 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (nqo) and the alkylating agent n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) in different species of the genus lactobacillus (l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. brevis, lactobacillus spp.). it was proved that the anti-genotoxicity was strain-dependent, and always  associated with spectroscopic modification of genotoxins. the frequency of strains inhibiting nitroarene genotoxicity was comparable for non-starter and starter lactobacilli, whereas inhibition of the alkylating agent was largely predominant in non-starter isolates. seventeen strains presented inhibitory activity against both genotoxins. dna rapd-pcr performed with m13, pro-up and rpo2 primers on the lactobacilli under examination showed genetic diversity in these strains. the non-starter isolates clustered in seven groups and the strains presenting a high degree of activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide clustered in a single group with a similarity around 75%. interestingly, the strains with anti-genotoxic properties also showed acid-bile tolerance, indicating that the autochthonous lactobacilli which survive cheese ripening may also reach the gut as viable cells and could prevent genotoxin dna damage to enterocytes, as is desirable for probiotic bacteria.

TI  == [study on application of rep-pcr fingerprint in rapid identification of beer-spoilager].
AB  == the application potential of rep-pcr in typing beer-spoilage isolates was studied. the effects of different factors, including dna templates and primers, on the quality and reproducibility of fingerprints were investigated. the ctab protocol was shown to be the feasible method for dna extraction. primers boxa1r and (gtg)5 were used in rep-pcr, and the pcr products were sequenced to identify  strains isolated from two breweries. rep-pcr fingerprint profiles were obtained by using gelcompar ii software. cluster analysis showed that the isolates belonging to lactobacillus brevis, l. buchneri, l. casei/paracasei, l. plantarum  are divided into 2 or 3 subgroups. in addition, the two rep-pcr fingerprint profiles complemented with each other in typing these isolates. combining the similarity coefficient cut-off (scc) of species, 9 unknown isolates were identified rapidly by using both fingerprint databases. the results indicate that rep-pcr is a simple, reliable and promising method for rapid identification of beer-spoilager.

TI  == detoxification of mycotoxins by probiotic preparation for broiler chickens.
AB  == biological decontamination of mycotoxins using microorganisms is one of the well  known strategies for the management of mycotoxins in foods and feeds. among the different potential decontaminating microorganisms,saccharomyces cerevisiae and lactic acid bacteria represent unique groups, which are widely used in food fermentation and preservation. the aim of this study was to determine the influence of spontaneous fermentation with the use of probiotic bacteria and yeast (lactobacillus paracasei/casei lock 0920,l. brevis lock 0944,l. plantarum lock 0945,saccharomyces cerevisiae lock 0142), on reduction of sum of aflatoxines (b1, b2, g1, g2) and ochratoxin a concentration during fermentation and the microflora pattern during fermentaton. the probiotic bacteria and yeast applied creates a starter culture for flour fermentation that has a stable feature of detoxication of aflatoxines and especially ochratoxin a.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == chitosan oligosaccharides, dp 2-8, have prebiotic effect on the bifidobacterium bifidium and lactobacillus sp.
AB  == in order to investigate the prebiotic potential of chitosan oligosaccharide (cos), prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis of fully deacetylated chitosan polymer, the effect of cos on bacterial growth was studied. the degree of polymerization (dp) of cos was determined by maldi-tof mass spectrometry, and the cos was found  to be composed of dimer (33.6%), trimer (16.9%), tetramer (15.8%), pentamer (12.4%), hexamer (8.3%), heptamer (7.1%), and octamer (5.9%). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of chitosan polymer against lactic acid bacteria  and bifidobacteria were below 0.31%. however, this only applied to two strains, the other bacteria tested grew on mrs broth containing 5% cos. the effects of cos on the growth of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria were compared with those of fructo-oligosaccharide (fos). fos was found to have a growth stimulatory effect on only three strains: bifidobacterium bifidium, b. infantis and lactobacillus casei. however, cos stimulated the growth of most lactobacillus sp. and b. bifidium kctc 3440. the amount of the growth and the specific growth rate  of b. bifidium increased with increasing cos concentration. the cultivation time  required to obtain maximum growth was reduced to about 25% in mrs broth supplemented with 0.2-0.4% cos. these results demonstrate that cos has considerable bifidogenic potential. both cell growth and specific growth rates of l. brevis in mrs broth supplemented with 0.1% cos increased by 25%. the present study shows that cos stimulates the growth of some enteric bacteria, and that cos has potential use as a prebiotic health-food.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from the vagina: identification, hydrogen peroxide production and nonoxynol-9 resistance.
AB  == background: lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. some species of lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) producers. nonoxynol-9 (n-9) is a nonionic detergent and is the active component of many spermicidal preparations. it immobilizes sperm by disrupting the cell membrane and is believed to act similarly on a number of bacteria and viruses. it is known that n-9 inhibits lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1%. purpose: the present study was conducted to identify the species of lactobacillus isolated from vaginal fluids of reproductive-age women and to characterize the h(2)o(2)-producing and n-9-resistant strains in an argentine population. results: we identified lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. gasseri, l. jensenii, l. casei subsp. casei, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii as the most frequent species. in this argentine, south american population, 62% of women had h(2)o(2)-producing vaginal lactobacilli. we found a high number of sensitive  strains. sixty-two h(2)o(2)-producer strains were detected, 50 (80.6%) strains were sensitive to n-9 and 12 (19.4%) strains were resistant to the inhibitory effect of n-9. discussion: the vaginal microecologic findings are comparable to those found in other populations and suggest that (1) vaginal microecologic conditions are likely to be similar among argentine women as in other countries,  and (2) n-9 may have deleterious effects as in other populations.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == [antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  == objective: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. design: review of literature. setting: charles university at prague, pharmaceutical faculty at hradec kralove. methods: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. conclusions: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. the efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of c. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. essential oils present in the cayenne pepper (capsodum  frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against c. albicans as well. clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. the effects of chinese leek are similar to garlic. propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the  yeast strains decreases in the following order: c. albicans > c. tropicalis > c.  crusei > c. guilliermondii. its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. tea trea oil (melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for c. crusei and c. norvengensis. in the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of lactobacilus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14, b-54 may be recommended. moreover there are suitable strains  of l. brevis cd-2, l. salivarius fv-2, l. gasseri mb 335, l. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (l. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (l. gasseri). the strains of l. acidophilus crl 1294 and l. salivarius crl 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with candida. it should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of lactobacillus (especially l. casei and l. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract.  no protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin e, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.

AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  == the development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partial 16s rrna genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to streptococcus thermophilus or saccharococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus fermentum. the middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus paracasei, l. fermentum, and lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by dgge during this stage. bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of  residual maltooligosaccharides. by 70 h, two new pcr bands were detected on dgge  gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. the bacteria were phylogenetically related to lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had  previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in japan. these were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as mrs. their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.

AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) were isolated from 12 italian ewe cheeses representing six different types of cheese, which in several cases were produced by different manufacturers. a total of 400 presumptive lactobacillus isolates were obtained, and 123 isolates and 10 type strains were subjected to phenotypic, genetic, and cell wall protein characterization analyses. phenotypically, the cheese isolates included 32% lactobacillus plantarum isolates, 15% l. brevis isolates, 12% l. paracasei subsp. paracasei isolates, 9%  l. curvatus isolates, 6% l. fermentum isolates, 6% l. casei subsp. casei isolates, 5% l. pentosus isolates, 3% l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum isolates, and 1% l. rhamnosus isolates. eleven percent of the isolates were not phenotypically identified. although a randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis based on three primers and clustering by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (upgma) was useful for partially differentiating the 10 type strains, it did not provide a species-specific dna band or a combination of bands which permitted complete separation of all the species considered. in contrast, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cell wall protein profiles clustered by upgma were species specific and resolved the nslab. the only exceptions were isolates phenotypically identified as l. plantarum and l. pentosus or as l. casei subsp. casei and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, which were grouped together. based on protein profiles, italian ewe cheeses frequently contained four different species and 3 to 16 strains. in general, the cheeses produced from raw ewe milk contained a larger number of more diverse strains than the cheeses produced from pasteurized  milk. the same cheese produced in different factories contained different species, as well as strains that belonged to the same species but grouped in different rapd clusters.

TI  == [cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  == the possibility of using the genera lactobacillus and lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. the prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mrna, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). to prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. high copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in l. plantarum and l. pentosus strains. several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from staphylococcus aureus  plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. the vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including l. casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum and l. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. but the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. l. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. in addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous  genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.

TI  == strain-dependent induction of cytokine profiles in the gut by orally administered lactobacillus strains.
AB  == different lactobacillus strains are frequently used in consumer food products. in addition, recombinant lactobacilli which contain novel expression vectors can now be used in immunotherapeutic applications such as oral vaccination strategies and in t cell tolerance induction approaches for autoimmune disease. both for food and clinical applications of lactobacilli, proper selection of wild type strains  is crucial. for that purpose, eight different common lactobacillus strains were analysed with respect to mucosal induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, iga-producing plasma cells in the gut, as well as systemic antibody responses against a parenterally administered antigen. immunohistochemical analysis of cytokine-producing cells in the gut villi showed no significant induction of the cytokines il-1alpha, ifn-gamma, il-4 or il-10 after oral administration of wild type lactobacillus strains. in contrast, oral administration of l. reuteri and l. brevis induced expression of the proinflammatory/th1 cytokines tnf-alpha, il-2 and/or il-1beta. oral administration of these two strains and l. fermentum also significantly enhanced  the igg response against parenterally administered haptenated chicken gamma globulin (tnp-cgg). the five other strains did not show this adjuvanticity. l. reuteri induced relatively high levels of igg2a compared to l. murines, a nonadjuving lactobacillus strain. these findings imply that different lactobacillus strains induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles and possess differential intrinsic adjuvanticity. this suggests that rational lactobacillus strain selection provides a strategy to influence cytokine expression and thereby influence immune responses.

TI  == development of a rapid method for the identification of lactobacillus spp. isolated from naturally fermented italian sausages using a polymerase chain reaction-temperature gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == a rapid method for the identification of lactobacillus spp. isolated from naturally fermented italian sausages was developed. it is based on the amplification of a small fragment from the 16s rrna gene followed by temperature  gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge). lactobacillus sakei, l. curvatus, l. alimentarius, l. casei, l. plantarum and l. brevis, obtained from international collections, were used to optimize the method. thiry-nine strains of lactobacillus spp. were isolated from naturally fermented sausages and, after traditional identification, were tested by the pcr-tgge protocol developed. no differences were observed comparing the results obtained, apart from five strains identified as l. curvatus that showed a pcr-tgge profile identical to l. sakei.

TI  == antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  == seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.

TI  == brewing spoilage lactobacilli detected using monoclonal antibodies to bacterial surface antigens.
AB  == a panel of thirteen monoclonal antibodies (mabs) was assembled that reacts with surface antigens on eight of eleven lactobacillus brewing spoilage organisms, including one or more of l. brevis, l. buchneri, l. casei-alactosus, l. plantarum, or unspeciated isolate(s). immunoblotting was done to identify the antigens involved in mab binding. antigen stability in situ was tested by protease treatment and by surface antigen extraction of washed bacteria. protease susceptibility of extracted surface antigens was also examined. in most cases, lactobacillus surface antigens detected by the mabs appear to be noncovalently bound proteins readily altered or removed from the bacterium by various environmental conditions. this research identifies brewing conditions that need to be tested to ascertain whether bacterial surface antigen-reactive mabs can be  used for the rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of lactobacillus brewing spoilage organisms.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.

TI  == high level heterologous protein production in lactococcus and lactobacillus using a new secretion system based on the lactobacillus brevis s-layer signals.
AB  == a secretion cassette, based on the expression and secretion signals of a s-layer  protein (slpa) from lactobacillus brevis, was constructed. e. coli beta-lactamase (bla) was used as the reporter protein to determine the functionality of the s-layer signals for heterologous expression and secretion in lactococcus lactis,  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus casei using a low-copy-number plasmid derived from pgk12. in all hosts tested, the bla gene was expressed under the slpa signals and all bla activity was secreted to the culture medium. the lb. brevis s-layer promoters were very efficiently recognized in l. lactis, lb. brevis and lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. gasseri the slpa promoter region appeared to be recognized at a lower level and in lb. casei the level of transcripts was below the detection limit. the production of bla was mainly restricted to the exponential phase of growth. the highest yield of bla was obtained with l. lactis and lb. brevis. without ph control, substantial degradation of bla occurred during prolonged cultivations with all lactic acid bacteria (lab) tested. when growing l. lactis and lb. brevis under ph control, the bla activity could be stabilized also at the stationary phase. l. lactis produced up to 80 mg/l of bla which to our knowledge  represents the highest amount of a heterologous protein secreted by lab so far. the short production phase implied a very high rate of secretion with a calculated value of 5 x 10(5) bla molecules/cell per h. such a high rate was also observed with lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. brevis the competition between the wild type slpa gene and the secretion construct probably lowered the rate of bla  production. the results obtained indicate wide applicability of the lb. brevis slpa signals for efficient protein production and secretion in lab.

TI  == characterization of lactobacilli by southern-type hybridization with a lactobacillus plantarum pyrdfe probe.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, and lactobacillus paraplantarum  (m.-c. curk, j.-c. hubert, and f. bringel, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 46:595-598, 1996) can hardly be distinguished on the basis of their phenotypes. unlike l. plantarum and l. paraplantarum, l. pentosus ferments glycerol and xylose but not  melezitose. we identified two l. pentosus strains (cnrz 1538 and cnrz 1544) which ferment glycerol and melezitose but not xylose. alpha-methyl-d-mannoside was fermented by 66% of the l. plantarum strains tested but not by l. paraplantarum strains. in this paper we describe a simple method to identify l. plantarum, l. pentosus, and l. paraplantarum. this method is based on nonradioactive southern-type hybridization between bgli dna digests of the lactobacilli tested and a dna probe (l. plantarum pyrdfe genes from strain ccm 1904). a total of 68 lactobacilli were classified into five groups on the basis of the bands detected. two groups contained l. plantarum strains; one of these groups contained 31 strains, including the type strain, and was characterized by bands at 7, 4, and 1 kb, and the other group contained strain lp 85-2 and was characterized by bands at 5 and 1.1 kb. only one band (a band at around 7 kb) was detected in the strains belonging to the l. pentosus group, and two bands (at 4 and 1 kb) were found in the strains belonging to the l. paraplantarum group. no hybridization was detected in the last group, which contained lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and lactobacillus leichmannii strains.

TI  == comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  == a total of 169 lactobacillus strains from 12 species (lb. acidophilus, lb. brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lb. fermentum, lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. plantarum and lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates  and a tryptic digest of casein. within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. furthermore, differences were observed between the lactobacillus species and lc. lactis. lb. helveticus had by  far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. on the other hand, lb. fermentum and lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. a more detailed study with highly proteolytic lactobacillus strains indicated that  at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. compared with lc. lactis, the lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on  glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.

TI  == the lysins of bacteriophages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == this short review highlights the complete absence of literature on lysins of bacteriophages infecting species like s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, pediococcus and leuconostoc species, l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum  and l. brevis, which are also widely used in the dairy industry. the lysins described share some similar biochemical characteristics: optimal ph and temperature, site of hydrolysis inside the peptidoglycan, and some activators and inhibitors. the cloning of the genes encoding these lysins only began in the last few years and four of them have been completely sequenced. in the future, these lysin genes could be interestingly compared to the host autolysin(s) gene(s). by  contrast, the passage of phage lysins through the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell in order to reach the peptidoglycan (via a signal sequence or the presence of a holin) seems not to be clearly resolved. the presence of a second open-reading frame upstream from the gene of the lysin, enabling a putative holin to be encoded, has already been suggested. no doubt our ever increasing knowledge about bacteriophage genome organization will help to elucidate this question. meanwhile the obtention of a lactococcus strain with an autolytic phenotype, using a bacteriophage lysin gene, as well as the successful use of purified pl1 lysin to obtain protoplasts of l. casei encourage us to continue to explore the field of bacteriophage lysins.

TI  == characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented greek  dry salami.
AB  == a total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. the majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus weissella (120), which was recently proposed (collins et al., 1993) to include leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. meat streptobacteria were identified as lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and l. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable  and, thus designated l. sake/curvatus. non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as l. plantarum (34 strains), l. farciminis (10), l. coryniformis (1) and l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). the majority of the weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as w. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described w. hellenica (collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled w. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. the latter group comprised strains that produced d(l)-lactate. the remaining weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to w. minor (31) and w. halotolerans (3). other species identified were enterococcus faecium (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), l. brevis (1) and pediococcus sp. (1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus has clustered trna genes.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to detect large trna gene clusters in bacillus subtilis, bacillus badius, bacillus megaterium, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, and staphylococcus aureus. the primers were based on conserved sequences of known gram-positive bacterial trna(arg) and trna(phe) genes. this pcr procedure detected an unusually large trna gene cluster in s. aureus. pcr-generated probes were used to identify a 4.5-kb ecori fragment that contained 27 trna genes immediately 3' to an rrna operon. some of these 27 trna genes are very similar, but only 1 is exactly repeated in the cluster. the 5' end of this cluster has a gene order similar to that found in the 9- and 21-trna gene clusters of b. subtilis. the 3' end of this s. aureus cluster exhibits more similarity to the 16-trna gene cluster of b. subtilis. the 24th, 25th, and 26th trna genes of this s. aureus trna gene cluster code for three similar, unusual gly-trnas that may be used in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan in the cell wall but not in protein synthesis. southern analysis of restriction digests of s. aureus dna indicate that there are five to six rrna operons in this bacterium's genome and that most or all may have large trna gene clusters at the 3' end.

TI  == incompatibility of lactobacillus vectors with replicons derived from small cryptic lactobacillus plasmids and segregational instability of the introduced vectors.
AB  == three new lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. the shuttle vector plp3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from lactobacillus pentosus md353, an erythromycin resistance gene from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pe194, and puc19 as a replicon for escherichia coli. the vectors plpe317 and plpe323, which do not contain e. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pe194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from l. pentosus md353, respectively. these vectors and the shuttle vector plp825 (m. posno, r. j. leer, j. m. m. van rijn, b. c. lokman, and p. h. pouwels, p. 397-401, in a. t. ganesan and j. a. hoch, ed., genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into lactobacillus casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of dna. plasmid dna analysis of l. pentosus md353 transformants revealed that the introduction of plp3537 or plpe323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. remarkably, plpe317 could only be introduced into an l. pentosus md353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb  plasmid. the curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. however, plpe323 is stable in three of four lactobacillus strains tested so far.

TI  == microflora associated with experimental root surface caries in humans.
AB  == this study describes the microflora from actively progressing root surface caries lesions, in which mineral loss had been determined by quantitative microradiography. the caries lesions were produced experimentally in root surface specimens from human molars inserted in lower partial dentures carried for 3 months by six elderly individuals. a total of 780 bacterial isolates were identified from 13 plaque samples, collected with a punch technique, and six dentin samples. the composition of the microflora showed distinct individual differences. the microflora from plaque samples associated with the highest mineral loss was dominated by either actinomyces viscosus or a combination of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and f) and lactobacillus species (l. casei and l. brevis). plaque from root surfaces with less pronounced mineral loss harbored a more complex microflora comprising gram-positive rods, mutans streptococci, streptococcus mitis biovar 1, veillonella spp., gram-negative rods, and low numbers of lactobacilli. in the latter samples, individual variations in  the proportions of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and g), actinomyces species (a. viscosus and a. naeslundii), and veillonella parvula biotypes were observed. these findings suggest that certain species or combinations of species  are more cariogenic than others and that dominance of single acidogenic species in particular is conducive to high caries activity.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, minocycline, and spiramycin, at a range of ph from 5.0 to 7.4. strains of streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. there were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. the strains tested were sensitive at ph 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/ml): l. casei (6 strains), 10-60; l. plantarum (4 strains), 40; l. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; l. brevis (1 strain), 10; and l. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. the streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/ml (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/ml (3 strains); and  10-20 micrograms/ml (2 strains). one strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/ml. chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower ph levels. the following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/ml) at ph 6.5 followed by sensitivity at ph 5.0: l. casei (atcc 15008), 40,60; l. plantarum (ch 374), 40,100; l. fermentum (ch 324) 10,40; l. acidophilus (atcc 4356), 10,40; and s. mutans (bm 52), 2,2. all of the strains of lactobacillus tested with spiramycin were resistant at ph 5.0. minocycline was less affected by changes in ph, but at ph 7.4 lactobacillus  strains were more resistant to minocycline as compared with spiramycin. both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. the lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.

AB  == the adhesive property of red blood cells of cosmonauts was investigated during various stages of their professional activity. the study was carried out using three test microorganisms: l. casei a6, l. brevis a16 and l. buchneri a14. the results show that the adhesive property of red blood cells varies during different periods of space flight. in contrast to long-duration flights, short-term flights cause greater changes in this parameter. during readaptation the adhesion of red blood cells was significantly increased as compared to that preflight and immediately postflight.

TI  == a phylogenetic analysis of lactobacilli, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l.  ruminis, l. casei, l. bifermentans, l. viridescens, l. fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 s ribosomal rnas. all lactobacillus species investigated together with p. pentosaceus and l. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus is  the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. lactobacillus, together with streptococcus and bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.

TI  == [bacteriocin typing of lactobacillus cultures using a basic set of bacteriocinogenic strains].
AB  == lactic bacilli of 15 species were divided into 78 bacteriocin types by their sensitivity spectra with respect to the main set of the bacteriocinogenic strains. l. acidophilus-l. salivarious, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. buchneri, l. helveticus, l. lactis and l. leichmannii were used in the study. the cultures were divided into 30, 9, 7, 25, 5, 20, 13, 8, 2.2 and 2 bacteriocin types respectively. the method of determining the lactic bacilli sensitivity spectra to 8 bacteriocinogenic strains of the main kit is simple and economic. it allows marking of lactic bacilli and their dividing into  bacteriocin types within the species. this may be used in taxonomy and epidemiological studies.

TI  == the microbial flora of awshari cheese with special reference to lactobacilli.
AB  == thirty-seven samples of awshari cheese and 13 of biza were examined microbiologically. penicillia occurred in 2 samples of cheese and yeasts in 21, 3 of which contained saccharomyces lactis. in 8 samples studied for the constitutive microflora, lactobacilli and streptococci were the most prevalent, with l. casei being the only lactobacillus species isolated. penicillia and yeasts occurred in all the samples of biza, with saccharomyces lactis being encountered in 5 out of 6 samples examined for the type of yeasts. the microbial  flora consisted primarily of lactobacilli. out of 98 lactobacilli isolated from 10 samples 55 were identified as betabacteria: 41 were attached to l. brevis, 13  l. buchneri and 1 l. pasteurianus. the remaining 43 isolates were streptobacteria: 21 belonged to l. coryniformis, 5 l. casei ssp pseudoplantarum,  3 ssp casei and 1 ssp alactosus, 2 l. plantarum ssp plantarum and 1 ssp arabinosus, 1 l. xylosus, 5 motile streptobacteria and 4 unidentifiable.

TI  == reassembly of the regularly arranged subunits in the cell wall os lactobacillus brevis and their reattachment to cell walls.
AB  == the reassembly of tetragonally arranged subunits in the cell wall of lactobacillus brevis and the reattachment of the subunits to cell wall fragments  were investigated by electron microscopy. the subunits dissociated from the cell  wall with guanidine hydrochloride (ghcl) reassembled into the same regular array  as seen in native cell wall after dialysis against neutral buffer even in the absence of specific cations. the subunits could also reattach to the cell wall fragments from which they had been removed by treatment with ghcl, sodium dodecyl sulfate or cold trichloroacetic acid but not to those treated with hot formamide. heterologous reattachment of the subunits occurred on cell wall fragments obtained from l. fermentum but not on those from l plantarum or l. casei subsp. casei. on the basis of these observations and chemical analyses of the cell wall  fragments, the subunits of l. brevis appeared to be bound by hydrogen bonds to a  neutral polysaccharide moiety in the cell wall but not to peptidoglycan or teichoic acid.

TI  == microbial determinations by flow cytometry.
AB  == recent improvements in the optics and electronics of flow cytometry systems, as well as in staining techniques, permit the assay of such minute cellular constituents as the dna and protein contents of micro-organisms. to assess the usefulness of this technique, dna and protein content distributions were determined in escherichia coli, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, chlorella kessleri 8k, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida utilis, schizosaccharomyces pombe and euglena gracilis. investigations of the dna content distributions of polyploid strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that the method can be used to determine ploidy. the rapidity of flow cytometry measurements allows accurate determinations in large populations.

TI  == [the microflora of sour dough. iv. communication: bacterial composition of sourdough starters genus lactobacillus beijerinck (author's transl)].
AB  == the bacterial composition of three so called pure culture sourdough starters of varying origin was investigated. 245 isolates were obtained all belonging to the  genus beijerinck. according to their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics they were classified into the subgroups: thermobacterium (l. acidophilus), streptobacterium (l. casei, l. plantarum, l. farciminis, l. alimentarius) and betabacterium (l. brevis, l. brevis var. lindneri, l buchneri,  l. fermentum, l. fructi vorans). in the three sourdough starters the identified lactic organisms varied in number and proportion. in starter preparation "a" only the varieties l. fructi vorans and l. fermentum were present. preparation "b" contained a great variety of microorganisms with l. brevis and l. brevis l. lindneri predominating. in starter "c" l. brevis, l. plantarum and l. alimentarius predominated.

TI  == [the fecal flora of man. iii. communication: the composition of lactobacillus flora of different age groups (author's transl)].
AB  == from fecal flora of 66 infants aged 3 to 220 days, 29 children aged 4 to 6 years, 42 adults aged 20 to 64 years and 21 senile persons aged 65 to 86 years, the lactobacillus flora was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. in the feces of babies only the resident lactobacilli (l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. fermenti) were found, while in the feces of children, adults and senile persons the resident lactobacilli as well as the transient lactobacilli (l. casei, l. plantarum, l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. lactis) were found simultaneously. within the lactobacillus species l. acidophilus type i, l. fermenti type iva and  l. salivarius type ia were most frequently found in the feces of all age groups.  in addition, l. acidophilus type x was also often found in the feces of senile persons. in connection with the numbers of species or types of lactobacilli in one fecal specimen, one or two species or types were demonstrated in 94,5% of positive cases of infants. with increasing age the numbers increased, especially  more than three species or types were demonstrated in 85% of positive cases. in infants in 3 different clinics, clinic-specificities were demonstrated in relation to the species or types of lactobacilli isolated: in each clinic clearly certain species or types of lactobacilli were present. the results indicate that  the composition of the lactobacillus flora in the feces is influenced by lactobacilli orally ingested.

TI  == [ability of lactobacilli in the human microflora to produce lysozyme].
AB  == lysozyme activity of 403 strains of lactobacilli were investigated; of these 26 were from foreign sets and 377 were isolated from the contents of the stomach, feces and vaginal discharge of healthy adults. the species reference of lactobacillae was confirmed by the results of study of their physiologo-biochemical properties with the aid of 45 tests. a method of agar plates was adapted to determination of lysozyme: the autoclaved suspension of micrococcus lysodeikticus (strain no. 2665) was added to the agar medium mpc-i, and lactobacilli were cultivated for 4 days in the co2 atmosphere at 37 degrees c. there was revealed the capacity of l. fermenti and l. brevis to produce lysozyme; in l. fermenti the lysozyme activity was much more frequent (p less than 0.001); strains of the rest of the species of lactobacilli differentiated by the rogosa and sharpe's classification proved to be lysozyme-negative. it was shown that the lactobacilli of the l. fermenti species, included into the microflora of the intestine and the vagina of healthy adults as a rule possessed  lysozyme activity. l. fermenti strain 90t-s4 used in the production of dry lactobacterin also produced lysozyme. all this favours an important role of l. fermenti in the protective function of the microflora.

TI  == lactobacilli on plants.
AB  == the distribution, enumeration, and identification of lactobacilli on vegetable plants were studied in an area described geographically as being subtropical and  moist. the lactobacilli were obtained, by means of quantitative enrichment procedures in rogosa's sl broth, from 35.3% of all samples incubated at 32 c, and from 15.4% of the samples incubated at 45 c. less than 10 lactobacilli/g of plant material were enumerated in 54% of all positive samples. the lactobacilli were found much less frequently and in lower numbers than were streptococci or leuconostoc mesenteroides. the most frequently isolated lactobacillus was very simular to, but not identical with, lactobacillus fermenti. it was aerogenic, grew well at both 15 and 45 c, fermented arabinose, lactose, and sucrose, and liberated ammonia from arginine. of the identified species, l. plantarum, l. fermenti, and l. brevis were the most frequently isolated, whereas l. casei, l. viridescens, l. cellobiosus, l. salivarius, and l. buchneri were obtained from small numbers of samples. the widespread but sporadic distribution of lactobacilli in low numbers seems to indicate that these organisms do not normally thrive on plant surfaces. a ternary cycle, beginning with intestinal waste, followed by mechanical distribution to and among plants, and return to the host via the oral cavity, is suggested.
