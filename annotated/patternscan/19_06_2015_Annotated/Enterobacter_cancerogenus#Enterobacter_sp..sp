TI  == enterobacter xiangfangensis sp. nov., isolated from chinese traditional sourdough, and reclassification of enterobacter sacchari zhu et al. 2013 as kosakonia sacchari comb. nov.
AB  == a gram-stain-negative bacterial strain, 10-17(t), was isolated from traditional sourdough in heilongjiang province, china. the bacterium was characterized by a polyphasic approach, including 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, rna polymerase beta subunit (rpob) gene sequence analysis, dna gyrase (gyrb) gene sequence analysis, initiation translation factor 2 (infb) gene sequence analysis, atp synthase beta subunit (atpd) gene sequence analysis, fatty acid methyl ester analysis, determination of dna g+c content, dna-dna hybridization and an analysis of phenotypic features. strain 10-17(t) was phylogenetically related to enterobacter hormaechei cip 103441(t), enterobacter cancerogenus lmg 2693(t), enterobacter asburiae jcm 6051(t), enterobacter mori lmg 25706(t), enterobacter ludwigii en-119(t) and leclercia adecarboxylata lmg 2803(t), having 99.5%, 99.3%, 98.7%, 98.5%, 98.4% and 98.4% 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, respectively. on the basis of polyphasic characterization data obtained in the present study, a novel species, enterobacter xiangfangensis sp. nov., is proposed and the type strain is 10-17(t) ( = lmg 27195(t) = ncimb 14836(t) = ccug 62994(t)). enterobacter sacchari zhu et al. 2013 was reclassified as kosakonia sacchari comb. nov. on the basis of 16s rrna, rpob, gyrb, infb and atpd gene sequence analysis and the type strain is strain sp1(t)( = cgmcc 1.12102(t) = lmg 26783(t)).

TI  == calcium carbonate precipitation by heterotrophic bacteria isolated from biofilms  formed on deteriorated ignimbrite stones: influence of calcium on eps production  and biofilm formation by these isolates.
AB  == heterotrophic caco3-precipitating bacteria were isolated from biofilms on deteriorated ignimbrites, siliceous acidic rocks, from morelia cathedral (mexico) and identified as enterobacter cancerogenus (22e), bacillus sp. (32a) and bacillus subtilis (52g). in solid medium, 22e and 32a precipitated calcite and vaterite while 52g produced calcite. urease activity was detected in these isolates and caco3 precipitation increased in the presence of urea in the liquid  medium. in the presence of calcium, eps production decreased in 22e and 32a and increased in 52g. under laboratory conditions, ignimbrite colonization by these isolates only occurred in the presence of calcium and no caco3 was precipitated.  calcium may therefore be important for biofilm formation on stones. the importance of the type of stone, here a siliceous stone, on biological colonization is emphasized. this calcium effect has not been reported on calcareous materials. the importance of the effect of calcium on eps production and biofilm formation is discussed in relation to other applications of caco3 precipitation by bacteria.

TI  == enterobacter mori sp. nov., associated with bacterial wilt on morus alba l.
AB  == two isolates of mulberry-pathogenic bacteria isolated from diseased mulberry roots were investigated in a polyphasic taxonomic study. comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis combined with rpob gene sequence analysis allocated strains r18-2(t) and r3-3 to the genus enterobacter, with enterobacter asburiae,  e. amnigenus, e. cancerogenus, e. cloacae subsp. cloacae, e. cloacae subsp. dissolvens and e. nimipressuralis as their closest relatives. cells of the isolates were gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods, 0.3-1.0 microm wide and 0.8-2.0 microm long, with peritrichous flagella, showing a dna g+c content of 55.1 +/- 0.5 mol%. calculation of a similarity index based on phenotypic features and fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analysis suggested that these isolates are members of e. cancerogenus or e. asburiae or a closely related species. biochemical data revealed that the isolates could be differentiated from their nearest neighbours by the presence of lysine decarboxylase activity and their ability to utilize d-arabitol. dna-dna relatedness also distinguished the two isolates from phylogenetically closely related enterobacter strains. based on these data, it is proposed that the isolates represent a novel species of the genus enterobacter, named enterobacter mori sp. nov. the type strain is r18-2(t)  ( = cgmcc 1.10322(t) = lmg 25706(t)).

TI  == decolorisation and detoxification of direct blue-15 by a bacterial consortium.
AB  == studies were carried out on decolorisation and biotransformation of the dye direct blue-15 into 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine (o'-dianisidine) and a sulphonated derivative by a five-member bacterial consortium. chromatographic studies revealed further complete biodegradation of 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine coupled with  release of ammonia, but the recalcitrant sulphonated derivative persisted. the microorganisms identified in the mixed consortium by 16s rdna sequence analysis were alcaligenes faecalis, sphingomonas sp. ebd, bacillus subtilis, bacillus thuringiensis and enterobacter cancerogenus. the cytotoxicity data showed a significant reduction in the toxicity (p<0.001) of the degraded dye as evidenced  from the number of viable human polymorphonuclear leukocyte cells present.
