TI  == effect of beta -glucanase and xylanase supplementation of barley- and rye-based diets on caecal microbiota of broiler chickens.
AB  == 1. the aim was to investigate the effect of grain type (barley or rye) and exogenous enzymes (beta-glucanase or xylanase) on the composition of chicken caecal microbiota as examined by classical culturing and molecular techniques (fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (fish) and terminal-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (t-rflp)). 2. plate counting revealed higher total numbers of anaerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in caecal contents of birds fed with rye-based diets than in birds fed with barley-based diets. 3. as assessed by fish analysis, the most abundant bacterial groups in the broiler caeca were clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale followed by bacteroides sp., lactobacillus sp./enterococcus sp., bifidobacterium sp. and enterobacteriaceae. for both cereal types, the enzyme supplementation significantly decreased the relative amount of enterobacteriaceae. 4. the t-rflp profiles indicated that the  caecal microbiota of birds receiving rye-based diets was more diverse than that of birds fed on barley-based diets. 5. irrespective of the method applied, the results indicate that the cereal type as well as the exogenous enzyme supplementation influence the microbiota in broiler chicken caeca, and may have the effect of reducing potentially pathogenic enterobacteriaceae populations.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.
