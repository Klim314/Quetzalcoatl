TI  == a pediatric patient with acute suppurative thyroiditis caused by eikenella corrodens.
AB  == a previously healthy 6-year-old boy had continuous fever for 6 days before admission to our hospital. his general condition was good except for pyrexia. the left lobe of the thyroid gland was swollen, red, hot, and tender, and neck movement was limited. the provisional diagnosis was upper respiratory tract infection. we demonstrated the existence of an orifice of the left piriform sinus by esophagography in this case, and made a diagnosis of acute suppurative thyroiditis caused by a piriform sinus fistula in the hypopharynx. the causative  organisms of acute suppurative thyroiditis include peptostreptococcus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and alpha-streptococcus, but the organisms responsible are commonly undetectable in clinical cases. we detected eikenella corrodens in the present patient. although eikenella species occasionally causes  acute suppurative thyroiditis in adults, it is rare for this to happen in pediatric patients. antibiotics were administered for 7 days. we also performed aspiration of the abscess on the 8th day of the illness. the abscess was reduced  in size and tenderness was relieved after aspiration. in conclusion, if a pediatric patient has swelling, heat, tenderness, and redness of the anterior neck, we should keep in mind acute suppurative thyroiditis and the possibility of a fistula. if there is an abscess, we should immediately perform aspiration, culture, and isolation, and choose the appropriate antibiotics for the causative  bacteria.

TI  == microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  == background: the bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (olp) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. methods: bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed olp from the stomatology service, department of oral surgery and stomatology, school of dental medicine, university of bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. samples were taken from olp lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. the control population did not have olp and  was recruited from the student clinic. all samples were processed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. results: significantly higher bacterial counts of bacteroides ureolyticus (p = 0.001), dialister species (sp.) (p = 0.006), staphylococcus haemolyticus (p = 0.007), and streptococcus agalactiae (p = 0.006) were found in  samples taken from olp lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of olp. significantly higher bacterial counts were found for capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus crispatus, mobiluncus curtisii, neisseria mucosa, prevotella bivia, prevotella intermedia, and s. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with olp compared to sites in control subjects (p  <0.001). conclusions: microbiologic differences were found between sites with olp and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of olp. specifically, higher counts of  staphylococci and s. agalactiae were found in olp lesions.
