TI  == genomics of streptococcus salivarius, a major human commensal.
AB  == the salivarius group of streptococci is of particular importance for humans. this group consists of three genetically similar species, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus thermophilus. s. salivarius and s. vestibularis are commensal organisms that may occasionally cause opportunistic infections in humans, whereas s. thermophilus is a food bacterium widely used in  dairy production. we developed multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and comparative  genomic analysis to confirm the clear separation of these three species. these analyses also identified a subgroup of four strains, with a core genome diverging by about 10%, in terms of its nucleotide sequence, from that of s. salivarius sensu stricto. s. thermophilus species displays a low level of nucleotide variability, due to its recent emergence with the development of agriculture. by  contrast, nucleotide variability is high in the other two species of the salivarius group, reflecting their long-standing association with humans. the species of the salivarius group have genome sizes ranging from the smallest ( approximately 1.7mb for s. thermophilus) to the largest ( approximately 2.3mb for s. salivarius) among streptococci, reflecting genome reduction linked to a narrow, nutritionally rich environment for s. thermophilus, and natural, more competitive niches for the other two species. analyses of genomic content have indicated that the core genes of s. salivarius account for about two thirds of the genome, indicating considerable variability of gene content and differences in potential adaptive features. furthermore, we showed that the genome of this species is exceptionally rich in genes encoding surface factors, glycosyltransferases and response regulators. evidence of widespread genetic exchanges was obtained, probably involving a natural competence system and the presence of diverse mobile elements. however, although the s. salivarius strains  studied were isolated from several human body-related sites (all levels of the digestive tract, skin, breast milk, and body fluids) and included clinical strains, no genetic or genomic niche-specific features could be identified to discriminate specific group.

TI  == streptococcus loxodontisalivarius sp. nov. and streptococcus saliviloxodontae sp. nov., isolated from oral cavities of elephants.
AB  == four gram-stain-positive, catalase-negative, coccoid-shaped organisms were isolated from elephant oral cavities. the isolates were tentatively identified as streptococcal species based on the results of biochemical tests. comparative 16s  rrna gene sequencing studies confirmed the organisms to be members of the genus streptococcus. two isolates (num 6304(t) and num 6312) were related most closely  to streptococcus salivarius with 96.8 % and 93.1 % similarity based on the 16s rrna gene and the rna polymerase beta subunit encoding gene (rpob), respectively, and to streptococcus vestibularis with 83.7 % similarity based on the 60 kda heat-shock protein gene (groel). the other two isolates (num 6306(t) and num 6318) were related most closely to s. vestibularis with 97.0 % and 82.9 % similarity based on the 16s rrna and groel genes, respectively, and to s. salivarius with 93.5 % similarity based on the rpob gene. based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, these isolates are suggested to represent novel species  of the genus streptococcus, for which the names streptococcus loxodontisalivarius sp. nov. (type strain num 6304(t) = jcm 19287(t) = dsm 27382(t)) and streptococcus saliviloxodontae sp. nov. (type strain num 6306(t) = jcm 19288(t) = dsm 27513(t)) are proposed.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == activity of oritavancin tested against uncommonly isolated gram-positive pathogens responsible for documented infections in hospitals worldwide.
AB  == objectives: to assess the oritavancin spectrum and activity against 2811 rarer species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), streptococci and other gram-positive species. methods: a total of 2057 cons (14 species), 674 streptococci (7 groups) and 80 other gram-positive species (3 genera) collected over a 5 year period as part of the sentry program (2008-12) were included. isolates were primarily identified by the participating laboratory and identification was confirmed by the reference monitoring laboratory (jmi laboratories, north liberty, ia, usa). isolates were tested for susceptibility by broth microdilution following the clsi m07-a9 and m100-s23 documents. results: overall, oritavancin was active against all cons (mic50/mic90, 0.015/0.06 mg/l),  with mic50 values of </=0.008-0.03 mg/l. streptococci exhibited oritavancin mic50 results of </=0.008 mg/l, except for the streptococcus bovis (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus dysgalactiae (0.06 mg/l) and streptococcus salivarius/vestibularis  (0.06 mg/l) groups. micrococcus spp., listeria monocytogenes and corynebacterium  spp. had oritavancin mic50 results of </=0.008 mg/l. conclusions: this study expands the oritavancin in vitro data against several species of gram-positive organisms.

TI  == evaluation of an ethidium monoazide-enhanced 16s rdna real-time polymerase chain  reaction assay for bacterial screening of platelet concentrates and comparison with automated culture.
AB  == background: culture-based systems are currently the preferred means for bacterial screening of platelet (plt) concentrates. alternative bacterial detection techniques based on nucleic acid amplification have also been developed but these have yet to be fully evaluated. in this study we evaluate a novel 16s rdna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay and compare its performance with automated  culture. study design and methods: a total of 2050 time-expired, 176 fresh, and 400 initial-reactive plt packs were tested by real-time pcr using broadly reactive 16s primers and a "universal" probe (taqman, invitrogen). plts were also tested using a microbial detection system (bact/alert, biomerieux) under aerobic  and anaerobic conditions. results: seven of 2050 (0.34%) time-expired plts were found repeat reactive by pcr on the initial nucleic acid extract but none of these was confirmed positive on testing frozen second aliquots. bact/alert testing also failed to confirm any time-expired plts positive on repeat testing,  although 0.24% were reactive on the first test. three of the 400 "initial-reactive" plt packs were found by both pcr and bact/alert to be contaminated (escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus vestibularis identified) and 14 additional packs were confirmed positive by bact/alert only. in 13 of these cases the contaminating organisms were identified as anaerobic skin or oral commensals and the remaining pack was contaminated with streptococcus pneumoniae. conclusion: these results demonstrate that the 16s pcr  assay is less sensitive than bact/alert and inappropriate for early testing of concentrates. however, rapid pcr assays such as this may be suitable for a strategy of late or prerelease testing.

TI  == using pcr-based detection and genotyping to trace streptococcus salivarius meningitis outbreak strain to oral flora of radiology physician assistant.
AB  == we recently investigated three cases of bacterial meningitis that were reported from a midwestern radiology clinic where facemasks were not worn during spinal injection of contrast agent during myelography procedures. using pulsed field gel electrophoresis we linked a case strain of s. salivarius to an oral specimen of a radiology physician assistant (rpa). we also used a real-time pcr assay to detect s. salivarius dna within a culture-negative cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimen. here we extend this investigation through using a nested pcr/sequencing strategy  to link the culture-negative csf specimen to the case strain. we also provide validation of the real-time pcr assay used, demonstrating that it is not solely specific for streptococcus salivarius, but is also highly sensitive for detection of the closely related oral species streptococcus vestibularis. through using multilocus sequence typing and 16s rdna sequencing we further strengthen the link between the csf case isolate and the rpa carriage isolate. we also demonstrate that the newly characterized strains from this study are distinct from previously characterized s. salivarius strains associated with carriage and meningitis.

TI  == erythromycin and penicillin resistance mechanisms among viridans group streptococci isolated from blood cultures of adult patients with underlying diseases.
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the species distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility and erythromycin-penicillin resistance mechanisms of viridans streptococci (vgs) isolates from blood cultures of adult patients with underlying diseases. fifty vgs blood culture isolates were screened for their antibiotic susceptibilities against penicillin g, erythromycin and tetracycline by e-test. clindamycin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, levofloxacin, linezolid and vancomycin  susceptibility were performed by broth microdilution method. erythromycin and penicillin resistance genotypes, ermb and mefa/e, pbp1a, pbp2b and pbp2x are amplified using pcr method. the clinical isolates included streptococcus mitis (n. 19), s.oralis (n. 13), s.sanguinis, s.parasanguinis (n. 6, each), s.salivarius, s.vestibularis (n. 2, each), s.constellatus, s.sobrinus (n. 1, each). the percentage resistance against erythromycin and penicillin was 36% and  30%, respectively. the genotypic carriage rate of erythromycin resistance genes were: 56% ermb, 28% mefe, 8% ermb+mefe. penicillin-resistant isolates carried pbp2b (33.3%) and pbp2x (20%) genes. twenty-four vgs isolates were recovered from patients with cancer. s.mitis and s.oralis predominated among patients with cancer who had erythromycin and penicillin resistance isolates. the importance of classical antimicrobial agents like penicillin and erythromycin warrants the continuous surveillance of invasive vgs isolates and can guide better treatment options especially in patients with underlying diseases.

TI  == spondylodiscitis and endocarditis caused by s. vestibularis.
AB  == streptococcus vestibularis is a recently described member of the viridans group that was first isolated from the vestibular mucosa of the human oral cavity and described as a new species in 1988. it has been rarely associated with human infections. in few papers, it has been reported as a causal agent of systemic infection in immunosupressed adults and in those with other severe underlying diseases, like coronary valve diseases. a 65-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with complaints of fever for three months, general malaise, effort dyspnea, weight loss, back pain and myalgia. both native aortic valve endocarditis and spondylodiscitis due to streptococcus vestibularis were detected. the patient was successfully treated with intravenous potassium penicillin g and gentamicin for six weeks, followed by oral amoxicillin for three months, in addition to aortic valve replacement. in all patients with spondylodiscitis, infective endocarditis should be considered, particularly in patients with heart valve disease history, since spondylodiscitis may be the presenting sign of an infective endocarditis. cardiac valve replacement surgery should be performed if the course of fever and inflammatory syndrome is unfavorable after appropriate antibiotic treatment. we report the first case with both native aortic valve endocarditis and spondylodiscitis due to streptococcus vestibularis.

TI  == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB  == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several  physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one  would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether  this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using  other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not  discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant nonhemolytic streptococci on the basis of sequence analysis of 16s-23s intergenic spacer region and partial gdh gene.
AB  == nonhemolytic streptococci (nhs) cause serious infections, such as endocarditis and septicemia. many conventional phenotypic methods are insufficient for the identification of bacteria in this group to the species level. genetic analysis has revealed that single-gene analysis is insufficient for the identification of  all species in this group of bacteria. the aim of the present study was to establish a method based on sequence analysis of the 16s-23s intergenic spacer (its) region and the partial gdh gene to identify clinical relevant nhs to the species level. sequence analysis of the its region was performed with 57 nhs reference or clinical strains. satisfactory identification to the species level was achieved for 14/19 nhs species included in this study on the basis of sequence analysis of the its region. streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis obtained the expected taxon as the best taxon match, but there was a short maximum score distance to the next best match (distance, <10). streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae could not be unambiguously discriminated by sequence analysis of the its region, as was also proven by phylogenetic analysis. these five species could be identified to the group level only by its sequence analysis. partial gdh sequence analysis was  applied to the 11 s. oralis strains, the 11 s. mitis strains, and the 17 s. pneumoniae strains. all except one strain achieved a satisfactory identification  to the species level. a phylogenetic algorithm based on the analysis of partial gdh gene sequences revealed three distinct clusters. we suggest that sequence analysis of the combination of the its region and the partial gdh gene can be used in the reference laboratory for the species-level identification of nhs.

TI  == phylogenetic analyses and detection of viridans streptococci based on sequences and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the rod shape-determining protein  gene.
AB  == background: population analysis of viridans streptococci is important because these species are associated with dental caries, bacteremia, and subacute endocarditis, in addition to being important members of the human oral commensal  microbiota. design: in this study, we phylogenetically analyzed the rod shape-determining protein gene (roda), which is associated with cellular morphology, cell division, and sensitivity for antibiotics, and demonstrated that the diversity of the roda gene is sufficient to identify viridans streptococci at the species level. moreover, we developed a more convenient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) method based on the diversity of the roda gene (roda-dgge) for detecting nine dominant streptococcal species in human saliva, namely, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus vestibularis,  streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. results: this roda-dgge method proved useful in detecting viridans streptococci without cultivation, isolation, and phenotypic characterization. conclusion: analysis of the oral microbiota by roda-dgge offers a higher resolution than the  conventional dgge using 16s rdna and may be an alternative in the microbial diagnosis of streptococcal infection.

TI  == prevalence rate and antibiotic susceptibility of oral viridans group streptococci (vgs) in healthy children population.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to evaluated the prevalence rate of oral viridans group streptococci (vgs) and their susceptibilities to some antibiotics  in healthy children. material and methods: samples of pharyngeal swabs and supragingival dental plaques for microbiological studies were collected from 206  healthy children, aged 4-18 years. additionally, 75 samples of carious lesions from children with dental caries were included. the streptococci were isolated and identified using standard methods and commercial identification kits. for performance of antibacterial susceptibility testing of vgs strains disk diffusion and/or breakpoints procedures were used according to nccls standards and criteria. a total of 425 vgs strains were tested against penicillin, ampicillin,  erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. results: a total of 239 vgs strains belonging to 8 species from pharyngeal swabs of 192 (93.2%) children were isolated. vgs strains from supragingival plaques were isolated in 149 (72.3%) healthy children (p < 0.05), and from carious lesions in 37 (49.3%) children with dental caries. vgs strains of s. mitis species were isolated most frequently from 4-5 year old as compared to 12 and 18 year old children (p < 0.05), while s. vestibularis strains isolated most often in 12 year old ones (p < 0.05). among 425 vgs strains, high level of penicillin resistance (mic > or = 2.0 mg/l) was shown in 71 (16.7%) strains, 33 (46.5%) of them belonged to s. mitis species. vgs strains were also resistant to  erythromycin (23.5%), clindamycin (23.1%), tetracyclines (t-52%, dox-16%), gentamycin (25.9%) and ciprofloxacin (55.2%). all vgs strains were vancomycin - susceptible. conclusions: 1. in the oral cavities of healthy children, approximately 98% of streptococci belonged to two vgs groups, i.e. mitis and salivarius groups. streptococci of mutans and anginosus groups were isolated sporadically (2%). 2. we observed difference in susceptibility to penicillin and  other antibiotics between the various species of viridans groups streptococci. mitis group strains (except s. pneumoniae) were more frequently penicillin-resistant (23%) in comparison to salivarius group of vgs strains (9%)  (p = 0.0001).

TI  == assessment of inhibitory potency of antibiotics by mri: apparent t2 as a marker of cell growth.
AB  == a new method to assess the antibiotic potency by mri has been developed. correlating 1h nmr spectra of bacterial cultures with the extracellular parameters t2, od600, and ph, a relationship between cell growth and t2 variations was established. t2 is influenced by chemical exchange that depends on ph, composition, and concentration of the medium. changes in the medium from bacterial metabolism are reflected in alternating t2 values. at 17.6 t, growth curves based on t2 values were measured simultaneously of several cultures of streptococcus vestibularis. from t2 growth curves in the presence of varying concentrations of vancomycin, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the antibiotic could be determined to be 0.33+/-0.08 microm. this value was in good agreement with the result obtained by the conventional broth microdilution. in principle, t2 growth curves can be determined on a large number of cultures simultaneously and may potentially be used as a novel tool in high through-put screening of novel anti-infective substances.

TI  == extent of horizontal gene transfer in evolution of streptococci of the salivarius group.
AB  == the phylogenetically closely related species streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis are oral bacteria that are considered commensals, although they can also be found in human infections. the relationship between these two species and the relationship between strains isolated from carriers and strains responsible for invasive infections were investigated by multilocus sequence typing and additional sequence analysis. the clustering of several s. vestibularis alleles and the extent of genomic divergence at certain loci support the conclusion that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis are separate species. the level of sequence diversity in s. salivarius alleles is generally high, whereas that in s. vestibularis alleles is low at certain loci, indicating that the latter species might have evolved recently. cluster analysis indicated that there has been genetic exchange between s. salivarius and s. vestibularis at three of the nine loci investigated. horizontal gene transfer between streptococci belonging to the s. salivarius group and other oral streptococci was also detected at several loci. a high level of recombination in s. salivarius was revealed by allele index association and split decomposition sequence analyses. commensal and infection-associated s. salivarius strains could not be distinguished by cluster analysis, suggesting that the pathogen isolates are opportunistic. taken together, our results indicate that there is a high level of gene exchange that contributes to the evolution of two streptococcal species from the human oral cavity.

TI  == viridans streptococci isolated by culture from blood of cancer patients: clinical and microbiologic analysis of 50 cases.
AB  == clinical and microbiologic studies of 50 cases of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in cancer patients were performed. the bacteria were identified to species level by sequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene. at least nine streptococcus spp. were found, including s. mitis (25 strains, 50.0% of 50); currently unnamed streptococcus spp. (11 strains); s. parasanguis (five strains); s. anginosus (three strains); s. salivarius (two strains); and one strain each of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, and s. vestibularis. there were no s. oralis strains. among 11 antibiotics of nine classes tested, no resistance to vancomycin, linezolid, or quinupristin-dalfopristin was seen. resistance to penicillin (mic, 4 to 12 mug/ml) was noted only among s. mitis strains (28.0%, 7/25) and not non-s. mitis strains (0/25) (p = 0.004). significantly more s. mitis strains than non-s. mitis strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones and to > or =3 classes of antibiotics. isolation of quinolone-resistant organisms was associated with the prior usage of quinolones (p = 0.002). quantitative blood cultures showed that the strains resistant to levofloxacin or gatifloxacin were associated with higher colony counts than were their corresponding nonresistant strains. the young and elderly patients also had higher levels of bacteremia caused predominantly by s. mitis. septic shock was present in 17 (34.0% of 50) patients, and 13 of those cases were caused by s. mitis (p = 0.007). these results suggest that s. mitis is the most common cause of viridans streptococcal  bacteremia in cancer patients and is more resistant to antibiotics than other species.

TI  == clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (crisprs) have spacers of extrachromosomal origin.
AB  == numerous prokaryote genomes contain structures known as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crisprs), composed of 25-50 bp repeats separated by unique sequence spacers of similar length. crispr structures are found in the vicinity of four genes named cas1 to cas4. in silico analysis revealed another cluster of three genes associated with crispr structures in many bacterial species, named here as cas1b, cas5 and cas6, and also revealed a certain number of spacers that have homology with extant genes, most frequently derived from phages, but also derived from other extrachromosomal elements. sequence analysis of crispr structures from 24 strains of streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus vestibularis confirmed the homology of spacers with extrachromosomal elements. phage sensitivity of s. thermophilus strains appears to be correlated with the number of spacers in the crispr locus the strain carries. the authors suggest that the spacer elements are the traces of past invasions by extrachromosomal elements, and hypothesize that they provide the cell immunity against phage infection, and more generally foreign dna expression, by coding an anti-sense rna. the presence of gene fragments in crispr structures and the nuclease motifs in cas genes of both cluster types suggests that crispr formation involves a dna degradation step.

TI  == identification of streptococcus sanguinis with a pcr-generated species-specific dna probe.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to design a pcr-generated dna probe and determine the specificity of the probe for the identification of clinical isolates of streptococcus sanguinis. to do this, we examined over 200 arbitrarily primed pcr (ap-pcr) amplicon patterns obtained with dna from clinical isolates of s. sanguinis. a 1.6-kb dna amplicon that was common to all ap-pcr profiles was extracted from agarose gels and then cloned and sequenced. a search for a similar sequence in the genbank database with the blastn program revealed that the 1.6-kb dna fragment comprised an intergenic region between two housekeeping genes, uncc  (proton-translocating atpase) and mura (udp-n-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase). three digoxigenin-labeled dna probes were synthesized on the basis  of the sequence of the 1.6-kb fragment: the sequence of probe ssa-1 contained the proton-translocating atpase (uncc) and the entire intergenic region, the sequence of probe ssa-2 contained only the intergenic region, and the sequence of probe ssa-3 contained an internal region of the mura gene. dot blot hybridization showed that the three probes displayed signals for hybridization to both s. sanguinis strain atcc 10556 and the s. sanguinis clinical isolates. probe ssa-1,  however, hybridized to dna from s. oralis and s. mitis. probe ssa-3 hybridized to dna from s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, and s. vestibularis. the probe ssa-2-specific intergenic region appeared to be specific for s. sanguinis. the results from this study suggest that probe ssa-2 may serve as a species-specific dna probe for the identification of clinical isolates of s. sanguinis.

TI  == native valve endocarditis due to streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus oralis.
AB  == viridans streptococci are the commonest cause of native valve infective endocarditis (ie). the taxonomy of this group is evolving allowing new disease associations to be made. streptococcus vestibularis is a recently described member of the viridans group, first isolated from the vestibular mucosa of the human oral cavity. it has rarely been associated with human disease. streptococcus oralis, another member of the viridans group resident in the human  oral cavity is a well known cause of ie and bacteraemia in neutropenic patients.  we report the first case of native mitral valve endocarditis due to s. vestibularis in a patient with co-existing s. oralis endocarditis.

TI  == study of the intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility of partial single base c-sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and its applicability for the identification of members of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the use of single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene (sbcs) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus streptococcus. for sbcs, only dd-ctp's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. the reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. the interlaboratory reproducibility proved  to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. sbcs did not differentiate between the closely related species s. constellatus and s. intermedius. also s. thermophilus and s. vestibularis as well as s. mitis and s. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. the previously reported heterogeneity within the species s. equinus was reflected by sbcs. for all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. in conclusion, single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene  could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to  automatize than full sequence determination.

AB  == the objectives were to: (1) determine the salivary concentrations of urea during  20 min chewing of a sugar-free gum containing 30 mg of urea; (2) measure the degree to which this urea would diffuse into a gel-stabilized plaque; (3) study the effect of the urea on the fall and subsequent rise in ph (stephan curve) on exposure to 10% sucrose for 1 min; (4) model the measurements 2 and 3 mathematically. in point 1, the salivary urea concentration of the 12 subjects peaked at 47 mmol/l in the first 2 min of gum chewing, falling within 15 min to the unstimulated salivary concentration of 3.4 mmol/l. recovery of urea from the  saliva averaged 81.5%. 'plaques' of 1% agarose or 67% dead bacteria in agarose accumulated urea from the saliva roughly as expected, whereas those plaques containing 8% live and 59% dead streptococcus vestibularis showed negligible accumulation. computer modelling showed this difference to be due to urease of live bacteria breaking down the urea as rapidly as it entered the plaque. simulation of the effect of gum chewing subsequent to initiation of a stephan curve in the latter type of plaque showed a rapid rise in ph but then a fall again on return to unstimulated conditions. this fall had not been seen in previous studies, with streptococcus oralis, nor was it predicted by the computer modelling. neither experimental simulation nor computer modelling suggested that  chewing urea-containing gum before exposure to sucrose would have any effect on a subsequent stephan curve. thus chewing gum is only likely to inhibit caries when  it is chewed after consumption of fermentable carbohydrate, rather than before.

TI  == application and evaluation of the interlaboratory reproducibility of trna intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tdna-pcr) for identification of streptococcus species.
AB  == the discriminatory power, speed, and interlaboratory reproducibility of trna intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tdna-pcr) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of streptococci. this method was carried out in three different laboratories under highly standardized conditions for 54 strains belonging to 18 different species. it was concluded that interlaboratory reproducibility of tdna fingerprints produced by means of capillary electrophoresis was sufficiently high to permit the exchange between different laboratories and the construction of common libraries which can be consulted for comparison with fingerprints obtained independently in separate laboratories. in a second step, 17 other species were included in the study and examined in one of the participating laboratories. all streptococcus species studied, except s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis, showed distinguishable tdna fingerprints. a database of well-characterized strains was constructed to enable computer-aided identification of unknown streptococcal isolates.

TI  == strain-related acid production by oral streptococci.
AB  == acid production, in particular at low ph, is thought to be an important ecological determinant in dental caries. the aim of the present study was to determine the acid producing capability at different ph levels of 47 streptococcal strains, representing 9 species, isolated from human dental plaque. the bacteria were grown until mid log-phase under anaerobic conditions and acid production was measured in a ph-stat system at ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0. at all ph values, the mean velocity of acid production (v(ap)) by streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus was significantly higher (p<0.01; anova) than that of the other oral streptococci, including s. mitis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. vestibularis. however, the v(ap) of some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis, particularly at ph values of 7.0 and 6.0, exceeded that of some strains of s. mutans. the v(ap) decreased with ph for all strains, but some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and strains of the mutans streptococci maintained a relatively high rate of acid production. the results suggest that some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis may play an important role in caries development by modifying the environment in dental plaque to become favourable for the succession of aciduric  species. the study furthermore emphasises the need for detailed species and biovar identification of oral streptococci and for recognition of the significant physiological differences that occur within single species.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.

TI  == effect of low-molecular-weight chitosans on the adhesive properties of oral streptococci.
AB  == it was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  n-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. the ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. when saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with n-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. growth in n-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. no effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. in contrast to what observed with s. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. these results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting s. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.

TI  == speciation of presumptive viridans streptococci from early onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == twenty isolates resembling viridans streptococci, 16 from blood and four from gastric aspirates, from 17 cases of early onset neonatal sepsis were identified by the api20 strep, rapid id 32 strep and conventional tests plus hydrolysis of methylumbelliferyl glycoside substrates. nineteen of the isolates were identified as species of viridans streptococci and one as a leuconostoc sp. ten of the isolates were streptococcus oralis, three s. mitis biotype 1, two s. mitis biotype 2 and one each of s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius and s. intermedius. the rapid id 32 strep and conventional plus methylumbelliferyl tests gave the same species identity for 17 of the isolates. s. intermedius was identified by the rapid id 32 strep as s. constellatus and s. salivarius as s. equinus, with s. salivarius at lower probability. the api20 strep failed to identify s. vestibularis and identified s. salivarius as s. defectivus. the absence of certain critical tests, including urea hydrolysis, does not allow the  api20 strep to identify all the currently recognised species of viridans steptococci. the species distribution was unexpected and the incidence of s. oralis and other viridans streptococci in vaginal swabs from prenatal patients is being investigated further.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == distribution of proteins similar to iiimanh and iiimanl of the streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  == in streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins ei and hpr, the specific membrane-bound iiiman, and two  forms of a protein called iiiman, with molecular weights of 38,900 (iiimanh) and  35,200 (iiimanl), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the  membrane. several lines of evidence suggest that iiimanh and/or iiimanl are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. to determine whether other bacteria  possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. three approaches were used to determine whether the iiiman proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-iiimanh and anti-iiimanh rabbit  polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of pep-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-iiiman antibodies of the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. only the species s. salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of iiiman. fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. in the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of pep. no such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. a iii(man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in lactobacillus casei by western blot experiments as well as by pep-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-iii(man) antibodies was detected in lactococcus lactis. in several cases, the involvement  of these putative iii(man) proteins in the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-iii(man) antibodies. no proteins cross-reacting with anti-iii(man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and e. coli. in s. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. this protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of pep.

TI  == an in vitro investigation of the cariogenic potential of oral streptococci.
AB  == whilst the importance of the mutans streptococci in the aetiology of dental caries is clear, a number of studies have described caries development in their absence. this investigation aimed to assess the cariogenic potential of streptococcus gordonii, strep. sanguis, strep. vestibularis and enterococcus faecalis in comparison with strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus, using a recently described in vitro model. in the presence of a 146 mm sucrose solution and powdered hydroxyapatite, each species was incubated for 5 h, after which acid anion production, calcium release and change in ph were measured. it was possible to assign each species to one of three groups, with e. faecalis, strep. gordonii, strep. sanguis exhibiting low, strep. vestibularis intermediate, and strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus high in vitro cariogenic potential. this assay could be used as a screening test to assess the potential cariogenicity of a range of bacterial species.

TI  == distribution and isolation frequency of eight streptococcal species in saliva from predentate and dentate children and adults.
AB  == the isolation frequency and distribution of eight recently defined streptococcal  species have been investigated in the saliva of adults and that of both predentate and dentate children. the effects of frequency of sugar intake and tooth presence on the distribution of streptococcal species were also analyzed. saliva samples were collected from 121 subjects divided into three study groups:  (a) 56 predentate children (predentate group), (b) 37 dentate children (dentate group), and (c) 28 adults (adult group). up to 17 biochemical and enzymatic tests were used to categorize streptococcal isolates into s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. mutans, and s. gordonii. the mean total and streptococcal salivary colony-forming units (cfu) were lowest in the predentate group and highest in the adult group. streptococci  were found in all the study subjects, and there was no obvious relationship between the total or streptococcal cfu and the number of teeth or the frequency of sugar intake. there was a wide variation in the isolation frequency of streptococcal species in the three study groups. s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. salivarius were the most frequent species isolated, and together they comprised 83% of the total streptococcal isolates. in contrast to studies using older classifications, s. sanguis was a minor species in the saliva though found more often in adults than in children (p < 0.04). s. anginosus was a minor species found in about 10% of adults and children. s. gordonii was detected rarely and only in dentate subjects. s. mutans was detected only in dentate subjects, significantly greater in adults (57.1%) than in children (5.4%, p < 0.001).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == urea concentration in minor mucous gland secretions and the effect of salivary film velocity on urea metabolism by streptococcus vestibularis in an artificial plaque.
AB  == our purpose was to determine the urea concentration in minor mucous gland (mmg) secretions and the ph at proximal and distal aspects of the lower surface of artificial plaque in vitro during infusion of urea solutions over the surface, at different film velocities. saliva is present in the mouth as a slowly moving film (ca. 0.1 mm thick) with an estimated velocity in the range of 0.8-8.0 mm/min. at  low velocities, due to the accumulation of bacterial products, a progressive increase in their concentration may occur in both the plaque and the overlying salivary film at the distal edge (where the film leaves the plaque). s. vestibularis, an oral micro-organism possessing ureolytic activity, was combined  with 1% agarose, to give a urease vmax similar to that of natural plaque. the artificial plaque was in the chamber (6.0 x 6.0 square and 0.5 or 1.5 mm deep) of a diffusion apparatus, and a urea-containing artificial saliva (3.3 or 13.2 mmol/l) was infused over the surface, as a film 0.1 mm deep, at velocities of 0.8, 8.2 and 86.2 mm/min. at the lower (physiologically normal) urea concentration and the two lower film velocities, most urea appeared to be metabolized at the proximal end of the plaque, which developed a higher ph. at the higher urea concentration, and a film velocity of 8 mm/min, a higher ph was found at the distal end. this was probably due to the combination of greater urea availability and a reduced rate of ammonia loss distally. at a film velocity of 86.2 mm/min, proximal/distal ph gradients did not develop.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

TI  == an examination of strains of the bacterium streptococcus vestibularis for relative cariogenicity in gnotobiotic rats and adhesion in vitro.
AB  == the cariogenicity and adhesion of six strains of streptococcus vestibularis were  compared with those of strains of strep. salivarius. all strains of strep. vestibularis produced low levels of caries, confined to the fissures, whereas the two strains of strep. salivarius produced high levels of caries, with one strain  producing approximal as well as fissure caries. the values for adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite of strep. vestibularis in the absence (median 4.74%) and the presence (median 4.67%) of sucrose were not statistically different, nor  did they differ significantly from those of strep. salivarius. strains of strep.  vestibularis were able to adhere to buccal epithelial cells (median 1.19%) as well as could strep. salivarius strain hb (1.65%). neither sucrose nor saliva greatly aggregated the strains of either species. strep. vestibularis did not adhere to hexadecane (median 18.5%) to the same extent as did strep. salivarius strains (median 69%). there was a significant correlation between the adhesion in the presence and absence of sucrose (p less than 0.01). strep. vestibularis strains could not coaggregate with either actinomycetes or veillonella spp. whereas strep. salivarius strains were able to coaggregate with veillonella spp.

AB  == viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. sialidase was produced by all strains of streptococcus oralis and s. intermedius and by a majority of s. mitis strains. s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s.  gordonii, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, "s. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.
