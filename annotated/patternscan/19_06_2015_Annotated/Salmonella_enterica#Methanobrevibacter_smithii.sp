TI  == alternative fecal indicators and their empirical relationships with enteric viruses, salmonella enterica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in surface waters of a tropical urban catchment.
AB  == the suitability of traditional microbial indicators (i.e., escherichia coli and enterococci) has been challenged due to the lack of correlation with pathogens and evidence of possible regrowth in the natural environment. in this study, the  relationships between alternative microbial indicators of potential human fecal contamination (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, methanobrevibacter smithii, human polyomaviruses [hpyvs], and f+ and somatic coliphages) and pathogens (salmonella  spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, rotavirus, astrovirus, norovirus gi, norovirus gii, and adenovirus) were compared with those of traditional microbial indicators, as  well as environmental parameters (temperature, conductivity, salinity, ph, dissolved oxygen, total organic carbon, total suspended solids, turbidity, total  nitrogen, and total phosphorus). water samples were collected from surface waters of urban catchments in singapore. salmonella and p. aeruginosa had significant positive correlations with most of the microbial indicators, especially e. coli and enterococci. norovirus gii showed moderately strong positive correlations with most of the microbial indicators, except for hpyvs and coliphages. in general, high geometric means and significant correlations between human-specific markers and pathogens suggest the possibility of sewage contamination in some areas. the simultaneous detection of human-specific markers (i.e., b. thetaiotaomicron, m. smithii, and hpyvs) with e. coli and enterococcus supports the likelihood of recent fecal contamination, since the human-specific markers are unable to regrow in natural surface waters. multiple-linear-regression results further confirm that the inclusion of m. smithii and hpyvs, together with traditional indicators, would better predict the occurrence of pathogens. further study is needed to determine the applicability of such models to different geographical locations and environmental conditions.

TI  == a dna microarray for the versatile diagnosis of infectious diarrhea.
AB  == several bacteria, viruses, and parasites cause diarrhea as coinfecting pathogens. we designed a dna microarray comprising 60-bp probes spotted 194 times for the multiplex detection of 33 enteropathogenic bacteria and seven enteropathogenic viruses, and the archaeon methanobrevibacter smithii was used as an internal positive control. nine pathogen-free stool specimens were used as negative controls. one of these control specimens was further spiked with salmonella enterica as a positive control. the microarray was then tested with 40 pathological stool specimens, comprising s. enterica (n = 30), campylobacter jejuni (n = 4), pathogenic escherichia coli (n = 2), and adenovirus (n = 4). m. smithii was detected in 47/49 (95.9%) specimens, no pathogen was detected in negative controls and s. enterica was identified in the s. enterica-spiked positive control. the overall specificity was 100% and the overall sensitivity was 97.5% because one s. enterica sample was missed by the microarray. the multiplexed detection of c. jejuni spiked into an adenovirus-positive stool sample gave positive results, with fluorescence values of 14.3 and 9.1, respectively. these data indicate that using the protocol developed in this article, the dna array allows for the multiplexed detection of some enteropathogens in stool samples.

TI  == optimized microbial dna extraction from diarrheic stools.
AB  == background: the detection of enteropathogens in stool specimens increasingly relies on the detection of specific nucleic acid sequences. we observed that such detection was hampered in diarrheic stool specimens and we set-up an improved protocol combining lyophilization of stools prior to a semi-automated dna extraction. findings: a total of 41 human diarrheic stool specimens comprising of 35 specimens negative for enteropathogens and six specimens positive for salmonella enterica in culture, were prospectively studied. one 1-ml aliquot of each specimen was lyophilised and total dna was extracted from lyophilised and non-lyophilised aliquots by combining automatic and phenol-chloroform dna extraction. dna was incorporated into real-time pcrs targeting the 16s rrna gene  of bacteria and the archaea methanobrevibacter smithii and the chorismate synthase gene of s. enterica. whereas negative controls consisting in dna-free water remained negative, m. smithii was detected in 26/41 (63.4%) non-lyophilised (ct value 28.78 +/- 9.1) versus 39/41 (95.1%) lyophilised aliquots (ct value 22.04 +/- 5.5); bacterial 16s rrna was detected in 33/41 (80.5%) non-lyophilised  (ct value 28.11 +/- 5.9) versus 40/41 (97.6%) lyophilised aliquots (ct value 24.94 +/- 6.6); and s. enterica was detected in 6/6 (100%) non-lyophilized and lyophilized aliquots (ct value 26.98 +/- 4.55 and 26.16 +/- 4.97, respectively).  s. enterica was not detected in the 35 remaining diarrheal-stool specimens. the proportion of positive specimens was significantly higher after lyophilization for the detection of m. smithii (p = 0.00043) and bacteria (p = 0.015). conclusion: lyophilization of diarrheic stool specimens significantly increases the pcr-based detection of microorganisms. the semi-automated protocol described  here could be routinely used for the molecular diagnosis of infectious diarrhea.
