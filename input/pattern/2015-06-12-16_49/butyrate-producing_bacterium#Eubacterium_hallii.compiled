TI  - Consumption of partially hydrolysed guar gum stimulates Bifidobacteria and butyrate-producing bacteria in the human large intestine.
AB  - Partially hydrolysed guar gum (PHGG) is a water-soluble dietary fibre that is non-digestible in the upper gastrointestinal tract. It is believed that PHGG benefits the health of hosts by altering the colonic microbiota and stimulating short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. However, it remains unclear which bacteria ferment PHGG in the human large intestine. In this study, the effect of PHGG on faecal bacteria was analysed to specify the bacteria that contribute to the fermentation of PHGG in the human large intestine. Ten healthy volunteers consumed PHGG (6 g/day) for 2 weeks. Faeces were collected at 2 weeks prior to consumption, at the end of 2 weeks of consumption, and 2 weeks after consumption of PHGG. Bacterial DNA was extracted from these collected faeces and subjected to real-time PCR using bacterial group- or species-specific primers. The copy number of the butyryl-CoA CoA-transferase gene and the 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of Bifidobacterium, the Clostridium coccoides group, the Roseburia/ Eubacterium rectale group, Eubacterium hallii, and butyrate-producing bacterium strain SS2/1 were significantly increased by the intake of PHGG. Other bacteria and bacterial groups were not significantly influenced by the intake of PHGG. It was believed that the Roseburia/E. rectale group bacteria, Bifidobacterium, the lactate-utilising, butyrate-producing bacteria, E. hallii and bacterium strain SS2/1, would contribute to the fermentation of PHGG in the human large intestine. PHGG may benefit health by stimulating Bifidobacterium and butyrate-producing bacteria in the human large intestine.
TI  - Starch structure modulates metabolic activity and gut microbiota profile.
AB  - Normal maize starch and high amylose maize starch (HAS) either in native or thermally treated forms were used to investigate the effect of starch structure on the production of metabolites and gut microbiota profile using an anaerobic in vitro system. The changes in starch structure during fermentation were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR). The native normal starch showed a porous structure during fermentation, indicating it was quickly metabolized by gut bacteria, whereas the HAS showed a smooth structure, suggesting it was utilized gradually. HPLC chromatography showed that amylose fraction with low molecular weight (MW) had a higher resistance to be fermented by gut bacteria than other starch molecular fractions. Thermal treatment enhanced starch fermentation kinetics, especially for amylopectin and high MW amylose fractions. FTIR analysis suggests that the structure of the normal starch, either in native or thermally treated, was less organized compared to HAS, and this structural character led to the normal starch to be utilized more quickly by gut bacteria with a faster increase in the IR ratio 1047/1022 cm(-1) (P < 0.01) during fermentation. The measurement of metabolic activity indicates that the normal starch with a less organized structure was utilized faster and generated more acetate and lactate during fermentation; HAS with a highly organized structure was more likely to produce butyrate, corresponding the significant increase (P < 0.001) in the populations of butyrate-producing strains (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Eubacterium hallii) in the cultures. This study reveals that fermentation kinetics of starch substrate is one of important characteristics for manipulating gut microbiota fermentation behaviours.
TI  - Kinetic modelling of lactate utilization and butyrate production by key human colonic bacterial species.
AB  - Butyrate is the preferred energy source for colonocytes and has an important role in gut health; in contrast, accumulation of high concentrations of lactate is detrimental to gut health. The major butyrate-producing bacterial species in the human colon belong to the Firmicutes. Eubacterium hallii and a new species, Anaerostipes coli SS2/1, members of clostridial cluster XIVa, are able to utilize lactate and acetate via the butyryl CoA : acetate CoA transferase route, the main metabolic pathway for butyrate synthesis in the human colon. Here we provide a mathematical model to analyse the production of butyrate by lactate-utilizing bacteria from the human colon. The model is an aggregated representation of the fermentation pathway. The parameters of the model were estimated using total least squares and maximum likelihood, based on in vitro experimental data with E. hallii L2-7 and A. coli SS2/1. The findings of the mathematical model adequately match those from the bacterial batch culture experiments. Such an in silico approach should provide insight into carbohydrate fermentation and short-chain fatty acid cross-feeding by dominant species of the human colonic microbiota.
TI  - Diversity of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria revealed by analysis of the butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase gene.
AB  - Butyrate-producing bacteria play an important role in the human colon, supplying  energy to the gut epithelium and regulating host cell responses. In order to explore the diversity and culturability of this functional group, we designed degenerate primers to amplify butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase sequences from faecal samples provided by 10 healthy volunteers. Eighty-eight per cent of amplified sequences showed >98% DNA sequence identity to CoA-transferases from cultured butyrate-producing bacteria, and these fell into 12 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The four most prevalent OTUs corresponded to Eubacterium rectale, Roseburia faecis, Eubacterium hallii and an unnamed cultured species SS2/1. The remaining 12% of sequences, however, belonged to 20 OTUs that are assumed to come from uncultured butyrate-producing strains. Samples taken after ingestion of inulin showed significant (P=0.019) increases in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Because several of the dominant butyrate producers differ in their DNA % G+C content, analysis of thermal melt curves obtained for PCR amplicons of the butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase gene provides a convenient and rapid qualitative assessment of the major butyrate producing groups present in a given sample. This type of analysis therefore provides an excellent source of information on functionally important groups within the colonic microbial community.
TI  - Lactate has the potential to promote hydrogen sulphide formation in the human colon.
AB  - High concentrations of sulphide are toxic for the gut epithelium and may contribute to bowel disease. Lactate is a favoured cosubstrate for the sulphate-reducing colonic bacterium Desulfovibrio piger, as shown here by the stimulation of sulphide formation by D. piger DSM749 by lactate in the presence of sulphate. Sulphide formation by D. piger was also stimulated in cocultures with the lactate-producing bacterium Bifidobacterium adolescentis L2-32. Other lactate-utilizing bacteria such as the butyrate-producing species Eubacterium hallii and Anaerostipes caccae are, however, expected to be in competition with the sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) for the lactate formed in the human colon. Strains of E. hallii and A. caccae produced 65% and 96% less butyrate from lactate, respectively, in a coculture with D. piger DSM749 than in a pure culture. In triculture experiments involving B. adolescentis L2-32, up to 50% inhibition of butyrate formation by E. hallii and A. caccae was observed in the presence of D. piger DSM749. On the other hand, sulphide formation by D. piger was unaffected by E. hallii or A. caccae in these cocultures and tricultures. These experiments strongly suggest that lactate can stimulate sulphide formation by SRB present in the colon, with possible consequences for conditions such as colitis.
TI  - Impact of pH on lactate formation and utilization by human fecal microbial communities.
AB  - The human intestine harbors both lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria. Lactate is normally present at <3 mmol liter(-1) in stool samples from healthy adults, but concentrations up to 100 mmol liter(-1) have been reported in gut disorders such as ulcerative colitis. The effect of different initial pH values (5.2, 5.9, and 6.4) upon lactate metabolism was studied with fecal inocula from healthy volunteers, in incubations performed with the addition of dl-lactate, a mixture of polysaccharides (mainly starch), or both. Propionate and butyrate formation occurred at pH 6.4; both were curtailed at pH 5.2, while propionate but not butyrate formation was inhibited at pH 5.9. With the polysaccharide mix, lactate accumulation occurred only at pH 5.2, but lactate production, estimated using l-[U-(13)C]lactate, occurred at all three pH values. Lactate was completely utilized within 24 h at pH 5.9 and 6.4 but not at pH 5.2. At pH 5.9, more butyrate than propionate was formed from l-[U-(13)C]lactate in the presence of polysaccharides, but propionate, formed mostly by the acrylate pathway, was the predominant product with lactate alone. Fluorescent in situ hybridization demonstrated that populations of Bifidobacterium spp., major lactate producers, increased approximately 10-fold in incubations with polysaccharides. Populations of Eubacterium hallii, a lactate-utilizing butyrate-producing bacterium, increased 100-fold at pH 5.9 and 6.4. These experiments suggest that lactate is rapidly converted to acetate, butyrate, and propionate by the human intestinal microbiota at pH values as low as 5.9, but at pH 5.2 reduced utilization occurs while production is maintained, resulting in lactate accumulation.
TI  - Two routes of metabolic cross-feeding between Bifidobacterium adolescentis and butyrate-producing anaerobes from the human gut.
AB  - Dietary carbohydrates have the potential to influence diverse functional groups of bacteria within the human large intestine. Of 12 Bifidobacterium strains of human gut origin from seven species tested, four grew in pure culture on starch and nine on fructo-oligosaccharides. The potential for metabolic cross-feeding between Bifidobacterium adolescentis and lactate-utilizing, butyrate-producing Firmicute bacteria related to Eubacterium hallii and Anaerostipes caccae was investigated in vitro. E. hallii L2-7 and A. caccae L1-92 failed to grow on starch in pure culture, but in coculture with B. adolescentis L2-32 butyrate was formed, indicating cross-feeding of metabolites to the lactate utilizers. Studies with [(13)C]lactate confirmed carbon flow from lactate, via acetyl coenzyme A, to butyrate both in pure cultures of E. hallii and in cocultures with B. adolescentis. Similar results were obtained in cocultures involving B. adolescentis DSM 20083 with fructo-oligosaccharides as the substrate. Butyrate formation was also stimulated, however, in cocultures of B. adolescentis L2-32 grown on starch or fructo-oligosaccharides with Roseburia sp. strain A2-183, which produces butyrate but does not utilize lactate. This is probably a consequence of the release by B. adolescentis of oligosaccharides that are available to Roseburia sp. strain A2-183. We conclude that two distinct mechanisms of metabolic cross-feeding between B. adolescentis and butyrate-forming bacteria may operate in gut ecosystems, one due to consumption of fermentation end products (lactate and acetate) and the other due to cross-feeding of partial breakdown products from complex substrates.
TI  - Genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16S rRNA gene analysis.
AB  - A novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16S rRNA gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. Simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (PI) and SYTO BC provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). The three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. This analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. Cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the DGGE patterns showed that most of clones retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium leptum, and Bacteroides. We found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as Eubacterium rectale and Eubacterium hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. However, amplicons affiliated with Bacteroides and Ruminococcus obeum- and Eubacterium biforme-like bacteria, as well as Butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. Furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the Clostridium leptum cluster. The bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; B. longum and B. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while B. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.
TI  - Lactate-utilizing bacteria, isolated from human feces, that produce butyrate as a major fermentation product.
AB  - The microbial community of the human colon contains many bacteria that produce lactic acid, but lactate is normally detected only at low concentrations (<5 mM) in feces from healthy individuals. It is not clear, however, which bacteria are mainly responsible for lactate utilization in the human colon. Here, bacteria able to utilize lactate and produce butyrate were identified among isolates obtained from 10(-8) dilutions of fecal samples from five different subjects. Out of nine such strains identified, four were found to be related to Eubacterium hallii and two to Anaerostipes caccae, while the remaining three represent a new species within clostridial cluster XIVa based on their 16S rRNA sequences. Significant ability to utilize lactate was not detected in the butyrate-producing species Roseburia intestinalis, Eubacterium rectale, or Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Whereas E. hallii and A. caccae strains used both D- and L-lactate, the remaining strains used only the d form. Addition of glucose to batch cultures prevented lactate utilization until the glucose became exhausted. However, when two E. hallii strains and one A. caccae strain were grown in separate cocultures with a starch-utilizing Bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate, with starch as the carbohydrate energy source, the L-lactate produced by B. adolescentis became undetectable and butyrate was formed. Such cross-feeding may help to explain the reported butyrogenic effect of certain dietary substrates, including resistant starch. The abundance of E. hallii in particular in the colonic ecosystem suggests that these bacteria play important roles in preventing lactate accumulation.
TI  - Oligonucleotide probes that detect quantitatively significant groups of butyrate-producing bacteria in human feces.
AB  - 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes were designed for butyrate-producing bacteria from human feces. Three new cluster-specific probes detected bacteria related to Roseburia intestinalis, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Eubacterium hallii at mean populations of 2.3, 3.8, and 0.6%, respectively, in samples from 10 individuals. Additional species-level probes accounted for no more than 1%, with a mean of 7.7%, of the total human fecal microbiota identified as butyrate producers in this study. Bacteria related to E. hallii and the genera Roseburia and Faecalibacterium are therefore among the most abundant known butyrate-producing bacteria in human feces.
