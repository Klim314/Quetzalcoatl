TI  == characterization of romboutsia ilealis gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of a rat, and proposal for the reclassification of five closely related members of the genus clostridium into the genera romboutsia gen.  nov., intestinibacter gen. nov., terrisporobacter gen. nov. and asaccharospora gen. nov.
AB  == a gram-positive staining, rod-shaped, non-motile, spore-forming obligately anaerobic bacterium, designated cribt, was isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of a rat and characterized. the major cellular fatty acids of strain cribt  were saturated and unsaturated straight-chain c12-c19 fatty acids, with c16:0 being the predominant fatty acid. the polar lipid profile comprised six glycolipids, four phospholipids and one lipid that did not stain with any of the  specific spray reagents used. the only quinone was mk-6. the predominating cell-wall sugars were glucose and galactose. the peptidoglycan type of strain cribt was a1sigma lanthionine-direct. the genomic dna g+c content of strain cribt was 28.1 mol%. on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, strain cribt was most closely related to a number of species of the genus clostridium, including clostridium lituseburense (97.2%), clostridium glycolicum (96.2%), clostridium mayombei (96.2%), clostridium bartlettii (96.0%) and clostridium irregulare (95.5%). all these species show very low 16s rrna gene sequence similarity (<85%) to the type strain of clostridium butyricum, the type species of the genus clostridium. dna-dna hybridization with closely related reference strains indicated reassociation values below 32%. on the basis of phenotypic and  genetic studies, a novel genus, romboutsia gen. nov., is proposed. the novel isolate cribt (=dsm 25109t=nizo 4048t) is proposed as the type strain of the type species, romboutsia ilealis gen. nov., sp. nov., of the proposed novel genus. it  is proposed that c. lituseburense is transferred to this genus as romboutsia lituseburensis comb. nov. furthermore, the reclassification into novel genera is  proposed for c. bartlettii, as intestinibacter bartlettii gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), c. glycolicum, as terrisporobacter glycolicus gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), c. mayombei, as terrisporobacter mayombei gen. nov., comb. nov., and c. irregulare, as asaccharospora irregularis  gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), on the basis of additional data collected in this study. in addition, an emendation of the species peptostreptococcus anaerobius and the order eubacteriales is provided.

TI  == in vitro utilization of amylopectin and high-amylose maize (amylomaize) starch granules by human colonic bacteria.
AB  == it has been well established that a certain amount of ingested starch can escape  digestion in the human small intestine and consequently enters the large intestine, where it may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation. thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to  utilize soluble starch, gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, and high-amylose maize starch granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. the six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of amylopectin maize starch and high-amylose maize starch granules a (amylose; sigma) and b (culture pro 958n). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes. it was demonstrated that bifidobacterium spp., bacteroides spp., fusobacterium spp., and strains of eubacterium, clostridium, streptococcus, and propionibacterium could hydrolyze the gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, while only bifidobacterium spp. and clostridium butyricum could efficiently utilize high-amylose maize starch granules. in fact, c. butyricum and bifidobacterium spp. had higher specific growth rates in the autoclaved medium containing high-amylose maize starch granules and hydrolyzed 80 and 40% of the amylose, respectively. starch-degrading enzymes were cell bound on bifidobacterium and bacteroides cells and were extracellular for c. butyricum. active staining for starch-degrading enzymes on sds-page gels showed that the bifidobacterium cells produced several starch-degrading enzymes with high relative molecular (m(r)) weights (>160,000),  medium-sized relative molecular weights (>66,000), and low relative molecular weights (<66,000). it was concluded that bifidobacterium spp. and c. butyricum degraded and utilized granules of amylomaize starch.

TI  == trypsin-dependent production of an antibacterial substance by a human peptostreptococcus strain in gnotobiotic rats and in vitro.
AB  == an antibacterial substance appeared within 1 day in feces of gnotobiotic rats harboring a human intestinal peptostreptococcus strain. it disappeared when the rat bile-pancreatic duct was ligatured or when the rats ingested a trypsin inhibitor. anaerobic cultures of the peptostreptococcus strain in a medium supplemented with trypsin also exhibited an antibacterial activity, which was also inhibited by the trypsin inhibitor. in vitro the antibacterial substance from both feces and culture medium was active against several gram-positive bacteria, including other peptostreptococcus spp., potentially pathogenic clostridium spp. such as c. perfringens, c. difficile, c. butyricum, c. septicum, and c. sordellii, eubacterium spp., bifidobacterium spp., and bacillus spp. whatever the order of inoculation of the strains, a sensitive strain of c. perfringens was eliminated within 1 day from the intestine of rats monoassociated with the peptostreptococcus strain. these findings demonstrate for the first time that very potent antibacterial substances can be produced through a mechanism involving intestinal bacteria and exocrine pancreatic secretions.

TI  == formation of amphetamine from its nitro analogue by anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  == 1. microbial reduction of 1-phenyl-2-nitropropane 1 was carried out using 40 strains of intestinal anaerobic bacteria. among them, 12 strains (mitsuokella multiacidus, clostridium perfringens, c. innocuum, c. clostiriiforme, c. difficile, c. butyricum, c. sp., eubacterium limosum, e. aerofaciens, e. multiforme, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and p. productus) had the ability to reduce 1 to amphetamine 2 (0.1-1% yield). 2. clostridium species were more active than another intestinal anaerobic bacteria. 3. when clostridium perfringens was used in preparative fermentation, the yield of 2 was increased, and its absolute  structure had an (s)-configuration with an optical purity of 68% in enantiomeric  excess.

TI  == pathogenicity of clostridium species with other bacteria in mixed infections.
AB  == the relationship of clostridial isolates with other bacteria in mixed infections  was studied by means of a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. we used 26 isolates of seven clostridial species, two bacteroides spp., eight gram-positive facultative or anaerobic cocci and three enteric gram-negative aerobic rods. abscesses were induced by all seven clostridium perfringens and three c. butyricum isolates and by some of the others. selective antimicrobial therapy experiments showed that enteric gram-negative rods were of equal or greater significance in the formation of abscesses than were clostridial strains in mixed infections. enhancement or suppression of each component of the mixed infection was studied by comparing the number of each bacterium to its number when injected alone. enhancement was observed mainly with c. perfringens in mixed infections. by contrast, other clostridium spp. were less able to induce enhancement. clostridium difficile and c. sporogenes often inhibited other bacterial species.  this study demonstrated the synergistic and antagonistic relationship between clostridial species and other bacteria.

TI  == on the occurrence of enoate reductase and 2-oxo-carboxylate reductase in clostridia and some observations on the amino acid fermentation by peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  == enoate reductase present in clostridium kluyveri and clostridium spec. la 1 could be detected in three strains of c. tyrobutyricum and ten clostridia belonging to  the groups of proteolytic and saccharolytic or proteolytic species, respectively. in c. pasteurianum, c. butyricum and c. propionicum enoate reductase could not be found even after growth on (e)-2-butenoate. a 2-oxo-carboxylate reductase was present in rather low activities in the non-proteolytic clostridia which produce  enoate reductase. high activities (up to 10 u/mg protein) of 2-oxo-carboxylate reductase were found in six of ten proteolytic clostridia. the substrate specificities of the enoate reductase and the 2-oxo-carboxylate reductases from the proteolytic clostridia were determined with different alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylates (enoates) and 2-oxo-carboxylates, respectively. enoates as well as 2-oxo-carboxylates are intermediates of the pathway by which amino acids are degraded. an explanation is offered for the long known but not understood fact that in the stickland reaction isoleucine always acts as an electron donor and leucine and phenylalanine can be electron acceptors as well as donors. peptostreptococcus anaerobius converting some amino acids to the same products as c. sporogenes did this also with the intermediates which were found for the reductive deamination of amino acids in c. sporogenes, however, in crude extracts reduction of enoates occurred only in an activated form.
