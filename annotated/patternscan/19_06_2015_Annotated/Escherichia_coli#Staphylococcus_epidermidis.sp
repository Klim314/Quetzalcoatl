TI  == a plasmid-borne system to assess the excision and integration of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec) mediated by ccra and ccrb.
AB  == resistance to methicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics in staphylococci is due to meca, which is carried on a genomic island, sccmec. the chromosomal excision and integration of sccmec is mediated by the site-specific recombinases  ccrab or ccrc encoded within this element. a plasmid-borne system was constructed to assess the activities of ccra and ccrb in the excision and integration of sccmec in escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. the excision frequency in e. coli mediated by ccrab from methicillin resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strain n315 was only 9.2%, while the integration frequency was 31.4%. in s. aureus the excision and integration frequencies were 11.0% and 18.7%, respectively. truncated mutants identified the n-terminal domain of either ccrb or ccra as necessary for both integration and excision while the c terminal domain was important for recombination efficiency. site-directed mutagenesis of the n-terminal domain identified s11 and r79 of ccra and s16, r89, t149 and r151 of ccrb as essential residues for catalytic activities and the critical location of  these residues was consistent with a model of the tertiary structure of the n terminus of ccra and ccrb. furthermore, ccrab and ccrc, cloned from a panel of 6  methicillin-resistant s. aureus and 2 methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis strains carrying sccmec types ii, iv and v also catalyzed integration at rates 1.3 to-10 times higher than that of excision, similar to the results from n315. the tendency of sccmec integration to be favored over excision may explain the low spontaneous excision frequency seen among mrsa. importance: spontaneous excision of the genomic island (sccmec) that encodes resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in staphylococci (methicillin resistance) would convert a methicillin resistant to a methicillin susceptible strain, improving therapy of difficult infections. this study characterizes a model system by which the relative frequencies of excision and integration can be compared. using a plasmid-based model for excision and integration mediated by the recombinases ccra and ccrb, integration occurred at a higher frequency than excision, consistent with the low baseline excision frequency seen in most strains. this model system can now be used to study conditions and drugs that may raise the sccmec excision frequency and generate strains that are beta-lactam susceptible.

TI  == gut catalase-positive bacteria cross-protect adjacent bifidobacteria from oxidative stress.
AB  == bifidobacteria isolated from infant gut and breast milk exhibited different abilities to grow under microaerobic conditions, alone or in the presence of added catalase. in the present study, we demonstrated that some bifidobacterium strains unable to grow under microaerobic conditions were cross-protected on solid media from oxidative stress by adjacent colonies of gut catalase-positive staphylococcus epidermidis or escherichia coli, but not by a catalase-deficient e. coli. the results of this study support the possible contribution of catalase-positive bacteria to the establishment of certain bifidobacteria in non-anaerobic human niches of the infant gastrointestinal tract or mammary gland.

TI  == variation in bacterial atp concentration during rapid changes in extracellular ph and implications for the activity of attached bacteria.
AB  == in this study we investigated the relationship between a rapid change in extracellular ph and the alteration of bacterial atp concentration. this relationship is a key component of a hypothesis indicating that bacterial bioenergetics - the creation of atp from adp via a proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane - can be altered by the physiochemical charge-regulation effect, which results in a ph shift at the bacteria's surface upon adhesion to another surface. the bacterial atp concentration was measured during a rapid change in extracellular ph from a baseline ph of 7.2 to ph values between 3.5 and 10.5. experiments were conducted with four neutrophilic bacterial strains, including the gram-negative escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida and the gram-positive bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus epidermidis. a change in bulk  ph produced an immediate response in bacterial atp, demonstrating a direct link between changes in extracellular ph and cellular bioenergetics. in general, the shifts in atp were similar across the four bacterial strains, with results following an exponential relationship between the extracellular ph and cellular atp concentration. one exception occurred with s. epidermidis, where there was no variation in cellular atp at acidic ph values, and this finding is consistent with this species' ability to thrive under acidic conditions. these results provide insight into obtaining a desired bioenergetic response in bacteria through (i) the application of chemical treatments to vary the local ph and (ii)  the selection and design of surfaces resulting in local ph modification of attached bacteria via the charge-regulation effect.

TI  == the pathophysiological role of bacterial biofilms in chronic sinusitis.
AB  == chronic rhinosinusitis (crs) is a very common disorder that remains poorly understood from a pathogenic standpoint. recent research on the pathogenesis of crs has been focused on the potential role of biofilms in this chronic infection. the aim of this study was to assess the sinuses' microflora and biofilm formation on the sino-nasal mucosa in patients with crs. paranasal sinus mucosa specimens were harvested at the time of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (fess). classical microbiology techniques for the isolation and identification of sinus mucosa microbial flora were used. scanning electron microscopy (sem) was used to  detect biofilm on the surface of mucosa. a microtiter plate assay for in vitro biofilm formation was employed, divided into three aliquots. one part was assessed for bacterial presence, utilizing an api manual system and the vitek(r)  2 compact system. the two remaining aliquots were tested by in vitro conventional microbiological assay with the use of the infinite m200 (tecan) microtiter plate  reader, and also by scanning electron microscopy (sem). a microbiological examination of mucosal specimens had taken during fess operation revealed the presence of various types of bacteria in 29 out of 30 tested samples. out of 62 different strains isolated from patients with crs, 23 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococcus epidermidis and 6 strains of escherichia coli were the most frequently isolated microorganisms, accounting for 37.1 and 9.7 %,  respectively. among the 62 isolated strains, 58 were used to assess biofilm formation. from the total of 58 isolates, 8.6 % were strong biofilm producers, 20.7 % were moderate, and 70.7 % of isolates were considered to be non- or weak biofilm producers. sem of the 30 nasal concha mucosal samples taken from patients with crs revealed biofilm in 23 specimens. a marked destruction of the epithelium was observed, with variation in degrees of severity, from disarrayed cilia to complete absence of cilia. the vast majority of nasal concha mucosal samples of patients affected by chronic sinusitis presented with biofilm formation. our study showed that 76.7 % of patients having fess for crs had evidence of biofilms on sem micrographs. although certain detection methods could lead to various discrepancies in the amount of biofilm produced, the consistent demonstration of  biofilms in patients with crs suggests that this convoluted three-dimensional structures might play a significant role in either the pathogenesis or persistence of chronic rhinosinusitis.

TI  == [epidemiology of neonatal purulent meningitis in hebei province, china: a multicenter study].
AB  == objective: to investigate the clinical characteristics, diagnosis and main pathogenic bacteria, and outcomes of neonatal purulent meningitis. methods: a prospective epidemiological study was conducted in neonates with purulent meningitis admitted to 23 cooperating hospitals between 2013 and 2014. clinical data were collected and clinical characteristics and outcomes were analyzed. results: a total of 301 neonates with purulent meningitis from the 23 cooperating hospitals were included. neonatal pneumonia was the most common primary disease (167 cases, 55.5%). fever was the most common manifestation (214 cases, 71.1%). blood culture findings were positive in 72 patients (23.9%), with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus epidermidis as the most common bacteria. positive cerebrospinal fluid (csf) culture was found in 36 patients (36/264, 13.6%) , with escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis as the most common bacteria. the median of csf wbc counts was 80/mm(3) (range: 0-9 2500/mm(3)), and 11 cases (3.7%) had csf wbc counts of <20/mm(3) and 154 cases (51.2%) had csf wbc counts of >100/mm(3). there were 258 patients (85.7%) who were cured or improved at discharge and 15 deaths (15/298, 5.0%). conclusions: the most common primary disease of neonatal purulent meningitis is neonatal pneumonia in this area. the patients with neonatal purulent meningitis most often present with fever. escherichia coli is the leading pathogenic bacteria causing neonatal purulent meningitis. a normal csf wbc count can barely be used to exclude the possibility of this diosorder.

TI  == composition and antimicrobial activity of euphrasia rostkoviana hayne essential oil.
AB  == eyebright, euphrasia rostkoviana hayne (scrophulariaceae), is a medicinal plant traditionally used in europe for the treatment of various health disorders, especially as eyewash to treat eye ailments such as conjunctivitis and blepharitis that can be associated with bacterial infections. some euphrasia species have been previously reported to contain essential oil. however, the composition and bioactivity of e. rostkoviana oil are unknown. therefore, in this study, we investigated the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the eyebright essential oil against some organisms associated with eye infections: enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans. gc-ms analysis revealed more than 70 constituents, with n-hexadecanoic acid (18.47%) as the main constituent followed by thymol (7.97%), myristic acid (4.71%), linalool  (4.65%), and anethole (4.09%). the essential oil showed antimicrobial effect against all organisms tested with the exception of p. aeruginosa. the best activity was observed against all gram-positive bacteria tested with the minimum  inhibitory concentrations of 512 microg/ml. this is the first report on the chemical composition of e. rostkoviana essential oil and its antimicrobial activity.

TI  == quaternized chitosans bind onto preexisting biofilms and eradicate pre-attached microorganisms.
AB  == quaternized chitosans, n,n,n-trimethylchitosans (tmc) with different degree of quaternization were synthesized by reacting methyl iodide with chitosan. the reaction was confirmed by ft-ir and 1h-nmr characterization. antimicrobial assay  showed that the prepared tmc had potent biocidal effects against planktonic gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus epidermidis, gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, and yeast candida albicans. bacterial and fungal biofilms were  formed on poly(methyl methacrylate) (pmma) films and then treated with tmc aqueous solutions. zeta potential measurement suggested that tmc bonded onto the  preexisting biofilms. biofilm-binding kinetics was evaluated in uv studies using  phenyl group-labeled tmc as model compounds, which revealed that quaternized chitosans bonded onto the preexisting biofilms rapidly. colony-forming unit (cfu) determination and sem, confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence microscopy studies demonstrated that the bonded tmc had powerful biocidal activities to eradicate the pre-attached bacterial and fungal cells in the preexisting biofilms. the biocompatibility of the tmc samples with rat skin fibroblast cells was evaluated in the mtt assay.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oils of portuguese foeniculum vulgare fruits.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from fruits of six fennel accessions collected from wild populations occurring in the  centre and south of portugal. composition of essential oils was established by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (gc-fid) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) analysis. the obtained yields of the essential oils were found to vary greatly in the range of 1.1 to 2.9% (v/w) and the chemical composition varied with the region of collection. a total of 16 compounds were identified. the main compounds were fenchone (16.9 - 34.7%), estragole (2.5 - 66.0%) and trans-anethole (7.9 - 77.7%). the percentages of these three main compounds were used to determine the relationship between the different oil samples and to group them into four different chemotypes: anethole/fenchone; anethole; estragole and anethole/estragole. antifungal activity of essential oils was evaluated against six food spoilage fungi: aspergillus niger, a. japonicus, a. oryzae, fusarium oxysporum, rhizophus oryzae and r. stolonifer. antibacterial  activity was assessed against three gram-positive strains: enterococcus faecalis  atcc 29212, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228 and s. aureus atcc 28213; and against six gram-negative strains: escherichia coli atcc 25922; morganella morganii lfg 08; proteus mirabilis lfg 04; salmonella enteritidis lfg 05; s. entiritidis serovar typhimurium lfg 06 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 by the disc diffusion agar method; the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined using the broth macro-dilution method. the mic values varied from 62.5 (e. coli atcc 25922) to 2000 microml (p. aeruginosa atcc 27853).

TI  == mechanism of cell integration on biomaterial implant surfaces in the presence of  bacterial contamination.
AB  == bacterial contamination during biomaterial implantation is often unavoidable, yielding a combat between cells and bacteria. here we aim to determine the modulatory function of bacterial components on stem-cell, fibroblast, and osteoblast adhesion to a titanium alloy, including the role of toll-like-receptors (tlrs). presence of heat-sacrificed staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa induced dose and cell-type dependent responses. stem-cells were most sensitive to bacterial presence, demonstrating decreased adhesion number yet increased adhesion effort with a relatively large focal adhesion contact area. blocking tlrs had no effect on stem-cell adhesion in presence of s. aureus, but blocking both tlr2 and tlr4 induced an increased adhesion effort in presence of e. coli. neither lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, nor bacterial dna provoked the same cell response as did whole bacteria. herewith we suggest a new mechanism as  to how biomaterials are integrated by cells despite the unavoidable presence of bacterial contamination. stimulation of host cell integration of implant surfaces may open a new window to design new biomaterials with enhanced healing, thereby reducing the risk of biomaterial-associated infection of both "hardware-based" implants as well as of tissue-engineered constructs, known to suffer from similarly high infection risks as currently prevailing in "hardware-based" implants.

TI  == metabolic pathways of pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in competition with respiratory bacterial pathogens.
AB  == background: chronic airway infection by pseudomonas aeruginosa considerably contributes to lung tissue destruction and impairment of pulmonary function in cystic-fibrosis (cf) patients. complex interplays between p. aeruginosa and other co-colonizing pathogens including staphylococcus aureus, burkholderia sp., and klebsiella pneumoniae may be crucial for pathogenesis and disease progression. methods: we generated a library of pa14 transposon insertion mutants to identify  p. aeruginosa genes required for exploitative and direct competitions with s. aureus, burkholderia cenocepacia, and k. pneumoniae. results: whereas wild-type pa14 inhibited s. aureus growth, two transposon insertions located in pqsc and carb, resulted in reduced growth inhibition. pqsc is involved in the synthesis of 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (haqs), a family of molecules having antibacterial properties, while carb is a key gene in pyrimidine biosynthesis. the carb mutant  was also unable to grow in the presence of b. cepacia and k. pneumoniae but not escherichia coli and s. epidermidis. we further identified a transposon insertion in purf, encoding a key enzyme of purine metabolism. this mutant displayed a severe growth deficiency in the presence of gram-negative but not of gram-positive bacteria. we identified a beneficial interaction in a bioa transposon mutant, unable to grow on rich medium. this growth defect could be restored either by addition of biotin or by co-culturing the mutant in the presence of k. pneumoniae or e. coli. conclusion: complex interactions take place between the various bacterial species colonizing cf-lungs. this work identified both detrimental and beneficial interactions occurring between p. aeruginosa and  three other respiratory pathogens involving several major metabolic pathways. manipulating these pathways could be used to interfere with bacterial interactions and influence the colonization by respiratory pathogens.

TI  == composition, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiproliferative activity of origanum dictamnus (dittany) essential oil.
AB  == background: nowadays, there has been an increased interest in essential oils from various plant origins as potential antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiproliferative agents. this trend can be mainly attributed to the rising number and severity of food poisoning outbreaks worldwide along with the recent negative consumer perception against artificial food additives and the demand for novel functional foods with possible health benefits. origanum dictamnus (dittany) is an aromatic, tender perennial plant that only grows wild on the mountainsides and gorges of the island of crete in greece. objective: the aim of  the present study was to investigate the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiproliferative properties of o. dictamnus essential oil and its main components and assess its commercial potential in the food industry. design: o. dictamnus essential oil was initially analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) to determine semi-quantitative chemical composition of the essential oils. subsequently, the antimicrobial properties were assayed and the minimum inhibitory and non-inhibitory concentration values were determined. the antioxidant activity and cytotoxic action against the hepatoma adenocarcinoma cell line hepg2 of the essential oil and its main components were further evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) assay and by the sulforhodamine b (srb) assay, respectively. results: the main constituents of o.  dictamnus essential oil identified by gc-ms analysis were carvacrol (52.2%), gamma-terpinene (8.4%), p-cymene (6.1%), linalool (1.4%), and caryophyllene (1.3%). o. dictamnus essential oil and its main components were effective against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and aspergillus niger. in addition, the estimated ic50 value for the  dpph radical scavenging activity for o. dictamnus essential oil was 0.045+/-0.0042% (v/v) and was mainly attributed to carvacrol. the ec50 value for  the essential oil in the 72h srb assay in hepg2 cells was estimated to be 0.0069+/-0.00014% (v/v). among the individual constituents tested, carvacrol was  the most bioactive compound and accounted for the observed antiproliferative activity of the essential oil. conclusions: the results revealed that o. dictamnus essential oil is a noteworthy growth inhibitor against the microbes studied. it also possesses significant antioxidant activity and demonstrated excellent cytotoxicity against hepg2 cells. taken together, o. dictamnus essential oil may represent an effective and inexpensive source of potent natural antimicrobial agents with health-promoting properties, which may be incorporated  in food systems.

TI  == antipsychotics inhibit glucose transport: determination of olanzapine binding site in staphylococcus epidermidis glucose/h(+) symporter.
AB  == the antipsychotic drug olanzapine is widely prescribed to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. however, it often causes unwanted side effects, including diabetes, due to disruption of insulin-dependant glucose metabolism through a mechanism yet to be elucidated. to determine if olanzapine can affect the first step in glucose metabolism - glucose transport inside cells - we investigated the effect of this drug on the transport activity of a model glucose transporter. the glucose transporter from staphylococcus epidermidis (glcpse) is  specific for glucose, inhibited by various human glucose transporter (glut) inhibitors, has high sequence and structure homology to gluts, and is readily amenable to transport assay, mutagenesis, and computational modeling. we found that olanzapine inhibits glucose transport of glcpse with an ic50 0.9 +/- 0.1 mm. computational docking of olanzapine to the glcpse structure revealed potential binding sites that were further examined through mutagenesis and transport assay  to identify residues important for olanzapine inhibition. these investigations suggest that olanzapine binds in a polar region of the cytosolic part of the transporter, and interacts with residues r129, strictly conserved in all gluts, and n136, conserved in only a few gluts, including the insulin-responsive glut4.  we propose that olanzapine inhibits glcpse by impeding the alternating opening and closing of the substrate cavity necessary for glucose transport. it accomplishes this by disrupting a key salt bridge formed by conserved residues r129 and e362, that stabilizes the outward-facing conformation of the transporter.

TI  == development of gendine coated cannula for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for extended use.
AB  == continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (csii) using pumps is a widely used method for insulin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus. one of the major factors that usually lead to the discontinuation of csii is csii set related issues including infection at the infusion site. current american diabetic association recommends rotating sites every 2-3 days. this adds cost and creates  inconvenience. therefore, in order to prevent infections and extend durations between insertion site changes, we have developed a teflon cannula coated with the combination of gentian violet and chlorhexidine (gendine) and tested its antimicrobial efficacy against different pathogens. cannulas were coated with gendine on exterior surface and dried. efficacy and durability of gendine cannulas was determined against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin- susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and candida glabrata using biofilm colonization method. cytotoxicity of gendine was assessed against mouse fibroblast cell lines. gendine cannulas showed complete prevention of biofilm colonization of all organisms tested up to 2 weeks (p < 0.0001) compared to uncoated control. gendine catheter against mouse fibroblast cells shown to be non-cytotoxic. our in vitro results show that a novel gendine cannula is highly effective in completely inhibiting biofilm of multi-drug resistant pathogens for  up to 2 weeks and may have potential clinical applications such as prolonged use, cost reduction and decreased infection rate.

TI  == anti-sessile bacterial and cytocompatibility properties of chx-loaded nanohydroxyapatite.
AB  == nanohydroxyapatite possesses exceptional biocompatibility and bioactivity regarding bone cells and tissues, justifying its use as a coating material or as  a bone substitute. unfortunately, this feature may also encourage bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. surface functionalization with antimicrobials is  a promising strategy to reduce the likelihood of bacterial infestation and colonization on medical devices. chlorhexidine digluconate is a common and effective antimicrobial agent used for a wide range of medical applications. the  purpose of this work was the development of a nanoha biomaterial loaded with chx  to prevent surface bacterial accumulation and, simultaneously, with good cytocompatibility, for application in the medical field. chx (5-1500mg/l) was loaded onto nanoha discs and the materials were evaluated for chx adsorption and  release profile, physic-chemical features, antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, and cytocompatibility toward l929 fibroblasts. results showed that the adsorption of  chx on nanoha surface occurred by electrostatic interactions between the cationic group of chx and the phosphate group of nanoha. the release of chx from chx-loaded nanoha showed a fast initial rate followed by a slower kinetics release, due to constraints caused by dilution and diffusion-limiting processes.  nanoha.50 to nanoha.1500 showed strong anti-sessile activity, inhibiting bacterial adhesion and the biofilm formation. chx-nanoha caused a dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on the proliferation of fibroblasts for nanoha.100 to nanoha.1500. cellular behavior on nanoha.5 and nanoha.50 was similar to control. therefore, chx-loaded nanoha surfaces appear as a promising alternative to prevention of devices-related infections.

TI  == multilayer hydrogel coatings to combine hemocompatibility and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == while silver-loaded catheters are widely used to prevent early-onset catheter-related infections [1], long term antimicrobial protection of indwelling catheters remains to be achieved [2] and antiseptic functionalization of coatings often impairs their hemocompatibility characteristics. therefore, this work aimed to capitalize on the antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles, incorporated in anticoagulant poly(ethylene glycol) (peg)-heparin hydrogel coatings [3] on thermoplastic polyurethane materials. for prolonged antimicrobial activity, the silver-containing starpeg-heparin hydrogel layers were shielded with silver-free hydrogel layers of otherwise similar composition. the resulting  multi-layered gel coatings showed long term antiseptic efficacy against escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis strains in vitro, and similarly performed well when incubated with freshly drawn human whole blood with respect to hemolysis, platelet activation and plasmatic coagulation. the introduced hydrogel multilayer system thus offers a promising combination of hemocompatibility and long-term antiseptic capacity to meet an important clinical need.

TI  == inhibition of various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria growth on selenium nanoparticle coated paper towels.
AB  == there are wide spread bacterial contamination issues on various paper products, such as paper towels hanging in sink splash zones or those used to clean surfaces, filter papers used in water and air purifying systems, and wrappings used in the food industry; such contamination may lead to the potential spread of bacteria and consequent severe health concerns. in this study, selenium nanoparticles were coated on normal paper towel surfaces through a quick precipitation method, introducing antibacterial properties to the paper towels in a healthy way. their effectiveness at preventing biofilm formation was tested in  bacterial assays involving staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the results showed significant  and continuous bacteria inhibition with about a 90% reduction from 24 to 72 hours for gram-positive bacteria including s. aureus and s. epidermidis. the selenium coated paper towels also showed significant inhibition of gram-negative bacteria  like p. aeruginosa and e. coli growth at about 57% and 84%, respectively, after 72 hours of treatment. therefore, this study established a promising selenium-based antibacterial strategy to prevent bacterial growth on paper products, which may lead to the avoidance of bacteria spreading and consequent severe health concerns.

AB  == background and objectives: although most pathogen reduction systems for plasma primarily target viruses, bacterial contamination may also occur. this study aimed to investigate the bacterial reduction capacity of a methylene blue (mb) treatment process and its virus inactivation capacity in lipaemic plasma. materials and methods: bacterial concentrations in plasma units spiked with different bacterial strains were measured before and after the following steps of the theraflex mb-plasma procedure: leucocyte filtration, mb/light treatment and mb filtration. virus inactivation was investigated for three virus types in non-lipaemic, borderline lipaemic and highly lipaemic plasma. results: leucocyte  filtration alone efficiently eliminated most of the tested bacteria by more than  4 logs (staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus) or to the limit of  detection (lod) (>/= 4.8 logs; escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and klebsiella pneumoniae). mb/light and mb filtration further reduced staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus to below the lod. the small bacterium brevundimonas diminuta was reduced by 1.7 logs by leucocyte filtration alone, and to below the lod by additional mb/light treatment and mb filtration (>/= 3.7 logs). suid herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus and human immunodeficiency virus 1 were efficiently inactivated by theraflex mb-plasma, independent of the degree of lipaemia. conclusion: theraflex mb-plasma efficiently reduces bacteria, mainly via the integrated filtration system. its virus inactivation capacity is sufficient to compensate for reduced light transparency due to lipaemia.

TI  == quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion using surface free energy determined with a spectrophotometric method.
AB  == bacterial adhesion onto solid surfaces is of importance in a wide spectrum of problems, including environmental microbiology, biomedical research, and various  industrial applications. despite many research efforts, present thermodynamic models that rely on the evaluation of the adhesion energy are often elusive in predicting the bacterial adhesion behavior. here, we developed a new spectrophotometric method to determine the surface free energy (sfe) of bacterial cells. the adhesion behaviors of five bacterial species, pseudomonas putida kt2440, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, and escherichia coli dh5alpha, onto two model substratum surfaces, i.e., clean glass and silanized glass surfaces, were studied. we found that bacterial adhesion was unambiguously mediated by the sfe difference between the bacterial cells and the solid substratum. the lower the sfe difference, the higher degree of bacterial adhesion. we therefore propose the use of the sfe difference as an accurate and simple thermodynamic measure for quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion. the methodological advance and thermodynamic simplification in the paper have implications in controlling bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on solid surfaces.

TI  == synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of water-soluble silver(i) complexes of metronidazole drug and selected counter-ions.
AB  == a series of water-soluble silver(i) complexes of the type [ag(mtz)2x] [mtz = 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-5-nitro-1h-imidazole (metronidazole drug); x = no3(-), clo4(-), cf3coo(-), bf4(-) and ch3so3(-)] was synthesised by the reactions of various ag(i) salts with metronidazole (mtz). all the complexes were characterized by esi-ms spectrometry, solution nmr ((1)h and (13)c) and ir spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. further evidence for the formation and molecular structure of all the complexes was provided by x-ray single-crystal crystallography. the different counter ions affect the crystal packing of the complexes and thus have an impact on the final geometries. the antimicrobial activities of the complexes against two gram-positive strains: staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, three gram-negative strains: pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, escherichia coli atcc 25922, proteus  hauseri atcc 13315 and yeast candida albicans atcc 10231 were evaluated and compared with antibacterial and antifungal properties of appropriate silver salts, metronidazole and silver sulfadiazine drugs. the newly synthesized compounds exhibited significant antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, better than the referenced silver sulfadiazine. the best active silver(i)-metronidazole complex contains a methanesulphonate counter-ion. moreover, the complex inhibited the growth of yeast candida albicans at a concentration 3-fold lower than that required for silver sulfadiazine. in addition, the complexes containing a tetrafluoroborate and a perchlorate as counter-ions were characterized as effective antibacterial agents against the tested gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == hydroxypropylcellulose as a novel green reservoir for the synthesis, stabilization, and storage of silver nanoparticles.
AB  == polysaccharides are attracting the vigil eye of researchers in order to design the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (ag nps) of diverse size, shape, and  application. we report an environmentally friendly method to synthesize ag nps where no physical reaction conditions were employed. hydroxypropylcellulose (hpc) was used as a template nanoreactor, stabilizer, and capping agent to obtain ag nps. different concentrations of agno3 solutions (50 mmol, 75 mmol, and 100 mmol) were mixed with a concentrated aqueous solution of hpc and the progress of the reaction was monitored by noting color changes of the reaction mixture at different reaction times for up to 24 hours. characteristic ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (uv/vis) absorption bands of ag nps were observed in the range of 388-452 nm. the morphology of the ag nps was studied by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (tem), and atomic force microscopy.  the tem images confirmed that the size of the ag nps was in the range of 25-55 nm. powder x-ray diffraction studies showed that the crystal phase of the ag nps  was face-centered cubic. the as-prepared ag nps were found to be stable, and no changes in size and morphology were observed after storage in hpc thin films over 1 year, as indicated by uv/vis spectra. so, the present work furnishes a green and economical strategy for the synthesis and storage of stable ag nps. as-synthesized ag nps showed significant antimicrobial activity against different bacterial (escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungal strains (actinomycetes and aspergillus niger).

TI  == a c-type lectin from bothrops jararacussu venom disrupts staphylococcal biofilms.
AB  == bovine mastitis is a major threat to animal health and the dairy industry. staphylococcus aureus is a contagious pathogen that is usually associated with persistent intramammary infections, and biofilm formation is a relevant aspect of the outcome of these infections. several biological activities have been described for snake venoms, which led us to screen secretions of bothrops jararacussu for antibiofilm activity against s. aureus nrs155. crude venom was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, and the fractions were tested against s. aureus. biofilm growth, but not bacterial growth, was affected by several fractions. two fractions (15 and 16) showed the best activities and were  also assayed against s. epidermidis nrs101. fraction 15 was identified by tripletof mass spectrometry as a galactose-binding c-type lectin with a molecular weight of 15 kda. the lectin was purified from the crude venom by d-galactose affinity chromatography, and only one peak was observed. this pure lectin was able to inhibit 75% and 80% of s. aureus and s. epidermidis biofilms, respectively, without affecting bacterial cell viability. the lectin also exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both bacterial biofilms. the antibiofilm activity was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. a pre-formed s. epidermidis biofilm was significantly disrupted by the c-type lectin in a time-dependent manner. additionally, the lectin demonstrated the ability to inhibit biofilm formation by several mastitis pathogens, including different field strains of s. aureus, s. hyicus, s. chromogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and escherichia coli. these findings reveal a new activity for c-type lectins. studies are underway to evaluate the biological activity of these lectins in a mouse mastitis model.

TI  == multifunctional network-structured film coating for woven and knitted polyethylene terephthalate against cardiovascular graft-associated infections.
AB  == multifunctional network-structured polymeric coat for woven and knitted forms of  crimped polyethylene terephthalate pet graft was developed to limit graft-associated infections. a newly synthesized antibacterial sulfadimethoxine polyhexylene adipate-b-methoxy polyethylene oxide (sd-pha-b-mpeo) di-block copolymer was employed. our figures of merit revealed that the formed coat showed a porous topographic architecture which manifested paramount properties, mostly bacterial anti-adhesion efficiency and biocompatibility with host cells. compared to untreated grafts, the coat presented marked reduction of adhered gram-positive staphylococcus epidermidis previously isolated from a patient's vein catheter by  2.6 and 2.3 folds for woven and knitted grafts, respectively. similarly, bacterial anti-adhesion effect was observed for staphylococcus aureus by 2.3 and  2.4 folds, and by 2.9 and 2.7 folds for gram-negative escherichia coli for woven  and knitted grafts, respectively. additionally, adhesion and growth characteristics of l929 cells on the modified grafts revealed no significant effect on the biocompatibility. in conclusion, coating of pet with (sd-pha-b-mpeo) is a versatile approach offers the desired bacterial anti-adhesion effect and host biocompatibility.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 4-bromo-1h-indazole derivatives as  ftsz inhibitors.
AB  == a series of novel 4-bromo-1h-indazole derivatives as filamentous temperature-sensitive protein z (ftsz) inhibitors were designed, synthesized, and assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activity against various phenotypes of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and their cell division inhibitory activity. the results indicated that this series showed better antibacterial activity against staphylococcus epidermidis and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pyogenes than the other tested strains. among them, compounds 12 and 18 exhibited 256-fold and 256-fold more potent activity than 3-methoxybenzamide (3-mba) against penicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and compound 18 showed 64-fold better activity than 3-mba but 4-fold weaker activity than ciprofloxacin in the inhibition of s. aureus atcc29213. particularly, compound 9 presented the best activity (4 microg/ml) against s. pyogenes ps, being 32-fold, 32-fold, and 2-fold more active than 3-mba, curcumin, and ciprofloxacin, respectively, but it was four times less active than oxacillin sodium. in addition, some synthesized compounds displayed moderate inhibition of  cell division against s. aureus atcc25923, escherichia coli atcc25922, and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc27853, sharing a minimum cell division concentration of 128 microg/ml.

TI  == antimicrobial lubricant formulations containing poly(hydroxybenzene)-trimethoprim conjugates synthesized by tyrosinase.
AB  == poly(hydroxybenzene)-trimethoprim conjugates were prepared using methylparaben as substrate of the oxidative enzyme tyrosinase. maldi-tof ms analysis showed that the enzymatic oxidation of methylparaben alone leads to the poly(hydroxybenzene)  formation. in the presence of trimethoprim, the methylparaben tyrosinase oxidation leads poly(hydroxybenzene)-trimethoprim conjugates. all of these compounds were incorporated into lubricant hydroxyethyl cellulose/glycerol mixtures. poly(hydroxybenzene)-trimethoprim conjugates were the most effective phenolic structures against the bacterial growth reducing by 96 and 97 % of escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis suspensions, respectively (after  24 h). a novel enzymatic strategy to produce antimicrobial poly(hydroxybenzene)-antibiotic conjugates is proposed here for a wide range of applications on the biomedical field.

TI  == new antimicrobial contact catalyst killing antibiotic resistant clinical and waterborne pathogens.
AB  == microbial growth on medical and technical devices is a big health issue, particularly when microorganisms aggregate to form biofilms. moreover, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the clinical environment is dramatically growing, making treatment of bacterial infections very challenging.  in search of an alternative, we studied a novel antimicrobial surface coating based on micro galvanic elements formed by silver and ruthenium with surface catalytic properties. the antimicrobial coating efficiently inhibited the growth  of the nosocomial pathogens staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as demonstrated by the growth inhibition on agar surface and in biofilms of antibiotic resistant clinical e. faecalis, e. faecium, and s. aureus isolates. it also strongly reduced the growth of legionella in a drinking water pipeline and of escherichia coli in urine. we postulate a mode of action of the antimicrobial material, which is independent of the release of silver ions. thus, the novel antimicrobial coating could represent an alternative to combat microbial growth avoiding the toxic side effects of high levels of silver ions on eukaryotic cells.

TI  == bacterial growth rates are influenced by cellular characteristics of individual species when immersed in electromagnetic fields.
AB  == previous studies have shown that exposure to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (elf-emfs) have negative effects on the rate of growth of  bacteria. in the present study, two gram-positive and two gram-negative species were exposed to six magnetic field conditions in broth cultures. three variations of the 'thomas' pulsed frequency-modulated pattern; a strong-static "puck" magnet upwards of 5000g in intensity; a pair of these magnets rotating opposite one another at approximately 30rpm; and finally a strong dynamic magnetic field generator termed the 'resonator' with an average intensity of 250mut were used. growth rate was discerned by optical density (od) measurements every hour at 600nm. elf-emf conditions significantly affected the rates of growth of the bacterial cultures, while the two static magnetic field conditions were not statistically significant. most interestingly, the 'resonator' dynamic magnetic field increased the rates of growth of three species (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli), while slowing the growth of one (serratia marcescens). we suggest that these effects are due to individual biophysical characteristics of the bacterial species.

TI  == introducing a semi-coated model to investigate antibacterial effects of biocompatible polymers on titanium surfaces.
AB  == peri-implant infections from bacterial biofilms on artificial surfaces are a common threat to all medical implants. they are a handicap for the patient and can lead to implant failure or even life-threatening complications. new implant surfaces have to be developed to reduce biofilm formation and to improve the long-term prognosis of medical implants. the aim of this study was (1) to develop a new method to test the antibacterial efficacy of implant surfaces by direct surface contact and (2) to elucidate whether an innovative antimicrobial copolymer coating of 4-vinyl-n-hexylpyridinium bromide and dimethyl(2-methacryloyloxyethyl) phosphonate (vp:dmmep 30:70) on titanium is able to reduce the attachment of bacteria prevalent in peri-implant infections. with a new in vitro model with semi-coated titanium discs, we were able to show a dramatic reduction in the adhesion of various pathogenic bacteria (streptococcus  sanguinis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis),  completely independently of effects caused by soluble materials. in contrast, soft tissue cells (human gingival or dermis fibroblasts) were less affected by the same coating, despite a moderate reduction in initial adhesion of gingival fibroblasts. these data confirm the hypothesis that vp:dmmep 30:70 is a promising antibacterial copolymer that may be of use in several clinical applications.

TI  == silver release and antimicrobial properties of pmma films doped with silver ions, nano-particles and complexes.
AB  == materials prepared on the base of bioactive silver compounds have become more and more popular due to low microbial resistance to silver. in the present work, the  efficiency of polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) thin films doped with silver ions, nanoparticles and silver-imidazole polymer complex was studied by a combination of aas, xps and afm techniques. the biological activities of the proposed materials were discussed in view of the rate of silver releasing from the polymer matrix. concentrations of ag active form were estimated by its ability to interact with l-cysteine using electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy. rates  of the released silver were compared with the biological activity in dependence on the form of embedded silver. antimicrobial properties of doped polymer films were studied using two bacterial strains: staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli. it was found that pmma films doped with ag(+) had greater activity than those doped with nanoparticles and silver-imidazole polymeric complexes. however, the antimicrobial efficiency of ag(+) doped films was only short-term. contrary, the antimicrobial activity of silver-imidazole/pmma films increased in time of sample soaking.

TI  == recombinant production and evaluation of an antibacterial l-amino acid oxidase derived from flounder platichthys stellatus.
AB  == fish produce mucus substances as a defensive outer barrier against several bacterial infections. we have recently identified an antibacterial l-amino acid oxidase (pslaao1) in the mucus layer of the flounder platichthys stellate. in this study, the antibacterial protein pslaao1 was expressed as a secretory bioactive recombinant protein in the methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris. the recombinant pslaao1 inhibited the growth of bacteria to the same levels as native pslaao1 present in mucus. in particular, staphylococci and yersinia were strongly suppressed, showing the highest growth retardation of the 21 species and strains  tested. moreover, staphylococcus epidermidis was most sensitive to pslaao1 with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 0.078 mug/ml, whereas escherichia coli  was essentially resistant to pslaao1 with a mic of >10 mug/ml. interestingly, pslaao1-treated e. coli were found to upregulate the expression of the btue gene, which encodes glutathione peroxidase (gpx). the biochemical function of gpx is to reduce free hydrogen peroxide and is induced under response to reactive oxygen species (ros). thus, e. coli confers resistance to the reduced free hydrogen peroxide produced by pslaao1 by increasing gpx levels. furthermore, the growth of staphylococcus aureus was completely inhibited in the presence of recombinant pslaao1. the morphology of pslaao1-treated s. aureus showed cell surface damage,  the formation of large aggregates and the cells showed severe deformations. western blot analysis showed that pslaao1 binds to the surface of s. aureus. therefore, pslaao1 binds to the surface of laao-sensitive s. aureus and directs peroxidative activity at the surface of the bacterial membrane.

TI  == compounds from geijera parviflora with prostaglandin e2 inhibitory activity may explain its traditional use for pain relief.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: australian aboriginal people used crushed leaves  of geijera parviflora lindl. both internally and externally for pain relief, including for toothache (cribb and cribb, 1981). this study tested the hypothesis that this traditional use might be at least in part explained by the presence of  compounds with anti-inflammatory activity. materials and methods: a crude extract (95% etoh) was prepared from powdered dried leaves. from the ch3cl fraction of this extract compounds were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation and tested  for: (1) cytotoxicity in raw 264.7 murine leukemic monocyte-macrophages, (2) prostaglandin e2 (pge2) inhibitory activity in 3t3 swiss albino mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, as well as (3) nitric oxide (no) and (4) tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha) inhibitory activity in lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated raw 264.7 cells. isolated compounds were also tested for (5) antibacterial activity against a panel of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and atcc 25923, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 35984, biofilm-forming) and gram-negative  (escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853) strains by broth microdilution. results: eleven compounds were isolated, including one new flavone and one new natural product, with a further four compounds reported from this species for the first time. some of the compounds showed good anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. in particular, flindersine (1) and n-(acetoxymethyl) flindersine (3) inhibited pge2 release with ic50 values of 5.0mum and 4.9mum, respectively, without any significant cytotoxicity. several other compounds showed moderate inhibition of no (5, 6, 7) and tnf-alpha (6), with ic50 in the low micromolar range; however much of this apparent activity could be accounted for by the cytotoxicity of these compounds. none of the compounds showed anti-bacterial activity. conclusions: the inhibition of pge2, an important mediator of inflammation and pain, by flindersine and a derivative thereof, along with the moderate anti-inflammatory activity shown by several other compounds isolated from geijera parviflora leaf extract, support the traditional use of this plant for pain relief by australian aboriginal people.

TI  == microbiology of pelvic lymphocyst infection after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors.
AB  == background: pelvic lymphocyst infection is a rare complication after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors. although medical therapy is a useful addition to surgical drainage, the appropriate antibiotic regimen is unknown because few studies have examined the causative organisms. the purpose of this case series was to identify the micro-organisms infecting pelvic lymphocysts. methods: this was a single-center, retrospective, case-series review conducted at a tertiary-care cancer center between october 2002 and march 2013. the participants included all patients who experienced their first pelvic lymphocyst infection after undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer and exhibited positive lymphocyst fluid culture. computed tomography- or sonography-guided percutaneous aspiration procedures were performed to obtain lymphocyst fluid for culture. results: during the study period, 878 patients underwent lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignant tumors,  and 13 developed a pelvic lymphocyst infection documented microbiologically. cultures identified staphylococcus aureus (three patients), s. epidermidis (one patient), streptococcus agalactiae (three patients), enterococcus (two patients), escherichia coli (one patient), and anaerobic bacteria (three patients). they were all monomicrobial infections. conclusions: our study and other smaller ones  suggest that lymphocyst infections following pelvic lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors usually are monomicrobial and caused by gram-positive cocci, including staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus, and anaerobes such as  bacteroides fragilis. these bacteria should be considered when selecting empiric  antibiotic therapy.

AB  == a strategy to release attached bacteria from surface-grafted bactericidal poly((trimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate chloride) (ptmaema) brushes has been proposed. the ptmaema brushes were fabricated via the surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization for contact killing of bacteria, including escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the bacteria-conditioning surfaces, afterward, were washed with electrolyte solutions containing anions with different lipophilic characteristic, charge density, polarity and adsorbility to quaternary ammonium groups in polymers. because of the special ion-pairing interactions, the interfacial properties, including wettability and zeta-potential, can be manipulated in a controlled manner. therefore, the counterion-assisted modulation of ptmaema brushes facilitates the bacterial release and regeneration of antimicrobial polymer films. the physicochemical properties of polymer brushes and their interactions with counterions were characterized using an ellipsometer, contact angle goniometer, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and an electrokinetic analyzer. the  repetitive killing and releasing actions of ptmaema through unlocking and locking counterions were demonstrated, showing the robust effectiveness of the ptmaema-based nanoactuator in controlling the physical action by the chemical stimuli. the real-world implementation of the nanoactuator was demonstrated with  a surgical scalpel by repelling killed bacteria and retaining reusability.

TI  == synthetic beta-sheet forming peptide amphiphiles for treatment of fungal keratitis.
AB  == fungal keratitis is a leading cause of ocular morbidity. it is frequently misdiagnosed as bacterial keratitis, causing a delay in proper treatment. furthermore, due to the lack of safe and effective anti-fungal agents for clinical use, treatment of fugal keratitis remains a challenge. in recent years,  antimicrobial peptides (amps) have received considerable attention as potent and  broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents with the potential to overcome antibiotics resistance. we previously reported the design of short synthetic beta-sheet forming peptides (ikik)2-nh2 and (irik)2-nh2 with excellent antimicrobial activities and selectivities against various clinically relevant microorganisms,  including gram-positive staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and yeast candida albicans (c. albicans). in this study, we evaluated the application of the two most promising synthetic beta-sheet forming peptide candidates for in vivo fungal keratitis treatment in comparison with the commercially available amphotericin b. it was found that topical solutions of the designed peptides are safe, and as effective as the clinically used amphotericin b. compared to the costly and unstable amphotericin b, (ikik)2-nh2 and (irik)2-nh2 are water-soluble, less expensive and stable. thus, the synthetic beta-sheet forming peptides are presented as promising candidates for the treatment of fungal keratitis.

TI  == antimicrobial and bacteria-releasing multifunctional surfaces: oligo (p-phenylene-ethynylene)/poly (n-isopropylacrylamide) films deposited by rir-maple.
AB  == antimicrobial oligo (p-phenylene-ethynylene) (ope) films have previously been demonstrated to show effective ultraviolet a (uva) light-induced biocidal activity; however, a serious problem arises from the accumulation of dead bacteria and debris on the films that limits their effectiveness and application. in this work, we address this challenge by incorporating thermally-responsive poly (n-isopropylacrylamide) (pnipaam), which provides on-demand bacteria-releasing functionality. multifunctional surfaces comprising blended films of ope and pnipaam were deposited on substrates by resonant infrared, matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (rir-maple) using a sequential co-deposition mode. in this way, rir-maple enabled the deposition of multifunctional films with surface properties and film functionality that can be  tailored, precisely and systematically, by controlling the chemical composition of the deposited film. the surface properties of these films were characterized by uv-visible (uv-vis) absorbance spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy  (xps), atomic force microscopy (afm), and water contact angle measurements. the interactions between bacteria and the deposited films were tested using two model bacteria: escherichia coli k12 (gram-negative) and staphylococcus epidermidis (gram-positive). the antimicrobial and bacteria-release properties of the blended films were controlled by varying the ope/pnipaam ratio in the rir-maple emulsion  target, providing an easy way to optimize the multifunctional surface. the ope/pnipaam blended films with optimized composition killed a majority of attached e. coli bacteria at 37 degrees c and under uva exposure, and the dead bacteria were then removed from the films simply by rinsing with water at 25 degrees c.

TI  == in vitro comparison of biological and synthetic materials for skeletal chest wall reconstruction.
AB  == background: various biological and synthetic materials have been proposed for use in skeletal chest wall reconstruction (scwr). because of the lack of studies allowing a direct comparison of scwr materials, their clinical use often depends  on the surgeon's preference and experience. the aim of this study was to analyze  6 synthetic and 3 biological materials frequently used in scwr with respect to their cytotoxicity, bacterial adhesion, surface characteristics, and mechanical properties to facilitate data-driven decisions. methods: the effect of the scwr materials and their extracts on the metabolism of human skeletal muscle cells (skmcs), dermal fibroblasts, adipose cells, and osteoblasts was analyzed in vitro. bacterial adhesion was quantified by incubating samples in bacterial suspensions (staphylococcus epidermidis, s aureus, and escherichia coli), followed by counting colony-forming units and performing scanning electron microscopy. moreover, the mechanical properties of the materials were analyzed under uniaxial tensile loading to failure. results: the metabolism of all cell types seeded on the scwr materials was reduced compared with untreated cells. with the exception of vypro (ethicon, somerville, nj), whose extracts significantly reduced fibroblast viability, no cytotoxic leachable substances were detected. biological materials were less cytotoxic compared with synthetic ones, but they demonstrated increased bacterial adhesion. synthetic materials demonstrated higher elongation to failure than did biological materials. conclusions: biological and synthetic scwr materials showed significant differences in their cytotoxicity, bacterial adhesion, and biomechanical properties, suggesting that they may be used for different indications in scwr. further comparable in vivo studies are needed to analyze their performance in different indications of clinical application.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo characterization of antibacterial activity and biocompatibility: a study on silver-containing phosphonate monolayers on titanium.
AB  == infections associated with implanted medical devices are a major cause of nosocomial infections, with serious medical and economic repercussions. a variety of silver-containing coatings have been proposed to decrease the risk of infection by hindering bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. however, the therapeutic range of silver is relatively narrow and it is important to minimize  the amount of silver in the coatings, in order to keep sufficient antibacterial activity without inducing cytotoxicity. in this study, the antibacterial efficiency and biocompatibility of nanocoatings with minimal silver loading ( approximately 0.65 nmol cm(-2)) was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. titanium substrates were coated by grafting mercaptododecylphosphonic acid (mdpa) monolayers followed by post-reaction with agno3. the mdpa/agno3 nanocoatings significantly inhibited escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis adhesion  and biofilm formation in vitro, while allowing attachment and proliferation of mc3t3-e1 preosteoblasts. moreover, osteogenic differentiation of mc3t3 cells and  murine mesenchymal stem cells was not affected by the nanocoatings. sterilization by ethylene oxide did not alter the antibacterial activity and biocompatibility of the nanocoatings. after subcutaneous implantation of the materials in mice, we demonstrated that mdpa/agno3 nanocoatings exhibit significant antibacterial activity and excellent biocompatibility, both in vitro and in vivo, after postoperative seeding with s. epidermidis. these results confirm the interest of  coating strategies involving subnanomolar amounts of silver exposed at the extreme surface for preventing bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on metallic or ceramic medical devices without compromising their biocompatibility.

TI  == changes in caenorhabditis elegans immunity and staphylococcal virulence factors during their interactions.
AB  == the nematode caenorhabditis elegans is used as a model system for the study of host-pathogen interactions. lipoteichoic acid (lta) is one of the major virulent  and immunostimulatory components found in gram positive bacteria. the current study used lta isolated from staphylococcus aureus and pathogenic and non-pathogenic staphylococcus epidermidis. the overall physiological assays revealed that lta exposed c. elegans show a significant reduction in the life span, production of eggs and progenies. to understand the involvement of innate immune specific players at the mrna level, the regulation of few candidate antimicrobial genes was studied during staphylococcal lta exposures. qpcr analysis indicated an upregulation of antimicrobial peptides during lta exposures. to understand the involvement of lta and other virulent genes during infection, the regulation of lta synthase and a few virulence genes was monitored during host exposure. the qpcr analyses indicated the upregulation of ltas and other virulence genes (atoxin, sak, ssaa and fbe) during infection. ability of the pathogens to modify their internal machinery during host presence was monitored by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltametric analyses. the ftir results indicated distinct alterations of peaks from staphylococcal lta composition between control and the  host exposed. further, eis and cv data displayed clear differences between the host exposed staphylococcal samples compared to their respective unexposed controls. the pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains showed different types of regulations and interactions during host exposures. the observed modifications clearly suggest that the gram positive pathogen changes its lta production and possibly the structure to cause a severe pathogenic effect on an interacting host.

AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (t+n) and from twigs without needles (t-n) from  wild pinus peuce griseb. (pinaceae), from three different locations in r. macedonia, were investigated. essential oil yields of t+n ranged from 7.5 ml/kg to 12.5 ml/kg and for t-n from 13.8 ml/kg to 17.3 ml/kg. gc/fid/ms analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the t+n and t-n oils, respectively. the major components in t+n and t-n oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(e)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene d (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and one strain of candida albicans. t-n essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans as well as streptococcus agalactiae, acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae. the antimicrobial activity of t+n essential oils was greater, especially against streptococcus agalactiae, s. pyogenes, enterococcus and candida albicans, followed by haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125  mul/ml. summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of pinus peuce t+n and t-n essential oils collected from different localities in r. macedonia varied considerably. these alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (t+n or t-n).

TI  == bacillus polymachus sp. nov., with a broad range of antibacterial activity, isolated from forest topsoil samples by using a modified culture method.
AB  == a new, modified culture method that utilizes a transwell plate with a 0.4 microm  pore-size microporous membrane was developed. this system allows only trace nutrients from the soil into the liquid culture through the microporous membrane. the method is a more powerful tool for the discovery of novel species from soils  than are traditional methods. such newly identified species could potentially produce useful metabolites. a bacterial strain, t515(t), was isolated using this  modified culture method. growth of strain t515(t) occurred at ph 4-9 in a temperature range between 20 degrees c and 40 degrees c and in the presence of 0-2 % (w/v) nacl on r2a agar. colonies on the agar plates were tiny, white, and convex after 5 days incubation at 28 degrees c. comparative analysis of the nearly full-length 16s rrna gene sequence of strain t515(t) revealed close pairwise similarity with species of the genus bacillus, and strain t515(t) was most closely related to bacillus panaciterrae gsoil 1517(t) (96.7 %) and bacillus funiculus naf001(t) (96.0 %). the major quinone of strain t515(t) was menaquinone-7 (mk-7) and the major fatty acids were iso-c15 : 0 (45.5 %), anteiso-c15 : 0 (23.2 %) and c16 : 0 (10.9 %). the predominant polar lipids were  diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. strain t515(t) was sensitive to streptomycin and tetracycline, but resistant to rifampicin (0.125 microg ml(-1)), ampicillin (0.5 microg ml(-1)) and chloramphenicol (1 microg ml(-1)). the strain showed antimicrobial activities against the six strains tested: bacillus subtilis kemb 51201-001, staphylococcus  aureus kemb 4659, pseudomonas aeruginosa kacc 10185, staphylococcus epidermidis kacc 13234, paenibacillus larvae kacc 14031 and escherichia coli kemb 212-234. based on these results, strain t515(t) represents a novel species of the genus bacillus with the proposed name, bacillus polymachus sp. nov. the type strain is  t515(t) ( = kemb 9005-168(t) = kacc 18242(t) = nbrc 110614(t)).

TI  == viability of 3h grown bacterial micro-colonies after direct raman identification.
AB  == clinical diagnostics in routine microbiology still mostly relies on bacterial growth, a time-consuming process that prevents test results to be used directly as key decision-making elements for therapeutic decisions. there is some evidence that raman micro-spectroscopy provides clinically relevant information from a limited amount of bacterial cells, thus holding the promise of reduced growth times and accelerated result delivery. indeed, bacterial identification at the species level directly from micro-colonies at an early time of growth (6h) directly on their growth medium has been demonstrated. however, such analysis is  suspected to be partly destructive and could prevent the further growth of the colony needed for other tests, e.g. antibiotic susceptibility testing (ast). in the present study, we evaluated the effect of the powerful laser excitation used  for raman identification on micro-colonies probed after very short growth times.  we show here, using envelope integrity markers (syto 9 and propidium iodide) directly on ultra-small micro-colonies of a few tens of escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis cells (3h growth time), that only the cells that are directly impacted by the laser lose their membrane integrity. growth kinetics experiments show that the non-probed surrounding cells are sometimes also affected but that the micro-colonies keep their ability to grow, resulting in normal aspect and size of colonies after 15h of growth. thus, raman spectroscopy  could be used for very early (<3h) identification of grown micro-organisms without impairing further antibiotics susceptibility characterization steps.

TI  == reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  == the purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. in experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip a: 1% h2o2; dip b: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip c: 1% iodophor; and dip d: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. in experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, klebsiella species, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip a; dip d;  and dip e: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, and streptococcus uberis. species differences were also found where mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were  equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips d and e and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. no differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip a. it can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for h2o2 dips may be optimal in reducing  pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. a reduction in premilking teat dip  contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.

TI  == importance of tryptophan in transforming an amphipathic peptide into a pseudomonas aeruginosa-targeted antimicrobial peptide.
AB  == here, we found that simple substitution of amino acids in the middle position of  the hydrophobic face of an amphipathic peptide ri16 with tryptophan (t9w) considerably transformed into an antimicrobial peptide specifically targeting pseudomonas aeruginosa. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) results demonstrated that t9w had a strong and specifically antimicrobial activity against p. aeruginosa, including antibiotic-resistant strains, but was not active against escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus and staphyfococcus epidermidis. fluorescent spectroscopic assays indicated that t9w interacted with the membrane of p. aeruginosa, depolarizing the outer and the inner membrane of bacterial cells. salt susceptibility assay showed that t9w still maintained its strong anti-pseudomonas activity in the presence of salts at physiological concentrations, and in hemolytic and mtt assays t9w also showed no  toxicity against human blood cells and macrophages. in vivo assay demonstrated that t9w also displayed no toxicity to chinese kun ming (km) mice. furthermore, the strong antibiofilm activity was also observed with the peptide t9w, which decreased the percentage of biomass formation in a dose-dependent manner. overall, these findings indicated that design of single-pathogen antimicrobial agents can be achieved by simple amino acid mutation in naturally occurring peptide sequences and this study suggested a model of optimization/design of anti-pseudomonas drugs in which the tryptophan residue was a conserved element.

AB  == pseudhymenochirin-1pb (ps-1pb) and pseudhymenochirin-2pa (ps-2pa) are host-defense peptides, first isolated from skin secretions of the frog pseudhymenochirus merlini (pipidae). ps-1pb and ps-2pa are highly cytotoxic (lc50<12 mum) against non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells, breast adenocarcinoma mda-mb-231 cells, and colorectal adenocarcinoma ht-29 cells but are also hemolytic against human erythrocytes (lc50=28+/-2 mum for ps-1pb and lc50=6+/-1 mum for ps-2pa). ps-2pa shows selective cytotoxicity for tumor cells (lc50 against non-neoplastic human umbilical vein (huvec) cells=68+/-2 mum). ps-1pb and ps-2pa (5 mug/ml) significantly inhibit production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 and the multifunctional cytokine il-6 from lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from c57bl/6 mice and  enhance the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-23 from both unstimulated and lps-stimulated macrophages. ps-1pb potently (mic</=10 mum) inhibits growth of multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of the gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, and the gram-negative bacteria acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. ps-2pa shows the same high potency (mic</=10 mum) against the gram-positive bacteria but is 2-4 fold less potent against the gram-negative isolates. ps-1pb at 4xmic kills 99.9% of escherichia coli within 30 min and 99.9% of s. aureus within 180 min. in conclusion, cytotoxicity against tumor cells, cytokine-mediated immunomodulatory properties, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity suggest that the ps-1pb and ps-2pa represent templates for design of non-hemolytic analogs for tumor therapy and for treatment of infections in cancer patients produced by multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == co-infection of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and extended spectrum beta-lactamase  producing escherichia coli in bovine mastitis--three cases reported from india.
AB  == emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bovine mastitis pathogens is the major cause of frequent therapeutic failure and a cause of concern for veterinary practitioners. this study describes intra-mammary infection of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing escherichia coli in two holstein friesian crossbred cows with subclinical mastitis and one non-descript cow with clinical mastitis in two different districts of west bengal, india. in total, three mrse, one mrsa and three esbl producing e. coli were isolated from these cases. both the crossbreds  were detected with mrse (hfse1 and hfse2) and esbl producing e. coli (hfec1 and hfec2), whereas, simultaneous infection of three pathogens viz. mrsa (ndsa1), mrse (ndse1) and esbl producing e. coli (ndec1) was found in the non-descript cow. the methicillin-resistant isolates possessed meca gene and exhibited resistance to various antibiotics such as amikacin, tetracycline and glycopeptides. the esbl producers were positive for blactx-m and blatem genes; in addition, hfec1 and hfec2 were positive for blashv and possessed the genes for class i integron (int1), sulphonamide resistance (sul1), quinolone resistance (qnrs) and other virulence factors (papc, iucd and esta1). all the esbl producers exhibited resistance to a variety of antibiotics tested including third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and were also intermediately resistant to carbapenems. this is the first ever report on simultaneous occurrence of mrse, mrsa and esbl producing e. coli in bovine mastitis indicating a major concern for dairy industry and public health as well.

TI  == defensins from the tick ixodes scapularis are effective against phytopathogenic fungi and the human bacterial pathogen listeria grayi.
AB  == background: ixodes scapularis is the most common tick species in north america and a vector of important pathogens that cause diseases in humans and animals including lyme disease, anaplasmosis and babesiosis. tick defensins have been identified as a new source of antimicrobial agents with putative medical applications due to their wide-ranging antimicrobial activities. two multigene families of defensins were previously reported in i. scapularis. the objective of the present study was to characterise the potential antimicrobial activity of two defensins from i. scapularis with emphasis on human pathogenic bacterial strains  and important phytopathogenic fungi. methods: scapularisin-3 and scapularisin-6 mature peptides were chemically synthesised. in vitro antimicrobial assays were performed to test the activity of these two defensins against species of different bacterial genera including gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria spp. as well as gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa along with two plant-pathogenic fungi from the genus fusarium. in addition, the tissue-specific expression patterns of scapularisin-3 and scapularisin-6 in i. scapularis midgut, salivary glands and embryo-derived cell lines were determined using pcr. finally, tertiary structures of the two defensins were predicted and structural analyses were conducted. results: scapularisin-6 efficiently killed l. grayi, and both scapularisin-3 and scapularisin-6 caused strong inhibition (ic50 value: ~1 mum) of the germination of plant-pathogenic fungi fusarium culmorum and fusarium graminearum. scapularisin-6 gene expression was observed in i. scapularis salivary glands and midgut. however, scapularisin-3 gene expression was only detected in the salivary glands. transcripts from the two defensins were not found in the i. scapularis tick cell lines ise6 and ise18. conclusion: our results have two main implications. firstly, the anti-listeria and antifungal activities of scapularisin-3 and scapularisin-6 suggest that these peptides may be useful for (i) treatment of antibiotic-resistant l. grayi in humans and (ii) plant protection. secondly, the antimicrobial properties of the two defensins described in this study may pave the way for further studies regarding pathogen invasion and innate immunity in i. scapularis.

TI  == blood stream infections in renal transplant recipients: a single-center study.
AB  == introduction: bacteremias among renal transplant recipients are more frequent as  a result of immunosuppression. they are considered extremely high-risk because they are correlated with decreased allograft and recipient survival. patients and methods: all episodes of bacteremia among renal transplant recipients were documented following review of medical records, from january 2010 to may 2013. results: in total 26 episodes of bacteremia were observed in 22 patients. gram negative bacteremia was identified in 73% (19/26) cases. pathogens according to their frequency were the following escherichia coli (6/26, 23%), klebsiella pneumonia (5/26, 19%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3/26, 11%), staphylococcus epidermidis (3/26, 11%), acinetobacter baumanni (2/26, 7.7%), enterococcus faecalis (2/26, 7.7%). the first trimester post renal transplantation 18 episodes (69%) of bacteremia were presented that were not correlated to indwelling urinary catheter or stent. positive urinary culture with the same pathogen was recognized in 13 patients. all recipients manifested fever, eight recipients had leucocytosis and three cases were complicated by septic shock. immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids and non-nephrotoxic antibiotic regimen was  initiated. acute renal allograft dysfunction (defined as an increase in serum creatinine more than 0.5 mg/dl from baseline) was observed in five patients and was restored following infection resolution. conclusion: increased prevalence of  bacteremia in renal transplant recipients is attributed to immunosuppression and  usually bacteremic episodes follow urinary tract infection. the commonest pathogens are gram negative bacteria with e. coli the most frequent. early detection and proper management are important as bacteremia affects renal allograft and recipient survival.

TI  == three-year study of health care-associated infections in a turkish pediatric ward.
AB  == introduction: health care-associated infections (hcais) can cause an increase in  morbidity, mortality and costs, especially in developing countries. as information on the epidemiology of hcais in pediatric patientsinturkey is limited, we decided to study the annual incidence and antibiotic resistance patterns in our pediatric ward at marmara university hospital. methodology: all hospitalized patients in the pediatric ward were assessed with regard to hcais between january 1, 2008 and december 31, 2010. data was prospectively collected according to standard protocols of the national nosocomial infections surveillance system (nosoline). results: a total of 16.5% of all hospitalized patients developed hcais in the three years studied. the most frequent hcais were urinary tract infections (uti) (29.3%), bloodstream infections (27%) and pneumonias (21%). while the most frequent agent isolatedfrom uti was escherichia  coli (26%), the most common agent in blood stream infections was staphylococcus epidermidis (30.4%). vancomycin resistance was found in 73.3% of all enterococcus faecium strains. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was detected in 58.3% of klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli isolates. conclusions: continual hcai surveillance is important to determineits rate. knowledge of the hcai incidence can influence people's use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and encourage antibiotic rotation. moreover, the knowledge of hcai incidence may support the infection control programmes, including education and isolation methods which ultimately may help to reducethe rate of the hcais.

TI  == tetracycline tethered to titanium inhibits colonization by gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == as peri-prosthetic infection is one of the most devastating complications associated with implant placement, we have reasoned that such infection can be largely subverted by development of antibacterial implants. our previous work demonstrated that covalent coupling of vancomycin to titanium alloy prevented colonization by the gram-positive pathogens, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. some orthopedic devices, including permanent prosthesis anchors, and most dental implants are transcutaneous or transmucosal and can be prone to colonization by gram-negative pathogens. we report here the successful covalent coupling of the broad-spectrum antibiotic, tetracycline (tet), to titanium surfaces (ti-tet) to retard gram-negative colonization. synthetic progress was followed by changes in water contact angle, while the presence of tet was confirmed by immunofluorescence. ti-tet actively prevented colonization in the presence of bathing escherichia coli, both by fluorescence microscopy and direct counting. finally, the ti-tet surface supported osteoblastic cell adhesion and proliferation over a 72-h period. thus, this new surface offers a powerful means to protect transcutaneous implants from adhesion  of gram-negative pathogens, decreasing the need for replacement of this hardware.

TI  == do crosslinking and vitamin e stabilization influence microbial adhesions on uhmwpe-based biomaterials?
AB  == background: microorganism adhesion on polyethylene for total joint arthroplasty is a concern. many studies have focused on vitamin e-stabilized ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (uhmwpe), whereas first-generation, highly crosslinked uhmwpe, which is the most commonly used in clinical practice,  has been scarcely evaluated. questions/purposes: we aimed (1) to compare the adherence of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and candida albicans with virgin (untreated) uhmwpe (pe) and crosslinked uhmwpe (xlpe); (2) to correlate the results with the biomaterial surface properties; and (3) to determine whether the decreased adhesion on vitamin e-stabilized uhmwpe (ve-pe) previously recorded for bacteria can also be confirmed for c albicans. methods: microbial adhesion of biofilm-producing american type culture collection (atcc) and clinical strains on xlpe and ve-pe were compared with pe at 3, 7, 24,  and 48 hours of incubation and quantified, as colony forming units (cfu)/ml, using a sonication protocol. sample surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, roughness and contact angle measurements, attenuated total reflection-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) to reveal qualitative differences in surface composition and topography that could influence the microbial adhesion. the results were analyzed by descriptive statistics and tested by unpaired t-tests. results: all microorganisms, both atcc and clinical strains, showed lower adhesion (p < 0.05)  on xlpe with adhesion percentages ranging from 18% to 25%, compared with pe with  adhesion percentages ranging from 51% to 55%, after 48 hours. only the atcc s epidermidis showed a reduced adhesion profile even at 3 hours (adhesion ratio of  14% on xlpe versus 50% on pe) and 24 hours (19% on xlpe versus 55% on pe) of incubation. atcc and clinical c albicans were less adherent to xlpe than to pe (p < 0.05) showing even at the earlier incubation time points adhesion values always of 10(3) cfu/ml and 10(4) cfu/ml, respectively. roughness and contact angle were  0.8 +/- 0.2 mum and 92 degrees +/- 3 degrees , respectively, with no differences  among samples. qualitative differences in the surface chemical composition were revealed by xps only. a confirmation of the decreased adhesion on ve-pe respect to pe was also registered here for c albicans strains (p < 0.05). conclusions: vitamin e stabilization and crosslinking of uhmwpe are capable of reducing microbial adhesion. further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms  of modulation of microbial adhesion to medical-grade uhmwpe. clinical relevance:  our results suggest that ve-pe and xlpe may have an added benefit of being more resistant to bacterial adhesion, even fungal strains.

TI  == investigation of the detection ability of an intrinsic fluorescence-based bioaerosol detection system for heat-stressed bacteria.
AB  == a number of rapid microbiological methods capable of aerosol-based microbial detection are quickly emerging for use in the pharmaceutical and food markets. a  subset of these technologies utilizes intrinsic microbial fluorescence as the basis for bioaerosol detection. this fundamental method of detection is relatively new to the pharmaceutical and food industries, which rely on traditional culture-based methods implemented decades ago to gain an understanding of their manufacturing environments. when combined with real time and continuous assessment, intrinsic fluorescence-based detection provides a new  level of information and monitoring in these environments. one aspect of this monitoring relates to the detection of stressed micro-organisms. bacteria found in pharmaceutical and food manufacturing environments can be in a stressed state  due to heat, uv, or chemical exposure, desiccation, and so forth. as a result, the ability of an environmental monitoring system to detect stressed microbes is  of particular interest. a commercially available, intrinsic fluorescence-based bioaerosol detection rmm was utilized in this study to determine the ability of such systems in the detection of heat-stressed microorganisms. an assessment of culturability and growth delay in control and heat-stressed samples was performed to confirm stress. furthermore, the performance of the intrinsic fluorescence-based bioaerosol detection systems were compared to the sas super 100, mas-100 nt, and sma air samplers in the detection of heat-stressed escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus atrophaeus spores. these bacteria were selected because they are industry-relevant organisms, commonly found in various manufacturing environments, that represent a gram-positive, gram-negative, and spore-forming bacteria, respectively. it was found that the intrinsic fluorescence-based bioaerosol detection systems can detect heat-stressed microorganisms, including those that are not detected by the traditional culture-based method due to the inability of the stressed microbes to form colony-forming units. lay abstract: rapid microbiological methods capable of aerosol-based microbial detection are emerging for use in pharmaceutical and food markets. a subset of these technologies utilizes intrinsic microbial fluorescence as the basis for bioaerosol detection, a method relative new to the pharmaceutical and food industries, which rely on traditional culture-based methods. bacteria found in such environments can be in a stressed state due to heat, uv, or chemical exposure, desiccation, and so forth. as a result, the ability of an environmental monitoring system to detect stressed microbes is of particular interest. a commercially available, intrinsic fluorescence-based bioaerosol detection rmm was utilized in this study to determine the ability of such systems in the detection of heat-stressed microorganisms. an assessment of culturability and growth delay in control and heat-stressed samples was performed to confirm stress. furthermore, the performance of the intrinsic fluorescence-based bioaerosol detection systems were compared to the sas super 100, mas-100 nt and sma air samplers in the detection of heat-stressed escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus atrophaeus spores. these bacteria were selected because they are industry-relevant organisms, commonly found in various manufacturing environments, that represent a gram-positive, gram-negative, and spore forming bacteria, respectively. it was found that the intrinsic fluorescence-based bioaerosol detection systems can detect heat-stressed microorganisms, including those that are not detected by the traditional culture-based method due to the inability of the stressed microbes to form colony-forming units.

TI  == monotreme lactation protein is highly expressed in monotreme milk and provides antimicrobial protection.
AB  == monotremes (platypus and echidna) are the descendants of the oldest ancestor of all extant mammals distinguished from other mammals by mode of reproduction. monotremes lay eggs following a short gestation period and after an even briefer  incubation period, altricial hatchlings are nourished over a long lactation period with milk secreted by nipple-less mammary patches located on the female's  abdomen. milk is the sole source of nutrition and immune protection for the developing young until weaning. using transcriptome and mass spectrometry analysis of milk cells and milk proteins, respectively, a novel monotreme lactation protein (mlp) was identified as a major secreted protein in milk. we show that platypus and short-beaked echidna mlp genes show significant homology and are unique to monotremes. the mlp transcript was shown to be expressed in a variety of tissues; however, highest expression was observed in milk cells and was expressed constitutively from early to late lactation. analysis of recombinant mlp showed that it is an n-linked glycosylated protein and biophysical studies predicted that mlp is an amphipathic, alpha-helical protein,  a typical feature of antimicrobial proteins. functional analysis revealed mlp antibacterial activity against both opportunistic pathogenic staphylococcus aureus and commensal enterococcus faecalis bacteria but showed no effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and salmonella enterica. our data suggest that mlp is an evolutionarily ancient component of milk-mediated innate immunity absent in other mammals. we propose that mlp evolved specifically in the monotreme lineage supporting the evolution of lactation in these species to provide bacterial protection, at a time when mammals lacked nipples.

AB  == in continuation of our efforts to find new antimicrobial compounds, series of fatty n-acyldiamines were prepared from fatty methyl esters and 1,2-ethylenediamine, 1,3-propanediamine or 1,4-butanediamine. the synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and for their antifungal activity against four species of candida (c. albicans, c. tropicalis, c. glabrata and c. parapsilosis). compounds 5a (n-(2-aminoethyl)dodecanamide), 5b (n-(2-aminoethyl)tetracanamide) and 6d (n-(3-aminopropyl)oleamide) were the most  active against gram-positive bacteria, with mic values ranging from 1 to 16mug/ml and were evaluated for their activity against 21 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus. all the compounds exhibited good to moderate antifungal activity. compared to chloramphenicol, compound 6b displayed a similar activity (mic50=16mug/ml). a positive correlation could be established between lipophilicity and biological activity.

TI  == surface-dependent inactivation of model microorganisms with shielded sliding plasma discharges and applied air flow.
AB  == cold atmospheric plasma inactivates bacteria through reactive species produced from the applied gas. the use of cold plasma clinically has gained recent interest, as the need for alternative or supplementary strategies are necessary for preventing multi-drug resistant infections. the purpose of this study was to  evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of a novel shielded sliding discharge based cold plasma reactor operated by nanosecond voltage pulses in atmospheric air on both biotic and inanimate surfaces. bacterial inactivation was determined by direct quantification of colony forming units. the plasma activated air (afterglow) was bactericidal against escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis seeded on culture media, laminate, and linoleum vinyl. in general, e. coli was more susceptible to plasma exposure. a bacterial reduction was observed  with the application of air alone on a laminate surface. whole-cell real-time pcr revealed a decrease in the presence of e. coli genomic dna on exposed samples. these findings suggest that plasma-induced bacterial inactivation is surface-dependent.

TI  == comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  == background: bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. methods: the cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in beijing children's hospital were analyzed in the study. two pcr based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex  pcr based-reverse line blot hybridization (mpcr/rlb), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, listerisa monocytogenes, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae. the findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. results: bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by csf cultures, 25 (45%) by rt-pcr and 16 (29%) by mpcr/rlb. one strain of s. epidermidis and one of e. faecalis were identified using mpcr/rlb but not by rt-pcr. in contrast, cultures identified one strain of s. pneumoniae which was missed by both pcr assays. overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). conclusion: our study confirmed that both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. they are capable of detecting the pathogens in csf samples with negative culture results.

TI  == a study on the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved  in skin and meibomian gland lesions of demodectic mange in cattle.
AB  == the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected  animals was investigated. demodex bovis and d. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. the mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes (group a)) and opportunistic organisms (proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and moraxella bovis and staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes (group a) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent  microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. the "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.

TI  == preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  == the ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (cdh) to produce hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. a recombinantly produced cdh from myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mm or 2 mm cellobiose as substrate. biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by cdh when supplemented with 1mm cellobiose. the cdh/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. interestingly, cdh was also able to produce h(2)o(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exps) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. the h(2)o(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exps were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for cdh as well as destabilises the biofilm. furthermore, cdh suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. incorporation of the cdh/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore  makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.

TI  == [prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in peking union medical college hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in peking union medical college  hospital. method: the incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. results: there were 449  positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. samples separated from patients with  community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. most community-aquired infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples.  respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were gram-negative (66.9%). the most common gram-negative bacteria included escherichia coli (13.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common gram-positive  bacteria. gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). the detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumonia/klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. the resistance to acinetobacter baumannii was serious. multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant a. baumannii acountted for 74% of all a. baumannii infections. stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. also, 22 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. all patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. fourteen  of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. there were 61  samples proved to be bacteria colonization. nonfermenters such as acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. conclusions: the pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly gram-negative bacteria. the incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.

TI  == functional synergy of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and traditional antibiotics against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == in this study, the antimicrobial activities based on the synergistic effects of traditional antibiotics (imipenem, cefepime, levofloxacin hydrochloride and vancomycin) and antimicrobial peptides (amps; pl-5, pl-31, pl-32, pl-18, pl-29 and pl-26), alone or in combination, against three gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus epidermidis)  and three gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) were investigated. in addition, the antimicrobial activity that was based on the synergistic effects of levofloxacin hydrochloride and pl-5  against staphylococcus aureus in vivo was explored in a mouse infection model. traditional antibiotics and amps showed significant synergistic effects on the antibacterial activities against the different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro. a strong synergistic effect in the pl-5 and levofloxacin hydrochloride combination against staphylococcus aureus was observed in the mouse infection model in vivo. the mechanism of synergistic action was due to the different targets of amps and traditional antibiotics. the combination of amps and traditional antibiotics can dramatically enhance antimicrobial activity and may help prevent or delay the emergence of antibiotic resistance. thus, this combination therapy could be a promising approach to treat bacterial infections,  particularly mixed infections and multi-antibiotic-resistant infections, in the clinics.

TI  == the influence of urinary ph on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens.
AB  == objective: to determine the effects of ph on the activity of clinically relevant  antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including ph. because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (ph 4.5) to alkaline (ph 8) conditions and can be  easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of ph in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection. materials and  methods: this in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) over the  range of ph 5-8. standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. one-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (p <.05). results: for 18 of the 24 agents, ph was shown to play a significant role  in overall inhibitory activity. although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed ph-dependent effects  against certain organisms. the fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline ph, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the beta-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by ph. conclusion: clinicians should consider the urinary ph of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. future clinical investigations examining urinary ph and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.

TI  == a refined technique for extraction of extracellular matrices from bacterial biofilms and its applicability.
AB  == biofilm-forming bacteria embedded in polymeric extracellular matrices (ecms) that consist of polysaccharides, proteins and/or extracellular dnas (ednas) acquire high resistance to antimicrobial agents and host immune systems. to understand molecular mechanisms of biofilm formation and maintenance and to develop therapeutic countermeasures against chronic biofilm-associated infections, reliable methods to isolate ecms are inevitable. in this study, we refined the ecm extraction method recently reported and evaluated its applicability. using three staphylococcus aureus biofilms in which proteins, polysaccharides or ednas  are major contributors to their integrity, ecms were extracted using salts and detergents. we found that extraction with 1.5 m sodium chloride (nacl) could be optimum for not only ecm proteins but also polysaccharides and ednas. in addition, long-time incubation was not necessary for efficient ecm isolation. lithium chloride (licl) was comparative to nacl but is more expensive. in contrast to sds, nacl hardly caused leakage of intracellular proteins and did not affect viability of bacterial cells within biofilms. furthermore, this method is  applicable to other bacteria such as gram-positive staphylococcus epidermidis and gram-negative escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus, this refined method is very simple, rapid, low cost and non-invasive and could be used for a broad range of applications.

TI  == self-defensive layer-by-layer films with bacteria-triggered antibiotic release.
AB  == we report on highly efficient, bioresponsive, controlled-release antibacterial coatings constructed by direct assembly of tannic acid (ta) with one of several cationic antibiotics (tobromycin, gentamicin, and polymyxin b) using the layer-by-layer (lbl) technique. these films exhibit a distinct "self-defense" behavior triggered by acidification of the immediate environment by pathogenic bacteria, such as staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epidermidis) or escherichia coli (e. coli). films assembled using spin-assisted and dip-assisted techniques show drastically different morphology, thickness and ph-/bacteria-triggered antibiotic release characteristics. while dip-deposited films have rough surfaces with island-like, granular structures regardless of the film thickness, spin-assisted  lbl assemblies demonstrate a transition from linear deposition of uniform 2d films to a highly developed 3d morphology for films thicker than approximately 45 nm. ellipsometry, uv-vis and mass spectrometry confirm that all coatings do not release antibiotics in phosphate buffered saline at ph 7.4 for as long as one month in the absence of bacteria and therefore do not contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance. these films do, however, release antibiotics upon ph lowering. the rate of triggered release can be controlled through the choice of assembled antibiotic and the assembly technique (spin- vs dip-deposition) and by the spinning rate used during deposition, which all affect the strength of ta-antibiotic binding. ta/antibiotic coatings as thin as 40 nm strongly inhibit s. epidermidis and e. coli bacterial growth both at surfaces and in surrounding medium, but support adhesion and proliferation of murine osteoblast cells. these coatings thus present a promising way to incorporate antibacterial agents at surfaces to prevent bacterial colonization of implanted biomedical devices.

TI  == [oflomelid ointment: activity against hospital microbial strains].
AB  == ofloxacin susceptibility was tested with the use of 100 hospital isolates by the  disk diffusion method vs. the activity of oflomelid ointment tested by the cavity method. it was shown that the hospital isolates of all the species were susceptible to the oflomelid ointment, while susceptibility to ofloxacin was preserved in s. epidermidis, the susceptibility of acinetobacter spp., e. coli, proteus spp. being intermediate. such a difference in the susceptibility of the isolates was evidently due to the properties of polyethylene glycols in the ointment composition.

TI  == development and characterization of polyphenon 60 and caffeine microemulsion for  enhanced antibacterial activity.
AB  == green tea catechins and caffeine have exhibited antibacterial activity; however,  their use is limited by lack of stability and effective delivery systems. polyphenon 60 (p60) and caffeine were encapsulated in a single microemulsion (me) formulation with an objective to lower the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the individual agents against selected pathogens (s. epidermidis and e. coli). combination of two natural compounds would advocate two different mechanisms on the bacterial growth thereby providing for better antibacterial activity. thermodynamically stable me was developed and characterized with an average particle size of 17.58 nm, further confirmed by tem analysis. antibacterial studies included chequerboard microdilution assay to determine the  mic and fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) of both the natural compounds individually and in combination. mic and fic results indicated that the combination of the above two natural compounds was proficient in lowering the mics of individual agents. results of dpph assay indicated that me system preserved the long term antioxidative potential of p60 and caffeine. the cytotoxicity of the optimized formulation on vero cell line by mtt assay was found to be nontoxic to mammalian cells.

AB  == bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates poses a major post-transfusion infectious risk. this study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the bactx((r)) assay (immunetics inc.) for bacterial detection in leucocyte-reduced buffy coat platelet pools and for its sensitivity in detecting clinical isolates, including bacteria that form surface-attached aggregates (biofilm positives). platelet pools were inoculated at bacterial concentrations of 0.8-13 cfu/ml. the  bactx((r)) assay detected all species at concentrations >/=10(3) cfu/ml within 20-69 h of platelet incubation. detection of slow-growing and biofilm-forming strains was delayed in comparison with the other strains. this assay could be used as a point-of-issue method to increase the safety of the platelet supply.

TI  == photodynamic inactivation of bacteria and viruses using two monosubstituted zinc(ii) phthalocyanines.
AB  == a zinc(ii) phthalocyanine substituted with a triamino moiety and its tri-n-methylated analogue have been prepared and characterized with various spectroscopic methods. both compounds remain non-aggregated in n,n-dimethylformamide and in water containing 0.05% cremophor el (v/v), and can generate singlet oxygen effectively. the photodynamic activities of these compounds have been examined against a range of bacterial strains, including the  gram-positive methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus atcc baa-43, and the gram-negative escherichia coli atcc 35218 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853. both photosensitizers are highly cytotoxic, particularly for the two gram-positive strains, for which as low as 5 nm of dye is required to induce a 4-log reduction  of their viability. the tri-n-methylated derivative has also been shown to be able to effectively inhibit the growth of a series of clinical strains of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, and biofilms of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus atcc 67928 and atcc 68507, and staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 35984. in addition, the photodynamic inactivation of a range of viruses using these two compounds has also been investigated. both compounds are highly photocytotoxic against the enveloped viruses influenza a virus (h1n1) and herpes  simplex virus type 1 (hsv1), but exhibit no significant cytotoxicity toward the non-enveloped viruses adenovirus type 3 (ad3) and coxsackievirus (cox b1).

TI  == novel copper (ii) alginate hydrogels and their potential for use as anti-bacterial wound dressings.
AB  == the incorporation of a metal ion, with antimicrobial activity, into an alginate dressing is an attractive approach to minimize infection in a wound. in this work, copper (ii) cross-linked alginate hydrogels were successfully prepared using a two-step cross-linking procedure. in the first step, solid alginate films were prepared using a solvent-casting method from soft gels of alginate solutions that had been lightly cross-linked using a copper (ii) (cu(2+)) sulfate solution. in the second step, the films were further cross-linked in a corresponding cu(2+) sulfate solution using a dipping method to further improve their dimensional stability. alginate solution (at 2%w/v) and cu(2+) sulfate solution (at 2%w/v) in acetate buffer at a low ph provided soft films with excellent swelling behavior.  an increase in either cu(2+) ion concentration or cross-linking time led to hydrogels with more densely-cross-linked networks that limited water absorption.  the hydrogels clearly showed antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes, which was proportional to  the cu(2+) ion concentration. blood coagulation studies showed that the tested copper (ii) cross-linked alginate hydrogels had a tendency to coagulate fibrin, and possibly had an effect on pro-thrombotic coagulation and platelet activation. conclusively, the prepared films are likely candidates as antibacterial wound dressings.

AB  == infections associated with medical devices are a substantial healthcare problem.  consequently, there has been increasing research and technological efforts directed toward the development of coatings that are capable of preventing bacterial colonization of the device surface. herein, we report on novel hybrid silver loaded poly(l-lactic acid) nanoparticles (plla-agnps) with narrowly distributed sizes (17 +/- 3 nm) prepared using a combination of solvent evaporation and mini-emulsion technology. these particles were then immobilized onto solid surfaces premodified with a thin layer of allylamine plasma polymer (aapp). the antibacterial efficacy of the plla-agnps nanoparticles was studied in vitro against both gram-positive (staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli) bacteria. the minimal inhibitory concentration values against  staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli were 0.610 and 1.156 mug . ml(-1), respectively. the capacity of the prepared coatings to prevent bacterial  surface colonization was assessed in the presence of staphylococcus epidermidis,  which is a strong biofilm former that causes substantial problems with medical device associated infections. the level of inhibition of bacterial growth was 98%. the substrate independent nature and the high antibacterial efficacy of coatings presented in this study may offer new alternatives for antibacterial coatings for medical devices.

TI  == a new silver based composite material for spa water disinfection.
AB  == a new composite material based on alumina (al2o3) modified by two surface nanocoatings - titanium dioxide (tio2) and silver (ag) - was studied for spa water disinfection. regarding the most common microorganisms in bathing waters, two non-pathogenic bacteria escherichia coli (gram-negative) and staphylococcus epidermidis (gram positive) were selected as surrogates for bacterial contamination. the bactericidal properties of the al2o3-tio2-ag material were demonstrated under various operating conditions encountered in spa water (temperature: 22-37 degrees c, presence of salt: caco3 or cacl2, high oxygen content, etc.). total removal of 10(8) cfu ml(-1) of bacteria was obtained in less than 10 min with 16 g l(-1) of material. best results were observed for both conditions: a temperature of 37 degrees c and under aerobic condition; this latest favouring reactive oxygen species (ros) generation. the caco3 salt had no  impact on the bactericidal activity of the composite material and cacl2 considerably stabilized the silver desorption from the material surface thanks to the formation of agcl precipitate. preliminary tests of the al2o3-tio2-ag bactericidal behaviour in a continuous water flow confirmed that 2 g l(-1) of material eliminated more than 90% of a 2.0 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) bacterial mixture after one water treatment recycle and reached the disinfection standard recommended by epa (coliform removal = 6 log) within 22 h.

TI  == jacobsen catalyst as a cytochrome p450 biomimetic model for the metabolism of monensin a.
AB  == monensin a is a commercially important natural product isolated from streptomyces cinnamonensins that is primarily employed to treat coccidiosis. monensin a selectively complexes and transports sodium cations across lipid membranes and displays a variety of biological properties. in this study, we evaluated the jacobsen catalyst as a cytochrome p450 biomimetic model to investigate the oxidation of monensin a. mass spectrometry analysis of the products from these model systems revealed the formation of two products: 3-o-demethyl monensin a and 12-hydroxy monensin a, which are the same ones found in in vivo models. monensin  a and products obtained in biomimetic model were tested in a mitochondrial toxicity model assessment and an antimicrobial bioassay against staphylococcus aureus, s. aureus methicillin-resistant, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. our results demonstrated the toxicological effects of monensin a in isolated rat liver mitochondria but not its products, showing that the metabolism of monensin a is a detoxification metabolism. in addition, the antimicrobial bioassay showed that monensin a and its products possessed activity against gram-positive microorganisms but not for gram-negative microorganisms. the results revealed the potential of application of this biomimetic chemical model in the synthesis of drug metabolites, providing metabolites for biological tests and other purposes.

TI  == prevention of transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms during catheter exchange using antimicrobial catheters.
AB  == exchanging a central venous catheter (cvc) over a guide wire for a fresh uncoated cvc in the presence of bacteremia can result in cross-infection of the newly exchanged cvc. a recent retrospective clinical study showed that exchanging a catheter over a guide wire in the presence of bacteremia using an antimicrobial minocycline-rifampin (m/r) catheter may improve outcomes. to expand on this, we developed an in vitro cross-contamination model of exchange to evaluate the efficacy of different antimicrobial cvcs in preventing cross-contamination of multidrug-resistant organisms during exchange. uncoated cvcs were allowed to form biofilm by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans. after 24 h, the biofilm-colonized cvcs were placed in a glass tube containing bovine calf serum plus mueller-hinton broth, and each catheter was exchanged over a guide wire for a fresh uncoated or an m/r-, chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine (chx/ss)-, or chlorhexidine-m/r (chx-m/r)-coated cvc. cross-contamination of exchanged catheters was enumerated by sonication and quantitative plating methods. the exchange of m/r cvcs completely prevented cross-contamination by mrsa biofilms compared to control exchanged cvcs (p<0.0001). exchange with chx/ss cvcs reduced but did not completely prevent cross-contamination by mrsa (p=0.005). exchange with chx-m/r cvcs completely prevented cross-contamination by mrsa, p. aeruginosa, and c. albicans biofilms (p<0.0001). furthermore, chx-m/r cvcs were superior to m/r cvcs against p. aeruginosa and c. albicans (p=0.003) and were superior to chx/ss cvcs against mrsa and p. aeruginosa (p=0.01). in conclusion, exchange with the novel chx-m/r cvc was the only exchange effective in completely and concurrently preventing cross-contamination from bacteria and candida.

TI  == application of sub-micrometer vibrations to mitigate bacterial adhesion.
AB  == as a prominent concern regarding implantable devices, eliminating the threat of opportunistic bacterial infection represents a significant benefit to both patient health and device function. current treatment options focus on chemical approaches to negate bacterial adhesion, however, these methods are in some ways  limited. the scope of this study was to assess the efficacy of a novel means of modulating bacterial adhesion through the application of vibrations using magnetoelastic materials. magnetoelastic materials possess unique magnetostrictive property that can convert a magnetic field stimulus into a mechanical deformation. in vitro experiments demonstrated that vibrational loads  generated by the magnetoelastic materials significantly reduced the number of adherent bacteria on samples exposed to escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus suspensions. these experiments demonstrate  that vibrational loads from magnetoelastic materials can be used as a post-deployment activated means to deter bacterial adhesion and device infection.

TI  == a cleavage-potentiated fragment of tear lacritin is bactericidal.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are important as the first line of innate defense, through their tendency to disrupt bacterial membranes or intracellular pathways and potentially as the next generation of antibiotics. how they protect wet epithelia is not entirely clear, with most individually inactive under physiological conditions and many preferentially targeting gram-positive bacteria. tears covering the surface of the eye are bactericidal for gram-positive and -negative  bacteria. here we narrow much of the bactericidal activity to a latent c-terminal fragment in the prosecretory mitogen lacritin and report that the mechanism combines membrane permeabilization with rapid metabolic changes, including reduced levels of dephosphocoenzyme a, spermidine, putrescine, and phosphatidylethanolamines and elevated alanine, leucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, proline, glycine, lysine, serine, glutamate, cadaverine, and pyrophosphate. thus, death by metabolic stress parallels cellular attempts to survive. cleavage-dependent appearance of the c-terminal cationic amphipathic alpha-helix is inducible within hours by staphylococcus epidermidis and slowly by another mechanism, in a chymotrypsin- or leupeptin protease-inhibitable manner. although bactericidal at low micromolar levels, within a biphasic 1-10 nm dose optimum, the same domain is mitogenic and cytoprotective for epithelia via a syndecan-1 targeting mechanism dependent on heparanase. thus, the c terminus of lacritin is multifunctional by dose and proteolytic processing and appears to play a key role in the innate protection of the eye, with wider potential benefit elsewhere as lacritin flows from exocrine secretory cells.

AB  == osteomyelitis is a disease that is still difficult to treat, with considerable morbidity and associated costs. the current "gold standard" in treatment - debridement and implantation of antibiotic impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) beads - presents the disadvantage of a second surgical intervention required for the removal of the beads. we comparatively investigated the in vitro antibacterial effect of s53p4 bioactive glass (bag) and gentamicin impregnated pmma beads. bacterial viability was assessed hourly by standard plate count during 24 hours of incubation, by determining the number of colony forming units  (cfu) of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli and  klebsiella pneumoniae. both tested materials showed an antibacterial effect on all studied bacteria. in case of s. aureus, bag granules were almost as effective as gentamicin impregnated pmma beads, with no statistically significant differences. in contrast, pmma beads had a superior antibacterial effect on s. epidermidis and k. pneumoniae. the antibacterial effect of bag was greatly influenced by granule size and contact time. there was a statistically significant correlation between ph values and the number of cfu in the case of s53p4 bag granules. as a biocompatible and biodegradable bone substitute, s53p4 bioactive glass can be a good alternative in the local management of osteomyelitis.

TI  == enzymatic treatment of specimens before dna extraction directly influences molecular detection of infectious agents.
AB  == introduction: biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by dna amplification techniques (pcr). moreover the targeted dna has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein  matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. the goal of the present work was  to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make  dna available for further extraction and amplification. methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase k; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase k. dnas was manually extracted using the qiamp dna mini kit or the magna pure compact automate. dna extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid herpesvirus. bacterial detection was performed using taqman real-time pcr and yeasts and filamentous fungi with hrm (real-time pcr followed by high-resolution melting analysis). results: viral dna was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. either the manual or the automatic dna extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for fungi and proteinase k for bacteria. the addition of lyticase and proteinase k did not improve results. for fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for proteinase k, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. discussion: columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting dna and separate pcr inhibitors. detection rates cannot be related to dna-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis.

AB  == escherichia coli (e. coli) contamination in foods and water resources represents  a major threat for human health and the environment. this work exploits the strong affinity of mannose-containing oligosaccharides with the fimbrial lectin of e. coli to design novel biosensors. modified carbohydrate ligands were synthesized by introducing phenyl residues and aliphatic chains to mannose via reductive amination in order to increase both the affinity and selectivity to e.  coli compared to other pathogenic bacteria. the synthesized ligands include p-thiolphenyl aminomannose (ptam), p-carboxyphenyl aminomannose (pcam), 1-deoxy-1-aminomannopyranoside (damp), glucosamine and low molecular weight chitosan bonded to mercapto undecanoic acid. the structures of the ligands were confirmed using (1)h nmr and 1h, (13)c, cozy nmr, and esi/ms. the ligands were immobilized onto gold electrodes and spr surfaces using-mercaptoundecanoic acid with glycine as deactivating agent. two detection mechanisms were tested: (i) metal-enhanced electrochemical detection (med) and (ii) label-free surface plasmon resonance (spr) detection. the introduction of phenyl residues and aliphatic side groups to the mannose-containing oligosaccharides produced extremely high affinity for e. coli with detection limit of 1 cfu/ml. the relative selectivity of these ligands for e. coli, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus epidermidis were 100%, 2.6% and 8.6% respectively. the biosensors  were validated using spinach leaves at 3.0 cfu/ml. the work provides a generic biosensor for other pathogenic bacteria by enabling multivalent binding, immediate recognition for pathogens as well as inhibition of bacterial growth.

TI  == bacterial resistance of self-assembled surfaces using ppom-b-psbman zwitterionic  copolymer - concomitant effects of surface topography and surface chemistry on attachment of live bacteria.
AB  == three well-defined diblock copolymers made of poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (poly(sbma)) and poly(propylene oxide) (ppo) groups were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (atrp) method. they were physically adsorbed onto three types of surfaces having different topography, including smooth flat surface, convex surface, and indented surface. chemical state of surfaces was characterized by xps while the various topographies were examined by sem and afm. hydrophilicity of surfaces was dependent on both the surface chemistry and the surface topography, suggesting that orientation of copolymer brushes can be tuned in the design of surfaces aimed at resisting bacterial attachment. escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli with  green fluorescent protein (e. coli gfp) were used in bacterial tests to assess the resistance to bacterial attachment of poly(sbma)-covered surfaces. results highlighted a drastic improvement of resistance to bacterial adhesion with the increasing of poly(sbma) to ppo ratio, as well as an important effect of surface  topography. the chemical effect was directly related to the length of the hydrophilic moieties. when longer, more water could be entrapped, leading to improved anti-bacterial properties. the physical effect impacted on the orientation of the copolymer brushes, as well as on the surface contact area available. convex surfaces as well as indented surfaces wafer presented the best  resistance to bacterial adhesion. indeed, bacterial attachment was more importantly reduced on these surfaces compared with smooth surfaces. it was explained by the non-orthogonal orientation of copolymer brushes, resulting in a  more efficient surface coverage of zwitterionic molecules. this work suggests that not only the control of surface chemistry is essential in the preparation of surfaces resisting bacterial attachment, but also the control of surface topography and orientation of antifouling moieties.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  == recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. these well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to  their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. according to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (amps) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. amps can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. the purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. to do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: citropin 1.1, lipopeptides palm-kk-nh2 and palm-rr-nh2, omiganan, pexiganan and temporin a. antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed  by reference strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) bacteria. amps exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive strains, while gram-negative  bacteria were less susceptible. antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as  compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.

TI  == a new cold-adapted, organic solvent stable lipase from mesophilic staphylococcus  epidermidis at2.
AB  == the gene encoding a cold-adapted, organic solvent stable lipase from a local soil-isolate, mesophilic staphylococcus epidermidis at2 was expressed in a prokaryotic system. a two-step purification of at2 lipase was achieved using butyl sepharose and deae sepharose column chromatography. the final recovery and  purification fold were 47.09 % and 3.45, respectively. the molecular mass of the  purified lipase was estimated to be 43 kda. at2 lipase was found to be optimally  active at ph 8 and stable at ph 6-9. interestingly, this enzyme demonstrated remarkable stability at cold temperature (<30 degrees c) and exhibited optimal activity at a temperature of 25 degrees c. a significant enhancement of the lipolytic activity was observed in the presence of ca(2+), tween 60 and tween 80. phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, a well known serine inhibitor did not cause complete inhibition of the enzymatic activity. at2 lipase exhibited excellent preferences towards long chain triglycerides and natural oils. the lipolytic activity was stimulated by dimethylsulfoxide and diethyl ether, while more than 50 % of its activity was retained in methanol, ethanol, acetone, toluene, and n-hexane. taken together, at2 lipase revealed highly attractive biochemical properties especially because of its stability at low temperature and in organic  solvents.

TI  == combinatorial antimicrobial effect of curcumin with selected phytochemicals on staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis is reported to be the main causative agent of nosocomial infections. it has become increasingly difficult to treat this micro-organism because of the emergence of new antibiotic-resistant strains and its ability to form biofilm on medical associated devices. phytochemicals acting  in synergy are effective in killing the micro-organisms by lowering the doses, and synergistic compounds evade the development of resistance due to different mechanism of action. this study aims to determine the synergistic antimicrobial potential of curcumin with cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and ellagic acid against s. epidermidis. curcumin with ellagic acid as well as eugenol were found to have additive antimicrobial effect, whereas, in combination, curcumin and cinnamaldehyde were found to have synergistic effect against s. epidermidis (fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici) = 0.5). synergy between curcumin and cinnamaldehyde was established by time-kill kinetics and was further evaluated for antibiofilm activity. the dose required to inhibit biofilm formation was reduced to half than that needed to inhibit its planktonic culture  (minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of curcumin = 3.12 mug/ml; mic of cinnamaldehyde = 15.62 mug/ml; fici = 0.248). both curcumin and cinnamaldehyde disrupted the bacterial membrane for killing the bacteria as determined by permeability studies on escherichia coli ml-35p.

TI  == control of multi-drug-resistant pathogens with non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate wound dressing.
AB  == background: non-thermal dielectric-barrier discharge plasma (non-thermal plasma)  is being investigated for use in wound healing. alginate gel, already in clinical use, is non-toxic but has no meaningful antimicrobial property. this study reports that a non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate wound dressing has strong antimicrobial properties. methods: alginate gel was treated with non-thermal plasma in room air and inoculated with bacterial pathogens. at 15 min after this, bacterial cell viability was determined by colony assay or 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-  nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (xtt) assay. the anti-biofilm efficacy of the non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel was investigated and the  treated gel was tested against vascular endothelial cells for a cytotoxic effect. the proliferation and migration of bacterial cells before and after exposure to the treated gel were investigated with an in vitro wound testing assay. scanning  electron microscopy was used to observe changes in the gel surface associated with exposure to bacterial pathogens. the treated gel was tested against acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, candida albicans, and c. glabrata as representative pathogens (at 10(6)-10(9) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml), and the thickness of a plasma-treated gel dressing and distance between a glass dielectric-barrier discharge plasma probe and the gel surface were kept constant. results: non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel exhibited a strong biocidal property and inactivated all of the pathogens included in the study at counts of 10(8) cfu/ml and within 15 sec of treatment. the treated gel inactivated 10(9) cfu/ml of the organisms within 1 min, and 3 min of exposure to the treated gel inactivated pathogens embedded in biofilms. the plasma-treated gel showed no significant cytotoxicity, and endothelial cells exposed to the treated gel proliferated and migrated well across a wound area over a period of time. dressings made with the treated gel retained their biocidal effects for about a month. scanning electron microscopy showed no damage to the surfaces of treated gels, but damage to the bacterial pathogens on plasma exposure. conclusion: a non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel dressing has the clinical potential to decontaminate wounds, prevent surgical site infection, and promote wound healing.

TI  == silver nanoparticles and growth factors incorporated hydroxyapatite coatings on metallic implant surfaces for enhancement of osteoinductivity and antibacterial properties.
AB  == research on incorporation of both growth factors and silver (ag) into hydroxyapatite (ha) coatings on metallic implant surfaces for enhancing osteoinductivity and antibacterial properties is a challenging work. generally, ag nanoparticles are easy to agglomerate and lead to a large increase in local ag concentration, which could potentially affect cell activity. on the other hand, growth factors immobilization requires mild processing conditions so as to maintain their activities. in this study, bone morphology protein-2 (bmp-2) and ag nanoparticle contained ha coatings were prepared on ti surfaces by combining electrochemical deposition (ed) of ag and electrostatic immobilization of bmp-2.  during the ed process, chitosan (cs) was selected as the stabilizing agent to chelate ag ions and generate ag nanoparticles that are uniformly distributed in the coatings. cs also reduces ag toxicity while retaining its antibacterial activity. afterwards, a bmp/heparin solution was absorbed on the cs/ag/ha coatings. consequently, bmp-2 was immobilized on the coatings by the electrostatic attraction between cs, heparin, and bmp-2. sustained release of bmp-2 and ag ions from ha coatings was successfully demonstrated for a long period. results of antibacterial tests indicate that the cs/ag/ha coatings have high antibacterial properties against both staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli. osteoblasts (ob) culture reveals that the cs/ag/ha coatings exhibit good biocompatibility. bone marrow stromal cells (bmscs) culture indicates that the bmp/cs/ag/ha coatings have good osteoinductivity and promote the differentiation of bmscs. ti bars with bmp/cs/ag/ha coatings were implanted into the femur of rabbits to evaluate the osteoinductivity of the coatings. results indicate that bmp/cs/ag/ha coatings favor bone formation in vivo. in summary, this study presents a convenient and effective method for the incorporation of growth factors and antibacterial agents into ha coatings. this method can be utilized to modify a variety of metallic implant surfaces.

TI  == poly (hexamethylene biguanide) adsorption on hydrogen peroxide treated ti-al-v alloys and effects on wettability, antimicrobial efficacy, and cytotoxicity.
AB  == an effective amount of the antiseptic agent phmb cannot simply be placed on the surface of titanium alloys where hydrocarbons were removed by different purification procedures. pre-treatment of ti6al4v specimen with 5% h2o2 in 24 h results in extra introduced -oh and -cooh groups as well as an adsorbed water film on the surface, which provide the base for the subsequent formation of a relatively stable and multi-layered phmb film. the superficially adhering phmb film produces no adverse effects on mg63 cells within a 48 h-cell culture, but promotes the initial attachment and spreading of the osteoblasts on the modified  ti6al4v surface within 15 min. after direct bacterial inoculation of the active sample, the phmb film reacts antimicrobially against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli) after surface contact. the bactericidal efficacy is only slightly reduced after using of the same specimen for re-testing the antibacterial activity. mg63 cells adhere and proliferate within 48 h on a phmb film-containing ti6al4v surface, which has been pre-contaminated with s. aureus. bacterial biofilms were only revealed in controls without phmb.

TI  == (-)-menthol based thixotropic hydrogel and its application as a universal antibacterial carrier.
AB  == a kind of novel hydrogelator based on (-)-menthol, a traditional cooling compound, tailed by an amino acid derivate through an alkyl chain, has been designed and synthesized. the hydrogelator containing an l-lysine can form a stable hydrogel with thixotropic character in a large ph range. an interesting feature is that the viscoelastic character of the hydrogel can be enhanced by mechanical force. the mechanism of the self-assembly process was investigated by  means of ir, sem, afm and x-ray diffraction. the formation of three dimensional multiporous networks through acid base interactions and strong double hydrogen bonding between amino acids is proposed to be the driving force for the construction of the stable hydrogel. as a result, the hydrogelator can further gelate aqueous solutions of some confirmed antibacterial agents such as zn(2+) and a series of water soluble organic antibiotic medicines like lincomycin, amoxicillin, etc., in such a unique way that the concentration of the antibacterial agents loaded into the hydrogel can be tuned to a large extent. the antimicrobial susceptibility of the hydrogels loaded with zn(2+) or lincomycin is much more effective than that of the corresponding aqueous solution tested by the oxford cup method. furthermore, the hydrogelator is completely innoxious to living cells by measurement of mtt assay. thus, the hydrogel can be developed as  a universal carrier for antibacterial agents and may also be widely used in the fields of cell culture, tissue engineering, or drug delivery systems.

TI  == biofilms on indwelling urologic devices: microbes and antimicrobial management prospect.
AB  == background: biofilms (bfs) are a potential source of highly resistant infections, frequently formed on devicesand pose problems for management. aim: this study was to develop rational approach for prevention of indwelling urologic device associated biofilm colonization. subjects and methods: from randomly selected patients visiting department of urology of a tertiary hospital in india 150 uro catheters and 31 used ureteric stents, in-situ for > 30, were collected aseptically. the organisms were isolated and identified from washed devices dipped in broth. evidence of bacteriuria in each case was checked by semi-quantitative method of urine culture, on day 0 and 14 of device use. the bf  statuses of the device-adhered organisms were confirmed by modified method of christensen. the antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disc diffusion method. data were analyzed using the graphpad prism version 5 statistical software. results: both single and multi-species bfs were formed on catheters, whereas mono-bacterial bfs were exclusive on stents. predominant organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.67%,69/225,) followed by staphylococcus aureus (15.11%, 34/225), escherichia coli (13.78%, 31/225), klebsiella pneumoniae (12%,  27/225), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.44%, 19/225). of all strains, (89.33%, 201/225) were found to be bf positive and their colonizations were early indicated by the presence of insignificant bacteriuria in follow-up urine samples. all bf isolates were resistant to at least three antibiotics. conclusions: bf colonization was almost inevitable in prolonged used urinary devices and the most frequent organisms were pseudomonas, staphylococcus, and escherichia spp. their colonizations usually were indicated by insignificant bacteriuria from follow-up samples. such bf dislodged organisms were multidrug resistant and could be a source of disseminated infection, yet were in-vitro preventable by many drugs.

TI  == nanopatterned antimicrobial enzymatic surfaces combining biocidal and fouling release properties.
AB  == surfaces incorporating the antimicrobial enzyme, lysozyme, have been previously demonstrated to effectively disrupt bacterial cellular envelopes. as with any surface active antimicrobial, however, lysozyme-expressing surfaces become limited in their utility by the accumulation of dead bacteria and debris. surfaces modified with environmentally responsive polymers, on the other hand, have been shown to reversibly attach and release both live and dead bacterial cells. in this work, we combine the antimicrobial activity of lysozyme with the fouling release capability of the thermally responsive polymer, poly(n-isopropylacrylamide) (pnipaam), which has a lower critical solution temperature (lcst) in water at approximately 32 degrees c. nanopatterned pnipaam  brushes were fabricated using interferometric lithography followed by surface-initiated polymerization. lysozyme was then adsorbed into the polymer-free regions of the substrate between the brushes to achieve a hybrid surface with switchable antimicrobial activity and fouling-release ability in response to the change of temperature. the temperature triggered hydration and conformational change of the nanopatterned pnipaam brushes provide the ability to temporally regulate the spatial concealment and exposure of adsorbed lysozyme. the biocidal efficacy and release properties of the hybrid surface were tested against escherichia coli k12 and staphylococcus epidermidis. the hybrid surfaces  facilitated the attachment of bacteria at 37 degrees c for e. coli and 25 degrees c for s. epidermidis and when the temperature is above the lcst, collapsed and dehydrated pnipaam chains expose lysozyme to kill attached bacteria. changing temperature across the lcst of pnipaam (e.g. from 37 degrees c to 25 degrees c for e. coli or from 25 degrees c to 37 degrees c for s. epidermidis) to induce a  hydration transition of pnipaam promoted the release of dead bacteria and debris  from the surfaces upon mild shearing. these results suggest that nano-engineered  surfaces can provide an effective way for actively mitigating short term bacterial biofouling.

TI  == nanoscale engineering of low-fouling surfaces through polydopamine immobilisation of zwitterionic peptides.
AB  == we report a versatile approach for the design of substrate-independent low-fouling surfaces via mussel-inspired immobilisation of zwitterionic peptides. using mussel-inspired polydopamine (pda) coatings, zwitterionic glutamic acid- and lysine-based peptides were immobilised on various substrates, including noble metals, metal oxides, polymers, and semiconductors. the variation of surface chemistry and surface wettability upon surface treatment was monitored with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) and water contact angle measurements. following  peptide immobilisation, the surfaces became more hydrophilic due to the strong surface hydration compared with pda-coated surfaces. the peptide-functionalised surfaces showed resistance to human blood serum adsorption and also effectively prevented the adhesion of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (i.e., escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis) and mammalian cells (i.e., nih 3t3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells). the versatility of mussel-inspired chemistry combined with the unique biological nature and tunability of peptides allows for the design of low-fouling surfaces, making this a promising coating technique for various applications.

AB  == background and objectives: current fda-approved culture-based methods for the bacterial testing of platelet concentrate (pc) can yield false-negative results attributed to poisson-limited sampling errors incurred near the time of collection that result in undetectable bacterial concentrations. testing pc at the point of issue (poi) extends the incubation period for any contaminant bacteria increasing the probability of detection. data are presented from time-course experiments designed to simulate poi testing of bacterially contaminated pcs at different stages of growth using differential impedance sensing. study design and methods: whole-blood-derived pcs were typically spiked  with low numbers of bacteria (approximately 100 cfu/ml) and incubated under standard pc storage conditions. each infected unit was evaluated every two hours  over a 12-h period. all samples were treated with a chemical compound that induces stress in the bacterial cells only. the development of any bacterial stress was monitored by detecting changes in the dielectric properties of the pc  using differential impedance. results: differential impedance measurements and corresponding cell counts at the different time-points are presented for six organisms implicated in post-transfusion-septic reactions. all infected pcs were  detected once contaminant bacteria reached concentrations ranging between 0.6 x 10(3) and 6 x 10(3) cfu/ml irrespective of the phase of growth. results were obtained within 30 min after the start of the assay and without the need for cell lysis or centrifugation. conclusion: differential impedance sensing can detect bacterial contamination in pc rapidly at concentrations below clinical thresholds known to cause adverse effects.

TI  == microbes in the neonatal intensive care unit resemble those found in the gut of premature infants.
AB  == background: the source inoculum of gastrointestinal tract (git) microbes is largely influenced by delivery mode in full-term infants, but these influences may be decoupled in very low birth weight (vlbw, <1,500 g) neonates via conventional broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. we hypothesize the built environment (be), specifically room surfaces frequently touched by humans, is a predominant source of colonizing microbes in the gut of premature vlbw infants. here, we present the first matched fecal-be time series analysis of two preterm vlbw neonates housed in a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) over the first month of life. results: fresh fecal samples were collected every 3 days and metagenomes sequenced on an illumina hiseq2000 device. for each fecal sample, approximately 33 swabs were collected from each nicu room from 6 specified areas: sink, feeding and intubation tubing, hands of healthcare providers and parents, general surfaces, and nurse station electronics (keyboard, mouse, and cell phone). swabs were processed using a recently developed 'expectation maximization iterative reconstruction of genes from the environment' (emirge) amplicon pipeline in which full-length 16s rrna amplicons were sheared and sequenced using an illumina platform, and short reads reassembled into full-length genes. over 24,000 full-length 16s rrna sequences were produced, generating an average of approximately 12,000 operational taxonomic units (otus) (clustered at 97% nucleotide identity) per room-infant pair. dominant gut taxa, including staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli, were widely distributed throughout the room environment with many gut colonizers detected in more than half of samples. reconstructed genomes  from infant gut colonizers revealed a suite of genes that confer resistance to antibiotics (for example, tetracycline, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside) and  sterilizing agents, which likely offer a competitive advantage in the nicu environment. conclusions: we have developed a high-throughput culture-independent approach that integrates room surveys based on full-length 16s rrna gene sequences with metagenomic analysis of fecal samples collected from infants in the room. the approach enabled identification of discrete icu reservoirs of microbes that also colonized the infant gut and provided evidence for the presence of certain organisms in the room prior to their detection in the gut.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of fluorescent ag nanoparticles.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of fluorescent ag nanoparticles of 1.5 nm (nag-fs) is  demonstrated and compared with the other ag nanoparticles of different shapes and size. the antimicrobial activity was evaluated using gram-positive (staphylococcus epidermidis ncim2493 and bacillus megaterium) and gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc27853 and escherichia coli) and fungal strains (candida albicans and aspergillus niger). insights into the possible mechanism were investigated using fluorescence microscope and cytoplasmic materials release assay. the fluorescence microscopic measurements show that the  nag-fs are localized at the centre of the cell, and 50% decrease in the fluorescence intensity was observed upon 2-h incubation. maximum cytoplasmic release was observed with spherical ag nanoparticles of 10 nm. although the nag-f shows minimum cytoplasmic release, it has the highest activity. the microbial killing effect of nag-fs is actually originates from its intracellular activity.  the antimicrobial activity of nag-fs is significantly higher than the other synthesized nanoparticles of different shapes and size. the activity of the nanoparticles has been rationalized by considering the shape, size and surface structure of the particles. significance and impact of the study: this study aims to demonstrate the size and shape-dependent antimicrobial activity of ag nanoparticles. it is shown for the first time that the fluorescent ag nanoparticles of 1.5 nm have superior antimicrobial activity with respect to the  larger particles. the shape and size of the particles actually control their activity. the smaller particles can easily penetrate the cell wall and have pronounced activity. these findings may be useful in the development of potential antimicrobial agents.

TI  == isolation of cultivable microorganisms from polish notes and coins.
AB  == the potential role of currency in the spread of pathogenic microflora has been evaluated in many countries. in this study polish paper notes and the coins in general circulation were assayed for the presence of cultivable bacteria and fungi. bacterial isolates identification was based on cultural and biochemical characters and by comparison of the 16s rrna gene sequence. fungal isolates were  recognized with biochemical and morphological criteria. coagulase-negative staphylococci, (43.6% of the total bacterial count) including staphylococcus saprophyticus, s. epidermidis, and s. hominis, and enteroccus spp. (30.8% of the  total bacterial count), i.e. e.faecalis, e.faecium and e. durans, were the most numerous bacterial contamination. penicillium spp., and aspergillus spp. were the most frequently detected moulds whereas candida spp. was the most frequent yeast  isolated from currency. a visible dependence between the banknote denomination, the physical condition of paper currency, and the number of bacteria and fungi was found. the overall count of bacteria isolated from currency was thousand-fold higher than that of fungal isolates. the total amount of bacteria and fungi recovered from the coins was approximately 2.7-fold lower than that isolated from the notes. in summary, the polish currency notes were found to be contaminated mainly with commensal bacteria and fungi while the opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms escherichia coli, pseudomonas stutzeri and c. albicans were detected at a low frequency.

TI  == [significance and prevention of post-operative wound complications].
AB  == although surgical site infections (ssi) in dermatologic operative procedures are  extremely rare, it is important to understand risks and etiological factors to initiate risk assessment and specific preventive measures. ssi commonly are associated with a complicated, long-term and expensive outcome. typical wound pathogens of these infections include a variety of multiresistant organisms along with staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, hemolytic streptococci and the gram-negative bacilli escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. effective hygienic measures as part of an adequate quality management system should consider the critical points in the development of ssi, particularly in the setting of an outpatient dermatologic unit, such as preparation of the operative area, preoperative skin antisepsis, hand hygiene, safe and skilled technique by surgeons, and barrier nursing to prevent spread of pathogens. the baseline infection incidence in dermatologic surgery inherently is low; nevertheless significant improvements can be achieved by implementation of risk-adapted infection control measures.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == nanostructured silver-gold bimetallic sers substrates for selective identification of bacteria in human blood.
AB  == surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy (sers) is a potentially important tool in the rapid and accurate detection of pathogenic bacteria in biological fluids. however, for diagnostic application of this technique, it is necessary to develop a highly sensitive, stable, biocompatible and reproducible sers-active substrate. in this work, we have developed a silver-gold bimetallic sers surface by a simple potentiostatic electrodeposition of a thin gold layer on an electrochemically roughened nanoscopic silver substrate. the resultant substrate was very stable under atmospheric conditions and exhibited the strong raman enhancement with the  high reproducibility of the recorded sers spectra of bacteria (e. coli, s. enterica, s. epidermidis, and b. megaterium). the coating of the antibiotic over  the sers substrate selectively captured bacteria from blood samples and also increased the raman signal in contrast to the bare surface. finally, we have utilized the antibiotic-coated hybrid surface to selectively identify different pathogenic bacteria, namely e. coli, s. enterica and s. epidermidis from blood samples.

AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == sers detection of bacteria in water by in situ coating with ag nanoparticles.
AB  == the bio-sensing for the convenient detection of bacteria has been widely explored with the use of various sensing materials and techniques. it is still a challenge to achieve an ultrasensitive and selective, but simple, rapid, and inexpensive detection method for bacteria. we report on surface-enhanced raman scattering (sers) for the detection of living bacteria in drinking water by employing a synthesis of silver nanoparticles coating the cell wall of bacteria. we found that the raman signals intensity of bacteria after agnp synthesis mainly depends  on the zeta potential of the cell wall. the enhancement of the raman signal of bacteria using this strategy is about 30-fold higher than that in the case of a simply mixed colloid-bacterial suspension. the total assay time required is only  10 min and the total reactants' volume needed to analyze bacteria in a real environment is as low as 1 ml. particularly, only one droplet of 3 mul sample is  necessary for each sers measurement. furthermore, we can use this novel strategy  to discriminate three strains of escherichia coli and one strain of staphylococcus epidermidis by hierarchy cluster analysis. finally, we can detect  bacteria down to 2.5 x 10(2) cells/ml on a hydrophobic glass slide by sers mapping. thus, our detection method offers prominent advantages, such as reduced  assay time, simple handling, low reactant volumes, small amount of sample, and higher sensitivity and selectivity compared to previously reported label free methods. this novel strategy may be extended to open an avenue for developing various sers-based biosensors.

TI  == zwitterionic-based stainless steel with well-defined polysulfobetaine brushes for general bioadhesive control.
AB  == stainless steels are widely used as orthopaedic and dental implant; however, bioadhesion in the case of thrombosis, inflammation, and infection is one of their major limitations. one way to tackle this problem is to graft the stainless steel surface with a zwitterionic polymer known for being anti-bioadhesive. controlled atom transfer radical polymerization (atrp) of zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (polysbma) grafted from biomedical grade stainless steel surface was employed in this study. the interactions of polysbma-grafted surfaces with biomacromolecules were demonstrated in vitro by the adhesion tests of plasma protein, blood cells, human mg63 osteoblast- and ht1080 fibroblast-like cells in biological complex media to evaluate their bioadhesive properties. anti-microbial effects were also assessed for two most ordinary seen clinical bacteria, i.e., escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. results showed that polysbma-grafted surface exhibited evident bioadhesion resistance and conferring antibacterial efficacy. this work is also dedicated to deduce the effectiveness of polysbma brushes' conformational structure on the prevention of bioadhesion. to this aim, the anti-bioadhesive effect of polysbma brushes prepared by dopamine- and silane-surfaced immobilization method was evaluated. results show that polysbma grafted from immobilized polydopamine interfacial layers achieved better bioadhesion resistance, which could be causally related to their greater grafting coverage, flexible brush conformational structures, and greater hydration capabilities.

TI  == influence of abiotic factors on the antimicrobial activity of chitosan.
AB  == in an effort to bypass the adverse secondary effects attributed to the traditional therapeutic approaches used to treat skin disorders (such as atopic dermatitis), alternative antimicrobials have recently been suggested. one such antimicrobial is chitosan, owing to the already proved biological properties associated with its use. however, the influence of abiotic factors on such activities warrants evaluation. this research effort assessed the antimicrobial activity of chitosan upon skin microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli) in vitro when subject to a combination of different abiotic factors such as ph, ionic strength, organic acids and free fatty acids. free fatty acids, ionic strength and ph significantly affected chitosan's capability of reducing the viable numbers of s. aureus. this  antimicrobial action was potentiated in the presence of palmitic acid and a lower ionic strength (0.2% nacl), while a higher ionic strength (0.4% nacl) favored chitosan's action upon the reduction of viable numbers of s. epidermidis and e. coli. although further studies are needed, these preliminary results advocate that chitosan can in the future be potentially considered as an antimicrobial of  choice when handling symptoms associated with atopic dermatitis.

AB  == plants produce a variety of proteins and peptides which are involved in their defense against pathogens. serine protease inhibitors are a well-established class of inhibitors correlated with plant defense. increased levels of protease inhibitors delay cell damage and expand the cell's life-span. recently, the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbial pathogens has prompted immense interest in purifying novel antimicrobial proteins or peptides from plant sources. usually, the purification of protease inhibitors is accomplished by salt-extraction, ultrafiltration and affinity chromatography. here, we developed  a novel approach based on iron oxide nanoparticles conjugated to dextran functionalized with trypsin beads that accelerate the quick screening and purification of antimicrobial peptides with serine protease inhibitor activity. the method described here also works for screening other inhibitors using particular protein kinases, and it is therefore a novel tool for use as the leading method in the development of novel antimicrobial agents with protease inhibitory activity. finally, and no less important, molecular modelling and dynamics studies of a homologous inhibitor studied here with escherichia coli trypsin and chymotrypsin are provided in order to shed some light on inhibitor-enzyme interactions.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == phytochemical, toxicological and antimicrobial evaluation of lawsonia inermis extracts against clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: the emerging resistance of pathogen against the currently available antimicrobial agents demands the search of new antimicrobial agents. the use of medicinal plants as natural substitute is the paramount area of research to overwhelm the drug resistance of infectious agents. scientists have not made enough effort on the evaluation of safety of medicinal plant yet. methods: in the present study antimicrobial activity of lawsonia inermis is investigated against  clinical isolates of seven bacteria including four gram negative (escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella spp., shigella sonnei) and three gram positive (bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis) using disc diffusion method. four types of lawsonia inermis extracts were prepared using methanol, chloroform, acetone and water as extraction solvents, while dmso (dimethyl sulfoxide) and water as dissolution solvents. the rate and extent of bacterial killing was estimated by time-kill kinetic assay at 1x mic of each bacterial isolate. the overall safety of lawsonia inermis extracts was assessed in mice. results: lawsonia inermis displayed noteworthy antimicrobial activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains used in the study. the minimum value of mic for different bacterial strains ranged from 2.31 mg/ml to 9.27 mg/ml. at 1x mic of each bacterial isolate, 3log10 decrease in cfu was recorded after 6 hours of drug exposure and no growth was observed in almost all  tested bacteria after 24 hours of exposure. no sign of toxidrome were observed during in vivo toxicity evaluation in mice at 300 mg/kg concentration. conclusion: in conclusion, the present study provides the scientific rational for medicinal use of lawsonia inermis. the use of lawsonia inermis extracts is of great significance as substitute antimicrobial agent in therapeutics.

TI  == domination of volumetric toughening by silver nanoparticles over interfacial strengthening of carbon nanotubes in bactericidal hydroxyapatite biocomposite.
AB  == in order to address the problem of bacterial infections in bone-substitution surgery, it is essential that bone replacement biomaterials are equipped with bactericidal components. this research aims to optimize the content of silver (ag), a well-known antibacterial metal, in a multiwalled carbon nanotube (cnt) reinforced hydroxyapatite (ha) composite, to yield a bioceramic which can be used as an antibacterial and tough surface of bone replacement prosthesis. the bactericidal properties evaluated using escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis indicate that cnt reinforcement supports growth of gram negative e. coli bacteria (~8.5% more adhesion than pure ha); but showed a strong decrease of gram positive s. epidermidis bacteria (~diminished to 66%) compared to that of pure ha. small amounts of silver (2-5wt.%) already show a severe bactericidal effect when compared to that of ha-cnt (by 30% and ~60% respectively). mtt assay  confirmed enhanced biocompatibility of l929 cells on ha-4wt.% cnt (~121%), ha-4wt.% cnt-1wt.% ag (~124%) sample and ha-4wt.% cnt-2wt.% ag (~100%) when compared to that of pure ha. the samples with higher silver content showed decreased biocompatibility (77% for ha-4wt.% cnt-5wt.% ag sample and 73% for ha-4wt.% cnt-10wt.% ag). though reinforcement of 4wt.% cnt has shown an increase  of fracture toughness by ~62%, silver reinforcement has shown enhancement of up to 244% (i.e. 3.43 times). accordingly, isolation of toughening contribution indicates that volumetric toughening by silver dominates over interfacial strengthening contributed by cnts towards enhanced fracture toughness of potential ha-ag-cnt biocomposites.

TI  == anti-biofilm efficacy of low temperature processed agcl-tio2 nanocomposite coating.
AB  == biofilms are a major concern in the medical settings and food industries due to their high tolerance to antibiotics, biocides and mechanical stress. currently, the development of novel methods to control biofilm formation is being actively pursued. in the present study, sol-gel coatings of agcl-tio2 nanoparticles are presented as potential anti-biofilm agents, wherein tio2 acts as a good supporting matrix to prevent aggregation of silver and facilitates its controlled release. low-temperature processed agcl-tio2 nanocomposite coatings inhibit biofilm formation by escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in vitro biofilm assay experiments demonstrated that agcl-tio2 nanocomposite coated surfaces, inhibited the development of biofilms over a period of 10days as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. the silver release kinetics exhibited an initial high release, followed by a slow and sustained release. the anti-biofilm efficacy of the coatings could be attributed to the release of silver, which prevents the initial bacterial adhesion required for biofilm formation.

TI  == mineralogical variables that control the antibacterial effectiveness of a natural clay deposit.
AB  == as antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains emerge and pose increased global health risks, new antibacterial agents are needed as alternatives to conventional antimicrobials. naturally occurring antibacterial clays have been identified which are effective in killing antibiotic-resistant bacteria. this study examines a hydrothermally formed antibacterial clay deposit near crater lake, or (usa). our hypothesis is that antibacterial clays buffer ph and eh conditions to dissolve unstable mineral phases containing transition metals (primarily fe(2+)), while smectite interlayers serve as reservoirs for time release of bactericidal components. model pathogens (escherichia coli atcc 25922 and staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 14990) were incubated with clays from different alteration zones of the hydrothermal deposit. in vitro antibacterial susceptibility testing showed that reduced mineral zones were bactericidal, while more oxidized zones had variable antibacterial effect. tem images showed no indication of cell lysis. cytoplasmic condensation and cell wall accumulations of <100 nm particles were seen within both bacterial populations. electron energy loss analysis indicates precipitation of intracellular fe(3+)-oxide nanoparticles (<10 nm) in e. coli after 24 h. clay minerals and pyrite buffer aqueous solutions to ph 2.5-3.1, eh > 630 mv and contain elevated level (mm) of soluble fe (fe(2+) and fe(3+)) and al(3+). our interpretation is that rapid uptake of fe(2+) impairs bacterial metabolism by flooding the cell with excess fe(2+) and overwhelming iron storage  proteins. as the intracellular fe(2+) oxidizes, it produces reactive oxygen species that damage biomolecules and precipitates fe-oxides. the ability of antibacterial clays to buffer ph and eh in chronic non-healing wounds to conditions of healthy skin appears key to their healing potential and viability as an alternative to conventional antibiotics.

TI  == immobilized phage proteins for specific detection of staphylococci.
AB  == rapid, specific detection of pathogenic bacteria remains a major challenge in infectious disease diagnostics. bacteriophages can show genus- or even species-level specificity and have been developed for biosensing purposes, but the possibility of using individual phage proteins for detection has not been fully explored. this work exploits the ability of specific phage proteins, the endolysins lysk and phi11, and the bacteriocin lysostaphin, fixed on silicon wafers to bind staphylococci. the proteins show activity against eight tested clinical isolates of s. aureus and to s. epidermidis, but no binding to escherichia coli and limited binding to micrococcus. binding was quantified by clearing assays in solution and by functionalization of silicon wafers followed by light microscopy. bacterial binding densities on functionalized surfaces were  ~3 cells/100 mum(2). the small size of the proteins makes the system robust and easy to handle, and the principle is generalizable to many different biosensor platforms, including label-free systems such as optical microresonators.

TI  == antimicrobial polycarbonates: investigating the impact of balancing charge and hydrophobicity using a same-centered polymer approach.
AB  == biodegradable antimicrobial polymers are a promising solution for combating drug  resistant microbes. when designing these materials, the balance between charge and hydrophobicity significantly affects the antimicrobial activity and selectivity toward microbes over mammalian cells. furthermore, where the charge and hydrophobicity is located on the molecules has also proven to be significant. a series of antimicrobial homopolymer polycarbonates were synthesized, where the  hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance was controlled by varying the spacer between the  charged quaternary ammonium moiety and the polymer backbone (a "same-centered" structure where the hydrophobic moiety is directly attached to the charged moiety). these homopolymers were active against all microbes tested but depending on the spacer length some hemolytic activity was observed. to reduce the polymer  hemolytic activity we systematically varied the polymer composition by copolymerizing the different monomers used in the "same center" homopolymers. by  maintaining charge on each repeat unit but copolymerizing monomers having varied  hydrophobic side chain lengths, polymers with high activity and selectivity were  achieved. in addition, these macromolecules act via a membrane disruption mechanism, making them less likely to induce resistance.

TI  == involvement of the anopheles gambiae nimrod gene family in mosquito immune responses.
AB  == insects fight infection using a variety of signaling pathways and immune effector proteins. in drosophila melanogaster, three members of the nimrod gene family (draper, nimc1 and eater) bind bacteria, and this binding leads to phagocytosis by hemocytes. the nimrod gene family has since been identified in other insects,  but their function in non-drosophilids remains unknown. the purpose of this study was to identify the members of the nimrod gene family in the malaria mosquito, anopheles gambiae, and to assess their role in immunity. we identified and sequenced three members of this gene family, herein named draper, nimrod and eater, which are the orthologs of d. melanogaster draper, nimb2 and eater, respectively. the three genes are preferentially expressed in hemocytes and their peak developmental expression is in pupae and young adults. infection induces the transcriptional upregulation of all three genes, but the magnitude of this upregulation becomes more attenuated as mosquitoes become older. rnai-based knockdown of eater, but not draper or nimrod, decreased a mosquito's ability to kill escherichia coli in the hemocoel. knockdown of draper, eater, or any combination of nimrod family genes rendered mosquitoes more likely to die from staphylococcus epidermidis. finally, knockdown of nimrod family genes did not impact mrna levels of the antimicrobial peptides defensin (def1), cecropin (ceca) or gambicin (gam1), but eater knockdown led to a decrease in mrna levels of nitric oxide synthase. together, these data show that members of the a. gambiae nimrod gene family are positive regulators of the mosquito antibacterial response.

TI  == antimicrobial properties and elution kinetics of linezolid from polymethylmethacrylate.
AB  == polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) impregnated with antibiotics is widely used in the  treatment of osteomyelitis and infected arthroplasties. with the emergence of resistant bacterial strains, linezolid, which is active against gram-positive bacteria and toward which resistance has been scarce, has been suggested as an alternative. in the current in vitro study, the authors sought to determine and compare the efficacy and elution kinetics of linezolid from pmma. polymethylmethacrylate beads impregnated with linezolid, vancomycin, or gentamicin alone and in combinations were placed in suspensions of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the leaching out concentrations of antibiotics and growth inhibitory time in days were recorded. the mechanical strength of cement beads was evaluated in accordance with international standard 5833. the growth inhibitory time of linezolid was significantly longer than that of vancomycin and gentamicin for methicillin-resistant s aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and s epidermidis. the combination of linezolid with gentamicin and vancomycin significantly increased the growth inhibitory time compared with either antibiotic used alone. linezolid alone or in combination with vancomycin and gentamicin showed satisfactory elution kinetics and antimicrobial activity in vitro without compromising the mechanical strength of pmma. future research evaluating the in vivo profile of linezolid-loaded pmma in experimental animals is needed before it can be considered for human use.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy and wound-healing property of a topical ointment containing nitric-oxide-loaded zeolites.
AB  == topical delivery of nitric oxide (no) through a wound dressing has the potential  to reduce wound infections and improve healing of acute and chronic wounds. this  study characterized the antibacterial efficacy of an ointment containing no-loaded, zinc-exchanged zeolite a that releases no upon contact with water. the release rate of no from the ointment was measured using a chemiluminescence detection system. minimum bactericidal concentration assays were performed using  five common wound pathogens, including gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii), gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis  and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) and a fungus (candida albicans).  the time dependence of antimicrobial activity was characterized by performing log-reduction assays at four time points after 1-8 h ointment exposure. the cytotoxicity of the ointment after 24 h was assessed using cultured 3t3 fibroblast cells. minimum microbicidal concentrations (mmcs) for bacterial organisms (5x10(7) c.f.u.) ranged from 50 to 100 mg ointment (ml media)(-1); the  mmc for c. albicans (5x10(4) c.f.u.) was 50 mg ointment (ml media)(-1). five to eight log reductions in bacterial viability and three log reductions in fungal viability were observed after 8 h exposure to no-zeolite ointment compared with untreated organisms. fibroblasts remained viable after 24 h exposure to the same  concentration of no-zeolite ointment as was used in antimicrobial tests. in parallel studies, full-thickness cutaneous wounds on zucker obese rats healed faster than wounds treated with a control ointment. these data indicate that ointment containing no-loaded zeolites could potentially be used as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial wound-healing dressing.

TI  == a novel approach for rapid detection of bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates via sensitive measurement of microbial dna polymerase activity.
AB  == background: transfusion of bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates (pcs) can result in serious health consequences for the affected patient. before being  released from blood banking facilities, pcs are routinely screened for bacterial  contamination by culture-based tests. however, culture-based pc screening methods require extended holding and incubation periods and are prone to false-negative results due to sampling error. screening pcs closer to the time of transfusion using rapid point-of-issue tests represents an alternative approach; however, fda-approved assays generally suffer from a lack of sensitivity. study design and methods: presented herein is the feasibility of a novel approach toward rapid, sensitive, and universal detection of bacterially contaminated pcs via selective  measurement of microbial dna polymerase activity. this approach is achieved using a differential cell lysis procedure in combination with enzymatic template generation and amplification (termed etga-pc assay). results: serial dilution spiking experiments revealed an approximate sensitivity of 30 to 200 colony-forming units (cfus)/ml (mean, 85 cfus/ml) for staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae. an additional 22 clinically relevant strains of bacteria were also detected below 200 cfus/ml after spiking into pc aliquots. furthermore, the etga-pc assay was able to accurately monitor the presence and growth of seven clinically relevant bacterial species that were spiked into pc units. conclusion: together, the data presented  here demonstrate that the etga-pc assay is a feasible approach for rapid and sensitive detection of bacterially contaminated pcs. experiments, aimed at simplification and/or automation of the assay procedure, are under way.

TI  == photo-activated porphyrin in combination with antibiotics: therapies against staphylococci.
AB  == staphylococcal infections have become difficult to treat due to antibiotic insensitivity and resistance. antimicrobial combination therapies may minimize acquisition of resistance and photodynamic therapy is an attractive candidate for these combinations. in this manuscript, we explore combined use of antibiotics and meso-tetra (4-aminophenyl) porphine (tapp), a cationic porphyrin, for treatment of staphylococcus aureus contamination. we characterize the antimicrobial activity of photoactivated tapp and show that activity is largely lost in the presence of a radical scavenger. importantly, tapp can be reactivated with continued, albeit attenuated, antibacterial activity. we then show that the  antimicrobial activity of illuminated tapp is additive with chloramphenicol and tobramycin for s. aureus and escherichia coli, and synergistic for mrsa and staphylococcus epidermidis. chloramphenicol+methylene blue, another photosensitizer, also show additivity against s. aureus. in contrast, ceftriaxone and vancomycin do not strongly augment the low level effects of tapp against s. aureus. eukaryotic cells exhibit a dose-dependent toxicity with illuminated tapp. our results suggest that even sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of photo-activated tapp could be used to boost the activity of waning antibiotics. this may play an important role in treatments reliant on antibiotic controlled release systems where augmentation with photo-active agents could extend their efficacy.

TI  == single-level lumbar pyogenic spondylodiscitis treated with minimally invasive anterior debridement and fusion combined with posterior fixation via wiltse approach.
AB  == the effect and safety of anterior debridement and fusion with a minimally invasive approach combined with posterior fixation via the wiltse approach were assessed in the single-level lumbar pyogenic spondylodiscitis. seventeen patients from 2007 to 2009 underwent anterior debridement and fusion with a minimally invasive approach combined with posterior fixation via the wiltse approach. postoperative follow-up time was 24-41 months. data included the patients' general information, microbiology, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, intervertebral fusion rate, and preoperative and final follow-up scores for american spinal injury association (asia) impairment,  visual analogue scale (vas), and oswestry disability index (odi). ten patients had undergone a prior spinal invasive procedure, and 7 had hematogenous infection. the infected segments included l1-2, l2-3, l3-4, and l4-5 in 1, 2, 5,  and 9 cases, respectively. thirteen bacterial cultures were positive for staphylococcus aureus (5 cases), staphylococcus epidermidis (4), streptococcus (3), and escherichia coli (1). the operative time was 213.8+/-45.6 min, and the intraoperative blood loss was 180.6+/-88.1 ml. postoperative complications consisted of urinary retention (2 cases), constipation (3), and deep vein thrombosis (2). on the final follow-up, vas scores and odis were significantly lower than those of preoperation, while the asia grades improved. all the cases achieved good intervertebral bony fusion. anterior debridement and fusion with a  minimally invasive approach combined with posterior fixation via the wiltse approach can successfully treat single-level lumbar pyogenic spondylodiscitis, with less trauma and reliable immobilization. it is a viable option for clinical  application.

TI  == evaluation of the anti-infectious properties of polyester vascular prostheses functionalised with cyclodextrin.
AB  == objectives: synthetic vascular graft infection (svgi) remains associated with high morbidity-mortality rates. newly developed polyester vascular prostheses (pvp) functionalised with cyclodextrin (pvp-cd) allowed sustained-drug-eluting of several antibiotics. this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pvp-cd loaded with antibiotics against bacteria that are commonly responsible for svgi in current practice. methods: samples of pvp-cd loaded with antibiotics and uncoated-pvp were tested in-vitro for their ability to limit bacterial adhesion and prevent bacterial proliferation over time. their anti-infectious properties were further evaluated in-vivo in a mouse model of svgi. both gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, mrsa) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, en. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria were tested.  results: pvp-cd loaded with rifampin showed significant bacterial adhesion reduction and growth inhibition against gram-positive bacteria. similar results were obtained against gram-negative bacteria with pvp-cd loaded with ciprofloxacin. in the mouse model, gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial proliferations were significantly prevented by pvp-cd loaded with rifampin or with ciprofloxacin respectively. a decrease in macroscopic infections correlated  with the bacterial proliferation rates depicted on the samples (spearman's rho =  0.61; p < 0.0001). conclusions: we have demonstrated the efficacy of pvp-cd loaded with appropriate antibiotics both in-vitro and in-vivo against six of the  most common bacteria involved in human svgi.

TI  == crystal structure of a glucose/h+ symporter and its mechanism of action.
AB  == glucose transporters are required to bring glucose into cells, where it is an essential energy source and precursor in protein and lipid synthesis. these transporters are involved in important common diseases such as cancer and diabetes. here, we report the crystal structure of the staphylococcus epidermidis glucose/h(+) symporter in an inward-facing conformation at 3.2-a resolution. the  staphylococcus epidermidis glucose/h(+) symporter is homologous to human glucose  transporters, is very specific and has high avidity for glucose, and is inhibited by the human glucose transport inhibitors cytochalasin b, phloretin, and forskolin. on the basis of the crystal structure in conjunction with mutagenesis  and functional studies, we propose a mechanism for glucose/h(+) symport and discuss the symport mechanism versus facilitated diffusion.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == the presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  == mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (et). it is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of vap. unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time vap is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (sc). it is thus important to know whether these sc can predict the microbial flora in et biofilms. in this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and of candida albicans in cultures from et biofilms and sc (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. our data indicate that  there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in et biofilms and sc.

TI  == new non-alcoholic formulation for hand disinfection.
AB  == hand washing is considered as the single most important strategy to prevent infections. world health organization (who) defines hand hygiene as a primary issue of personal care with particular reference to hospital personnel and health facility workers. in this work, we investigated a new combination for hand disinfection as an alternative to alcohol-based and chlorhexidine products. the new combination of 5-pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid (pca) and copper sulphate pentahydrate (cs) was tested upon different bacterial species that normally colonize hands, including staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus  (mr s. aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis, multidrug resistant s. epidermidis (mdr s. epidermidis), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, candida albicans and three clinical isolates: mr s. aureus, mdr s. epidermidis, and an e. coli strain. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics),  minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices, and fractional bactericidal concentration (fbc) indices were evaluated. ethanol 70% v/v, isopropanol 60% v/v, and 4% w/v chlorhexidine solution were used as reference hand disinfectants. copper sulphate pentahydrate  was very effective against all tested microorganisms: the mic and mbc for cs ranged from 781 mg/l against s. pyogenes to 12500 mg/l against e. coli strains and c. albicans. in addition, pca exhibited a good antimicrobial activity, in particular, against s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae. the combination of cs and pca  showed a strong synergistic effect and all fic indices were </=0.500. the combination of cs and pca were more effective than ethanol 70% v/v and isopropanol 60% v/v. in addition to antimicrobial activity, the new formulation possesses peculiar features such as residual activity and moisturizing effect. this work identifies a new strategy for hand disinfection.

AB  == in this study, we introduce a methodology for disrupting cell membranes with air  ions coupled with atp bioluminescence detection for real-time monitoring of bioaerosol concentrations. a carbon fiber ionizer was used to extract atp from bacterial cells for generating atp bioluminescence. our methodology was tested using staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli, which were aerosolized with an atomizer, and then indoor bioaerosols were also used for testing the methodology. bioaerosol concentrations were estimated without culturing which requires several days for colony formation. correlation equations were obtained for results acquired using our methodology (relative luminescent unit (rlu)/m(3)) and a culture-based (colony forming unit (cfu)/m(3)) method; cfu/m(3)=1.8 x measured rlu/m(3) for s. epidermidis and e. coli, and cfu/m(3)=1.1 x measured rlu/m(3) for indoor bioaerosols under the experimental conditions. our methodology is an affordable solution for rapidly monitoring bioaerosols due to rapid detection time (cell-lysis time: 3 min; bioluminescence detection time: <1  min) and easy operation.

TI  == health-care associated bacteremia in geriatric cancer patients with febrile neutropenia.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to determine the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and outcome of health-care associated bacteremia in geriatric cancer patients with febrile neutropenia. materials and methods: we retrospectively evaluated cancer patients with febrile neutropenia aged >/=60years with culture proven health-care associated bacteremia between january  2005 and december 2011. the date of the first positive blood culture was regarded as the date of bacteremia onset. primary outcome was the infection related mortality, defined as the death within 14days of bacteremia onset. results: the two most common pathogens responsible for bacteremia were staphylococcus epidermidis (36.1%) and escherichia coli (31.5%), with high rates of methicillin  resistance and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production, respectively.  there were no statistically significant differences in infection related mortality rate according to the type of malignancy (p=0.776). by the univariate analysis, factors associated with 14day mortality among febrile neutropenic episodes were prolonged neutropenia (p=0.024), persistent fever (p=0.001), hospitalization in icu (p<0.001) and the initial clinical presentations including respiratory failure (p<0.001), hepatic failure (p=0.013), hematological failure (p<0.001), neurological failure (p<0.001), severe sepsis (p<0.001), and septic shock (p=0.036). multivariate analysis showed that persistent fever was an independent factor associated with infection related mortality (odds ratio, 18.0; 95% confidence interval, 5.2-62.6; p<0.001). conclusions: the only independent risk factor for mortality was persistent fever. although the most frequently isolated pathogens were s. epidermidis and e. coli, high rates of methicillin resistance and esbl production were found respectively.

TI  == influence of glucosamine on oligochitosan solubility and antibacterial activity.
AB  == light scattering studies indicate that oligochitosan (short-chain chitosan) solutions contain aggregates at ph values below the critical ph of phase separation, while at or above this point the gel phase coexists with the aggregate solution. this work demonstrates for the first time that the presence of d-glucosamine in an oligochitosan solution shifts the critical ph to a higher  value and improves the oligochitosan antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermis in neutral and slightly alkaline aqueous media. by comparing the results of light scattering studies and  antimicrobial assays one can conclude that the antimicrobial activity of oligochitosan is dependent on its unimolecular form, not its supramolecular structures. the widening of the homogeneity region of an oligochitosan solution could lead to promising biomedical applications.

TI  == type i-e crispr-cas systems discriminate target from non-target dna through base  pairing-independent pam recognition.
AB  == discriminating self and non-self is a universal requirement of immune systems. adaptive immune systems in prokaryotes are centered around repetitive loci called crisprs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat), into which invader dna fragments are incorporated. crispr transcripts are processed into small rnas that guide crispr-associated (cas) proteins to invading nucleic acids  by complementary base pairing. however, to avoid autoimmunity it is essential that these rna-guides exclusively target invading dna and not complementary dna sequences (i.e., self-sequences) located in the host's own crispr locus. previous work on the type iii-a crispr system from staphylococcus epidermidis has demonstrated that a portion of the crispr rna-guide sequence is involved in self  versus non-self discrimination. this self-avoidance mechanism relies on sensing base pairing between the rna-guide and sequences flanking the target dna. to determine if the rna-guide participates in self versus non-self discrimination in the type i-e system from escherichia coli we altered base pairing potential between the rna-guide and the flanks of dna targets. here we demonstrate that type i-e systems discriminate self from non-self through a base pairing-independent mechanism that strictly relies on the recognition of four unchangeable pam sequences. in addition, this work reveals that the first base pair between the guide rna and the pam nucleotide immediately flanking the target sequence can be disrupted without affecting the interference phenotype. remarkably, this indicates that base pairing at this position is not involved in  foreign dna recognition. results in this paper reveal that the type i-e mechanism of avoiding self sequences and preventing autoimmunity is fundamentally different from that employed by type iii-a systems. we propose the exclusive targeting of pam-flanked sequences to be termed a target versus non-target discrimination mechanism.

TI  == phagocytosis of neonatal pathogens by peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes  from newborn preterm and term infants.
AB  == background: deficiencies in phagocytosis may contribute to the increased susceptibility of infants to early life infections. data on phagocytosis of the major neonatal pathogens staphylococcus epidermidis (se), staphylococcus aureus (sa), and escherichia coli (ec) by preterm infant leukocytes are inconsistent. methods: cord and <24-h peripheral blood were collected from very preterm (<30.1  wks gestational age (ga)) and term (37-42 wks ga) infants. monocyte and neutrophil phagocytosis of phrodo-labeled se, sa, and ec were analyzed using a small-volume flow cytometry assay, with simultaneous characterization of surface  activation marker expression. results: preterm infants had lower proportions of monocytes and neutrophils capable of phagocytosis than term infants, but preterm  infant phagocytes had higher phagocytic capacity. phagocytosis was strongly correlated between cord and <24-h peripheral blood. supplementation with exogenous complement significantly increased phagocytosis of ec but not of se or  sa. monocyte human leukocyte antigen (hla)-dr expression was lower in preterm infants but did not correlate with phagocytosis. conclusion: there is no defect in phagocytosis by monocytes and neutrophils from preterm compared with term infants, although preterm infants possess fewer phagocytes, possibly contributing to susceptibility to bacterial infection. further investigation into the development of postnatal phagocytic competence is warranted.

AB  == the development of new polymeric materials aimed to control the bacterial biofilm appears to be an important practical approach. the goal of the present study was  to prepare and characterize poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) copolymer (eva) films containing citronellol, eugenol, and linalool and evaluate their efficiency on growth and biofilm formation of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in monospecies and dual species. the results showed that the addition of oil components influenced the elastic modulus (15 % decrease), the tensile stress (30 % decrease), the elongation at break (10 % increase), and the contact angle values (10-20 degrees decrease) while leaving the homogeneity of the surface unaltered. among the polymeric films, eva + citronellol and eva + eugenol at 7 wt% had the best inhibitory effect. after 24-48 h of incubation, eva + citronellol was more effective against the growth (30-60 % reduction) than eva +  eugenol (15-30 % inhibition). however, this inhibition decreased after 240 h of incubation. on the contrary, the biofilm evaluation revealed a strong inhibition  trend also after prolonged incubation time: the amount of biomass per square centimeter formed on copolymer with oil components was significantly less (40-70  % decrease) than that on pure copolymer control for l. monocytogenes, s. aureus,  and e. coli. when polymeric materials were simultaneously inoculated with combinations of s. aureus and e. coli, the biomass accumulated was higher for eva + citronellol and lower for eva + eugenol than that in monoculture biofilm. the findings were similar to the results obtained by 2,3-bis[2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2h-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide assay that measures the metabolic activity of viable cells.

TI  == demonic axe-like conjugated alkynes in combating microbes.
AB  == a new series of disubstituted alkynes was obtained by microwave induced internal  splitting of the corresponding beta-oxo-alkylidenetriphenylphosphoranes. the antimicrobial potential of these conjugated alkynes and phosphoranes was assayed  in vitro against three gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus epidermidis), three gram-negative bacteria (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae) and five fungal strains (aspergillus niger, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, candida rugosa, saccharomyces cerevisiae). the 3-pyridylalkyne derivatives viz., 3-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)propynenitrile (6a), 3-(2-chloropyridin-3-yl)propynenitrile (6b), ethyl 3-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)propiolate (6c), iso-propyl 3-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)propiolate (6d) and 3-(2,6-dichloro-5-fluoropyridin-3-yl)propynenitrile (6e) were found to be highly  potent towards all tested microorganisms except e. coli.

TI  == three different bacterial detection systems for platelet concentrates under inter-laboratory conditions.
AB  == background: a variety of screening methods are currently used worldwide in order  to decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted sepsis and improve the safety of  pcs. methods/materials: pcs inoculated with five different transfusion-relevant species of bacteria at concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 colony-forming units (cfu)ml(-1) were stored at 22 degrees c for 7 days. flow cytometry (facs), bact/alert automated culturing, and a quantitative real-time pcr (q-pcr) were then used to detect the presence of bacteria in samples prepared from these pcs.  results: at the initial spiking concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 cfu ml(-1), q-pcr detected all five bacterial species tested. screening with the bact/alert culture-based system allowed bacterial detection (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 15.13 h for all three spiking concentrations. using facs, positive signals were obtained for all three concentrations of escherichia coli and bacillus cereus on day 1 and for initial spiking concentrations of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus of 1 cfu ml(-1) on day 2. for staphylococcus epidermidis, detection of an initial inoculum of 1 cfu ml(-1) was possible only beginning on day 6. conclusion: this study shows that under standard laboratory conditions the sensitivity of facs in the detection of bacterial contamination of pcs was lower than that of either the bact/alert automated culturing method or q-pcr.

TI  == wall teichoic acid structure governs horizontal gene transfer between major bacterial pathogens.
AB  == mobile genetic elements (mges) encoding virulence and resistance genes are widespread in bacterial pathogens, but it has remained unclear how they occasionally jump to new host species. staphylococcus aureus clones exchange mges such as s. aureus pathogenicity islands (sapis) with high frequency via helper phages. here we report that the s. aureus st395 lineage is refractory to horizontal gene transfer (hgt) with typical s. aureus but exchanges sapis with other species and genera including staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria monocytogenes. st395 produces an unusual wall teichoic acid (wta) resembling that of its hgt partner species. notably, distantly related bacterial species and genera undergo efficient hgt with typical s. aureus upon ectopic expression of s. aureus wta. combined with genomic analyses, these results indicate that a 'glycocode' of wta structures and wta-binding helper phages permits hgt even across long phylogenetic distances thereby shaping the evolution of gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == a ruler protein in a complex for antiviral defense determines the length of small interfering crispr rnas.
AB  == small rnas undergo maturation events that precisely determine the length and structure required for their function. crisprs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) encode small rnas (crrnas) that together with crispr-associated (cas) genes constitute a sequence-specific prokaryotic immune system for anti-viral and anti-plasmid defense. crrnas are subject to multiple processing events during their biogenesis, and little is known about the mechanism of the final maturation step. we show that in the staphylococcus epidermidis type iii crispr-cas system, mature crrnas are measured in a cas10.csm ribonucleoprotein complex to yield discrete lengths that differ by 6-nucleotide increments. we looked for mutants that impact this crrna size pattern and found that an alanine substitution of a conserved aspartate residue of csm3 eliminates  the 6-nucleotide increments in the length of crrnas. in vitro, recombinant csm3 binds rna molecules at multiple sites, producing gel-shift patterns that suggest  that each protein binds 6 nucleotides of substrate. in vivo, changes in the levels of csm3 modulate the crrna size distribution without disrupting the 6-nucleotide periodicity. our data support a model in which multiple csm3 molecules within the cas10.csm complex bind the crrna with a 6-nucleotide periodicity to function as a ruler that measures the extent of crrna maturation.

TI  == rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == this study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (utis). urine samples from patients with utis (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. the urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. bacterial species were identified by a combination of  bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the bact-ist microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. the most common seven species of bacteria in the study included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection"  method using capillary electrophoresis (ce). each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. the mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (r(2)=0.99). the effect of urine composition on ce results was also investigated. the results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (wbcs) and red blood cells (rbcs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. the results demonstrated that the bacteria in  urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using ce. the "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from utis.

TI  == prevention of pacemaker infections with perioperative antimicrobial treatment: an in vitro study.
AB  == aims: the antimicrobial treatment of pacemaker casings with antiseptics (povidone-iodine or octenidine dihydrochloride) or antibiotics (vancomycin, daptomycin, cefuroxime, tazobac, or nebacetin) was analysed in vitro for its biocompatibility and efficacy in preventing the bacterial adhesion of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli to cardiac-implantable electrophysiological devices (cieds). methods and results: titan platelets (0.4 cm&sup2;) cut from pacemaker casings were impregnated with seven different antimicrobial solutions: two antiseptics and five antibiotics. subsequently, they were challenged with bacterial contamination by four test strains over a 24 h incubation period. bacterial adherence was quantified using the colony-forming-unit method after cell recovery with sonication and examined with confocal laser scanning electron microscopy. simultaneously, the biocompatibility of the antimicrobial impregnation was assessed using pre-treated titan platelets in a culture of human fibroblasts, skeletal myoblasts, and microvascular endothelial cells. after a 48 h incubation, cell vitality was measured using the 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2h/tetrazoliu m monosodium (wst-8) assay. the immersion of pacemaker casings in antiseptic or antibiotic solutions applies an antimicrobial coating that can significantly reduce bacterial adhesion. the studied impregnations differed in their antimicrobial efficacy and toxicity. conclusion: compared with the two antiseptics and the other tested antibiotics, nebacetin showed the best ratio of  efficacy to toxicity. nebacetin showed good in vitro antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens without impairing human cell vitality. it is a safe and effective candidate for cied impregnation.

TI  == enhanced antimicrobial activity of peptide-cocktails against common bacterial contaminants of ex vivo stored platelets.
AB  == bacterial contamination of blood components such as ex vivo-stored platelets is a major safety risk in transfusion medicine. we have recently shown that synthetic  antimicrobial peptides named pd1-pd4 derived from the thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins, and repeats of arg-trp (rw1-rw5) demonstrate microbicidal activity against selected bacteria and viruses. in the present study, we selected pd3, pd4, rw2, rw3 and rw4 and evaluated each individual peptide and their various combinations to see whether the cocktail regimen enhances the antimicrobial activity above and over the individual peptides. stored platelet or plasma samples spiked with known titres of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus cereus were treated with either individual peptides or with peptides in various combinations. analyses revealed that individual peptides show moderate microbicidal activity (10- to 100-fold reduction) against the tested bacteria relative to their combined regimen. the peptide combinations (rw2 + rw4, rw2 + rw3 + rw4 and pd4 + rw3 + rw4) on the other hand enhanced the microbicidal activity (c.10 000-fold reduction) and revealed a minimal inhibitory concentration of 5 mum. time-kill kinetics indicated that these three peptide combinations exhibited enhanced antimicrobial  activity bringing about a 100-fold reduction of bacterial titres within 20 min of incubation. the present study therefore demonstrates the synergistic effect of antimicrobial peptides when used in combinations and provides a proof-of-concept  of its potential application as a molecular tool towards pathogen reduction and further extends the possibility of using peptide combinatorial therapeutics as broad-spectrum antibiotics or as alternatives to combat drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == r-thanatin inhibits growth and biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis in vivo and in vitro.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the most frequent causes of device-associated infections, because it is known to cause biofilms that grow on  catheters or other surgical implants. the persistent increasing resistance of s.  epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) has driven the need for newer antibacterial agents with innovative therapeutic strategies. thanatin is reported to display potent antibiotic activities, especially against extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. the present study aimed to investigate whether a shorter derivative peptide (r-thanatin) could be used as a novel antibacterial agent. we found that r-thanatin was highly potent in vitro against coagulase-negative staphylococci, such as s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, and s. hominis, and inhibited biofilm formation at subinhibitory concentrations. properties of little toxicity to human red blood cells (hrbcs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, a low incidence of resistance, and relatively high stability in plasma were confirmed. excellent in vivo protective  effects were also observed using a methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse)-induced urinary tract infection rat model. electron microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy analyses suggested that r-thanatin disturbed cell division of mrse severely, which might be the reason for inhibition of mrse  growth. these findings indicate that r-thanatin is active against the growth and  biofilm formation of mrse in vitro and in vivo. r-thanatin might be considered as a specific drug candidate for treating cons infections.

TI  == surface self-assembled pegylation of fluoro-based pvdf membranes via hydrophobic-driven copolymer anchoring for ultra-stable biofouling resistance.
AB  == stable biofouling resistance is significant for general filtration requirements,  especially for the improvement of membrane lifetime. a systematic group of hyper-brush pegylated diblock copolymers containing poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (pegma) and polystyrene (ps) was synthesized using an atom transfer  radical polymerization (atrp) method and varying pegma lengths. this study demonstrates the antibiofouling membrane surfaces by self-assembled anchoring pegylated diblock copolymers of ps-b-pegma on the microporous poly(vinylidene fluoride) (pvdf) membrane. two types of copolymers are used to modify the pvdf surface, one with different ps/pegma molar ratios in a range from 0.3 to 2.7 but  the same ps molecular weights (mws, approximately 5.7 kda), the other with different copolymer mws ( approximately 11.4, 19.9, and 34.1 kda) but the similar ps/pegma ratio ( approximately 1.7 +/- 0.2). it was found that the adsorption capacities of diblock copolymers on pvdf membranes decreased as molar mass ratios of ps/pegma ratio reduced or molecular weights of ps-b-pegma increased because of steric hindrance. the increase in styrene content in copolymer enhanced the stability of polymer anchoring on the membrane, and the increase in pegma content enhanced the protein resistance of membranes. the optimum ps/pegma ratio was found to be in the range between 1.5 and 2.0 with copolymer mws above 20.0 kda for the ultrastable resistance of protein adsorption on the pegylated pvdf membranes. the pvdf membrane coated with such a diblock copolymer owned excellent biofouling resistance to proteins of bsa and lysozyme as well as bacterium of escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis and high stable microfiltration operated with domestic wastewater solution in a membrane bioreactor.

TI  == membrane perturbation action mode and structure-activity relationships of protonectin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the venom of the neotropical social wasp agelaia pallipes pallipes.
AB  == with the extensive use of antibiotics, multidrug-resistant bacteria emerge frequently. new antimicrobial agents with novel modes of action are urgently needed. it is now widely accepted that antimicrobial peptides (amps) could be promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. in this study, we aimed to study the antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of protonectin, a cationic peptide from the venom of the neotropical social wasp agelaia pallipes pallipes. we demonstrated that protonectin exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against a spectrum of bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains. to further understand this mechanism, the structural features of protonectin and its analogs were studied by circular dichroism (cd). the cd spectra demonstrated that protonectin and its natural analog polybia-cp formed a typical alpha-helical conformation in the membrane-mimicking environment, while its proline-substituted analog had much lower or even no alpha-helix conformation. molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the alpha-helical conformation in the membrane is required for the exhibition of antibacterial activity. in conclusion, protonectin exhibits potent antimicrobial activity by disruption of the integrity of the bacterial membrane, and its alpha-helical confirmation in the membrane is essential for this action.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly lucilia cuprina.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly lucilia sericata (meigen) (diptera:calliphoridae) against bacteria. however, the antibacterial activity of  its sibling species, lucilia cuprina (wiedemann) (diptera:calliphoridae) against  a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. the aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of l. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). the turbidimetric assay demonstrated that l. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (p < 0.001). additionally, colony-forming unit (cfu), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against p. aeruginosa. the reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. these observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.

TI  == effects of shear on initial bacterial attachment in slow flowing systems.
AB  == initial bacterial attachment, likely affected by local shear, could influence biofilm formation. however, there are contradictory reports for the shear effects on attachment of different bacteria onto different surfaces. in this study, four  bacteria, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, and escherichia coli, were examined for their attachment to glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane (ots) modified glass under different shears. polystyrene particles were used to verify that their shear dependent attachment on glass and  ots could be interpreted using an analysis based on the extended derjaguin-landau-verwey-overbeek (xdlvo) theory. in particular, the critical shear force (f(c-shear)) could correlate with the maximum attractive force (f(max)(xdlvo)) toward the secondary energy minimum as f(c-shear)=cf(max)(xdlvo). for these particles, c of ~1 was obtained, the value was within the coefficient range (0.1-1) of substances sliding over glass. for s. epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa on glass, c was 0.3, <0.6 and 0.2, respectively. when considering potential protein adsorption on ots during bacterial attachment, c of these species on ots was slightly above 1. a greatly enhanced attachment of p. aeruginosa on ots was also observed, probably due to the presence of flagella. for p. putida, the attachment first decreased slightly or maintained with shear and then increased. such behaviors were probably caused by the increased secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) at higher shears by p. putida. the results from this study suggested that, without complications from surface features/eps, the analysis based on the xdlvo theory could provide a basis for understanding shear effect on initial bacterial attachment.

AB  == vancomycin functionalized silver nanorod arrays substrates were used to obtain the surface enhanced raman scattering (sers) signals of six foodborne pathogenic  bacteria in mung bean sprouts samples using both a portable and a handheld raman  system. the silver nanorod arrays substrates were optimized to facilitate quantitative, rapid, and sensitive detection of salmonella enterica serotype anatum, salmonella enterica serotype cubana, salmonella enterica serotype stanley, salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli o157:h7, and staphylococcus epidermidis. substrate optimization was achieved by varying the nanorod length and vancomycin incubation concentration. by combining these substrates with a two-step filtration process we found that the foodborne pathogenic bacteria used  in this study can be identified in mung bean sprouts with a limit of detection as low as 100 cfu ml(-1) in less than 4 h using both portable and handheld raman systems. the results show that sers spectra can be used to differentiate between  bacterial species and serotypes when chemometric methods are employed. the low detection limit and rapid detection time of this biosensing platform for foodborne pathogenic bacteria could be a valuable field detection method for the  fresh produce and food processing industries.

TI  == antibiotic selection for the treatment of infectious complications of implant-based breast reconstruction.
AB  == background: infection requiring explantation remains the most devastating complication associated with implant-based breast reconstruction. there are many  treatment algorithms to prevent reconstructive failure in face of infection using both oral and intravenous antibiotics. in the absence of patient-specific culture data, antibiotic selection is generally directed toward broad-spectrum coverage based on historical data. we hypothesize that reviewing our institution's microbiology data obtained from explanted implant-based breast reconstructions would provide a rational basis for antibiotic selection in the future. methods: a retrospective review of 902 consecutive immediate implant-based breast reconstructions at a single institution from november 2007 to may 2011 was conducted. implant reconstructions requiring explantation or drainage by interventional radiology were identified. patient demographics, implant characteristics, presence of skin necrosis, microbiological data, and outcomes were reviewed. results: forty-three (4.76%) implant reconstructions requiring explantation or drainage by interventional radiology met the inclusion criteria for this study. five patients (11.6%) had round, smooth silicone implants, and 36 (88.4%) had textured tissue expanders. twenty-six implants were explanted because of infection; 3, because of exposure from skin necrosis; and 11, because of the combination of flap necrosis and infection; and 1, secondarily because of cancer  invasion into the skin. reconstruction was salvaged in 21 breasts (51.2%): 12 (57.1%) by implant reconstruction, 5 (23.8%) by pedicled latissimus dorsi flaps,  and 4 (19.1%) with a microvascular free flap. thirty explants had microbiology data available. the most common organism isolated was staphylococcus epidermidis  (10), followed by methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (5), serratia marcescens (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), enterococcus (3), escherichia coli (2), enterobacter (2), group b streptococcus (1), and morganella morganii (1). forty percent of the organisms were resistant to cefazolin; however, 86% were sensitive to gentamicin, 80% were sensitive to levaquin, and 63% were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. conclusions: infection associated with implant-based breast reconstructions continues to threaten explantation and reconstructive failure. based on our microbiological data, initial cellulitis amenable to oral antibiotics should be treated with oral fluoroquinolones as a first-line treatment. if this regimen fails, intravenous imipenem or gentamicin and vancomycin should be initiated. obviously, clinical judgment regarding specific patient risk factors and compliance should play a role in decision making, but these data provide an evidence-based rationale for first-line oral antibiotic selection.

AB  == purpose of the study: prosthetic joint infection is a feared complication in total hip arthroplasty. the use of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement is the important part of preventive and therapeutic strategies. at present a number of commercial bone cements are available and support of their use by the results of  experimental trials and clinical studies has varied. in relation to this issue we studied essential microbiological and pharmacological characteristics of vancogenx in comparison with gentamicin-loaded bone cement used conventionally. material and methods: based on a previously described protocol, we tested pellets of four commercial bone cements, namely, hi-fatigue g, palacos r+g, vancogenx, and palacos r as a control. bone cement was prepared in a vacuum-mixing system. the strains used for bacterial load included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. each cement was tested for its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities and the results were evaluated by standard methods. in addition, we investigated time-related release of gentamicin and vancomycin from the bone cements tested. results: all antibiotic-loaded cement pellets were able to prevent growth of the bacterial strains tested. the bactericidal effect lasted for several days in relation to the bacterial species and cement used, with the exception of s. epidermidis whose growth was inhibited by gentamicin-loaded cement only for one day. the antibiotic-loaded pellets also prevented the formation of a biofilm for 24 hours at least. the major amount of vancomycin (32.915 mg/l) was released from vancogenx to mh medium within 24 hours and the last measureable amount (4.327 mg/l) was recorded at 48 hours after the start of  the experiment. in physiological saline the highest level of vancomycin was 139.852 mg/ml measured at 24 hours, and the antibiotic was detectable at a level  of 2.334 mg/ml as late as 8 days after the experiment started. release of gentamicin from vancogenx was as follows: the 24-hour level was higher in mh medium than physiological saline (178 versus 131.4 mg/ml); however, gentamicin was still detectable in physiological saline at 192 hours after the start of the  experiment while no gentamicin was found in mh medium after 72 hours. discussion: the antimicrobial effect of vancogenx bone cement was not an unexpected finding since both gentamicin and vancomycin have been used with bone cement for a long time and their combination is optimal in terms of preventing prosthetic joint infection. however, there is a disputable issue of poor release of vancomycin from bone cement. in mh medium we were able to detect the vancomycin released from vancogenx only for two days after the initial rapid elution while its release into physiological saline seemed to be slower but much longer. it is possible that more vancomycin is released from bone cement, but this amount is immediately bound to proteins in the cement vicinity and this process is not detectable by any analytical method. conclusions: the bone cement vancogenx showed excellent antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties and can be recommended  for use in orthopaedic practice. therapy of prosthetic joint infection is the main indication. extension of the indication to the prevention of prosthetic joint infection in high-risk patients should be preceded by biomechanical studies demonstrating that the cement is appropriate for long-term implant fixation.

AB  == prevention and management of wound infections receive a lot of attention, since the presence of micro-organisms interferes with the wound-healing process. the aim of this work was to use cyclodextrins (cds) to endow hydrogels and gauzes with the ability to take up antiseptics and sustain their delivery for several hours. benzalkonium chloride (bzcl) can form inclusion complexes with cross-linked cds that regulate the release through an affinity-driven mechanism.  grafting of cds to cotton gauzes using citric acid as the linker, at 190 degrees  c and for 15 min, led to grafting yields of about 148%, much larger than those obtained at 180 degrees c or with shorter reaction times. microbiological tests revealed that the bzcl-loaded networks can inhibit the growth of staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli both on agar plates and in liquid medium. furthermore, the antiseptic-loaded gauzes were able to inhibit biofilm formation  by staphylococcus aureus rn1hg pmv158gfp when applied in early stages of biofilm  formation and could reduce the number of living cells in preformed biofilms grown in a chronic wound biofilm model. these findings highlight the role of cds as main components of hydrogels and gauzes for the efficient delivery of antiseptics.

TI  == infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  == the present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. the waste  was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in penang island, malaysia. the presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste  was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. the presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rdna analysis. in this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, lysinibacillus sphaericus, serratia marcescens, and staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. the present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or  either of the clinical wastes.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a new preservative for multiuse ophthalmic solutions.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and the  preservative efficacy of a novel preservative solution containing sodium hydroxymethyl glycinate (shmg) and edetate disodium (edta), which is used for preservation of some commercial ophthalmic formulations. methods: in vitro susceptibility assays were performed against several gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria representative of the microbial flora of epithelial surfaces or colonizing the conjunctiva, as well as against candida albicans and aspergillus niger. using different concentrations of shmg alone or in combination with edta, the minimal inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations against these organisms were assessed. in addition, 8 brands of multidose eye drops containing 0.002% shmg and 0.1% edta as preservative were tested for antimicrobial activity using the antimicrobial effectiveness test recommended by the international pharmacopoeias. results: the  minimal inhibitory and bactericidal/fungicidal concentration values of shmg ranged from 0.0025% to 0.0125% for bacteria and from 0.125% to 0.50% for mold and yeast. susceptibility testing demonstrated that the addition of edta substantially increased the shmg activity against all bacterial and fungal strains. the preservative effectiveness test was applied to commercial eye drops. all the drop solutions met the criteria reported by the u.s. pharmacopeia for parenteral and ophthalmic preparations. all products also satisfied the major acceptance criteria of the european pharmacopeia with respect to the antifungal activity. with regard to the antibacterial activity, the less-stringent criteria  of the european pharmacopeia were fulfilled. conclusions: the present study demonstrates the efficacy of a novel preservative for ophthalmic solutions (shmg/edta) and its activity in protecting selected commercial artificial tears against microbial contamination.

TI  == tandem multicomponent reactions toward the design and synthesis of novel antibacterial and cytotoxic motifs.
AB  == the synthesis of polysubstituted imidazopyridines and imidazopyrazines through the orthogonal union of groebke-blackburn and ugi reactions is described. these motifs were produced efficiently in a tandem operation without intermediate isolation. the synthesized scaffolds were biologically evaluated and found to possess potent anticancer and anti bacterial activities. importantly, some of these motifs (e.g. compound 5) were found to possess specific anti-breast cancer  activity against mcf7 cell line and others (e.g. compound 15) possess specific effects against melanoma cancer cell line (m8). interestingly, the introduction of imidazobenzothiazole framework produced compounds with potent anti cancer activities (e.g. compounds 29 and 33) in vitro. interestingly, many of synthesized compounds displayed potent and broad spectrum antibacterial activity  against hospital-resistant clinical isolates namely, escherichia coli, klebsiellapneuomoniae, staph. epidermidis, ps. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris. furthermore, many of the synthesized motifs were found to effective against gram  positive methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mmsa; atcc 25923), andmethicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; atcc 35591). these findings, however, form the foundation for further investigation in our continuing efforts to develop selective anticancer and antibacterial agents.

TI  == bacterial growth in red blood cell units exposed to uncontrolled temperatures: challenging the 30-minute rule.
AB  == background and objectives: the '30-min rule' requires discarding red blood cells  (rbcs) exposed to uncontrolled temperatures for >30 min to ensure safe rbc transfusion. this study was aimed at determining whether multiple room temperature (rt) exposures promote bacterial growth. materials and methods: pooled and split rbc units were inoculated with ~1 cfu/ml of serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli or staphylococcus epidermidis. control  units remained in storage, while test units were exposed to rt for six 30-min or  three 60-min intervals. bacterial concentrations and endotoxin levels were determined after each exposure and at 42 days of storage. rbc core temperature and rt were monitored in mock units with escort ilog temperature loggers. a mixed model was used for statistical analyses. results: red blood cell core temperature reached 10.7 +/- 0.4 degrees c and 14.2 +/- 0.2 degrees c during 30- and 60-min exposures, respectively. staphylococcus epidermidis and e. coli did not grow in either control or exposed rbcs. yersinia enterocolitica concentration and endotoxin levels were similar in both control and test units. serratia marcescens concentration and endotoxin levels were higher in exposed units; however, differences between units exposed for 30 min or 60 min were not observed. conclusion: there is no added risk to rbc safety by increasing rt exposures to 60 min with each removal from storage for up to a total of 3 h during rbc shelf life. therefore, extending the 30-min limitation in rbcs exposed to uncontrolled  temperatures to 60 min should be considered by regulatory agencies.

AB  == objective: to investigate the epidemiology and antibiotic resistance of isolates  from hospitalized patients with hematological disease from 2005 to 2011. methods: a total of 1453 bacterial strains were isolated from patients with hematological  disease from january 2005 to december 2011. antimicrobial susceptibility testing  was performed by micro-dilution method. results: (1) the majority of the bacterial strains were respiratory passage examples (57.5%). the portage of blood examples in our division (13.60%) was higher than of whole hospital (6.26%), with lower positive rate of bacterial culture (52.37%) than of whole hospital (60.24%). chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis was the main reason for hospital infection. 578 (39.8%) bacterial strains were gram positive, and 875 (60.2%) gram negative bacillus. staphylococcus epidermidis strains and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. (2) methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) accounted for 72.8% antibiotic resistance. detection rates of esbls in escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were 18.9% and 10.4%, respectively. (3) no obvious changes of antimicrobial resistances of staphylococcus and enterococcus were observed during these years. the enterobacteriaceae strains showed lowest resistance rates to carbapenems, next to cefoperazone/sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam. but the resistance rates of escherichia coli to cefepime and ceftazidime were gradually increasing during the past years. pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii of glucose nonfermenters showed lowest resistance rates to cefoperazone/sulbactam, but the resistance rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa to carbapenems increased. conclusions: escherichia coli was the highest in quantity of gram negative bacillus and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. the resistance rates of escherichia coli to cefepime  and ceftazidime, pseudomonas aeruginosa to carbapenems were gradually increasing  in the past years.

TI  == biofilm formation by clinical isolates and the implications in chronic infections.
AB  == background: biofilm formation is a major virulence factor contributing to the chronicity of infections. to date few studies have evaluated biofilm formation in infecting isolates of patients including both gram-positive and gram-negative multidrug-resistant (mdr) species in the context of numerous types of infectious  syndromes. herein, we investigated the biofilm forming capacity in a large collection of single patient infecting isolates and compared the relationship between biofilm formation to various strain characteristics. methods: the biofilm-forming capacity of 205 randomly sampled clinical isolates from patients, collected from various anatomical sites, admitted for treatment at brooke army medical center (bamc) from 2004-2011, including methicillin-resistant/methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mrsa/mssa) (n=23), acinetobacter baumannii (n=53), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=36), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=54), and escherichia coli (n=39), were evaluated for biofilm formation using the high-throughput microtiter plate assay and scanning electron microscopy (sem). relationships between biofilm formation to clonal type, site of isolate collection, and mdr phenotype were evaluated. furthermore, in patients with relapsing infections, serial strains were assessed for their ability to form biofilms in vitro. results: of the 205 clinical isolates tested, 126 strains (61.4%) were observed to form biofilms in vitro at levels greater than or equal to the staphylococcus epidermidis, positive biofilm producing strain, with p. aeruginosa and s. aureus having the greatest number of biofilm producing strains. biofilm formation was significantly associated with specific clonal types, the site of isolate collection, and strains positive for biofilm formation were more  frequently observed to be mdr. in patients with relapsing infections, the majority of serial isolates recovered from these individuals were observed to be  strong biofilm producers in vitro. conclusions: this study is the first to evaluate biofilm formation in a large collection of infecting clinical isolates representing diverse types of infections. our results demonstrate: (1) biofilm formation is a heterogeneous property amongst clinical strains which is associated with certain clonal types, (2) biofilm forming strains are more frequently isolated from non-fluid tissues, in particular bone and soft tissues,  (3) mdr pathogens are more often biofilm formers, and (4) strains from patients with persistent infections are positive for biofilm formation.

TI  == antimicrobial durability of air filters coated with airborne sophora flavescens nanoparticles.
AB  == airborne biological particles containing viruses, bacteria, and/or fungi can be toxic and cause infections and allergy symptoms. recently, natural materials such as tea tree oil and sophora flavescens have shown promising antimicrobial activity when applied as air filter media. although many of these studies demonstrated excellent antimicrobial efficacy, only a few of them considered external environmental effects such as the surrounding humidity, temperature, and natural degradation of chemicals, all of which can affect the antimicrobial performance of these natural materials. in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial durability of air filters containing airborne nanoparticles from s. flavescens for 5 months. antimicrobial tests and quantitative chemical analyses were performed every 30 days. morphological changes in the nanoparticles were also evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. the major antimicrobial compounds remained stable and active for ~90 days at room temperature. after about 90 days, the quantities of major antimicrobial compounds decreased noticeably with a consequent decrease in antimicrobial activity. these results are promising for the implementation of new technologies using natural antimicrobial products and provide useful information regarding the average life expectancy of antimicrobial filters using nanoparticles of s. flavescens.

TI  == photoinactivation of gram positive and gram negative bacteria with the antimicrobial peptide (klaklak)(2) conjugated to the hydrophilic photosensitizer  eosin y.
AB  == we test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial peptide (klaklak)(2) enhances the photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer eosin y upon conjugation. the conjugate eosin-(klaklak)(2) was obtained by solid-phase peptide synthesis. photoinactivation assays were performed against the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli , pseudomonas aeruginosa , and multidrug resistant acinetobacter baumannii aye, as well as the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus , and  staphylococcus epidermidis . partitioning assays were performed with e. coli and  s. aureus . photohemolysis and photokilling assays were also performed to assess  the photodynamic activity of the conjugate toward mammalian cells. eosin-(klaklak)(2) photoinactivates 99.999% of 10(8) cfu/ml of most bacteria tested at a concentration of 1 mum or below. in contrast, neither eosin y nor (klaklak)(2) cause any significant photoinactivation under similar conditions. the increase in photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer conferred by the antimicrobial peptide is in part due to the fact that (klaklak)(2) promotes the association of eosin y to bacteria. eosin-(klaklak)(2) does not significantly associate with red blood cells or the cultured mammalian cell lines hacat, cos-7, and colo 316. consequently, little photodamage or photokilling is observed with these cells under conditions for which bacterial photoinactivation is achieved. the peptide (klaklak)(2) therefore significantly enhances the photodynamic activity of eosin y toward both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria while interacting minimally with human cells. overall, our results suggest that antimicrobial peptides such as (klaklak)(2) might serve as attractive agents that can target photosensitizers to bacteria specifically.

AB  == a multiscale investigation was carried out to study the dark and light-enhanced bactericidal mechanisms of poly(phenylene ethynylene) (ppe)-based cationic conjugated polyelectrolytes (cpes) and oligo-phenylene ethynylenes (opes). on the morphological scale, gram-negative e. coli cells exposed to cpe and ope compounds in the dark show damage to the cell envelope, plasma membrane, and in some cases  the cytoplasm, while with uv-irradiation, e. coli sustained catastrophic damages  to both the cell envelope and cytoplasm. in contrast, the gram-positive s. epi bacteria appeared intact when exposed to cpe and ope compounds in the dark but showed damages to the cell envelope with uv-irradiation. to better understand the molecular basis of cpe- and ope-induced morphological changes and damages to bacteria, we investigated the effect of these compounds on model bacterial plasma membrane and bacterial proteins and plasmid dna. measurements of dark membrane perturbation activity of the cpes and opes using model lipid membranes support a  carpet or detergent-like mechanism by which the antimicrobial compounds induce membrane collapse and phase transitions. under uv-irradiation, e. coli bacteria exposed to cpes and opes showed covalent modifications and damages to both cellular protein and plasmid dna, likely through oxidative pathways mediated by singlet oxygen and subsequent reactive oxygen species sensitized by the cpe and ope compounds. our finding thus show that the antimicrobial polymers and oligomers exert toxicity toward gram-negative bacteria by disrupting the morphology and structures of cell envelope and cytoplasm, including cellular components such as proteins and dna, while exert toxicity toward gram-positive bacteria by binding to and disrupting just the cell wall.

TI  == evaluation of biocidal efficacy of copper alloy coatings in comparison with solid metal surfaces: generation of organic copper phosphate nanoflowers.
AB  == aims: to analyse the biocidal efficacy of thermal sprayed copper surfaces. methods and results: copper alloy sheet metals containing >60% copper have been shown to exhibit potent biocidal activity. surface biocidal activity was assessed by epifluorescence microscopy. after 2-h exposure at 20 degrees c in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), contact killing of gram-negative escherichia coli and gram-positive staphylococcus epidermidis by brass sheet metal and phosphor bronze was 3-4-times higher than that by stainless steel. sem observations revealed that the surface membranes of both bacterial strains were slightly more irregular when exposed to brass sheet metal than stainless steel. however, when exposed to phosphor bronze coating, e. coli were 3-4 times larger with irregular membrane morphology. in addition, the majority of the cells were associated with spherical carbon-copper-phosphate crystalline nanostructures characteristic of nanoflowers. the membranes of many of the s. epidermidis exhibited blebbing, and a small subset was also associated with nanoflowers. conclusions: our data indicate that increasing the surface roughness of copper alloys had a pronounced impact on the membrane integrity of gram-positive and, to a lesser degree, gram-negative bacteria. in the presence of pbs, carbon-copper-phosphate-containing nanoflowers were formed, likely nucleated by components derived from killed bacteria. the intimate association of the bacteria with the nanoflowers and phosphor bronze coating likely contributed to their nonreversible adhesion. significance and impact of the study: thermal spraying of copper alloys provides a strategy for the rapid coating of three-dimensional organic and inorganic surfaces with biocidal copper alloys. our study demonstrates that the macroscale surface roughness generated by the thermal spray process enhances the biocidal activity of copper alloys compared with the nanoscale surface roughness of copper sheet metals. moreover, the coating surface topography provides conditions for the rapid formation of organic copper phosphate nanocrystals/nanoflowers.

TI  == effect of rhamnolipids on initial attachment of bacteria on glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane-modified glass.
AB  == bacterial attachment on solid surfaces has various implications in environmental, industrial and medical applications. in this study, the effects of rhamnolipid biosurfactants on initial attachment of bacteria on hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane (ots) modified glass were evaluated under continuous-flow conditions. the bacteria investigated were three gram-negative species pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, and escherichia coli, and two gram-positive species staphylcoccus epidermidis and bacillus subtilis. rhamnolipids, at 10 and 200 mg/l, significantly reduced the attachment of all but s. epidermidis on both glass and ots-modified glass. for s. epidermidis rhamnolipids reduced the attachment on ots-modified glass but not on glass. studies were further done to identify the mechanism(s) by which rhamnolipids reduced the cell attachment. the following potential properties of rhamnolipids were investigated: inhibition of microbial growth, change of cell surface hydrophobicity, easier detachment of cells already attached to substratum, and modification of substratum surface properties. results showed that rhamnolipids were ineffective for the latter two effects. rhamnolipids, up to 200mg/l, inhibited the growth of b. subtilis, s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa pao1 but not the growth of e. coli, p. putida and p. aeruginosa e0340. also, rhamnolipids  tended to increase the hydrophobicity of p. aeruginosa pao1 and e. coli, decrease the hydrophobicity of p. putida and s. epidermidis, and have no clear effect on the hydrophobicity of b. subtillis. these trends however did not correlate with the observed trend of cell attachment reduction. the responsible mechanism(s) remained unknown.

TI  == microbiology of explanted suture segments from infected and noninfected surgical  patients.
AB  == sutures under selective host/environmental factors can potentiate postoperative surgical site infection (ssi). the present investigation characterized microbial  recovery and biofilm formation from explanted absorbable (ab) and nonabsorbable (nab) sutures from infected and noninfected sites. ab and nab sutures were harvested from noninfected (70.9%) and infected (29.1%) sites in 158 patients. at explantation, devices were sonicated and processed for qualitative/quantitative bacteriology; selective sutures were processed for scanning electron microscopy (sem). bacteria were recovered from 85 (53.8%) explanted sites; 39 sites were noninfected, and 46 were infected. suture recovery ranged from 11.1 to 574.6 days postinsertion. a significant difference in mean microbial recovery between noninfected (1.2 isolates) and infected (2.7 isolates) devices (p < 0.05) was noted. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia spp. were recovered from infected devices, while commensal skin flora was recovered from noninfected  devices. no significant difference in quantitative microbial recovery between infected monofilament and multifilament sutures was noted. biofilm was present in 100% and 66.6% of infected and noninfected devices, respectively (p < 0.042). we  conclude that both monofilament and braided sutures provide a hospitable surface  for microbial adherence: (i) a significant difference in microbial recovery from  infected and noninfected sutures was noted, (ii) infected sutures harbored a mixed flora, including multidrug-resistant health care-associated pathogens, and  (iii) a significant difference in the presence or absence of a biofilm in infected versus noninfected explanted devices was noted. further studies to document the benefit of focused risk reduction strategies to minimize suture contamination and biofilm formation postimplantation are warranted.

TI  == wound repair and anti-inflammatory potential of lonicera japonica in excision wound-induced rats.
AB  == background: lonicera japonica thunb. (caprifoliaceae), a widely used traditional  chinese medicinal plant, is used to treat some infectious diseases and it may have uses as a healthy food and applications in cosmetics and as an ornamental groundcover. the ethanol extract of the flowering aerial parts of l. japonica (ljee) was investigated for its healing efficiency in a rat excision wound model. methods: excision wounds were inflicted upon three groups of eight rats each. healing was assessed by the rate of wound contraction in skin wound sites in rats treated with simple ointment base, 10% (w/w) ljee ointment, or the reference standard drug, 0.2% (w/w) nitrofurazone ointment. the effects of ljee on the contents of hydroxyproline and hexosamine during healing were estimated. the antimicrobial activity of ljee against microorganisms was also assessed. the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of ljee was investigated to understand the mechanism of wound healing. results: ljee exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, candida albicans, and candida tropicalis. the ointment formulation prepared with 10% (w/w) ljee exhibited potent wound healing capacity as evidenced by the wound contraction in the excision wound model. the contents of hydroxyproline and hexosamine also correlated with the observed healing pattern. these findings were supported by the histopathological characteristics of healed wound sections, as greater tissue regeneration, more fibroblasts, and angiogenesis were observed in  the 10% (w/w) ljee ointment-treated group. the results also indicated that ljee possesses potent anti-inflammatory activity, as it enhanced the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines that suppress proinflammatory cytokine production. conclusions: the results suggest that the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of ljee act synergistically to accelerate wound repair.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of blended essential oil preparation.
AB  == antimicrobial activities of two blended essential oil preparations comprising lavender oil, petigrain oil, clary sage oil, ylang ylang oil and jasmine oil were evaluated against various pathogenic microorganisms. both preparations showed antimicrobial activity in the agar disc diffusion assay against the gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus atcc6538 and s. epidermidis isolated strain, the  fungus, candida albicans atcc10231, and the gram-negative bacterium, escherichia  coli atcc25922, but showed no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc9027. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of these preparations was evaluated. by the broth microdilution assay, preparation 1, comprising lavender oil, clary sage oil, and ylang ylang oil (volume ratio 3:4:3), exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity than preparation 2, which was composed of petigrain oil, clary sage oil, and jasmine oil (volume ratio 3:4:3). moreover, the sum of the fractional inhibitory concentrations (sigma fic) of preparation 1 expressed a synergistic antimicrobial effect against the tested microorganisms (sigma fic<l). the blended essential oil preparations, characterized for their components by gc/ms, contained linalyl acetate, and linalool as major components. our experiments showed that the differential antimicrobial effect of either blended oil preparations or single/pure essential oils may be influenced by the amount of linalool and linalyl acetate, and the number of active components in either the blended preparations or single/pure essential oils. in addition, blended oil preparations expressed synergistic antimicrobial effect by the accumulation of active components such as linalool and linalyl acetate and combining active constituents of more than one oil.

TI  == a novel role for lipid droplets in the organismal antibacterial response.
AB  == we previously discovered histones bound to cytosolic lipid droplets (lds); here we show that this forms a cellular antibacterial defense system. sequestered on droplets under normal conditions, in the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) or lipoteichoic acid (lta), histones are released from the droplets and kill bacteria efficiently in vitro. droplet-bound histones also function in vivo: when injected into drosophila embryos lacking droplet-bound histones, bacteria grow rapidly. in contrast, bacteria injected into embryos with droplet-bound histones die. embryos with droplet-bound histones displayed more than a fourfold  survival advantage when challenged with four different bacterial species. our data suggests that this intracellular antibacterial defense system may function in adult flies, and also potentially in mice.doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.00003.001.

TI  == a novel synthetic peptide from a tomato defensin exhibits antibacterial activities against helicobacter pylori.
AB  == defensins are a class of cysteine-rich proteins, which exert broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. in this work, we used a bioinformatic approach to identify putative defensins in the tomato genome. fifteen proteins had a mature peptide that includes the well-conserved tetradisulfide array. we selected a representative member of the tomato defensin family; we chemically synthesized its gamma-motif and tested its antimicrobial activity. here, we demonstrate that  the synthetic peptide exhibits potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus a170, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes, and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi, escherichia coli, and helicobacter pylori. in addition, the synthetic peptide shows minimal (<5%) hemolytic activity and absence of cytotoxic effects against thp-1 cells. finally, solyc exerts an anti-inflammatory activity in vitro, as it downregulates the level of the proinflammatory cytokines tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma.

TI  == surface modification of silicone for biomedical applications requiring long-term  antibacterial, antifouling, and hemocompatible properties.
AB  == silicone has been used for peritoneal dialysis (pd) catheters for several decades. however, bacteria, platelets, proteins, and other biomolecules tend to adhere to its hydrophobic surface, which may lead to pd outflow failure, serious  infection, or even death. in this work, a cross-linked poly(poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate) (p(pegdma)) polymer layer was covalently grafted on medical-grade silicone surface to improve its antibacterial and antifouling properties. the p(pegdma)-grafted silicone (silicone-g-p(pegdma)) substrate reduced the adhesion  of staphylococcus aureus , escherichia coli , and staphylococcus epidermidis , as well as 3t3 fibroblast cells by >/=90%. the antibacterial and antifouling properties were preserved after the modified substrate was aged for 30 days in phosphate buffer saline. further immobilization of a polysulfobetaine polymer, poly((2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl)ammonium hydroxide) (p(dmaps)), on the silicone-g-p(pegdma) substrate via thiol-ene click reaction leads to enhanced antifouling efficacy and improved hemocompatibility with the preservation of the antibacterial property. compared to pristine silicone, the so-obtained silicone-g-p(pegdma)-p(dmaps) substrate reduced the absorption of bovine serum albumin and bovine plasma fibrinogen by >/=80%. it also reduced the  number of adherent platelets by >/=90% and significantly prolonged plasma recalcification time. the results indicate that surface grafting with p(pegdma) and p(dmaps) can be potentially useful for the modification of silicone-based pd  catheters for long-term applications.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == surface-grafted polysarcosine as a peptoid antifouling polymer brush.
AB  == poly(n-substituted glycine) "peptoids" are a class of peptidomimetic molecules receiving significant interest as engineered biomolecules. sarcosine (i.e., poly(n-methyl glycine)) has the simplest side chain chemical structure of this family. in this article, we demonstrate that surface-grafted polysarcosine (psar) brushes exhibit excellent resistance to nonspecific protein adsorption and cell attachment. polysarcosine was coupled to a mussel adhesive protein-inspired dopa-lys pentapeptide, which enabled solution grafting and control of the surface chain density of the psar brushes. protein adsorption was found to decrease monotonically with increasing grafted chain densities, and protein adsorption could be completely inhibited above certain critical chain densities specific to  different polysarcosine chain lengths. the dependence of protein adsorption on chain length and density was also investigated by a molecular theory. psar brushes at high chain length and density were shown to resist fibroblast cell attachment over a 7 week period, as well as resist the attachment of some clinically relevant bacterial strains. the excellent antifouling performance of psar may be related to the highly hydrophilic character of polysarcosine, which was evident from high-pressure liquid chromatography measurements of polysarcosine and water contact angle measurements of the psar brushes. peptoids  have been shown to resist proteolytic degradation, and polysarcosine could be produced in large quantities by n-carboxy anhydride polymerization. in summary, surface-grafted polysarcosine peptoid brushes hold great promise for antifouling  applications.

AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis strains were isolated from the expressed human breast  milk (ehm) of 14 healthy donor mothers. genetic diversity was evaluated using rapd-pcr rep-pcr and pulse-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). pfge allowed the best discrimination of the isolates, since it provided for the greatest diversity of the analyzed genomes. among the s. epidermidis strains, resistance to gentamicin, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin or vancomycin was detected, whilst four isolates were multiresistant. the results from our study demonstrate  that staphylococci from ehm could be reservoirs of resistance genes, since we showed that tetk could be transferred from ehm staphylococci to gram-negative escherichia coli. most of the staphylococcal strains displayed excellent proteolytic and lipolytic activities. additionally, the presence of ica genes, which was related to their ability to form a biofilm on tissue culture plates, and the presence of virulence factors including autolysin/adhesin atle, point to  their pathogenic potential.

TI  == peptidoglycan hydrolases-potential weapons against staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == bacteria of the genus staphylococcus are common pathogens responsible for a broad spectrum of human and animal infections and belong to the most important etiological factors causing food poisoning. because of rapid increase in the prevalence of isolation of staphylococci resistant to many antibiotics, there is  an urgent need for the development of new alternative chemotherapeutics. a number of studies have recently demonstrated the strong potential of peptidoglycan hydrolases (phs) to control and treat infections caused by this group of bacteria. phs cause rapid lysis and death of bacterial cells. the review concentrates on enzymes hydrolyzing peptidoglycan of staphylococci. usually, they are characterized by high specificity to only staphylococcus aureus cell wall components; however, some of them are also able to lyse cells of other staphylococci, e.g., staphylococcus epidermidis-human pathogen of growing importance and also other groups of bacteria. some phs strengthen the bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of common antibiotics, and as a result, they should be considered as component of combined therapy which could definitely reduced the development of bacterial resistance to both enzymes and antibiotics.  the preliminary research revealed that most of these enzymes can be produced using heterologous, especially escherichia coli expression systems; however, still much effort is required to develop more efficient and large-scale production technologies. this review discusses current state on knowledge with emphasis on the possibilities of application of phs in the context of therapeutics for infections caused by staphylococci.

TI  == full and broad-spectrum in vivo eradication of catheter-associated biofilms using gentamicin-edta antibiotic lock therapy.
AB  == biofilms that develop on indwelling devices are a major concern in clinical settings. while removal of colonized devices remains the most frequent strategy for avoiding device-related complications, antibiotic lock therapy constitutes an adjunct therapy for catheter-related infection. however, currently used antibiotic lock solutions are not fully effective against biofilms, thus warranting a search for new antibiotic locks. metal-binding chelators have emerged as potential adjuvants due to their dual anticoagulant/antibiofilm activities, but studies investigating their efficiency were mainly in vitro or else focused on their effects in prevention of infection. to assess the ability of such chelators to eradicate mature biofilms, we used an in vivo model of a totally implantable venous access port inserted in rats and colonized by either staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. we demonstrate that use of tetrasodium edta (30 mg/ml) as a supplement to the gentamicin (5 mg/ml) antibiotic lock solution associated with systemic antibiotics completely eradicated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial biofilms developed in totally implantable venous access ports. gentamicin-edta lock was able to eliminate biofilms with a single instillation, thus reducing length of treatment. moreover, we show that this combination was effective for immunosuppressed rats. lastly, we demonstrate that a gentamicin-edta lock is able to eradicate the biofilm formed by a gentamicin-resistant strain of methicillin-resistant s. aureus. this in vivo study demonstrates the potential of edta as an efficient antibiotic adjuvant to eradicate catheter-associated biofilms of major bacterial pathogens and thus provides a promising new lock solution.

TI  == biofilm infections, their resilience to therapy and innovative treatment strategies.
AB  == biofilm formation of microorganisms causes persistent tissue and foreign body infections resistant to treatment with antimicrobial agents. up to 80% of human bacterial infections are biofilm associated; such infections are most frequently  caused by staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and enterobacteria such as escherichia coli. the accurate diagnosis of biofilm infections is often difficult, which prevents the appropriate choice of treatment. as biofilm infections significantly contribute to patient morbidity and substantial healthcare costs, novel strategies to treat these infections are  urgently required. nucleotide second messengers, c-di-gmp, (p)ppgpp and potentially c-di-amp, are major regulators of biofilm formation and associated antibiotic tolerance. consequently, different components of these signalling networks might be appropriate targets for antibiofilm therapy in combination with antibiotic treatment strategies. in addition, cyclic di-nucleotides are microbial-associated molecular patterns with an almost universal presence. their  conserved structures sensed by the eukaryotic host have a widespread effect on the immune system. thus, cyclic di-nucleotides are also potential immunotherapeutic agents to treat antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.

AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the bactericidal effect of shock waves (sws) on gram-negative or gram-positive monocultured biofilms grown on an orthopedic implant in vitro. cortical bone screws were individually cultured with escherichia coli or staphylococcus epidermidis to produce a biofilm. in each run  of 8 screws, 6 screws were treated with shock waves and then sonicated to disrupt the biofilm. one screw was sonicated only and one was not shock waved or sonicated before sampling for plate count dilutions. post-treatment serial dilutions and plate counts were done on an aliquot from the vial containing each  screw to obtain the number of colony-forming units (cfus). shock waves were at a  constant energy of 0.15 mj/mm(2). pulse number and screw orientation were varied. a linear mixed-effects model was used with "treatment" as a fixed effect and "run" as a random effect. pairwise comparisons of treatments were performed with  tukey-cramer's adjustment for p-values. sonicated plate counts were greater than  nonsonicated counts for each run. when all sonicated screws were compared to all  nonsonicated screws, the counts were significantly increased (p = 0.0091). for each paired comparison between sonicated and shock wave treatment, the only significant difference was in the s. epidermidis biofilm treated at 2000 pulses in a horizontal position, which increased the post-treatment count (p = 0.0445).  no bactericidal effects were seen on monocultured biofilms on cortical bone screws treated with shock waves.

TI  == decreased bacteria activity on si(3)n(4) surfaces compared with peek or titanium.
AB  == a significant need exists for orthopedic implants that can intrinsically resist bacterial colonization. in this study, three biomaterials that are used in spinal implants--titanium (ti), polyether-ether-ketone (peek), and silicon nitride (si(3)n(4))--were tested to understand their respective susceptibility to bacterial infection with staphylococcus epidermidis, staphlococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus. specifically, the surface chemistry, wettability, and nanostructured topography of respective biomaterials, and the effects on bacterial biofilm formation, colonization, and growth were investigated. ti and peek were received with as-machined surfaces; both materials are hydrophobic, with net negative surface charges. two surface finishes of si(3)n(4) were examined: as-fired and polished. in contrast to ti and peek, the surface of si(3)n(4) is hydrophilic, with a net positive charge. a decreased biofilm formation was found, as well as fewer live bacteria on both the as-fired and polished si(3)n(4). these differences may reflect differential surface chemistry and surface nanostructure properties between the biomaterials tested. because protein adsorption on material surfaces affects bacterial adhesion, the adsorption of fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin on ti, peek, and si(3)n(4) were also examined. significantly greater amounts of these proteins adhered to si(3)n(4) than to ti or peek. the findings of this study suggest that  surface properties of biomaterials lead to differential adsorption of physiologic proteins, and that this phenomenon could explain the observed in-vitro differences in bacterial affinity for the respective biomaterials. intrinsic biomaterial properties as they relate to resistance to bacterial colonization may reflect a novel strategy toward designing future orthopedic implants.

TI  == chemical composition, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the leaf essential oil of juglans regia l. and its constituents.
AB  == the essential oil from the leaves of juglans regia l. (juglandaceae) growing wild in kashmir (india) was obtained by hydrodistillation and analysed by a combination of capillary gc-fid and gc-ms. a total of 38 compounds, representing  92.7% of the oil, were identified and the major components were found to be alpha-pinene (15.1%), beta-pinene (30.5%), beta-caryophyllene (15.5%) germacrene  d (14.4%) and limonene (3.6%). the essential oil and the main individual constituents were screened for antibacterial activity and the essential oil evaluated for antioxidant activity. antibacterial activity was evaluated using the disc diffusion and microdilution methods against a group of clinically significant gram-positive (staphylococcus epidermidis mtcc-435, bacillus subtilis mtcc-441, staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative bacteria (proteus vulgaris mtcc-321, pseudomonas aeruginosa mtcc-1688, salmonella typhi, shigella dyssenteriae, klebsiella pneumonia and escherichia coli). the essential oil and its major components exhibited broad spectrum inhibition against all the bacterial strains with gram-positive being more susceptible to the oil than gram-negative bacteria. antioxidant activity of the oil was evaluated by the scavenging effect on dpph (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and hydroxyl radicals.  in general, the essential oil exhibited high antioxidant activity which was comparable to the reference standards at the same dose (ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxyl toluene, bht) with ic(50) values of 34.5 and 56.4mug/ml calculated by dpph and hydroxyl radical scavenging assays respectively.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  == background: zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) is a polymorphic disease. it is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process.  however, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. material/methods: the aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected zcl and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate zcl from non-zcl lesions in a rural area north of isfahan, iran from july to december 2009. bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. results: the results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for zcl, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of zcl. the bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of zcl (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-zcl lesions. the most common species were staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and s. epidermidis (28%) followed by bacillus sp. streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus sp., enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeroginosa. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, cefazolin and clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. conclusions: bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in zcl, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-zcl lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (acl). local  lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the  treatment of zcl.

TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

TI  == the use of maldi-tof-ms and in silico studies for determination of antimicrobial  peptides' affinity to bacterial cells.
AB  == several methods have been proposed for determining the binding affinity of antimicrobial peptides (amps) to bacterial cells. here the utilization of maldi-tof-ms was proposed as a reliable and efficient method for high throughput  amp screening. the major advantage of the technique consists of finding amps that are selective and specific to a wide range of gram-negative and -positive bacteria, providing a simple reliable screening tool to determine the potential candidates for broad spectrum antimicrobial drugs. as a prototype, amp-1 and -2 were used, showing highest activity toward gram-negative and -positive membranes  respectively. in addition, in silico molecular docking studies with both peptides were carried out for the membranes. in silico results indicated that both peptides presented affinity for dppg and dppe phospholipids, constructed in order to emulate an in vivo membrane bilayer. as a result, amp-1 showed a higher complementary surface for gram-negative while amp-2 showed higher affinity to gram-positive membranes, corroborating ms analyses. in summary, results here obtained suggested that in vitro methodology using maldi-tof-ms in addition to theoretical studies may be able to improve amp screening quality.

TI  == genetic manipulation of staphylococci-breaking through the barrier.
AB  == most strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis possess a strong restriction barrier that hinders exchange of dna. recently, major advances have been made in identifying and characterizing the restriction-modification (rm) systems involved. in particular a novel type iv restriction enzyme that recognizes cytosine methylated dna has been shown to be the major barrier to transfer of plasmid dna from escherichia coli into s. aureus and s. epidermidis.  while the conserved type i rm system provides a further barrier. here we review the recent advances in understanding of restriction systems in staphylococci and  highlight how this has been exploited to improve our ability to manipulate genetically previously untransformable strains.

TI  == chemical composition and in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial and anti-acetylcholinesterase properties of the flower oil of ferula lutea.
AB  == the present work describes the chemical composition and evaluates the antimicrobial and the anti-acetylcholinesterase properties of the flower oil from the tunisian ferula lutea obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of gc/fid and gc/ms. the chemical composition of the flower oil of this species is reported for the first time. seventeen compounds were identified  accounting for 94.3% of the total oil. the chemical composition of this essential oil was characterized by a high proportion of monoterpene hydrocarbons (80.4%) among which delta-3-carene (31.2%) and alpha-pinene (25.8%) were the predominant  compounds. the oxygenated monoterpenes represent the second major fraction (12.0%), 2,3,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde (10.9%) being the predominant one. furthermore, the isolated oil was tested for its antimicrobial activity using the disc-diffusion and the microdilution assays against six gram-positive and five gram-negative bacteria as well as towards eight candida species. it was found that flower oil of f. lutea exhibited interesting antibacterial and anticandidal  activity (mic = 39 mcirog/ml against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and  s. epidermidis and mic = 156 microg/ml against candida albicans). the anti-acetylcholinesterase effect of this oil was also evaluated in this work. results showed that this oil exhibits significant activity (ic50 =70.25 +/- 5.41  microg/ml).

AB  == few transition metal complexes of tetradentate n(2)o(2) donor schiff base ligands containing 2-hydroxybenzylidene-4-aminoantipyrine and amino acids (alanine/valine) abbreviated to khl(1)/khl(2) have been synthesized. all the metal complexes have been fully characterized with the help of elemental analyses, molecular weights, molar conductance values, magnetic moments and spectroscopic data. the schiff bases khl(1)/khl(2) are found to act as tetradentate ligands using n(2)o(2) donor set of atoms leading to a square-planar geometry for the complexes around the metal ions. the binding behaviors of the complexes to calf thymus dna have been investigated by absorption spectra, viscosity measurements and cyclic voltammetry. the dna binding constants reveal that all these complexes interact with dna through minor groove binding mode. the studies on mechanism of photocleavage reveal that singlet oxygen ((1)o(2)) and superoxide anion radical (o(2)(-)) may play an important role in the photocleavage. the schiff bases and their metal complexes have been screened for  their in vitro antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella  pneumoniae and antifungal activities against aspergillus niger, fusarium solani,  culvularia lunata, rhizoctonia bataicola and candida albicans by mic method.

TI  == dose findings of antofloxacin hydrochloride for treating bacterial infections in  an early clinical trial using pk-pd parameters in healthy volunteers.
AB  == aim: to find an appropriate dose regimen of the novel antibacterial agent antofloxacin for a phase ii clinical trial using a population pharmacokinetic (ppk) study in healthy volunteers and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)  as pharmacodynamic (pd) parameters. methods: twenty-four healthy volunteers were  enrolled in a double-blind crossover study and received antofloxacin (200 or 400  mg/d, po) for consecutive 5 d with 10 d washout between two separate periods. blood concentrations were analyzed using hplc with a uv-vis detector. the values  of area under the curve (auc) with covariates were obtained from a ppk model, and the mics came from the previous in vitro studies. the dose regimen was determined for the phase ii clinical trial according to the ratio (>20) of auc/mic, and the  efficacy of the dose was evaluated by the trial. results: a two-compartment model best described the time-concentration data with first-order absorption. the ppk parameter estimates for cl, v(c), q, v(p) and k(a) are 8.34 l/h, 142 l, 15.9 l/h, 52.2 l and 4.64 1/h, respectively. the covariates sex for k(a), weight for cl, weight for v(c) and interoccasion variability were included in the final model. the auc/mic was calculated based on the ppk model and the mic of antofloxacin for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus  epidermidis were determined in previous researches. the 400 mg loading dose with  200 mg/d maintenance dose was recommended and confirmed by the phase ii trial. conclusion: the ratio of auc from the ppk model vs mic as the pd parameter can be applied in a dose-finding trial of antofloxacin in treatment of bacterial infections. the ppk model suggests that sex and body weight may be considerations in regards to individual therapy, which should be investigated in larger clinical trials and serve as a potential reference for clinical therapies.

TI  == safety and efficacy of levofloxacin versus ciprofloxacin for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis in chinese patients.
AB  == levofloxacin is a synthetic fluoroquinolone that is usually used to treat chronic bacterial prostatitis. we investigated the safety and efficacy of levofloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis in chinese patients. this was a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled non-inferiority trial. four hundred and seventy-one patients with clinical symptoms/signs were enrolled into the study, and 408 patients were microbiologically confirmed chronic bacterial prostatitis, who were randomized to either oral levofloxacin (500 mg q.d.) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg b.i.d.) for 4 weeks. bacterial clearance rate, clinical symptoms/signs, adverse reactions and disease recurrence were assessed. the clinical symptoms and signs (including dysuria, perineal discomfort or pain) and bacteria cultures in 209 patients treated with levofloxacin and 199 patients treated with ciprofloxacin were similar. the most common bacteria were escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. one to four weeks after the end of 4 weeks treatment, the bacterial clearance rate (86.06% vs. 60.03%; p<0.05) and the clinical efficacy (including clinical cure and clinical improvement(93.30% vs. 71.86%; p<0.05)) were significantly higher in the levofloxacin-treated group than in the ciprofloxacin-treated group. the microbiological recurrence rate was significantly lower in the levofloxacin-treated group than in the ciprofloxacin-treated group (4.00% vs. 19.25%; p<0.05). rates of adverse events and treatment-related adverse events were slightly lower in the levofloxacin-treated group than in ciprofloxacin-treated group. levofloxacin showed some advantages over ciprofloxacin in terms of clinical efficacy and disease recurrence, with a low rate of adverse events, for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis in chinese patients.

TI  == comparison of real-time pcr and masstag pcr for the multiplex detection of highly pathogenic agents.
AB  == multiplex pcr assays are a cost- as well as labour-effective way to analyse one sample for several pathogens simultaneously. besides the mutual competition of the individual pcr reactions included in a multiplex pcr assay, their specific read-out displays a limiting factor for the total number of pcr reactions that can be multiplexed. in this study, two pcr systems with different read-out approaches are compared, using a pentaplex pcr assay for the detection of highly  pathogenic agents. a pentaplex assay was used since five represents the current limit of real-time pcr multiplexing capacity due to the low resolution of fluorescence emission peaks of the current equipment. in contrast, masstag pcr as a quite new technique offers the possibility to detect up to 20-30 target sequences from one reaction. after extensive and separate optimisation of the pcr protocol for both platforms, a comparative probit analysis showed good sensitivities for masstag and real-time pcr detection. nevertheless, the detection limits of masstag pcr have been undercut by the real-time pcr for each  target. we therefore conclude that masstag pcr is a useful diagnostic technique for the sensitive screening for pathogens by highly multiplexed pcr assays, but cannot reach the sensitivity of real-time pcr for lower multiplexed pcr assays.

TI  == synthesis of short cationic antimicrobial peptidomimetics containing arginine analogues.
AB  == worldwide efforts are underway to develop new antimicrobial agents against bacterial resistance. to identify new compounds with a good antimicrobial profile, we designed and synthesized two series of small cationic antimicrobial peptidomimetics (1-8) containing unusual arginine mimetics (to introduce cationic charges) and several aromatic amino acids (bulky moieties to improve lipophilicity). both series were screened for in vitro antibacterial activity against a representative panel of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) bacterial strains, and candida albicans. the biological screening showed that peptidomimetics containing tryptophan residues are endowed with the best antimicrobial activity against s. aureus and s. epidermidis in respect to the other synthesized derivatives (mic values range 7.5-50 microg/ml). moreover,  small antimicrobial peptidomimetics derivatives 2 and 5 showed an appreciable activity against the tested gram-negative bacteria and c. albicans. the most active compounds (1-2 and 5-6) have been tested against gram-positive established biofilm, too. results showed that the biofilm inhibitory concentration values of  these compounds were never up to 200 microg/ml. the replacement of tryptophan with phenylalanine or tyrosine resulted in considerable loss of the antibacterial action (compounds 3-4 and 7-8) against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. furthermore, by evaluating hemolytic activity, the synthesized compounds did not reveal cytotoxic activities, except for compound 5.

TI  == causative bacteria and antibiotic resistance in neonatal sepsis.
AB  == background: neonatal sepsis is characterised by bacteraemia and clinical symptoms caused by microorganisms and their toxic products. gram negative bacteria are the commonest causes of neonatal sepsis. the resistance to the commonly used antibiotics is alarmingly high. the major reason for emerging resistance against  antibiotics is that doctors often do not take blood cultures before starting antibiotics. we have carried out this study to find out various bacteria causing  neonatal sepsis and their susceptibility to antibiotics for better management of  neonatal sepsis. methods: a total of 130 neonates with sepsis who were found to be blood culture positive were taken in this study. culture/sensitivity was done, isolated organisms identified and their sensitivity/resistance was noted against  different antibiotics. data were arranged in terms of frequencies and percentage. results: out of 130 culture proven cases of neonatal sepsis, gram negative bacteria were found in 71 (54.6%) cases and gram positive bacteria in 59 (45.4%)  cases. staphylococcus aureus was the most common bacteria found in 35 (26.9%) cases followed by escherichia coli in 30 (23.1%) cases. acinetobacter species, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebseila, streptococci, enterobacter cloacae and morexella species were found in 17 (13.1%), 17 (13.1%), 13 (10%), 7 (5.4%), 6 (4.6%), and 5 (3.8%) cases respectively. in most of the cases causative organisms were found to be resistant to commonly used antibiotics like ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone (77.7%, 81.5%, 63.1%, and 66.9% respectively). there was comparatively less (56.9%) resistance to ceftazidime. gentamicin had resistance in 55.1% cases, while amikacin and tobramycin had relatively less resistance (17.4% and 34.8% cases respectively). quinolones and imipenem had relatively less resistance. vancomycin was found to be effective in  100% cases of staphylococcus group. conclusion: staphylococcus aureus are the most common gram positive bacteria and escherichia coli are the most common gram  negative bacteria causing neonatal sepsis. resistance to commonly used antibiotics is alarmingly increasing. continued surveillance is mandatory to assess the resistance pattern at a certain level.

(rp) is a medicinal herb that possesses antibacterial activity. in this study, we extracted the volatile oil from the leaves of rp to assess its antibacterial activity and analyze its chemical composition. a uniform distribution design was used to optimize the extraction procedure, which yielded  0.36% (w/w) of light yellowish oil from the water extract of rp leaves. we found  that the extracted oil effectively inhibited the growth of a wide range of gram positive and negative bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii, bacillus cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae. we further analyzed the components contained in the hydro-distillated rp volatile oil by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. twenty nine compounds were identified, including 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene (66%), 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol (10%) and 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid (2%). our results suggest that one or multiple constituents contained in rp volatile oil may account for its antibacterial activity.

TI  == does dithiothreitol improve bacterial detection from infected prostheses? a pilot study.
AB  == background: sonication and scraping of infected prostheses usually are used to improve diagnosis of prosthetic infections, reducing false negatives. chemical methods that reduce biofilms also may allow higher levels of detection. questions/purposes: we therefore asked: (1) do dithiothreitol (dtt) and n-acetylcysteine (nac) remove bacteria from biofilm formed on prosthetic materials? (2) is bacterial recovery affected by differing dtt and nac concentrations and incubation times? (3) do treatments with dtt and nac detach the same amounts of bacteria from biofilm on prosthetic materials as sonication and scraping? (4) are these methods reproducible? methods: we treated polyethylene and titanium discs covered by biofilm formed by pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus with dtt or nac solutions at different concentrations for different times. we compared colony counts of s aureus, p aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli after treatment with  nac, dtt, sonication and scraping. we determined colony counts after treatment of biofilm formed by one strain of s aureus and one of p aeruginosa on five discs of each material analyzed on the same day and on five discs analyzed on five consecutive days. results: mean colony counts (logcfu/ml) obtained after treatment with 1 g/l dtt for 15 minutes (5.3) were similar to those after sonication (4.9) and greater than those obtaining by scraping (3.4) and treatment with 2 g/l nac for 30 minutes (1.9). dtt and sonication showed good reproducibility. clinical relevance: our data suggest that treatment of prostheses with dtt may be a reasonable alternative to sonication to improve detection of biofilm-associated bacteria and supplement conventional laboratory culturing techniques for diagnosing periprosthetic infections.

TI  == comparison of microplate and macrodilution methods in time-kill study of new antimicrobial drugs.
AB  == in consideration of high production costs of new antimicrobial drugs, a more convenient and economical method for time-kill study is urgently required. in the present experiment, we attempted to demonstrate the feasibility of microplate method as an alternative measure of macrodilution method for time-kill study. three conventional antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, and levofloxacin) and two antimicrobial peptides [a-thanatin and k(4)-s4(1-16)a] were used to determine time-kill curves against escherichia coli atcc 25922 and staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 14990. meanwhile, both methods were also performed with three antisense peptide nucleic acids (pna3, pna4, and pna5) targeting ropd gene of staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and mrsa who-2. in order to study the correlation between the two methods, the growth inhibition rate of pnas, antimicrobial peptides, and antibiotics for the tested strains were evaluated. a  strong agreement between the results obtained from the two methods has been demonstrated. although microplate method required longer incubation time for a significant result than macrodilution method, the former provides a more convenient, economical, and stable way to perform time-kill test for these agents. thus, we concluded that microplate method was an available measure for time-kill study of new antimicrobial drugs.

TI  == igg opsonization of bacteria promotes th17 responses via synergy between tlrs and fcgammariia in human dendritic cells.
AB  == dendritic cells (dcs) are essential in inducing adaptive immune responses against bacteria by expressing cytokines that skew t-cell responses toward protective th17 cells. although it is widely recognized that induction of these cytokines by dcs involves activation of multiple receptors, it is still incompletely characterized which combination of receptors specifically skews th17-cell responses. here we have identified a novel role for fcgammariia in promoting human th17 cells. activation of dcs by bacteria opsonized by serum igg strongly promoted th17 responses, which was fcgammariia-dependent and coincided with enhanced production of selected cytokines by dcs, including th17-promoting il-1beta and il-23. notably, fcgammariia stimulation on dcs did not induce cytokine production when stimulated individually, but selectively amplified cytokine responses through synergy with tlr2, 4, or 5. importantly, this synergy  is mediated at 2 different levels. first, tlr-fcgammariia costimulation strongly  increased transcription of pro-il-1beta and il-23p19. second, fcgammariia triggering induced activation of caspase-1, which cleaves pro-il-1beta into its bioactive form and thereby enhanced il-1beta secretion. taken together, these data identified cross-talk between tlrs and fcgammariia as a novel mechanism by which dcs promote protective effector th17-cell responses against bacteria.

TI  == anti-helicobacter pylori activity of the methanolic extract of geum iranicum and  its main compounds.
AB  == geum iranicum khatamsaz, belonging to the rosaceae family, is an endemic plant of iran. the methanol extract of the roots of this plant showed significant activity against one of the clinical isolates of helicobacter pylori which was resistant to metronidazole. the aim of this study was the isolation and evaluation of the major compounds of g. iranicum effective against h. pylori. the compounds were isolated using various chromatographic methods and identified by spectroscopic data (1h and 13c nmr, hmqc, hmbc, ei-ms). an antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed employing the disk diffusion method against clinical isolates of h. pylori and a micro dilution method against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria; additionally the inhibition zone diameters (izd) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) values were recorded. nine compounds were isolated: two triterpenoids, uvaol and niga-ichigoside f1, three sterols, beta-sitosterol, beta-sitosteryl acetate, and beta-sitosteryl linoleate, one phenyl propanoid, eugenol, one phenolic glycoside, gein, one flavanol, (+)-catechin, and sucrose. the aqueous fraction, obtained by partitioning the meoh extract with water and chloroform, was the most effective fraction of the extract against all clinical isolates of h. pylori. further investigation of the  isolated compounds showed that eugenol was effective against h. pylori but gein,  diglycosidic eugenol, did not exhibit any activity against h. pylori. the subfraction d4 was the effective fraction which contained tannins. it appeared that tannins were probably the active compounds responsible for the anti-h. pylori activity of g. iranicum. the aqueous fraction showed a moderate inhibitory activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the mic values indicated that gram-positive bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus subtilis are more susceptible than gram-neagative bacteria including escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == a rat model of central venous catheter to study establishment of long-term bacterial biofilm and related acute and chronic infections.
AB  == formation of resilient biofilms on medical devices colonized by pathogenic microorganisms is a major cause of health-care associated infection. while in vitro biofilm analyses led to promising anti-biofilm approaches, little is known  about their translation to in vivo situations and on host contribution to the in  vivo dynamics of infections on medical devices. here we have developed an in vivo model of long-term bacterial biofilm infections in a pediatric totally implantable venous access port (tivap) surgically placed in adult rats. using non-invasive and quantitative bioluminescence, we studied tivap contamination by  clinically relevant pathogens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, and we demonstrated that tivap bacterial populations display typical biofilm phenotypes. in our study, we  showed that immunocompetent rats were able to control the colonization and clear  the bloodstream infection except for up to 30% that suffered systemic infection and death whereas none of the immunosuppressed rats survived the infection. besides, we mimicked some clinically relevant tivap associated complications such as port-pocket infection and hematogenous route of colonization. finally, by assessing an optimized antibiotic lock therapy, we established that our in vivo model enables to assess innovative therapeutic strategies against bacterial biofilm infections.

AB  == flow cytometry can be used to detect bacterial contamination of platelet products. in this study, we investigated whether the incubation of a minimal volume of platelet-rich plasma (prp)-derived platelet concentrates (pcs) with growth medium improved the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry. five bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli) were used. platelets were inoculated with 10, 10(2), and 10(3) cfus per ml; 0.5 ml, 1.0 ml, and 2.0 ml aliquots of spiked platelets were incubated with growth medium at 37 degrees c for 24 hours. during the incubation period, the numbers of events were analyzed every 4 hours by flow cytometry. we could detect a low concentration (10 cfus per ml) of bacteria in a small volume (minimum 0.5 ml) of pcs. irrespective of spiking concentrations and incubation volumes, the detection times of s. aureus and s. epidermidis were 24 hours or less, while those of b. cereus, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli were 16 hours or less. a higher spiking concentration made it possible to shorten the detection time. the numbers of detected bacteria  increased during the incubation. however, the graphs corresponding to k. pneumoniae and e. coli showed peak levels and decreasing patterns during the incubation period. the incubation of small volumes of pc with growth medium increased the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry for bacterial detection. therefore, flow cytometry can serve as a useful method for sterility testing using prp-derived pcs with only low levels of consequent platelet loss.

TI  == moderate intensity static magnetic field has bactericidal effect on e. coli and s. epidermidis on sintered hydroxyapatite.
AB  == the application of electromagnetic field in the context of bacteria associated infections on biomaterial surfaces has not been extensively explored. in this work, we applied a moderate intensity static magnetic field (100 mt) to understand the adhesion and growth behavior of both gram positive (s. epidermidis) and gram negative bacteria (e. coli) and also to investigate bactericidal/bacteriostatic property of the applied electromagnetic field. an in-house built magnetometer was used to apply static homogeneous magnetic field during a planned set of in vitro experiments. both the sintered hydroxyapatite (ha) and the control samples seeded with bacteria were exposed to the magnetic field (100 mt) for different timescale during their log phase growth. quantitative analysis of the sem images confirms the effect of electromagnetic field on suppressing bacterial growth. furthermore, cell integrity and inner membrane permeabilization assays were performed to understand the origin of such  effect. the results of these assays were statistically analyzed to reveal the bactericidal effect of magnetic field, indicating cell membrane damage. under the investigated culture conditions, the bactericidal effect was found to be less effective for s. epidermidis than e. coli.

TI  == nonrecovery of varying proportions of viable bacteria during spread plating governed by the extent of spreader usage and proposal for an alternate spotting-spreading approach to maximize the cfu.
AB  == aims: to elucidate the cause of high variations and inconsistencies in bacterial  cfu observed within and between different experiments while assessing viable bacterial counts through spread plating (sp). methods and results: following the  inconsistent results, cfu estimations were undertaken through conventional sp using the spreader, or a modified approach that did not use spreader employing four organisms. the latter approach involving spotting-and-tilt-spreading of inoculum on agar surface [spotting spreading (ss)] yielded higher cfu by 11-120%  over the weighted average depending on the organism and diluent. the adverse effect owing to the spreader was the most obvious in escherichia coli followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter cloacae and bacillus pumilus. plate attributes that determined the surface moisture levels of agar medium and the spreading practice adopted by the personnel formed two other major influencing factors. plating for shorter periods (<60 s) using fresh 15/20 ml plates caused loss of 3-12% cfu owing to inoculum adhesion to spreader irrespective of glass or polypropylene make. on the other hand, prolonging the plating brought down the cfu significantly. spreader movement on agar surface subsequent to the exhaustion of free moisture, which was marked by the experiencing of some friction to smooth spreader movement, was detrimental to vegetative cells, while bacillus spores were less affected. conclusions: the study brings out that the way sp is carried  out exerts significant effects on cfu influenced by plate conditions. prolonged use of spreader on dry agar surface could be highly detrimental to bacterial cells. a mild use of spreader accounting for spreader-adhering inoculum or the practice of ss not involving the spreader is recommended. significance and impact of the study: this study unravels the effects owing to the spreader on bacterial  cells and the cfu and recommends an alternate approach of ss to minimize cfu inconsistencies and to maximize the viable bacterial counts.

TI  == study on carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde polymeric films: mechanical properties, release kinetics and antibacterial and antibiofilm activities.
AB  == polyethylene-co-vinylacetate (eva) films with different concentrations (3.5 wt% and 7 wt%) of essential oil constituents, carvacrol or cinnamaldehyde, were prepared and characterized by mechanical, antibacterial and antibiofilm properties. the incorporation of the compounds into copolymer films affected their elastic modulus, tensile stress and elongation at break. carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde act as plasticizers which reduce the intermolecular forces of polymer chains, thus improving the flexibility and extensibility of the film. the analysis of the surface characteristics demonstrated that essential oil constituents lowered the contact angle values without causing any remarkable variation of the surface roughness. the films allowed progressive diffusion of the bioactive molecules and the kinetic of release was correlated with the damaging effect on bacterial growth. the kill curves proved that the film with essential oil constituents (7 wt%) had a significant bactericidal effect (reduction of 4 and 2 log cfu) against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli and a bacteriostatic effect against staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria monocytogenes (reduction of about 1 log cfu). with regard to biofilm formation the biomass formed on polymeric films surface was significantly reduced if compared with the pure copolymer control. the results were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy images by live/dead staining. the reduction in the surface tension coupled to an inherent bactericidal property of carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde could in turn affect the initial attachment phase of bacteria and  compromise the normal biofilm development.

TI  == prokaryotic selectivity and lps-neutralizing activity of short antimicrobial peptides designed from the human antimicrobial peptide ll-37.
AB  == to develop novel antimicrobial peptides (amps) with shorter lengths, improved prokaryotic selectivity and retained lipolysaccharide (lps)-neutralizing activity compared to human cathelicidin amp, ll-37, a series of amino acid-substituted analogs based on ig-19 (residues 13-31 of ll-37) were synthesized. among the ig-19 analogs, the analog a4 showed the highest prokaryotic selectivity, but much lower lps-neutralizing activity compared to parental ll-37. the analogs, a5, a6,  a7 and a8 with higher hydrophobicity displayed lps-neutralizing activity comparable to that of ll-37, but much lesser prokaryotic selectivity. these results indicate that the proper hydrophobicity of the peptides is crucial to exert the amalgamated property of lps-neutralizing activity and prokaryotic selectivity. furthermore, to increase lps-neutralizing activity of the analog a4  without a remarkable decrease in prokaryotic selectivity, we synthesized trp-substituted analogs (a4-w1 and a4-w2), in which phe(5) or phe(15) of a4 is replaced by trp. despite their same prokaryotic selectivity, a4-w2 displayed much higher lps-neutralizing activity compared to a4-w1. when compared with parental ll-37, a4-w2 showed retained lps-neutralizing activity and 2.8-fold enhanced prokaryotic selectivity. these results suggest that the effective site for trp-substitution when designing novel amps with higher lps-neutralizing activity, without a remarkable reduction in prokaryotic selectivity, is the amphipathic interface between the end of the hydrophilic side and the start of the hydrophobic side rather than the central position of the hydrophobic side in their alpha-helical wheel projection. taken together, the analog a4-w2 can serve  as a promising template for the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of endotoxic shock and bacterial infection.

TI  == antimicrobial lipopeptaibol trichogin ga iv: role of the three aib residues on conformation and bioactivity.
AB  == the lipopeptaibol trichogin ga iv is a natural, non-ribosomally synthesized, antimicrobial peptide remarkably resistant to the action of hydrolytic enzymes. this feature may be connected to the multiple presence in its sequence of the non-coded residue alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (aib), which is known to be responsible for the adoption of particularly stable helical structures already at the level of short peptides. to investigate the role of aib residues on the 3d-structure and bioactivity of trichogin ga iv, we synthesized and fully characterized four analogs where one or two aib residues are replaced by l-leu. our extensive conformational studies (including an x-ray diffraction analysis) and biological assays performed on these analogs showed that the aib to l-leu replacements do not affect the resistance to proteolysis, but modulate the bioactivity of trichogin ga iv in a 3d-structure related manner.

TI  == studies on dna binding behaviour of biologically active transition metal complexes of new tetradentate n2o2 donor schiff bases: inhibitory activity against bacteria.
AB  == a series of cu(ii), ni(ii) and zn(ii) complexes of the type ml have been synthesized with schiff bases derived from o-acetoacetotoluidide, 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and o-phenylenediamine/1,4-diaminobutane. the complexes are insoluble in common organic solvents but soluble in dmf and dmso. the measured molar conductance values in dmso indicate that the complexes are non-electrolytic in nature. all the six metal complexes have been fully characterized with the help of elemental analyses, molecular weights, molar conductance values, magnetic moments and spectroscopic data. the analytical data helped to elucidate the structure of the metal complexes. the schiff bases are found to act as tetradentate ligands using n(2)o(2) donor set of atoms leading to a square-planar geometry for the complexes around all the metal ions. the binding properties of metal complexes with dna were investigated by absorption spectra, viscosity measurements and cyclic voltammetry. detailed analysis reveals that the metal complexes intercalate into the dna base stack as intercalators. all the metal complexes cleave the puc19 dna in presence of h(2)o(2.) the schiff bases and their complexes have been screened for their antibacterial activity against five  bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae) by disk diffusion method. all the metal complexes have potent biocidal activity than the free ligands.

TI  == transforming the untransformable: application of direct transformation to manipulate genetically staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == the strong restriction barrier present in staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis has limited functional genomic analysis to a small subset of strains that are amenable to genetic manipulation. recently, a conserved type iv restriction system termed sauusi (which specifically recognizes cytosine methylated dna) was identified as the major barrier to transformation with foreign dna. here we have independently corroborated these findings in a widely used laboratory strain of s. aureus. additionally, we have constructed a dna cytosine methyltransferase mutant in the high-efficiency escherichia coli cloning strain dh10b (called dc10b). plasmids isolated from dc10b can be directly transformed into clinical isolates of s. aureus and s. epidermidis. we also show  that the loss of restriction (both type i and iv) in an s. aureus usa300 strain does not have an impact on virulence. circumventing the sauusi restriction barrier, combined with an improved deletion and transformation protocol, has allowed the genetic manipulation of previously untransformable strains of these important opportunistic pathogens. importance: staphylococcal infections place a  huge burden on the health care sector due both to their severity and also to the  economic impact of treating the infections because of prolonged hospitalization.  to improve the understanding of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis infections, we have developed a series of improved techniques that allow the genetic manipulation of strains that were previously refractory to transformation. these developments will speed up the process of mutant construction and increase our understanding of these species as a whole, rather than just a small subset of strains that could previously be manipulated.

TI  == characterization and antimicrobial activities of two streptomyces isolates from soil in the periphery of universiti putra malaysia.
AB  == this study was to assess the identification and antimicrobial activities of two actinomycete isolates. the two isolates designated as b8 and c2, were isolated from a patch of soil in the peripheral area of universiti putra malaysia by streaking on starch casein agar after standard serial dilution procedures. their  antimicrobial activities were first evaluated against eight clinical laboratory strains namely bacillus sp., enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, klebsiella sp.,  pseudomonas sp., salmonella sp., staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis by perpendicular streak method on mueller hinton and tryptic soy agar. in both media, a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity was observed for both isolates, with b8 against all the test bacteria and c2 against five of them  (bacillus sp., e. coli, pseudomonas sp., s. aureus and s. epidermidis). re-assessment against e. coli atcc 25922 and s. aureus atcc 25923 strains by similar method showed antibacterial activities by isolate b8 against both attc strains while c2 only against s. aureus atcc 25923. streptomyces griseus atcc 10137 was included in the later experiment and showed antibacterial activity against both atcc strains. subsequently, the two isolates were identified by pcr/sequencing techniques and phylogenetic analysis to be streptomyces species (>93% homology based on 16s rrna and rpob genes). characterization on cultural characteristic and viable count at different temperatures (37 masculinec and 28 masculinec), on different microbiological media (aia, isp-2, mha, na, pda and tsa), were performed. more morphological features were observed on isp-2 for both isolates. a higher growth yield was also observed at 28 masculinec in all media but in comparing that between the two isolates, isolate b8 outnumbered c2 at all  experimental conditions. the observed variation in cultural traits and growth yield indicate unique properties between the two antibiotic-producing isolates.

TI  == pathogen identification with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy: the effect of  bacterial and biofluid specimen contamination.
AB  == in this paper, the potential use of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (libs) for the rapid discrimination and identification of bacterial pathogens in realistic clinical specimens is investigated. specifically, the common problem of sample contamination was studied by creating mixed samples to investigate the effect that the presence of a second contaminant bacterium in the specimen had on the libs-based identification of the primary pathogen. two closely related bacterial specimens, escherichia coli strain atcc 25922 and enterobacter cloacae  strain atcc 13047, were mixed together in mixing fractions of 10:1, 100:1, and 1000:1. libs spectra from the three mixtures were reliably classified as the correct e. coli strain with 98.5% accuracy when all the mixtures were withheld from the training model and classified against spectra from pure specimens. to simulate a rapid test for the presence of urinary tract infection pathogens, libs spectra were obtained from specimens of staphylococcus epidermidis obtained from  distilled water and sterile urine. libs spectra from the urine-harvested bacteria were classified as s. epidermidis with 100% accuracy when classified using a model containing only spectra from other staphylococci species and with 88.5% accuracy when a model containing five genera of bacteria was utilized. bacterial  specimens comprising five different genera and 13 classifiable taxonomic groups of species and strains were compiled in a library that was tested using external  validation techniques. the importance of utilizing external validation techniques where the library is tested with data withheld from all previous testing and training of the model was revealed by comparing the results against "leave-one-out" cross-validation results. last, the effect of using sequential models for the classification of a single unknown spectrum was investigated by comparing the misclassification of two closely related bacteria, e. coli and e. cloacae, when the classification was first performed using the five-genus bacterial library and then with a smaller model consisting only of e. coli and e. cloacae specimens. this result shows the utility of using successively more targeted analyses and models that use preliminary classifications from more general models as input.

TI  == antiadhesive activity of the biosurfactant pseudofactin ii secreted by the arctic bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens bd5.
AB  == background: pseudofactin ii is a recently identified biosurfactant secreted by pseudomonas fluorescens bd5, the strain obtained from freshwater from the arctic  archipelago of svalbard. pseudofactin ii is a novel compound identified as cyclic lipopeptide with a palmitic acid connected to the terminal amino group of eighth  amino acid in peptide moiety. the c-terminal carboxylic group of the last amino acid forms a lactone with the hydroxyl of thr3. adhesion is the first stage of biofilm formation and the best moment for the action of antiadhesive and anti-biofilm compounds. adsorption of biosurfactants to a surface e.g. glass, polystyrene, silicone modifies its hydrophobicity, interfering with the microbial adhesion and desorption processes. in this study the role and applications of pseudofactin ii as a antiadhesive compound has been investigated from medicinal and therapeutic perspectives. results: pseudofactin ii lowered the adhesion to three types of surfaces (glass, polystyrene and silicone) of bacterial strains of five species: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis and two candida albicans strains. pretreatment of a polystyrene surface with 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin ii inhibited bacterial adhesion by 36-90% and that of c. albicans by 92-99%. the same concentration of pseudofactin ii dislodged 26-70% of preexisting biofilms grown on previously untreated surfaces. pseudofactin ii also caused a marked inhibition of the initial adhesion of e. faecalis, e. coli, e. hirae and c. albicans strains to silicone urethral catheters. the highest concentration tested (0.5 mg/ml) caused a total growth inhibition of s. epidermidis, partial (18-37%) inhibition of other bacteria and 8-9% inhibition of c. albicans growth. conclusion: pseudofactin ii showed antiadhesive activity against several pathogenic microorganisms which are potential biofilm formers on catheters, implants and internal prostheses. up to 99% prevention could be achieved by 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin ii. in addition, pseudofactin ii dispersed preformed biofilms. pseudofactin ii can be used as a disinfectant or surface coating agent against microbial colonization of different surfaces, e.g. implants or urethral catheters.

TI  == mirasol prt system inactivation efficacy evaluated in platelet concentrates by bacteria-contamination model.
AB  == background/aim: bacterial contamination of blood components, primarily platelet concentrates (pcs), has been identified as one of the most frequent infectious complications in transfusion practice. pc units have a high risk for bacterial growth/multiplication due to their storage at ambient temperature (20 +/- 2 degrees c). consequences of blood contamination could be effectively prevented or reduced by pathogen inactivation systems. the aim of this study was to determine  the mirasol pathogen reduction technology (prt) system efficacy in pcs using an artificial bacteria-contamination model. methods: according to the abo blood groups, pc units (n = 216) were pooled into 54 pools (pc-ps). pc-ps were divided  into three equal groups, with 18 units in each, designed for an artificial bacteria-contamination. briefly, pc-ps were contaminated by staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus or escherichia coli in concentrations 10(2) to 10(7) colony forming units (cfu) per unit. afterward, pc-ps were underwent to inactivation by mirasol prt system, using uv (lambda = 265-370 nm) activated riboflavin (rb). all pc-ps were assayed by bact/alert microbial detection system  for cfu quantification before and after the mirasol treatment. samples from non-inactivated pc-p units were tested after preparation and immediately following bacterial contamination. samples from mirasol treated units were quantified for cfus one hour, 3 days and 5 days after inactivation. results. a complete inactivation of all bacteria species was obtained at cfu concentrations  of 10(2) and 10(3) per pc-p unit through storage/investigation period. the most effective inactivation (10(5) cfu per pc-p unit) was obtained in escherichia coli setting. contrary, inactivation of all the three tested bacteria species was unworkable in concentrations of > or = 10(6) cfu per pc-p unit. conclusion: efficient inactivation of investigated bacteria types with a significant cfu depletion in pc-p units was obtained--3 log for all three tested species, and 5 log for escherichia coli. the safety of blood component therapy, primarily the clinical use of pcs can be improved using the mirasol prt system.

TI  == photodynamic inactivation of drug-resistant bacteria isolated from diabetic foot  ulcers.
AB  == background and objectives: due to the extensive use of antibiotics, the spread of drug-resistant bacteria is one of the most worrisome threats to public health. one strategy that can be used to overcome potential shortcomings might be the inactivation of these organisms by photodynamic therapy. in this study, we have investigated whether drug-resistant wound-associated organisms (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli) are sensitive to lethal  photosensitization using the dye methylene blue coupled with laser light of 660 nm. materials and methods: effect of photosensitizer concentration (25, 50, 100 microg/ml) and laser light dose (27.3, 54.6 and 109.2 j/cm(2)) on lethal photosensitization was investigated. results: all species were susceptible to killing by photodynamic inactivation. the bactericidal effect was not dependent on the concentration of methylene blue but it was dependent on the light dose. methylene blue photosensitization using red laser light (109.2 j/cm(2)) was able  to achieve reductions of 99.03% and 98.95% in the viable counts of s. aureus and  s. epidermidis (using starting concentrations of 10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml). eradication of 92.23% were obtained for e. coli (initial concentration 10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml) photosensitized by the red light (109.2 j/cm(2)). conclusion: these findings imply that mb in combination with red light may be an effective means of eradicating drug- resistant bacteria from wounds.

TI  == effects of cranberry extracts on growth and biofilm production of escherichia coli and staphylococcus species.
AB  == biofilm producing bacteria such as staphylococcus species and escherichia coli are the most common cause of catheter related urinary tract infections (utis). the american cranberry (vaccinium macrocarpon) is utilized widely as a prophylaxis for utis due to its prevention of microbial adhesion. cranberry contains proanthocyanidins (pacs), which have been implicated as active constituents responsible for its bacterial antiadhesive properties. despite overwhelming data supporting cranberry's beneficial effects against human pathogenic bacteria, there is limited information regarding its effects on biofilm formation. this study evaluated the effects of three proprietary pac-standardized cranberry extracts on the inhibition of bacterial growth and biofilm production against a panel of clinically relevant pathogens: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, clinical methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus saprophyticus and escherichia coli. the extracts inhibited the growth of the gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus spp.) but not  the gram-negative species (e. coli) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range 0.02-5 mg/ml. the extracts also inhibited biofilm production by the gram-positive bacteria but did not eradicate their established biofilm. these results suggest that cranberry may have beneficial effects against the growth and biofilm producing capability of gram-positive bacteria pathogens.

TI  == bactericidal effect of silver-reinforced carbon nanotube and hydroxyapatite composites.
AB  == bacterial infection remains an important risk factor after orthopedic surgery. the present paper reports the synthesis of hydroxyapatite-silver (ha-ag) and carbon nanotube-silver (cnt-ag) composites via spark plasma sintering (sps) route. the retention of the initial phases after sps was confirmed by phase analysis using x-ray diffraction and raman spectroscopy. energy dispersive spectrum analysis showed that ag was distributed uniformly in the cnt/ha matrix.  the breakage of cnts into spheroid particles at higher temperatures (1700) is attributed to the rayleigh instability criterion. mechanical properties (hardness and elastic modulus) of the samples were evaluated using nanoindentation testing. ag reinforcement resulted in the enhancement of hardness (by ~15%) and elastic modulus (~5%) of ha samples, whereas ag reinforcement in cnt, ag addition does not have much effect on hardness (0.3 gpa) and elastic modulus (5 gpa). the antibacterial tests performed using escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant decrease (by ~65-86%) in the number of adhered bacteria in ha/cnt composites reinforced with 5% ag nanoparticles. thus, ag-reinforced ha/cnt can serve as potential antibacterial biocomposites.

AB  == pathogenic biofilms have been associated with persistent infections due to their  high resistance to antimicrobial agents. to identify nontoxic biofilm inhibitors  for enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7, the spent media of a 4,104 actinomycetes library was screened. the culture spent medium (1%, v/v) of plant pathogen rhodococcus sp. bfi 332 markedly inhibited e. coli o157:h7 biofilm formation without affecting the growth of planktonic e. coli o157:h7 cells. rhodococcus sp. bfi 332 produced significant amounts of indole-3-acetaldehyde and indole-3-acetic acid, and the former of which reduced e. coli o157:h7 biofilm formation. global transcriptome analyses showed that indole-3-acetaldehyde most repressed two curli operons, csgbac and csgdefg, and induced tryptophanase (tnaab) in e. coli o157:h7 biofilm cells. electron microscopy showed that spent medium of rhodococcus sp. bfi 332 and indole-3-acetaldehyde reduced curli production in e. coli o157:h7. the spent medium of rhodococcus sp. bfi 332 also significantly reduced the biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. overall, this study suggests that indole derivatives  are present in the actinomycetes strains and they can be used as biofilm inhibitors against pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == prosthetic vascular graft infections between blood and concordance of graft culture pathogen.
AB  == introduction: prosthetic vascular graft infection (pvgi) is an infrequent and potentially fatal complication of abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery and occlusive vascular disease. the predictive value of blood cultures in accurately identifying the causative pathogen (or pathogens) has not been determined. methods: we studied the compatibility between results of blood and graft cultures obtained from patients suffering from late-onset (>4 months after surgery) infections of abdominal prosthetic vascular grafts. results: among 17 patients who suffered from late-onset abdominal pvgi, only in 3 patients (17.6%), the same microorganisms isolated from blood cultures were also identified by direct cultures from excised grafts or perigraft tissues. three patients (17.6%) had negative blood cultures and the rest (n = 11; 64.7%) had different growth of microorganisms from the blood and graft cultures. three patients were diagnosed with chronic q fever vascular graft infection, all of whom had positive blood cultures. on the basis of graft cultures, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli were responsible for nearly 50% of cases. conclusion: the yield  of blood cultures in late-onset abdominal pvgis is low. presence of microorganisms in blood cultures does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship with graft infection. an empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is advised in all suspected cases until a definitive etiology has been made.

TI  == in vivo antioxidative property, antimicrobial and wound healing activity of flower extracts of pyrostegia venusta (ker gawl) miers.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: pyrostegia venusta (ker gawl) miers. (bignoniaceae), has been traditionally used as a remedy for treating white patches and infections on the skin (leukoderma, vitiligo). aim of the study: to investigate wound healing and antimicrobial activity of flower extract of pyrostegia venusta, including in vivo antioxidant activity. materials and methods: methanolic extracts of pyrostegia venusta flowers were studied for wound healing efficiency along with its effect on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was assessed using excision and incision model of wound repair in wistar rats. healing was assessed by the rate of wound contraction, tensile strength, breaking strength, hydroxyproline and hexosamine content. antimicrobial activity of the flower extract against twelve microorganisms was also assessed. in vivo antioxidant activity was performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. results: the results indicated that pyrostegia venusta extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. hydroxyproline and hexosamine expression were also correlative with the healing pattern observed. pyrostegia venusta extract exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against the  organisms: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and candida tropicana. during early wound healing phase tnf-alpha and il-6 level were found to be up regulated by pyrostegia venusta treatment. conclusion: increased wound contraction and tensile strength,  augmented hydroxyproline and hexosamine content along with antioxidative activity and moderate antimicrobial activity support the early wound healing exhibited by  pyrostegia venusta flower extract. induction in cytokine production may be one of the mechanisms involved in accelerating the wound healing by pyrostegia venusta extract. results suggest that pyrostegia venusta may be useful in the tropical management of wound healing.

TI  == locking tunneled hemodialysis catheters with hypertonic saline (26% nacl) and heparin to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections and thrombosis: a randomized, prospective trial.
AB  == objective: tunneled cuffed dual-lumen catheters (tccs) are commonly used for vascular access in hemodialysis (hd) patients. catheter-related bloodstream infection (crbsi) is the major problem leading to morbidity and mortality. we investigated whether 26% nacl solution has any favorable effect on the infections and thrombosis caused by hd catheters. methods: tccs were locked with either 26%  nacl and heparin or standard heparin. the primer end point of the study was the crbsi or thrombosis of the tcc. we compared the antimicrobial activity of the nacl solutions (6.5%, 13%, 26%) with 0.9% nacl solution by time-kill kinetic assay. all tests were performed in triplicate by incubation of test fluids with escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. results: the mean catheter survival was significantly higher in the 26% nacl and heparin group (129.5 +/- 50.1 catheter days to 103.3 +/- 59.8, p = 0.008). crbsi rates (10-15.4%) did not differ significantly between the two groups (p = 0.54). the hypertonic 13% nacl solution had bactericidal effects on e. coli and p. aeruginosa, but had bacteriostatic effect on s. aureus  and s. epidermidis. conclusion: in this study we demonstrated that the 13% nacl solution and more hypertonic nacl solutions revealed potent in vitro antimicrobial properties against all checked gram-negative microorganisms.

TI  == inactivation of microorganisms within collagen gel biomatrices using pulsed electric field treatment.
AB  == pulsed electric field (pef) treatment was examined as a potential decontamination method for tissue engineering biomatrices by determining the susceptibility of a  range of microorganisms whilst within a collagen gel. high intensity pulsed electric fields were applied to collagen gel biomatrices containing either escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae or the spores of aspergillus niger. the results established varying degrees of microbial pef susceptibility. when high initial cell densities (10(6)-10(7) cfu ml(-1)) were pef treated with 100 pulses  at 45 kv cm(-1), the greatest log reduction was achieved with s. cerevisiae (~6.5 log(10) cfu ml(-1)) and the lowest reduction achieved with s. epidermidis (~0.5 log(10) cfu ml(-1)). the results demonstrate that inactivation is influenced by the intrinsic properties of the microorganism treated. further investigations are required to optimise the microbial inactivation kinetics associated with pef treatment of collagen gel biomatrices.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial growth and biofilm production by constituents from hypericum spp.
AB  == biofilm embedded bacterial pathogens such as staphylococcus spp., escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii are difficult to eradicate and are major sources of bacterial infections. new drugs are needed to  combat these pathogens. hypericum is a plant genus that contains species known to have antimicrobial properties. however, the specific constituents responsible for the antimicrobial properties are not entirely known, nor have most compounds been tested as inhibitors of biofilm development. the investigation presented here tested seven secondary metabolites isolated from the species hypericum densiflorum, hypericum ellipticum, hypericum prolificum, and hypericum punctatum  as inhibitors of bacterial growth and biofilm production. assays were conducted against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, clinical methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii. five of the seven compounds demonstrated growth inhibition against the gram-positive bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.95 microg/ml to 7.81 microg/ml. four of the secondary metabolites inhibited biofilm production by certain gram-positive strains at sub-mic concentrations.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of different adenosine analogues.
AB  == nucleoside analogues may represent good candidates for the discovery of new antibacterial agents, therefore, a library of adenosine analogues was assessed for their antibacterial activity, and the relationship between the structure and  activity of these molecules was outlined. antibacterial activity was evaluated against that of reference strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we tested 54 adenosine analogues, modified both at ribose and base moieties, including adenine and 1/3-deazaadenine derivatives substituted in the 2- and/or n(6)-positions and bearing n-9 sugar moieties, such as ribose, 2'-deoxyribose, 3'-deoxyribose, 2',3'-dideoxyribose or cycloalkyl groups like cyclopentane. the data obtained, mic and minimal bactericidal concentrations demonstrated that the presence of bulky substituents such as cycloheptyl and cyclooctyl rings on the n(6)-amino, together with a chlorine atom in the 2-position, conferred antibacterial activity against the gram-positive group with mic values ranging from 16 to 128 mg l(-1). the intact sugar moiety seemed to be  not essential for antimicrobial activity and nucleosides bearing deoxyribose or cyclopentyl groups associated with bulky substituents in n(6)-position showed good antimicrobial properties. furthermore, n-1 proved to be non-crucial and the  2-chloro-n(6)-cyclooctyl-1-deaza-3'-deoxyadenosine and 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine compounds were among the more active in the series with an mic of 32 mg l(-1) against staph. aureus and strep. pneumoniae. none of the analogues was active against the two gram-negative species tested. hence, adenosine derivatives bearing bulky substituents in the n(6)-position may represent good lead compounds for the future discovery of a novel series of antibacterial agents.

AB  == we describe the discovery, purification, characterization, and expression of an antimicrobial peptide, epidermicin ni01, which is an unmodified bacteriocin produced by staphylococcus epidermidis strain 224. it is a highly cationic, hydrophobic, plasmid-encoded peptide that exhibits potent antimicrobial activity  toward a wide range of pathogenic gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococci, and biofilm-forming s. epidermidis strains. purification of the peptide was achieved  using a combination of hydrophobic interaction, cation exchange, and high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) analysis yielded a molecular mass of 6,074  da, and partial sequence data of the peptide were elucidated using a combination  of tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms) and de novo sequencing. the draft genome sequence of the producing strain was obtained using 454 pyrosequencing technology, thus enabling the identification of the structural gene using the de  novo peptide sequence data previously obtained. epidermicin ni01 contains 51 residues with four tryptophan and nine lysine residues, and the sequence showed approximately 50% identity to peptides lacticin z, lacticin q, and aureocin a53,  all of which belong to a new family of unmodified type ii-like bacteriocins. the  peptide is active in the nanomolar range against s. epidermidis, mrsa isolates, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. other unique features displayed by epidermicin include a high degree of protease stability and the ability to retain antimicrobial activity over a ph range of 2 to 10, and exposure to the peptide does not result in development of resistance in susceptible isolates. in this study we also show the structural gene alone can be cloned into escherichia coli  strain bl21(de3), and expression yields active peptide.

TI  == thymic stromal lymphopoietin exerts antimicrobial activities.
AB  == thymic stromal lymphopoietin (tslp) is an interleukin-7-like cytokine expressed by epithelial cells and reported to be involved in allergic diseases and atopic eczema. the presence of several predicted alpha-helical regions in tspl, a structure characterizing many classical antimicrobial peptides (amps), prompted us to investigate whether tslp exerts antimicrobial activities. recombinant human tslp exerted antimicrobial activity, particularly against gram-negative bacteria. using synthetic overlapping peptide 20-mers of tslp, it was demonstrated that the antimicrobial effect is primarily mediated by the c-terminal region of the protein. mkk34 (mkkrrkrkvttnkcleqvsqlqglwrrfnrpllk), a peptide spanning a c-terminal alpha-helical region in tslp, showed potent antimicrobial activities,  in physiological salt conditions and in the presence of human plasma. fluorescent studies of peptide-treated bacteria, electron microscopy and liposome leakage models showed that mkk34 exerted membrane-disrupting effects comparable to those  of the classical amp ll-37. moreover, tslp was degraded into multiple fragments by staphylococcal v8 proteinase. one major antimicrobial degradation fragment was found to encompass the c-terminal antimicrobial region defined by the mkk34 peptide. we here describe a novel antimicrobial role for tslp. the antimicrobial  activity is primarily mediated by the c-terminal part of the protein. in combination with the previously known cytokine function of tslp, our result indicates dual functions of the molecule and a previously unknown role in host defense.

AB  == this study examined the effect of subinhibitory melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) essential oil on the development of antibiotic resistance in staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. frequencies of single-step antibiotic-resistant mutants were determined by inoculating bacteria cultured with or without subinhibitory tea tree oil onto agar containing 2 to 8 times the mic of each antibiotic and with or without tea tree oil. whereas most differences in resistance frequencies were relatively minor, the combination of kanamycin and tea tree oil yielded approximately 10-fold fewer resistant e. coli mutants than kanamycin alone. the development of multistep antibiotic resistance in the presence of tea tree oil or terpinen-4-ol was examined by culturing s. aureus and e. coli isolates daily with antibiotic alone, antibiotic with tea tree oil, and antibiotic with terpinen-4-ol for 6 days. median mics for each antibiotic alone increased 4- to 16-fold by day 6. subinhibitory tea tree oil or terpinen-4-ol did not greatly alter results, with day 6 median mics being either the same as or one concentration different from those for antibiotic alone. for tea tree oil and terpinen-4-ol alone, day 6 median mics had increased 4-fold for s. aureus (n = 18) and 2-fold for e. coli (n = 18) from baseline values. lastly, few significant changes in antimicrobial susceptibility were seen for s. aureus and s. epidermidis isolates that had been serially subcultured 14 to 22 times with subinhibitory terpinen-4-ol. overall, these data indicate that tea tree oil and terpinen-4-ol have little impact on the development of antimicrobial resistance and susceptibility.

TI  == exploring the dna binding mode of transition metal based biologically active compounds.
AB  == few novel 4-aminoantipyrine derived schiff bases and their metal complexes were synthesized and characterized. their structural features and other properties were deduced from the elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility and molar conductivity as well as from mass, ir, uv-vis, (1)h nmr and epr spectral studies. the binding of the complexes with ct-dna was analyzed by electronic absorption spectroscopy, viscosity measurement, and cyclic voltammetry. the interaction of the metal complexes with dna was also studied by molecular modeling with special  reference to docking. the experimental and docking results revealed that the complexes have the ability of interaction with dna of minor groove binding mode.  the intrinsic binding constants (k(b)) of the complexes with ct-dna were found out which show that they are minor groove binders. gel electrophoresis assay demonstrated the ability of the complexes to cleave the puc19 dna in the presence of ah(2) (ascorbic acid). moreover, the oxidative cleavage studies using distamycin revealed the minor groove binding for the newly synthesized 4-aminoantipyrine derived schiff bases and their metal complexes. evaluation of antibacterial activity of the complexes against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, and klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited that the complexes have potent biocidal activity  than the free ligands.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of anthemis  altissima l. var. altissima.
AB  == the essential oil obtained from the flowering parts of anthemis altissima l. var. altissima was analysed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectroscopy. in this study, 34 compounds representing 98.76% of the essential oil were identified. the main components were alpha-terpineol (26.42%), beta-pinene (9.23%), cis-chrysanthenyl acetate (6.30%), globulol (5.36%), n-tricosane (4.41%), terpinen-4-ol (4.08%) and 1,8 cineole (3.84%). antibacterial activities of the essential oil and its two major components (alpha-terpineol and beta-pinene) were determined using microdilution method against both gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. the essential oil showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity (mics ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 microl ml(-1)). it was found that alpha-terpineol with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of  the range 0.87-1.56 microl ml(-1) was a more potent antibacterial agent than beta-pinene with mic values of the range 1.56-6.25 microl ml(-1). all of them, the essential oil, beta-pinene and alpha-terpineol, were more effective against gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative ones.

TI  == rapid detection of food- and waterborne bacteria using surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy coupled with silver nanosubstrates.
AB  == development of rapid and sensitive methods to detect pathogens is important to food and water safety. this study aimed to detect and discriminate important food- and waterborne bacteria (i.e., escherichia coli o157:h7, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecelis) by surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy (sers) coupled with intracellular nanosilver  as sers substrates. an in vivo molecular probing using intracellular nanosilver for the preparation of bacterial samples was established and assessed. satisfactory sers performance and characteristic sers spectra were obtained from  different bacterial samples. distinctive differences were observed in sers spectral data, specifically in the raman shift region of 500-1,800 cm(-1), and between bacterial samples at the species and strain levels. the detection limit of sers coupled with in vivo molecular probing using silver nanosubstrates could  reach the level of single cells. experiments with a mixture of e. coli o157:h7 and s. epidermidis for sers measurement demonstrate that sers could be used for classification of mixed bacterial samples. transmission electron microscopy was used to characterize changes of morphology and cellular composition of bacterial  cells after treatment of intracellular nanosilver. the results indicate that sers coupled with intracellular silver nanosubstrates is a promising method for detection and characterization of food- and waterborne pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial samples.

TI  == synthesis and characterization of poly(n-hydroxyethylacrylamide) for long-term antifouling ability.
AB  == development of biomaterials with long-term biocompatibility, durability, and stability remains a critical challenge for biomedical devices. here, we synthesize, characterize, and graft poly(n-(2-hydroxyethyl)acrylamide) (polyheaa) onto both gold surfaces and gold nanoparticles (aunps) via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (si-atrp) to form a stable antifouling coating to resist nonspecific protein adsorption and bacterial attachment. surface plasmon resonance (spr) results demonstrate that all of polyheaa brushes coated on the gold substrate at a wide range of film thickness of ~10-40 nm can achieve almost  zero protein adsorption from undiluted blood plasma and serum for 1 h, while static bacteria assay results show that polyheaa brushes prohibit long-term bacterial colonization by staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli rp437 up to 3 days. moreover, the polyheaa-coated aunps with different diameters remain their hydrodynamic sizes unchanged in human blood plasma and serum for up to 7 days. all these data indicate that polyheaa can serve as promising biomaterials with long-term biocompatibility and durability suitable for applications in complex biological media.

TI  == efficacy of intravascular catheter lock solutions containing preservatives in the prevention of microbial colonization.
AB  == there is little published evidence regarding whether heparin lock solutions containing preservatives prevent catheter-related infections. however, adverse effects from preservative-containing flushes have been documented in neonates, leading many hospitals to avoid their use altogether. infection control records from 1982 to 2008 at st. jude children's research hospital (sjcrh) were reviewed  regarding the incidence of catheter-related infections and the use of preservative-containing intravenous locks. in addition, the antimicrobial activities of heparin lock solution containing the preservatives parabens (0.165%) or benzyl alcohol (0.9%), and 70% ethanol were examined against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, and compared with preservative-free saline with and without heparin. growth was assessed after exposure to test solutions for 0, 2, 4 and 24h at 35 degrees c. the activities of preservatives were assessed against both planktonic (free-floating) and sessile (biofilm-embedded) micro-organisms using the mbec assay. infection control records revealed two periods of increased catheter-related infections, corresponding with two intervals when preservative-free heparin was used at sjcrh. heparin solution containing preservatives demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile forms of all six microbial species. ethanol demonstrated the greatest antimicrobial activity, especially following short incubation periods. heparin lock solutions containing  the preservatives parabens or benzyl alcohol, and 70% ethanol demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile micro-organisms commonly responsible for catheter-related infections. these findings, together with the authors' historical infection control experience, support the use of preservatives in intravenous lock solutions to reduce catheter related infections in patients beyond the neonatal period.

TI  == the persistent microbicidal effect in water exposed to the corona discharge.
AB  == this article describes and particularly explains a new phenomenon of persistent microbicidal effect of water previously exposed to the low-temperature plasma, which cannot be attributed to the acidification only. the direct microbicidal action of plasma is well documented, being mediated by number of reactive particles with a short lifetime. however, we observed the microbicidal effect also in exposed water stored for a month, where it must be mediated by stable particles. in water and in phosphate-buffered saline, the formation of no(x) and  corresponding acids, h(2)o(2) and o(3) was confirmed after exposition to the low-temperature plasma generated in air by dc negative glow corona and positive streamer discharge. the time course of acidification, h(2)o(2) and o(3) formation were deremined. except uncertain traces of hcn, sift-ms analysis of exposed liquids reveals no additional reactive compounds. the microbicidal effect persists almost unchanged during 4 weeks of storage, although o(3) completely and h(2)o(2) almost disappears. staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli were  inactivated within 10 min of incubation in exposed liquids, candida albicans needs at least 1 h. the solutions prepared by artificial mixing of reactive compounds mimic the action of exposed water, but in lesser extent. the acid milieu is the main cause of the microbicidal effect, but the possibility of still unidentified additional compound remains open.

TI  == biodegradable tocopherol acetate as a drug carrier to prevent ureteral stent-associated infection.
AB  == biomaterial-centred bacterial infections present common and challenging complications with medical implants like ureteral stent which provide substratum  for the biofilm formation. hence the purpose of this study is to make antibacterial stent surface with biodegradable polymer (tocopherol acetate) and anti-infective agents (norfloxacin and metronidazole) using a modified dip-coating procedure. this is done by impregnating the stent pieces in the anti-infective solution (a mixture of norfloxacin-metronidazole and polymer) for  uniform surface coating (drug-carrier-coated stents). after coating, agar diffusion test was performed as qualitative test to find out the sensitivity of coated stents against the clinical isolates, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli. quantitative test was measured by calculating the numbers of adhered bacteria on coated and uncoated stents by incubating the stent pieces in  artificial urine. difference in the number of viable bacteria adhered on the surface of coated and uncoated stents were statistically calculated using chi square test with p < 0.05 considered significant. the stent colonising ability of staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli in a controlled environment chamber was determined using two-challenge dose of the isolates by in vitro challenge test. in qualitative test, the zone of inhibition around the coated stents showed sensitivity against the clinical isolates. in quantitative test, the number of adhered bacteria on the surface of coated stents was reduced to a significant level (p < 0.05). the polymer, tocopherol acetate is highly biodegradable in nature. due to its degrading ability in body tissues, it releases the anti-infective drugs at a constant and sustained rate.

AB  == carbon nanotubes (cnts) have been widely used in a variety of applications because of their unique structure and excellent mechanical and electrical properties. additionally, silver (ag) nanoparticles exhibit broad-spectrum biocidal activity toward many different bacteria, fungi, and viruses. in this study, we prepared ag-coated cnt hybrid nanoparticles (ag/cnts) using aerosol nebulization and thermal evaporation/condensation processes and tested their usefulness for antimicrobial air filtration. droplets were generated from a cnt suspension using a six-jet collison nebulizer, passed through a diffusion dryer to remove moisture, and entered a thermal tube furnace where silver nanoparticles were generated by thermal evaporation/condensation at approximately 980 degrees c in a nitrogen atmosphere. the cnt and ag nanoparticle aerosols mixed together and attached to each other, forming ag/cnts. for physicochemical characterization, the ag/cnts were introduced into a scanning mobility particle sizer (smps) for size distribution measurements and were sampled by the nanoparticle sampler for morphological and elemental analyses. for antimicrobial air filtration applications, the airborne ag/cnt particles generated were deposited continuously onto an air filter medium. physical characteristics (fiber morphology, pressure drop, and filtration efficiency) and biological characteristics (antimicrobial tests against staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli bioaerosols) were evaluated. real-time smps and transmission electron microscopy (tem) data showed  that ag nanoparticles that were <20 nm in diameter were homogeneously dispersed and adhered strongly to the cnt surfaces. because of the attachment of ag nanoparticles onto the cnt surfaces, the total particle surface area concentration measured by a nanoparticle surface area monitor (nsam) was lower than the summation of each ag nanoparticle and cnt generated. when ag/cnts were deposited on the surface of an air filter medium, the antimicrobial activity against test bacterial bioaerosols was enhanced, compared with the deposition of  cnts or ag nanoparticles alone, whereas the filter pressure drop and bioaerosol filtration efficiency were similar to those of cnt deposition only. at a residence time of 2 h, the relative microbial viabilities of gram-positive s. epidermidis were approximately 32, 13, 5, and 0.9% on the control, cnt-, ag nanoparticle-, and ag/cnt-deposited filters, respectively, and those of gram-negative e. coli were 13, 2.1, 0.4, and 0.1% on the control, cnts, ag nanoparticles, and ag/cnts, respectively. these ag/cnt hybrid nanoparticles may be useful for applications in biomedical devices and antibacterial control systems.

TI  == surface acoustic waves increase the susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms to antibiotic treatment.
AB  == bacterial urinary tract infections resulting from prolonged patient catheterization have become a major health problem. one of the major issues is bacterial resistance to antibiotic treatments due to biofilm formation inside the catheters, thus enhancing the search for alternative treatments. in the present study, a device containing a piezo element capable of transmitting low-frequency  surface acoustic waves (saw) onto the indwelling catheter was used. the saw were  able to eradicate biofilm-residing bacteria by >85% when applied simultaneously with an antibiotic in three clinically relevant species, viz. escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. moreover, transcriptome analysis revealed that saw can alter the transcription pattern of p. aeruginosa,  suggesting that this signal can be specifically sensed by the bacterium.

TI  == combating bacterial colonization on metals via polymer coatings: relevance to marine and medical applications.
AB  == metals are widely used in engineering as well as medical applications. however, their surfaces are easily colonized by bacteria that form biofilms. among the numerous concerns with biofilm formation, biocorrosion is of particular importance in industry, because structural integrity may be compromised, leading  to technical failures. in the food industry and medical field, biofilms also pose health risks. to inhibit bacterial colonization, the surfaces of metals can be coated with a polymeric layer which is antiadhesive and/or bactericidal. this article describes polymers that have these desired properties and the methodologies for immobilizing them on metal surfaces of relevance to the marine  and medical fields. the focus is on polymer coatings that have a high degree of stability in aqueous medium and do not leach out. the efficacies of the different polymer coatings against bacteria commonly encountered in marine (desulfovibrio desulfuricans) and medical applications (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli) are demonstrated.

TI  == typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr to assess genetic diversity.
AB  == the recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. the current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified dna, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. we have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis, escherichia coli, streptococcus thermophilus, bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. initially, purified dna and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. the conditions that were found to be optimal 8 mum of 10-mer primers, 3 mum magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. the rapd genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) pfu ml(-1) were highly reproducible. clustering by the pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar dna restriction pattern were indistinguishable. the results support the use of rapd-pcr for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of  their genetic diversity bypassing tedious dna purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.

TI  == decreasing bacterial colonization of external fixation pins through nitric oxide  release coatings.
AB  == objective: bacterial infection of the pin tract represents the most common complication associated with external fixation. this study was designed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of nitric oxide (no)-releasing xerogel films  applied to commercially pure titanium pins in a rat model. methods: pins were coated with xerogel solution through a dip-coating procedure. half of the xerogel-coated implant pins were modified into no donors and served as the no-releasing group, whereas the remaining pins were left unmodified to serve as non-no-releasing xerogel-coated controls. acid-etched pins served as uncoated controls. animal selection was randomized and every rat had one pin from each of  the three groups randomly allocated to the third, fourth, or fifth tail vertebrae. quantification of bacterial infection was performed 48 days postoperatively and the tissue-implant interface was inspected for clinical signs of infection on days 14 and 28 postimplantation. results: pin tract bacterial colony counts of the no-releasing group (170,000 +/- 181,000) were significantly  lower than both the xerogel-coated group (677,000 +/- 675,000) and the control group (1,181,000 +/- 2,717,000) 48 days postoperatively (p < 0.05). no significant difference in colony counts was observed between the xerogel-coated group and the control group. the no-releasing group also had significantly fewer  clinical signs of infection than both the coated and the control groups on postoperative day 28 (p < 0.05). conclusion: the application of no-releasing xerogel coatings can inhibit bacterial colonization of external fixation pins both during the initial postsurgical period and up to 48 days postimplantation.

TI  == initial efforts toward the optimization of arylomycins for antibiotic activity.
AB  == while most clinically used antibiotics were derived from natural products, the isolation of new broad-spectrum natural products has become increasingly rare and narrow-spectrum agents are typically deemed unsuitable for development because of intrinsic limitations of their scaffold or target. however, it is possible that the spectrum of a natural product antibiotic might be limited by specific resistance mechanisms in some bacteria, such as target mutations, and the spectra of such "latent" antibiotics might be reoptimized by derivatization, just as has  been done with clinically deployed antibiotics. we recently showed that the spectrum of the arylomycin natural product antibiotics, which act via the novel mechanism of inhibiting type i signal peptidase, is broader than previously believed and that resistance in several key human pathogens is due to the presence of a specific pro residue in the target peptidase that disrupts interactions with the lipopeptide tail of the antibiotic. to begin to test whether this natural resistance might be overcome by derivatization, we synthesized analogues with altered lipopeptide tails and identified several with  an increased spectrum of activity against s. aureus. the data support the hypothesis that the arylomycins are latent antibiotics, suggest that their spectrum may be optimized by derivatization, and identify a promising scaffold upon which future optimization efforts might focus.

TI  == surfactant free rapid synthesis of hydroxyapatite nanorods by a microwave irradiation method for the treatment of bone infection.
AB  == mesoporous nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (nhap) rods of size 40-75 nm long and 25 nm wide (resembling bone mineral) were synthesized under microwave irradiation without using any surfactants or modifiers. the surface area and average pore size of the nhap were found to be 32 m(2) g(-1) and 4 nm, respectively. rifampicin (rif) and ciprofloxacin (cpf) loaded nhap displayed an initial burst followed by controlled release (zero order kinetics). combination of cpf and rif  loaded nhap showed enhanced bacterial growth inhibition against staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epidermidis) and escherichia coli (e. coli) compared to individual agent loaded nhap and pure nhap. in addition, decreased bacterial adhesion (90%) was observed on the surface of cpf plus rif loaded nhap. the biocompatibility test toward mg63 cells infected with micro-organisms showed better cell viability and alkaline phosphatase activity (alp) for the combination of cpf and rif loaded nhap. the influence on cell viability of infected mg63 cells was attributed to the simultaneous and controlled release of cpf and rif from nhap, which prevented the emergence of subpopulations that were resistant to each other. hence, apart from the issue of  the rapid synthesis of nhap without surfactants or modifiers, the simultaneous and controlled release of dual drugs from nhap would be a simple, non-toxic and cost-effective method to treat bone infections.

TI  == broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition by kingella kingae exopolysaccharide.
AB  == cell-free extracts prepared from kingella kingae colony biofilms were found to inhibit biofilm formation by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, candida albicans,  and k. kingae. the extracts evidently inhibited biofilm formation by modifying the physicochemical properties of the cell surface, the biofilm matrix, and the substrate. chemical and biochemical analyses indicated that the biofilm inhibition activity in the k. kingae extract was due to polysaccharide. structural analyses showed that the extract contained two major polysaccharides.  one was a linear polysaccharide with the structure -->6)-alpha-d-glcnacp-(1-->5)-beta-d-oclap-(2-->, which was identical to a capsular polysaccharide produced by actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5. the second was a novel linear polysaccharide, designated pam galactan, with the structure -->3)-beta-d-galf-(1-->6)-beta-d-galf-(1-->. purified pam galactan exhibited broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition activity. a cluster of three k. kingae genes encoding udp-galactopyranose mutase (ugm) and two putative galactofuranosyl transferases was sufficient for the synthesis of pam galactan in escherichia coli. pam galactan is one of a growing number of bacterial polysaccharides that exhibit antibiofilm activity. the biological roles and potential technological applications of these molecules remain unknown.

TI  == cyclodextrin and maltodextrin finishing of a polypropylene abdominal wall implant for the prolonged delivery of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the aim of this work was to develop a polypropylene (pp) artificial abdominal wall implant for the prolonged release of ciprofloxacin (cfx). this sustained release effect was obtained by functionalization of the textile mesh with citric  acid and hydroxypropyl-gamma-cyclodextrin (hpgammacd) or maltodextrin (md). in both cases the textile finishing reaction yielded a cyclo- or malto-dextrin crosslinked polymer coating the fibers. the modified supports were characterized  by thermogravimetric analysis (tga), differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. the sorption capacities and the kinetics of cfx release were studied by batch tests coupled with spectrophotometric assays. microbiological assays were carried out on staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis and escherichia coli, while proliferation and viability tests used fibroblasts. the main results were as follows. (i) due to the differences between the range of temperature of thermal degradation of the (cyclo)dextrins polymers and of the pp fibers tga was a reliable method for quantifying the degree of functionalization of the textiles. (ii) both modified supports showed improved sorption/desorption capacities for cfx, compared with the virgin mesh. the hpgammacd-finished support showed an increased sorption capacity and a lower release rate of cfx compared with the md modified support. (iii) microbiological  assays confirmed the latter result, with greater sustained antibacterial activity of the hpgammacd treated support. these experiments have demonstrated the role of the cyclodextrin cavity in interactions with cfx: the antibiotic was not only adsorbed via hydrogen and acid-base interactions with the polyctr-hpgammacd network, but also via host-guest complexation. (iv) biological tests revealed a slight decrease in fibroblast proliferation after 6 days on the modified supports, but cell viability tests showed that this was not due to toxicity of the (cyclo)dextrin polymer coatings.

TI  == [photoinduced bactericidal activity of tio2 films].
AB  == a decline in cfu of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria on the surface of uv illuminated tio2 films (wavelength of 380 nm) is shown. a 29, 45, and 47% decrease in bacterial viability of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and escherichia coli, respectively, was seen following a 12-min exposition. it was first discovered that the reuse of tio2 films to test a bacterial suspension for viability removes uv-induced bactericidal activity. however, annealing of tio2 at a temperature above 400 degrees c restores the photoinduced bactericidal activity to its initial state.

TI  == changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern taiwan.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. we evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at  a tertiary medical center in northern taiwan. methods: we conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. the numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third  period, 1999-2005. results: during the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. a significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant s pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and  imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. additionally, a significant increase  in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for e coli, enterobacter cloacae, and a baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). however, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005  was found for groups a and b streptococci, non-a, b, d streptococci, and s pneumoniae. conclusion: resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.

TI  == peptide mimics of peptidoglycan are vaccine candidates and protect mice from infection with staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus drug resistance to antibiotics is a serious situation that  has drawn greater attention to immunotherapy and prophylaxis. peptidoglycan (pgn) is a common and conserved component of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria such as s. aureus. however, pgn, as a thymus-independent antigen, cannot be considered a vaccine candidate because of its very weak immunogenicity. in this study we have attempted to enhance the immunogenicity of pgn by identifying a pgn peptide mimic sequence that would act as a thymus-dependent antigen. several peptide sequences were obtained from a phage display peptide library using a mab  against s. aureus pgn, and a 12-mer linear single peptide (sp-31) and a four-branch multiple antigen peptide (map) (map-p31) were synthesized. both sp-31 and map-p31 were shown to bind directly to anti-pgn mab and a polyclonal antibody against s. aureus. these peptides could also inhibit the binding of pgn to a mab  against pgn. furthermore, map-p31 was able to provoke an effective secondary antibody response in mice to pgn and to cell-wall fragments isolated from s. aureus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa by sonication. in addition, the map-p31 antiserum showed a potent bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity against s. aureus in the presence and absence of complement in vitro. importantly, immunization with map-p31 significantly prolonged the survival and enhanced bacterial clearance in balb/c mice challenged with live s. aureus. in addition, the serum igg-type antibodies against pgn persisted in mice, demonstrating that map-p31, as a peptide mimicking epitopes on pgn, provokes an effective secondary or memory antibody response, which can only  be induced by a thymus-dependent antigen and which protects against infection with s. aureus. these results suggest that map-31 may be a novel vaccine candidate against s. aureus.

TI  == a type iv modification-dependent restriction enzyme sauusi from staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus usa300.
AB  == a gene encoding a putative dna helicase from staphylococcus aureus usa300 was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the protein was purified to over 90% purity by chromatography. the purified enzyme, sauusi, predominantly cleaves modified dna containing 5mc and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. cleavage of 5mc-modified plasmids indicated that the sites s5mcngs (s = c or g) are preferentially digested. the endonuclease activity requires the presence of adenosine triphosphate (atp) or datp whereas the non-hydrolyzable gamma-s-atp does not support activity. sauusi activity was inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. it is most active in mg(++) buffers. no companion methylase gene was found  near the sauusi restriction gene. the absence of a cognate methylase and cleavage of modified dna indicate that sauusi belongs to type iv restriction endonucleases, a group that includes ecok mcrbc and mrr. sauusi belongs to a family of highly similar homologs found in other sequenced s. aureus, s. epidermidis and s. carnosus genomes. more distant sauusi orthologs can be found in over 150 sequenced bacterial/archaea genomes. finally, we demonstrated the biological function of the type iv rease in restricting 5mc-modified plasmid dna  by transformation into clinical s. aureus strain sa564, and in restricting phage  lambda infection when the endonuclease is expressed in e. coli.

TI  == light-induced antibacterial activity of symmetrical and asymmetrical oligophenylene ethynylenes.
AB  == the light-induced antibacterial activity of symmetric and asymmetric oligophenylene ethynylenes (opes) was investigated against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli) bacteria. to understand the light-induced biocidal effect better, the transient absorption and triplet lifetime of opes were studied in methanol and water. a higher triplet lifetime was observed for ope samples in water than in methanol. the magnitudes of the changes in optical density (deltaod) of the s-ope-n(h) series of symmetric oligomers are much higher than that of the asymmetric ope-n series in water and are generally correlated with the singlet oxygen yield. it was found that the antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is size-, concentration-, and time-dependent. the light-induced antibacterial activity may result from the coordinated interactions of membrane disruption and interfacial or intracellular  singlet oxygen generation, and the dominant factor is most likely the latter. the results obtained in this study will aid in the design of more efficient biocides  in the future.

TI  == improving the antibacterial property of porcine small intestinal submucosa by nano-silver supplementation: a promising biological material to address the need  for contaminated defect repair.
AB  == objective: we hypothesize that introduction of nano-silver particles to porcine-derived small intestinal submucosa (ns-psis) would lead to significant enhancement in antibacterial property in repairing contaminated abdominal defect. background: porcine-derived small intestinal submucosa (psis) is an acellular and xenogenic biological material intensively used in repairing and regenerating wounded and dysfunctional tissues. surgical site infection (ssi) remains so far a serious problem and major challenge, particularly in contaminated tissue-deficient repairing. methods: self-assembly was used to fabricate ns-psis. the antibacterial property was evaluated in vitro and in vivo by means of repairing full-thickness contaminated abdominal defect in rats. the native psis and polypropylene-oxidized regenerated cellulose were served as controls. in addition, changes in biomechanical resistance, morphology and immunohistochemistry for inflammatory reaction and neovasculation in the repaired abdominal wall were analyzed. biosafety was investigated by pyrogen test, skin irritation test and silver measurement in vivo. results: ns-psis exhibited strong antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa on agar diffusion, with mean diameters of inhibition zone ranging from 11.9 to 23.5 mm. there were significantly lower ssi incidence and a tendency of better abdominal wall resistance in the ns-psis group as compared with the psis or polypropylene-oxidized regenerated cellulose group after repairing contaminated abdominal defect in rats. nano-silver modified psis did not change the native psis property in the tissue recolonization, remodeling and neovascularization. ns-psis was not pyrogenic or skin irritated, without silver residual in vivo after repairing contaminated abdominal defect. conclusion: nano-silver particles  to psis lead to significant enhancements in antibacterial property in vitro and in vivo without decreasing its biomechanical resistance and biocompatibility. this study provides proof of concept for the use of nano-silver modified naturally derived psis as an ideal scaffold for ssi prevention in the contaminated tissue-deficient repair.

TI  == a comparative study of sterility levels in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis system.
AB  == introduction: peritonitis remains a serious risk associated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd), although better patient education programs and such technological advances as improved automated connecting devices have greatly decreased its incidence over the past 20 years. the automated devices have a good resistance to contamination, but they rely on an external electrical  power source and are not easily portable. there has, therefore, been a need for a highly sterile nonelectric manual connecting device to complement the automated devices already in use. such a manual device has recently been developed. we compared the level of sterility after touch contamination in this new device with levels in 2 other connecting devices: a conventional device with a manual cap (jms co. ltd., hiroshima, japan), and a powered total containment device (jms co. ltd.). method: five bacteria frequently causing capd-related peritonitis (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans) were separately applied to the tip of each connecting device, and peritoneal washing fluid was injected as in a routine exchange. we used a membrane filter method to determine whether the route had been contaminated by the washing fluid. results: in the conventional device with  a manual cap, 3 to 4 colony-forming units (cfus) of s. aureus were detected in 2  of 10 drainage samples, 8 cfus of e. coli in 1 of 10 drainage samples, and 1 cfu  of e. coli in the injection fluid. in contrast, no contamination was detected in  the automated connecting device or the new manual cap device. conclusion: this study confirmed that the new device has a risk of touch contamination lower than  that of the conventional manual cap device and equal to that of the automated device. being easily portable and not reliant on an external power source, the new device should be useful in various situations.

AB  == bacterial lipoproteins are known to be diacylated or triacylated and activate mammalian immune cells via toll-like receptor 2/6 or 2/1 heterodimer. because the genomes of low g+c content gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, do not contain escherichia coli-type apolipoprotein n-acyltransferase, an enzyme  converting diacylated lipoproteins into triacylated forms, it has been widely believed that native lipoproteins of s. aureus are diacylated. however, we recently demonstrated that one lipoprotein sitc purified from s. aureus rn4220 strain was triacylated. almost simultaneously, another group reported that another lipoprotein sa2202 purified from s. aureus sa113 strain was diacylated. the determination of exact lipidated structures of s. aureus lipoproteins is thus crucial for elucidating the molecular basis of host-microorganism interactions. toward this purpose, we intensively used ms-based analyses. here, we demonstrate  that sitc lipoprotein of s. aureus rn4220 strain has two lipoprotein lipase-labile o-esterified fatty acids and one lipoprotein lipase-resistant fatty acid. further ms/ms analysis of the lipoprotein lipase digest revealed that the lipoprotein lipase-resistant fatty acid was acylated to alpha-amino group of the  n-terminal cysteine residue of sitc. triacylated forms of sitc with various length fatty acids were also confirmed in cell lysate of the rn4220 and triton x-114 phase in three other s. aureus strains, including sa113 strain and one staphylococcus epidermidis strain. moreover, four other major lipoproteins including sa2202 in s. aureus strains were identified as n-acylated. these results strongly suggest that lipoproteins of s. aureus are mainly in the n-acylated triacyl form.

TI  == prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern nigeria.
AB  == enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. the aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in osogbo, nigeria. the study was conducted between january and june 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of enterococcus species at the  bacteriology laboratory of ladoke akintola university of technology, osogbo using standard microbiological methods. there were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (hai); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. two species of enterococcus were identified; enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection  (uti) and surgical site infection (ssi) of 6 (85.7%) patients and enterococcus faecium from uti in 1 (14.3%) patient. other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were klebsiella spp 31.0%, pseudomonas spp 20.7%, staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, escherichia coli 12.1%, staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and serratia spp 1.7%. all the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) with the vre strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. other gram-positive and gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except e. coli and pseudomonas spp which  were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. this limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci  infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. there is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and  rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.

TI  == "scrub the hub": cleaning duration and reduction in bacterial load on central venous catheters.
AB  == this article reports the results of a study on the effect of alcohol disinfection duration on bacterial load on catheter hubs. three different levels of disinfection (3, 10, and 15 seconds) were analyzed as well as a positive and negative control. all hubs with the exception of the negative controls were contaminated with a 10 bacterial solution and allowed to dry for 24 hours. through each hub, 1 ml of sterile saline was flushed; a 10-mul calibrated loop was used to plate the flush onto blood agar. colony counts were performed on the  plates after a 24-hour incubation period. results revealed that the 3 different levels of disinfection duration were not found to differ significantly in reduction in bacterial load. the duration of disinfection did not significantly change the bacterial load on the hub. however, any disinfection duration significantly decreased the bacterial load as compared to the positive control. a larger study would likely detect a significant result among the disinfections.

TI  == application of air ions for bacterial de-colonization in air filters contaminated by aerosolized bacteria.
AB  == we aerosolized the escherichia coli (e. coli) and staphylococcus epidermidis (s.  epidermidis) bacteria and collected them on membrane filters. then we generated air ions by applying a high voltage to a carbon fiber tip and applied them to the contaminated filters. the antibacterial efficiency was not significantly affected by the bacteria being gram-positive or gram-negative, however, negative ions showed a lower antibacterial efficiency than positive ions to both e. coli and s. epidermidis, even though the concentration of negative air ions was much higher than that of positive air ions. with a field emission scanning electron microscope (fe-sem) images and fluorescence microscopy images using a live/dead baclight bacterial viability kit, electrostatic disruption of the bacteria was found to be the dominant antibacterial effect.

TI  == therapeutic efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus against bacterial isolates from burn wounds.
AB  == background: probiotics are live microorganisms which are mainly strains of lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp. when administered in adequate amounts, these microorganisms offer a health benefit for the host. probiotic organisms are also available commercially in milk, sour milk, ice cream and other foods. aims:  to identify bacterial species isolated from burn wounds, and also to evaluate (in-vitro) the therapeutic efficacy of lacto. acidophilus against these bacterial isolates. to compare this activity to other antibacterial agents which are used medically in the treatment of burn wound cases. materials and methods: burn wound swabs were obtained from 50 patients who had been admitted to hospitals in baghdad during august to november 2009. these swabs were inoculated onto enriched and differential culture media. subcultures were performed on selective media. the necessary biochemical tests were conducted and the organisms identified using standard procedures. susceptibility of isolated pathogens to local isolates lacto. acidophilus (with 1x10(8) cells/ml) and 10 commonly used burn wounds antibiotics was examined using standard susceptibility testing. results: ninety different organisms were isolated. gram-positive cocci accounted for 16 (17.7%) and gram-negative bacilli for 74 (82.2%) bacterial isolates. pseudomonas aeruginosa 30(33.3%) were the most commonly isolated organisms, followed by escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., klebsiella spp., proteus spp.(22.2,20,4.4,2.2%), respectively. staphylococcus aureus isolates were performed in 8(8.8%). however, the incidence of staphylococcus epidermidis was 2  (2.2%), while ss-haemolytic streptococci was 4(4.4%). in susceptibility testing,  lacto. acidophilus had coverage against 90 (100%) of 74 gram-negative and 16 of gram-positive bacteria tested. the coverage of the remaining 10 antibacterial agents used was different in their activity (resistance or sensitivity), which ranged between 50-100%. conclusion: the results of the study concluded that lactobacillus acidophilus concentration of 1x10(8) cells/ml had a high activity to inhibit the growth in-vitro of all pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria, which cause burn wound infections. this indicated the therapeutic efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria.

TI  == broad-spectrum antibiotic activity of the arylomycin natural products is masked by natural target mutations.
AB  == novel classes of broad-spectrum antibiotics are needed to treat multidrug-resistant pathogens. the arylomycin class of natural products inhibits  a promising antimicrobial target, type i signal peptidase (spase), but upon initial characterization appeared to lack whole-cell activity against most pathogens. here, we show that staphylococcus epidermidis, which is sensitive to the arylomycins, evolves resistance via mutations in spase and that analogous mutations are responsible for the natural resistance of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we identify diverse bacteria lacking these mutations and demonstrate that most are sensitive to the arylomycins. the results illustrate that the arylomycins have a broad-spectrum of activity and are viable candidates for development into therapeutics. the results also raise the possibility that naturally occurring resistance may have masked other natural product scaffolds that might be developed into therapeutics.

TI  == swnt-mwnt hybrid filter attains high viral removal and bacterial inactivation.
AB  == we describe the concept and demonstrate the efficacy of a novel swnt-mwnt hybrid  filter for the removal and inactivation of microbial pathogens from water. the filter is composed of a thin swnt layer (0.05 mg cm(-2)) on top of a thicker mwnt layer (0.27 mg cm(-2)) supported by a microporous support membrane. the swnt-mwnt filter exhibits high log removal of several model viruses (ms2, prd1, and t4 bacteriophages) by depth filtration, which predominantly takes place in the thicker and more uniform mwnt layer. the filter removes all bacteria by a sieving mechanism, with the top swnt layer providing high levels of inactivation of model bacteria (escherichia coli k12 and staphylococcus epidermidis), as well as microbes from river water and treated wastewater effluent. the dual-layer swnt-mwnt filter lays the framework for new possibilities in point-of-use water filtration.

TI  == chitosan-vancomysin composite biomaterial as a laser activated surgical adhesive  with regional antimicrobial activity.
AB  == we have used laser irradiation to enhance the natural adhesiveness of chitosan to form a thin film surgical adhesive. prevention of infection at surgical sites often utilizes systemic provision of antibiotics with reduced local efficacy and  potential side effects. in the work reported here, we investigate the bactericidal properties of laser-irradiated chitosan films and their impregnation with the antibiotic vancomycin. despite strong efficacy in solution, chitosan films showed no antimicrobial activity against representatives of common pathogens escherichia coli , staphylococcus aureus , and s. epidermidis . in contrast, a composite of chitosan adhesive and the antibiotic vancomycin showed therapeutically significant release profiles greater that the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for the staphylococci over a 28 day period. these composite films had greater crystallinity, up to 28 +/- 3 compared to 8.9 +/- 2%, for its unblended counterpart. despite a significant increase in material strength from 31.4 +/- 4 to 77.5 +/- 5 mpa, flexibility was still maintained with an elongation to break around 5 +/- 2% and fold endurance of approximately 30 +/- 3-folds. laser irradiation had no apparent effect on the release or activity of the antibiotic which survived transient temperatures at the film-tissue interface during infrared irradiation of around 54 degrees c. furthermore, significant adhesive strength was still apparent, 15.6 +/- 2 kpa. thus, we have developed a laser-activated bioadhesive with the potential to close wounds while facilitating the prevention of microbial infection through local release of antibiotic targeted to the site of potential infection.

TI  == bacterial growth kinetics in acd-a apheresis platelets: comparison of plasma and  pas iii storage.
AB  == background: our objective was to determine the growth kinetics of bacteria in leukoreduced apheresis platelets (lr-ap) in a platelet (plt) additive solution (pas; intersol, fenwal, inc.) compared to lr-ap stored in plasma. study design and methods: hyperconcentrated, double-dose lr-ap were collected from healthy donors with a separator (amicus, fenwal, inc.). lr-ap were evenly divided, intersol was added to half (65% intersol:35% plasma [pas]), and plts in autologous plasma were used for a paired control (pl). bacteria were inoculated into each lr-ap pas/pl pair (0.5-1.6 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml), and bacterial growth was followed for up to 7 days. time to the end of the lag phase, doubling times, maximum concentration (conc-max), and time to maximum concentration (time-max) were estimated. results: streptococcus viridans did not  grow to detectable levels in either pas or pl units. the other bacteria had no significant overall difference in the conc-max (p = 0.47) or time-max (p = 0.7) between pl and pas lr-ap; pl had a 0.14 hours faster doubling rate (p = 0.023); and pas had a 4.7 hours shorter lag time (p = 0.016). conclusion: we observed that five index organisms will grow in lr-ap stored in a 35%:65% ratio of plasma  to intersol where initial bacterial concentrations are 0.5 to 1.6 cfus/ml. the more rapid initiation of log-phase growth for bacteria within a pas storage environment resulted in a bacterial concentration up to 4 logs higher in the pas  units compared to the plasma units at 24 hours, but with no difference in the conc-max. this may present an early bacterial detection advantage for pas-stored  plts.

AB  == background: chlorhexidine gluconate (chg) and povidone iodine (pi) are rarely used concurrently despite a lack of evidence regarding functional incompatibility of these agents. methods: chg and pi, alone and combined, were evaluated against  staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible s aureus [mssa] and methicillin-resistant s aureus [mrsa]), staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli using checkerboard microbroth dilution techniques. minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was the concentration (percent wt/vol) that reduced bacterial burden >/= 5-log(10) colony-forming units/ml at 2 hours when compared with bacterial densities in growth controls. fractional bactericidal concentration indexes (fbcis) were calculated to determine chg and pi compatibility. additionally, tissue plugs from freshly excised porcine vaginal mucosa were infected with s aureus (mssa), treated for 2 hours with chg 3%, pi 5%, or chg 3% and pi 5% combined and then viable bacteria on the tissue plugs enumerated. results: in broth, chg demonstrated dose-dependent bactericidal activity, whereas pi activity was all-or-none. all isolates studied were similarly susceptible to chg (mbcs: 0.0078% +/- 0.0019%, 0.0069% +/- 0.0026%, 0.0024% +/- 0.0005%, 0.0024% +/- 0.0005%, 0.0059% +/- 0.0%, and 0.0029% +/- 0.0%, respectively). the mbcs of pi were identical (0.625%) for all isolates. overall, fbci calculations showed indifference. treatment of mssa-infected porcine tissue for 2 hours demonstrated  that the chg-pi combination was superior to either antiseptic alone. conclusion:  fbcis, determined in broth culture, indicate that combining chg and pi had no negative impact on antisepsis. moreover, data from an ex vivo porcine mucosal infection model suggest a potential benefit when combining the 2 antiseptic agents.

TI  == efficacy of local rifampin/minocycline delivery (aigis(rx)(r)) to eliminate biofilm formation on implanted pacing devices in a rabbit model.
AB  == purpose: device-related infections represent a significant clinical challenge. once established, these infections prove difficult to treat with existing antibiotic regimens, compromising the health of device recipients, and usually requiring surgical intervention to resolve. the purpose of this study was to determine the ability of the aigis(rx)(r) anti-bacterial envelope to reduce the formation of bacterial biofilm on implanted pacing devices. methods: an infection was established in a rabbit model by creating bilateral subcutaneous implant pockets, into which a pacing device with or without aigis(rx)(r) was placed. the  incisions were closed, and a defined dose of bacteria was infused into each implant pocket. after seven days, devices were explanted and assessed for viable  bacteria by a sonication/vortex procedure to quantify bacteria, and by imaging of the device surface by scanning electron microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy. results: the presence of the aigis(rx)(r) envelope eliminated recoverable, viable bacteria from the explanted devices using a vortex/sonication technique from in vivo models of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis, and escherichia coli infections. scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy demonstrate greatly reduced biological material on the pacemaker surfaces in the presence of the aigis(rx)(r) envelope compared to untreated controls. conclusion: these results demonstrate that in this animal model, the aigis(rx)(r) device reduces the formation of adherent bacteria and reduces bioburden on implanted, infected pacemaker devices.

AB  == honey has potent activity against both antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant bacteria, and is an interesting agent for topical antimicrobial application to wounds. as honey is diluted by wound exudate, rapid bactericidal activity up to high dilution is a prerequisite for its successful application. we investigated the kinetics of the killing of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by rs honey, the source for the production of revamil(r) medical-grade honey, and we aimed to enhance the rapid bactericidal activity of rs honey by enrichment with its endogenous compounds or the addition of antimicrobial peptides (amps). rs honey killed antibiotic-resistant isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium, and burkholderia cepacia within 2 h, but lacked such rapid activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli. it was not feasible to enhance the rapid activity of rs honey by enrichment with endogenous  compounds, but rs honey enriched with 75 mum of the synthetic peptide bactericidal peptide 2 (bp2) showed rapid bactericidal activity against all species tested, including mrsa and esbl e. coli, at up to 10-20-fold dilution. rs honey enriched with bp2 rapidly killed all bacteria tested and had a broader spectrum of bactericidal activity than either bp2 or honey alone.

AB  == this study was designed to determine the degree and type of bacterial contamination of ejaculated semen samples in fertile rams and its consequences on sperm quality during storage. in experiment 1, 68 ejaculates from 36 rams were divided into two aliquots, one of which was used for bacterial culture, while the other one was diluted, stored at 15 degrees c and assessed for plasma membrane integrity and motility at 0, 24 and 48h after dilution. from the 68 ejaculates, 66 were positive for aerobic bacteria, including 20 species of bacteria from 14 genera. the most frequently isolated bacteria were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermis, and staphylococcus aureus species. these 5 bacteria were present in 97% of all contaminated samples. all contaminant bacteria were found to be sensitive to gentamicin and to ceftiofur, with variable percentages of resistance to the other antibiotics evaluated. in samples with total enterobacteria count lower than 100 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml, higher proportions of motile and progressive sperm and higher velocities of spermatozoa were observed at different times during storage. in experiment 2, pure cultures of the most frequently isolated bacteria  were individually added to fresh semen samples of low contamination and tested for their effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees c. semen with e.  coli showed a drastic reduction in motility, velocity and viability during storage. this reduction was also significant, but less drastic, in semen with e.  cloacae and p. mirabilis, whereas it was partial and less pronounced in the other groups (s. epidermidis and s. aureus). in conclusion, the contamination of ram semen with enterobacterial species reduced sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees c, and the antibiotics gentamicin and ceftiofur showed the higher antimicrobial activities.

TI  == bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  == non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. the purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. overall, gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than gram-positive bacteria. for the gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cenocepacia and escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. the susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the sa  78 and atcc 6538 strains, respectively. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. a rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with p. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive staphylococcus aureus  strain sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. a 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. a 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated p. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. a statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated  animals after the third day of the course. wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.

TI  == bacterial bloodstream infections in hiv-infected adults attending a lagos teaching hospital.
AB  == an investigation was carried out during october 2005-september 2006 to determine  the prevalence of bloodstream infections in patients attending the outpatient department of the hiv/aids clinic at the lagos university teaching hospital in nigeria. two hundred and one patients--86 males and 115 females--aged 14-65 years were recruited for the study. serological diagnosis was carried out on them to confirm their hiv status. their cd4 counts were done using the micromagnetic bead method. twenty ml of venous blood sample collected from each patient was inoculated into a pair of oxoid signal blood culture bottles for 2-14 days. thereafter, 0.1 ml of the sample was plated in duplicates on macconkey, blood and chocolate agar media and incubated at 37 degrees c for 18-24 hours. the cd4+ counts were generally low as 67% of 140 patients sampled had < 200 cells/microl of blood. twenty-six bacterial isolates were obtained from the blood samples and  comprised 15 (58%) coagulase-negative staphylococci as follows: staphylococcus epidermidis (7), s. cohnii cohnii (1), s. cohnii urealyticum (2), s. chromogenes  (1), s. warneri (2), s. scuri (1), and s. xylosus (1). others were 6 (23%) gram-negative non-typhoid salmonella spp., s. typhimurium (4), s. enteritidis (2); pseudomonas fluorescens (1), escherichia coli (1), ochrobactrum anthropi (1), moraxella sp. (1), and chryseobacterium meningosepticum. results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed that coagulase-negative staphylococci had good sensitivities to vancomycin and most other antibiotics screened but were resistant mainly to ampicilin and tetracycline. the gram-negative organisms isolated also showed resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and septrin. this study demonstrates that coagulase-negative staphylococci and non-typhoidal salmonellae are the most common aetiological agents of bacteraemia  among hiv-infected adults attending the lagos university teaching hospital, nigeria. the organisms were resistant to older-generation antibiotics often prescribed in this environment but were sensitive to vancomycin, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, and other new-generation antibiotics.

TI  == role of surface protein sasg in biofilm formation by staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the sasg surface protein of staphylococcus aureus has been shown to promote the formation of biofilm. sasg comprises an n-terminal a domain and repeated b domains. here we demonstrate that sasg is involved in the accumulation phase of biofilm, a process that requires a physiological concentration of zn(2+). the b domains, but not the a domain, are required. purified recombinant b domain protein can form dimers in vitro in a zn(2+)-dependent fashion. furthermore, the  protein can bind to cells that have b domains anchored to their surface and block biofilm formation. the full-length sasg protein exposed on the cell surface is processed within the b domains to a limited degree, resulting in cleaved proteins of various lengths being released into the supernatant. some of the released molecules associate with the surface-exposed b domains that remain attached to the cell. studies using inhibitors and mutants failed to identify any protease that could cause the observed cleavage within the b domains. extensively purified recombinant b domain protein is very labile, and we propose that cleavage occurs  spontaneously at labile peptide bonds and that this is necessary for biofilm formation.

TI  == cajanol inhibits the growth of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus by acting on membrane and dna damage.
AB  == in the present study, the mechanism of antibacterial activity of cajanol extracted from the roots of cajanus cajan (l.) millsp. towards escherichia coli (e. coli) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) was investigated. the antibacterial activity of cajanol was evaluated towards six bacterial strains (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) by the broth microdilution method. it showed strong antibacterial activity towards all bacteria tested with minimal inhibition concentration (mic) values ranging from 98.90 microm to 197.8 microm. cajanol-induced death rates in the most sensitive strains ( e.coli, 96.55 % and s. aureus, 97.25 %) were analyzed by flow cytometry. furthermore, the activity of cajanol on the membranes of e. coli and s. aureus was investigated by using lecithin, phosphate groups, and fluorescence  microscopy. cajanol-induced dna damage was observed by agarose gel electrophoresis. in summary, cajanol inhibited e. coli only by dna damage, whereas s. aureus was inhibited by affecting both, the lecithin and phosphate groups on the cellular membrane and dna. the present study shows that cajanol possesses antibacterial activity in vitro towards both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and therefore may be a promising candidate as an antibacterial agent for the therapy of microbial infections.

TI  == obstacles of multiplex real-time pcr for bacterial 16s rdna: primer specifity and dna decontamination of taq polymerase.
AB  == background: the detection of a broad range of bacteria by pcr is applied for the  screening of blood and blood products with special attention to platelet concentrates. for practical use it is desirable that detection systems include gram-positive, gram-negative and non-gram-stainable bacteria. it is quite challenging to achieve high sensitivity along with a clear negative control with  pcr reagents, because especially taq polymerase is contaminated with traces of bacterial dna. methods: bacterial dna decontamination of taq polymerase was attempted by two different methods using the restriction enzyme sau 3a1 and microfiltration. additionally a commercially available taq polymerase depleted of bacterial dna was included. a published real-time pcr specific for gram-negative  bacteria was adapted for gram-positive bacteria, including certain staphylococcus species and mycobacteria, and was used to charge the three taq polymer-ases depleted of bacterial dna contamination results: despite published reports about  successful dna decontamination, all three approaches performed poorly in experiments done in this study. sensitivity ranged at approximately 50-100 colony forming units (cfu) per pcr reaction for escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis, corresponding to 1,250-2,500 cfu/ml sample material. conclusion: it  seems unsatisfying to accept detection limits that high for diagnostic bacterial  pcr even if highly multiplexed. reliable methods for dna decontamination of taq polymerase are needed and would present one important step towards bacterial dna  detection with high sensitivity.

TI  == towards long-lasting antibacterial stainless steel surfaces by combining double glow plasma silvering with active screen plasma nitriding.
AB  == antibacterial surface modification of biomedical materials has evolved as a potentially effective method for preventing bacterial proliferation on the surfaces of devices. however, thin antibacterial coatings or modified layers can  be easily worn down when interacting with other surfaces in relative motion, thus leading to a low durability of the antibacterial surface. to this end, novel biomaterial surfaces with antibacterial ag agents and a wear-resistant s-phase have been generated on stainless steel by duplex plasma silvering-nitriding techniques for application to load-bearing medical devices. the chemical composition, microstructure, surface topography, roughness and wettability of ss  surfaces were characterised using glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy/wavelength dispersive spectrometry (wds), x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy and a contact angle goniometer. optimal surface design for high antimicrobial activity and prolonged durability has been  achieved, as evidenced by rapid bacterial killing rates (within 6h), an ultra hard matrix (875 +/- 25 hv), high load-bearing capacity (critical load 37 n) and  excellent wear resistance (wear rate 4.9 x 10(-)(6) mm(3) m(-)(1)). ag embedded in the hard substrate of fcc compounds m(4)n (m=fe, cr, ag, etc.) and the expanded fcc nitrogen s-phase shows deep infiltration of 6 +/- 1 mum, and provides bactericidal activity against both gram-negative escherichia coli nctc 10418 and gram-positive staphylococcus epidermidis nctc 11047 of over 97% and 90%, respectively, within 6h. the presence of silver in the surface before and after scratching under a progressive load applied up to 60 n using a diamond stylus was confirmed by wds.

TI  == diamagnetic levitation enhances growth of liquid bacterial cultures by increasing oxygen availability.
AB  == diamagnetic levitation is a technique that uses a strong, spatially varying magnetic field to reproduce aspects of weightlessness, on the earth. we used a superconducting magnet to levitate growing bacterial cultures for up to 18 h, to  determine the effect of diamagnetic levitation on all phases of the bacterial growth cycle. we find that diamagnetic levitation increases the rate of population growth in a liquid culture and reduces the sedimentation rate of the cells. further experiments and microarray gene analysis show that the increase in growth rate is owing to enhanced oxygen availability. we also demonstrate that the magnetic field that levitates the cells also induces convective stirring in the liquid. we present a simple theoretical model, showing how the paramagnetic force on dissolved oxygen can cause convection during the aerobic phases of bacterial growth. we propose that this convection enhances oxygen availability by transporting oxygen around the liquid culture. since this process results from the strong magnetic field, it is not present in other weightless environments, e.g. in earth orbit. hence, these results are of significance and timely to researchers considering the use of diamagnetic levitation to explore effects of weightlessness on living organisms and on physical phenomena.

AB  == cationic, uv -curable coatings containing the tethered biocide, triclosan, were produced and their antimicrobial activity toward staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli determined. two polysiloxanes functionalized with both cycloaliphatic epoxy and triclosan were synthesized using hydrosilylation. the functionalized polysiloxanes, with varied concentration of pendant triclosan, were used to produce uv-curable coatings with reasonably good coating properties. fourier transform (ft)-raman spectroscopy showed that the tethered triclosan moieties self-concentrate on the coating surface. using biological assays, it was determined that the coatings possessed nearly 100% antimicrobial activity toward  the gram-positive bacterium, s. epidermidis, without leaching toxic components. for the gram-negative bacterium, e. coli, 60-80% reduction in biofilm retention was observed for all the coatings. interestingly, the coatings were lesser effective in reducing e. coli cell viability suggesting that the tethered triclosan were able to substantially reduce the production of the biofilm extracellular matrix with minimal adverse affect on the bacterial cells attached  to the coating surfaces. the high specificity of the coatings toward s. epidermidis indicates that a novel mode of contact-active antimicrobial activity  was achieved through the disruption of processes unique to the gram-positive cell wall. these novel uv-curable coatings have potential applications in inhibiting implantable biomedical device associated infections.

TI  == microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  == the tonsils of mammals such as humans and pigs are colonized with an extensive microbiota and are frequently the site for asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens. the goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. aerobic cultivation identified pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus suis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and escherichia coli from >/= 50% of the pigs in both herds. for culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16s rrna sequences using the ribosomal database project pipeline programs developed at michigan state university. dominant genera identified by 16s rrna analysis in pigs from both herds included actinobacillus,  haemophilus, pasteurella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and prevotella. these genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. in contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. in addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. this is the first analysis using 16s rrna sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in  the porcine upper respiratory tract.

TI  == use of quantitative broad-based polymerase chain reaction for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == background: conventional laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis based on microscopy followed by culture is time-consuming and has only moderate sensitivity. objectives: the objective was to define the limit of detection (lod), analytic specificity, and performance characteristics of a broad-based quantitative multiprobe polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay for rapid bacterial detection and simultaneous pathogen-specific identification in patients with suspected meningitis. methods: a pcr algorithm consisting of initial broad-based  detection of eubacteriales by a universal probe, followed by pathogen identification using either pathogen-specific probes or gram-typing probes, was employed to detect pathogens. the 16s rrna gene, which contains both conserved and variable regions, was chosen as the target. pathogen-specific probes were designed for streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli,  and listeria monocytogenes. gram-positive and -negative typing probes were designed based on conserved regions across all eubacteria. the lod and time to detection were assessed by dilutional mocked-up samples. a total of 108 convenience cerebrospinal fluid (csf) clinical samples obtained from the johns hopkins hospital (jhh) microbiology laboratory were tested, and results were compared with hospital microbiologic culture reports. results: the lod of the assay ranged from 10(1) to 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. pathogen-specific probes showed no cross-reactivity with other organisms. time to detection was 3 hours. in clinical specimens, the universal probe correctly detected 16 of 22 culture-positive clinical specimens (sensitivity = 72.7%; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 49.8% to 89.3%), which were all correctly characterized by either pathogen-specific or gram-typing probes. adjusted sensitivity after removing probable microbiologic laboratory contaminants was 88.9% (95% ci = 65.3% to 98.6%). the universal probe was negative for 86 of 86 culture-negative specimens. conclusions: a broad-based multiprobe pcr assay demonstrated strong analytic performance characteristics. findings from a pilot clinical study showed promise  in translation to human subjects, supporting potential utility of the assay as an adjunct to traditional diagnostics for early identification of bacterial meningitis.

TI  == photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy by liposome-encapsulated water-soluble photosensitizers.
AB  == photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy is an alternative method for killing bacterial cells in view of the increasing problem of multi-antibiotic resistance. we examined the effect of three water-soluble photosensitizers (phs): methylene blue (mb), neutral red (nr) and rose bengal (rb) on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. we compared the efficacy of phs in their free form and encapsulated in liposomal formulations against various bacterial strains, and determined conditions for the effective use of encapsulated phs. we found that all three phs were able to eradicate the gram-positive microbes staphylococcus aureus and sarcina lutea; and mb and rb were effective against st. epidermidis. in the case of the gram-negative species, mb and rb were cytotoxic against the shigella flexneri, nr-inactivated escherichia coli and salmonella para b, and br  was effective in killing pseudomonas aeruginosa. none of the examined phs showed  activity against klebsiella pneumoniae. mb and nr enclosed in liposomes gave a stronger antimicrobial effect than free phs for all tested prokaryotes, whereas encapsulation of rb led to no increase in its activity. we suggest that encapsulation of phs can increase the photoinactivation of bacteria.

TI  == prevalence and clinical outcome of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis: a prospective observational study in  central part of croatia.
AB  == spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis and is defined as infected ascites in the absence of any recognizable secondary cause of infection. the aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence, incidence, pathogens and clinical outcome of sbp. this prospective observational study included 108 cirrhotic patients with ascites treated during 18 months. patients were divided into two groups according to diagnostic criteria of sbp: sbp group (n=23) and non-sbp group (n=85). differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups were analyzed, including mortality rate, incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, bacteremia/sepsis and frequency of rehospitalization. the pathogens responsible for sbp were analyzed in sbp group.  the prevalence of sbp was 21% and incidence 14.1% per year. statistically significant between-group differences were recorded in mortality (26% vs. 4.7%; p=0.017), incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (39% vs. 11.7%; p=0.015) and rehospitalization frequency (47.8% vs. 20%; p=0.05). the incidence of sepsis following episode of gastrointestinal bleeding was similar in both groups (55.5%  vs. 50%; p=0.892). the following pathogens were responsible for sbp: escherichia  coli (n=7), mrsa (n=2), acinetobacter spp. (n=2), staphylococcus aureus (n=1), streptococcus spp. (n=1), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=1) and enterococcus faecalis (n=1). as indicated by study results, the incidence and mortality of sbp were high. patients with liver cirrhosis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were found to be at a high risk of developing sepsis with or without clinically proven sbp. the pathogens responsible for sbp were mostly gram-negative microorganisms;  however, there were also a significant proportion of gram-positive microorganisms and hospital infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. study results suggested the spectrum of pathogens to change due to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria within the hospital setting.

TI  == preparation and in-vitro antibacterial evaluation of electroless silver coated polymers.
AB  == long-term use of indwelling medical catheters has often been hindered by catheter-associated nosocomial infections. in this study the effectiveness of silver coating of polystyrene and polyethylene polymers was investigated. polymer pieces of 2 cm(2) each were coated with a thin layer of silver using electroless  plating technique. silver-coated polymers were challenged with cultures of four different microorganisms known for their involvement in nosocomial infections in  both solid and broth media. the tested bacteria included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. silver release from the coated polymers was 2-5 mug/cm(2) which was confirmed by chemical and biological methods. the silver coating thickness ranged between 20-450 nm. p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were the most adherent bacteria to polystyrene sheets while e. coli showed minimum adherence effect. the survival rate of different bacteria after 80 min in a time course experiment tended to dominate e. coli as the most sensitive bacteria to the effect of silver with zero survival rate while around 4% of p. aeruginosa were detected after same period. silver coating of indwelling polymers by electroless technique seems promising in combating nosocomial infections due to long-term catheterization.

TI  == origin of the putrescine-producing ability of the coagulase-negative bacterium staphylococcus epidermidis 2015b.
AB  == a multiplex pcr method, aimed at the detection of genes associated with biogenic  amine production, identified the odc gene encoding ornithine decarboxylase in 1 of 15 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis. the ability of the positive strain,  s. epidermidis 2015b, to produce putrescine in vitro was demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). in this strain, the odc gene was detected on plasmid dna, suggesting that the ability to form putrescine is carried by a mobile element, which explains the fact that the trait is strain dependent within the s. epidermidis species. a 6,292-bp nucleotide sequence harboring the putative odc gene was determined. s. epidermidis ornithine decarboxylase (odc) showed 60 to 65% sequence identity with known odcs of gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. downstream of the odc gene, a gene encoding a putative amino acid transporter was found that shared 59% sequence identity with the ornithine/putrescine exchanger (pote) of escherichia coli. cloning and expression of the pote gene of s. epidermis 2015b in lactococcus lactis demonstrated that the gene product transported ornithine and putrescine into the cells and efficiently exchanged putrescine for ornithine. analysis of the flanking regions showed high identity levels with different s. epidermidis plasmid sequences, which would confirm the plasmidic location of the  odc operon. it follows that the odc and pote gene pair encodes a putrescine-producing pathway in s. epidermis 2015b that was acquired through horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == in vitro assessment of antimicrobial properties of rifampin-coated titan((r)) coloplast penile implants and comparison with inhibizone((r)).
AB  == introduction: it is a common practice to soak titan((r)) coloplast penile implants in antibiotic solution prior to implantation. aim. the aim of this study is to identify an ideal solution for soaking the titan((r)) coloplast penile implants prior to implantation. methods: titan((r)) strips were soaked in a different combination of antibiotics and the zone of inhibition was studied against staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli. this zone of inhibition  was compared against zone of inhibition produced by inhibizone((r)) -coated silicone strips. zones of inhibitions were also compared for different components of inhibizone((r)) implant such as cylinder, tubing, connector, rear tip extender, and reservoir, and compared with similar components of titan((r)) coloplast penile implants. main outcome measures: the zone of inhibition against  s. epidermidis and e. coli for titan strips dipped in rifampin and gentamicin was compared against other antibiotics. the clinical significance of dipping titan((r)) -coated coloplast implant in rifampin and gentamicin solution was determined. results: rifampin 10mg/ml+gentamicin 1mg/ml (r10/g1) and rifampin 1mg/ml+gentamicin 1mg/ml (r1/g1) had excellent coverage against s. epidermidis and e. coli. the zone of inhibition (utilizing the titan((r)) coating) produced by both these solutions exceeds that produced by inhibizone((r)) by 40% to 56% for s. epidermidis and 33% for e. coli. components of the american medical system implant (tubing connectors and rear tip extenders) are not coated with antibiotics and had no zone of inhibition. conclusion: soaking titan((r)) -coated coloplast implants in r10/g1 solution produces a zone of inhibition greater than  that produced by inhibizone((r)) -coated penile implants. the clinical significance of this increased zone of inhibition can only be determined by a separate clinical study.

TI  == absence of bacterial resistance to medical-grade manuka honey.
AB  == clinical use of honey in the topical treatment of wounds has increased in europe  and north america since licensed wound care products became available in 2004 and 2007, respectively. honey-resistant bacteria have not been isolated from wounds,  but there is a need to investigate whether honey has the potential to select for  honey resistance. two cultures of bacteria from reference collections (staphylococcus aureus nctc 10017 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853) and four cultures isolated from wounds (escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant s. aureus  (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. epidermidis) were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of manuka honey in continuous and stepwise training experiments to determine whether the susceptibility to honey diminished. reduced susceptibilities to manuka honey in the test organisms during long-term stepwise  resistance training were found, but these changes were not permanent and honey-resistant mutants were not detected. the risk of bacteria acquiring resistance to honey will be low if high concentrations are maintained clinically.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of topical skin pharmaceuticals - an in vitro study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of currently  available topical skin pharmaceuticals against candida albicans, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes. the agar dilution assay was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration for cream formulations and their active substances. corticosteroid  formulations with the antiseptics clioquinol or halquinol were active against all microbes. the hydrogen peroxide formulation was primarily active against staphylococci. clotrimazole, miconazole and econazole showed an effect against staphylococci in addition to their effect on c. albicans. in contrast, terbinafine had no antibacterial effect. fusidic acid was active against staphylococci, with slightly weaker activity against s. pyogenes and no activity  against c. albicans or e. coli. in summary, some topical skin pharmaceuticals have broad antimicrobial activity in vitro, clioquinol and halquinol being the most diverse. in limited superficial skin infection topical treatment can be an alternative to systemic antibiotics and should be considered. with the global threat of multi-resistant bacteria there is a need for new, topical, non-resistance-promoting, antimicrobial preparations for the treatment of skin infections.

TI  == a simple method to reduce infection of ventriculoperitoneal shunts.
AB  == object: postoperative shunt infection is the most common and feared complication  of ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunt placement for treatment of hydrocephalus. the  rate of shunt infection is highest in the 1st postoperative month. the most common organisms responsible for shunt infection include coagulase-negative staphylococcus and staphylococcus aureus. this suggests a transfer of patient's skin flora via the surgeons' glove as a possible means of infection. the authors  conducted a study to determine if the rate of postoperative shunt infections could be reduced simply by changing gloves before handling the shunt catheter. methods: a total of 111 neonates born with congenital hydrocephalus requiring a vp shunt were enrolled retrospectively and divided into 2 groups: a control group of 54 neonates treated with standard protocol vp shunt placement (group a) and a  treatment group of 57 neonates in whom, after initially double gloving, the outer pair of gloves was removed before handling the shunt catheter (group b). shunt infection rates were compared up to 6 months postoperatively. results: there was  a statistically significant reduction of infection rate from 16.33% in group a (control) to 3.77% in group b (p = 0.0458). conclusions: the study shows that a changing of gloves before handling the shunt catheter may be a simple and cost-effective way to reduce the burden of postoperative shunt infections.

TI  == patients with acute pancreatitis complicated by organ failure show highly aberrant monocyte signaling profiles assessed by phospho-specific flow cytometry.
AB  == objectives: to outline signaling profiles and transmigration capacity of monocytes of patients with severe acute pancreatitis. design: prospective study.  setting: university hospital intensive care unit. patients: thirteen patients with severe acute pancreatitis. all patients had organ dysfunction (acute respiratory distress syndrome in 12, renal dysfunction in eight). healthy volunteers served as reference subjects. interventions: blood samples were collected after admission to the intensive care unit. measurements and main results: phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappab and p38, signal transducers and activators of transcription (stats) 1, 3, 5, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 in appropriately stimulated and nonstimulated samples were studied using phospho-specific whole-blood flow cytometry. monocyte chemotactic protein-1-induced transmigration of monocytes among mononuclear cells obtained by density gradient centrifugation was studied using transwell cell culture inserts  covered with confluent layer of endothelial ea-hy cells. phosphorylation levels of nuclear factor-kappab induced by tumor necrosis factor, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, muramyl dipeptide, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were significantly lower in patients' monocytes than monocytes of healthy reference subjects, whereas mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 phosphorylation levels were normal. phosphorylation levels induced by  interleukin-6 in stat1 and stat3 and by combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calcium ionophore a23187 in extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2, members of a mitogen-activated protein kinase family, were depressed in patients' monocytes, whereas phosphorylation levels induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in stat5 was normal. in nonstimulated samples, phosphorylation levels were normal. the transmigration percentage of patients' monocytes was significantly lower than that of reference  monocytes. conclusions: in severe acute pancreatitis, monocytes show impaired nuclear factor kappab and stat1 activation, which may increase susceptibility to  secondary infections. p38 activation is normal and stat3 activation is depressed, which may contribute to maintenance of systemic inflammation. extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activation is impaired, which may depress monocytes' transmigration and may consequently increase risk of infection. monitoring of monocyte signaling profiles may aid in finding new therapeutic approaches and predictors of outcome of severe acute pancreatitis.

AB  == the influence of silver ions on escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis has been investigated by atomic force microscopy (afm). both single cell and cell communities were visualized, and the nanoscale ultrastructure images of these two bacteria strains before and after stimulation of silver ions were obtained. the results showed that in the case of e. coli after treatment with silver ions, vesicles appeared on the cell walls, and the size of vesicles became larger with  the increase of the incubation time. however, in the case of s. epidermidis after treatment with silver ions, irregular and deep grooves appeared on the cell walls, and the cytoplasm membrane shrank and became separated from the cell wall. the significant differences in cell wall changes between e. coli and s. epidermidis after treatment with silver ions were related to their structural characters. according to those results, it is shown that afm can provide new insight into the antimicrobial mechanism of silver ions, and show a new methodological approach to understand the relationship between structure and function of microbial cell when it was exposed to external stimulation.

AB  == neutrophils play an important role in host defense. however, deregulation of neutrophils contributes to tissue damage in severe systemic inflammation. in contrast to complications mediated by an overactive neutrophil compartment, severe systemic inflammation is a risk factor for development of immune suppression and as a result, infectious complications. the role of neutrophils in this clinical paradox is poorly understood, and in this study, we tested whether  this paradox could be explained by distinct neutrophil subsets and their functionality. we studied the circulating neutrophil compartment immediately after induction of systemic inflammation by administering 2 ng/kg escherichia coli lps i.v. to healthy volunteers. neutrophils were phenotyped by expression of membrane receptors visualized by flow cytometry, capacity to interact with fluorescently labeled microbes, and activation of the nadph-oxidase by oxidation  of amplex red and dihydrorhodamine. after induction of systemic inflammation, expression of membrane receptors on neutrophils, such as cxcr1 and -2 (il-8rs), c5ar, fcgammarii, and tlr4, was decreased. neutrophils were also refractory to fmlf-induced up-regulation of membrane receptors, and suppression of antimicrobial function was shown by decreased interaction with staphylococcus epidermis. simultaneously, activation of circulating neutrophils was demonstrated by a threefold increase in release of ros. the paradoxical phenotype can be explained by the selective priming of the respiratory burst. in contrast, newly released, cd16(dim) banded neutrophils display decreased antimicrobial function.  we conclude that systemic inflammation leads to a functionally heterogeneous neutrophil compartment, in which newly released refractory neutrophils can cause  susceptibility to infections, and activated, differentiated neutrophils can mediate tissue damage.

TI  == potential airborne microbial hazards for workers on dairy and beef cattle farms in egypt.
AB  == this study was conducted to determine the concentration and frequency distribution of certain airborne micro-organisms on cattle farms and their potential health hazards to farm workers. the samples (60 air samples and 240 hand and nasal swabs from cattle farm workers) were collected from ten cattle farms (five dairy barns and five beef sheds) located in the sharkia governorate of egypt. air samples were collected for microbiological examination in liquid media using an all-glass impinger whereas those for fungal examination were placed on agar plates using slit air samplers (aeroscopes). the results showed that the overall means of total culturable bacterial and fungal counts were lower in the air of dairy cattle barns than in beef cattle sheds. identification of the isolated bacteria revealed the recovery of the following species (from dairy cattle barns versus beef cattle sheds): staphylococcus epidermidis (26.7% vs 36.7%), s. saprophyticus (20% vs 33.3%), s. aureus (10% vs 16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (23.3% vs 26.7%), enterobacter agglomerans (23.3 vs 13.3%), escherichia  coli, (16.7% vs 26.7%), klebsiella oxytoca, (10% vs 16.7%), k. pneumoniae (3.3% vs 0%), proteus rettegri (6.7% vs 13.3%), p. mirabilis (10% vs 10%), p. vulgaris  (3.3% vs 6.7%), pseudomonas species (6.7% vs 16.7%), respectively). mycological examination of air samples revealed the presence of aspergillus fumigatus (46.7%  vs 63.3%), a. niger (20% vs 36.7%), a. flavus (13.3% vs 26.7%), penicillium citrinum (16.7% vs 23.3%), p. viridicatum (13.3% vs 6.7%), p. capsulatum (3.3% vs 0%), cladosporium spp. (30% vs 56.7%), alternaria spp. (13.3 vs 23.3%), mucor spp. (6.7% vs 16.7%), fusarium spp. (3.3% vs 10%), absidia spp. (6.7% vs 10%), curvilaria spp. (10% vs 3.3%), rhizopus spp. (6.7% vs 13.3%), scopulariopsis (3.3% vs 6.7%), epicoccum spp. (0% vs 3.4%) and yeast (13.3% vs 20%), respectively. in addition, microbiological examinations of farm workers revealed  heavy contamination of their hands and noses with most of the micro-organisms detected in the air of cattle farms. the results showed that potential airborne microbial risks in beef cattle sheds were greater than in dairies.

TI  == a survey of veterinary hospitals in nigeria for the presence of some bacterial organisms of nosocomial and zoonotic potential.
AB  == this study was undertaken to determine the type and estimate the prevalence of bacterial organisms on contact surfaces of five close-to-patient facilities in three veterinary health care settings within the sokoto metropolis of north-western nigeria. a total of 30 samples (10 from each setting) were collected and analysed using culture, microscopy and biochemical testing. bacterial species isolated from samples in this study included the following: bacillus sp. (27.3%), staphylococcus aureus (15.9%), listeria sp. (13.6%), streptococcus sp. (11.4%), salmonella sp. (6.8%), escherichia coli (4.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (4.5%), citrobacter sp. (2.3%), klebsiella sp. (2.3%), lactobacillus sp. (2.3%), micrococcus sp. (2.3%), pasteurella sp. (2.3%), proteus sp. (2.3%), and yersinia sp. (2.3%). a higher percentage (64.3%) of the total bacterial isolates were zoonotic in nature and hence of public health significance. some pathogens have the potential of nosocomial spread. in this study, we seek to establish the first evidence of bacterial presence in the major veterinary health care settings in the sokoto region of north-western nigeria. of particular interest is the hypothesis, which has not previously been formally tested, that nosocomial infections are especially likely to be implicated in both animals and occupational diseases in nigeria. it was suggested that some of these isolates were associated with the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections and  hence draws attention to the need to rigorously employ standard veterinary precautions as part of the hospital's infection control programme in an attempt to protect both patients and staff from infections.

TI  == essential oil from the underground parts of laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of laserpitium zernyi hayek (apiaceae) were investigated. the pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by gc and gc-ms. forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). the main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. the antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against gram (+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis), gram (-) bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (candida albicans). l. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against s. epidermidis, s. aureus and m. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.

TI  == ironing out the wrinkles in the rare biosphere through improved otu clustering.
AB  == deep sequencing of pcr amplicon libraries facilitates the detection of low-abundance populations in environmental dna surveys of complex microbial communities. at the same time, deep sequencing can lead to overestimates of microbial diversity through the generation of low-frequency, error-prone reads. even with sequencing error rates below 0.005 per nucleotide position, the common  method of generating operational taxonomic units (otus) by multiple sequence alignment and complete-linkage clustering significantly increases the number of predicted otus and inflates richness estimates. we show that a 2% single-linkage  preclustering methodology followed by an average-linkage clustering based on pairwise alignments more accurately predicts expected otus in both single and pooled template preparations of known taxonomic composition. this new clustering  method can reduce the otu richness in environmental samples by as much as 30-60%  but does not reduce the fraction of otus in long-tailed rank abundance curves that defines the rare biosphere.

TI  == antibiotic resistance patterns in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria causing septicemia in newborns in leon, nicaragua: correlation with environmental samples.
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify the bacteria causing neonatal septicemia in a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) in leon, nicaragua and its relation with bacteria isolated from the environment at the nicu. our data showed that 74% (34/46) of the bacteria related to newborns with septicemia were gram-negative and highly resistant to beta-lactams (>85%) and aminoglycosides (80%), leading to treatment failure in 10 neonates with fatal outcome. although, the prevalence of  gram-positive bacteria (26%) was lower than gram-negative bacteria, staphylococcus epidermidis was related to the death of three newborns. no clonal  similarity was found among enterobacter cloacae , escherichia coli and serratia liquefaciens isolated from the neonates with septicemia and the nicu environment. however, in order to improve the outcome for neonates with septicemia, infection  control practices and appropriate empirical therapy should be considered to reduce the high prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing gram-negative bacteria isolated from neonates with septicemia (80%) and from the  nicu environment (34%).

TI  == tunable bioadhesive copolymer hydrogels of thermoresponsive poly(n-isopropyl acrylamide) containing zwitterionic polysulfobetaine.
AB  == this work describes a novel tunable bioadhesive hydrogel of thermoresponsive n-isopropylacrylamide (nipaam) containing zwitterionic sulfobetaine methacrylate  (sbma). this novel hydrogel highly regulates general bioadhesive foulants through the adsorption of plasma proteins, the adhesion of human platelets and cells, and the attachment of bacteria. in this investigation, nonionic hydrogels of polynipaam, zwitterionic hydrogels of polysbma, and three copolymeric hydrogels of nipaam and sbma (poly(nipaam-co-sbma)) were prepared. the copolymeric hydrogels exhibited controllable temperature-dependent swelling behaviors and showed stimuli-responsive phase characteristics in the presence of salts. the interactions of these hydrogels with biomolecules and microorganisms were demonstrated by protein adsorption, cell adhesion, and bacterial attachment, which allowed us to evaluate their bioadhesive properties. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) with monoclonal antibodies was used to measure different plasma protein adsorptions on the prepared hydrogel surfaces. at a physiological temperature, the high content of the nonionic polynipaam in poly(nipaam-co-sbma) hydrogel exhibits a high protein adsorption due to the interfacial exposure of polynipaam-rich hydrophobic domains. a relatively high content of polysbma in poly(nipaam-co-sbma) hydrogel exhibits reduced amounts of  protein adsorption due to the interfacial hydration of polysbma-rich hydrophilic  segments. the attachment of platelets and the spreading of cells were only observed on polynipaam-rich hydrogel surfaces. interestingly, the incorporation of zwitterionic sbma units into the polynipaam gels was found to accelerate the hydration of the cell-cultured surfaces and resulted in more rapid cell detachment. such copolymer gel surface was shown to be potentially useful for triggered cell detachment. in addition, the interactions of hydrogels with bacteria were also evaluated. the polysbma-rich hydrogels exhibited evident antimicrobial properties when they were incubated with gram-positive bacteria ( s. epidermidis ) and gram-negative bacteria ( e. coli ). this work shows that the bioadhesive properties of poly(nipaam-co-sbma) hydrogels can be effectively controlled via regulated nonionic and zwitterionic molar mass ratios. the tunable-bioadhesive behavior of temperature-sensitive poly(nipaam-co-sbma) makes  this biocompatible hydrogel appropriate for biomedical applications.

TI  == chain length dependence of antimicrobial peptide-fatty acid conjugate activity.
AB  == the rise of resistant bacteria has prompted the search for new antimicrobial agents. antimicrobial membrane lytic peptides have potential as future microbial  agents due to their novel mode of action. recently conjugation of a fatty acid to antimicrobial peptides has been explored as a method to modulate the activity and selectivity of the peptide. our work further explores these phenomena by testing  two peptides, ygaakkaakaakkaakaa (akk) and lkkllkllkllkl (lkk), conjugated to fatty acids of varying length for their activity, structure, solution assembly properties and the ability to bind model membranes. we found that increasing the  length of fatty acids conjugated to peptide akk, up to a 16 carbons in length, increases the antimicrobial activity. peptide akk appears to lose activity when the minimal active concentration is higher than the critical miscelle concentration (cmc) of the molecule. thus, if the cmc of the peptide conjugate is too low the activity is lost. peptide lkk has no activity when conjugated to lauric acid and appears to aggregate at very low concentrations. conjugation of akk with a fatty acid increases its affinity to model supported lipid membranes.  it appears that the increased hydrophobic interaction imparted by the fatty acid  increases the affinity of the peptide to the surface thus increasing its activity. at concentrations above the cmc, solution self-assembly inhibits binding of the peptide to cell membranes.

AB  == the adhesion of staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and candida albicans on mucin coatings was evaluated to explore the feasibility of using the  coating to increase the infection resistance of biomaterials. coatings of bovine  submaxillary mucin (bsm) were deposited on a base layer consisting of a poly(acrylic acid-b-methyl methacrylate) (paa-b-pmma) diblock copolymer. this bi-layer system exploits the mucoadhesive interactions of the paa block to aid the adhesion of mucin to the substratum, whereas the pmma block prevents dissolution of the coating in aqueous environments. the thickness of the mucin coating was adjusted by varying the ph of the solution from which it was deposited. thin mucin coatings decreased the numbers of bacteria but increased the numbers of c. albicans adhering to the copolymer and control surfaces. increasing the mucin film thickness resulted in a further lowering of the density of adhering s. epidermidis cells, but it did not affect the density of e. coli. in contrast, the density of c. albicans increased with an increase in mucin thickness.

AB  == background: the sensitivity of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay  detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates (pcs) was improved by detection of ribosomal rna (rrna) in addition to dna. the real-time reverse transcription-pcr  (rt-pcr) assay was compared with the bact/alert culturing system (biomerieux) to  determine its value for routine screening of pcs for bacterial contamination. study design and methods: the sensitivity of the assay was determined by spiking  pcs with serial dilutions of bacteria. rna amplification was performed with real-time rt-pcr, using a universal primer and probe set based on the conserved 16s rrna gene of bacteria. routinely prepared pcs in plasma were spiked with low  bacterial titers of four different bacteria to compare the real-time rt-pcr with  the bact/alert. for the bact/alert, samples were taken directly after spiking. for the real-time rt-pcr, samples were taken daily during 7 days of storage. results: rna detection improved the sensitivity of the pcr assay at least 10-fold. when pcs were spiked with low bacterial titers, all positive samples were detected by the real-time rt-pcr after 48 hours. the bact/alert became positive for almost all samples within 24 hours. however, some positive pc samples remained negative in the bact/alert. conclusion: the sensitivity of the pcr assay was improved by detection of rrna. a spiking study demonstrated the advantage of late sampling for pcr testing compared to early sampling for culturing with the bact/alert system. a real-time rt-pcr assay that is performed  on pcs during storage or shortly before transfusion can be a good alternative to  culturing methods.

TI  == simultaneous pasteurization and homogenization of human milk by combining heat and ultrasound: effect on milk quality.
AB  == the combination of ultrasound and heat (thermoultrasound) is an emerging food preservation technique that retains higher quantities of bioactive components compared with current thermal pasteurization practice, but has not yet been assessed for pasteurizing human milk. artificially contaminated human milk samples were treated with ultrasound (20 khz, 150 watts) with and without heating. the retention of four human milk proteins was quantified by biochemical  assay and laser scattering particle sizing was used to determine the extent of homogenization. while ultrasonic treatment was effective at inactivating escherichia coli (d4 degrees c=5.94 min), staphylococcus epidermidis exhibited resistance (d4 degrees c=16.01 min). thermoultrasonic treatment was considerably  more effective (esch. coli d45 degrees c=1.74 min, d50 degrees c=0.89 min; staph. epidermidis d45 degrees c=2.08 min, d50 degrees c=0.94 minutes) with a predicted  retention (2.8 min treatment, 50 degrees c) of secretory iga lysozyme, lactoferrin and bile salt stimulated lipase of 91, 80, 77, and 45%, respectively. homogenization of the milk samples occurred after 5 min and 2 min of ultrasonic and thermoultrasonic treatment, respectively. thermoultrasonic treatment is an effective method for pasteurizing donor human milk and retaining a greater proportion of bioactive components compared with current practices. however, further studies are required to assess the practicality of applying this technique routinely to donor human milk.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles produced by chemical  reduction method.
AB  == background and the purpose of the study: the most prominent nanoparticles for medical uses are nanosilver particles which are famous for their high anti-microbial activity. silver ion has been known as a metal ion that exhibit anti-mold, anti-microbial and anti-algal properties for a long time. in particular, it is widely used as silver nitrate aqueous solution which has disinfecting and sterilizing actions. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity as well as physical properties of the silver nanoparticles prepared by chemical reduction method. methods: silver nanoparticles (nps) were prepared by reduction of silver nitrate in the presence  of a reducing agent and also poly [n-vinylpyrolidone] (pvp) as a stabilizer. two  kinds of nps were synthesized by ethylene glycol (eg) and glucose as reducing agent. the nanostructure and particle size of silver nps were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (sem) and laser particle analyzer (lpa). the formations of the silver nps were monitored using ultraviolet- visible spectroscopy. the anti-bacterial activity of silver nps were assessed by determination of their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against the gram positive (staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis) as well as gram-negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. results and conclusion: the silver nanoparticles were spherical with particle size between 10 to 250 nm. analysis of the theoretical (mie light scattering theory) and experimental results showed that the silver nps in colloidal solution had a diameter of approximately 50 nm. both colloidal silver nps showed high anti-bacterial activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. glucose nanosilver colloids showed a shorter killing time against most of the tested bacteria which could be due to their nanostructures and uniform size distribution patterns.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of light-activated polyurethane containing indocyanine green.
AB  == the aim of this study was to produce novel antimicrobial polymers containing the  light-activated antimicrobial agent indocyanine green (icg). the novel materials  were prepared by swelling polyurethane in acetone containing water and icg, followed by solvent evaporation. the uptake of icg was dependent upon the ratio of acetone to water. only at a ratio of 99 parts acetone to 1 part water was there any substantial colouration of the samples. when exposed to laser light from the near infrared spectrum (808 nm), polyurethane-containing icg exhibited antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria; a 2 log(1)(0) reduction was achieved against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis after 15 min exposure, corresponding to an energy dose of 31.83 j delivered at an energy density of 31.83 j/cm(2). under the same conditions, gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa)  appeared to be less susceptible, the viable count being reduced by 0.5 log(1)(0). some of the physical properties of the resulting material were also investigated  and it was found that the elasticity (young's modulus) was reduced by approximately 60%. furthermore, when the icg-containing polymer was stretched, the breaking point occurred when the elongation was 6.7 times the initial value,  while icg-free polyurethane samples did not break following a 7-fold elongation.  the contact angles for water droplets revealed that the icg-containing polymer was more hydrophobic than untreated polyurethane. the results of this study show  that icg can be embedded in polyurethane to produce materials which when irradiated with near-infrared light can exert a bactericidal effect particularly  against mrsa and s. epidermidis. such materials may be useful for preparing intravenous catheters, which are often colonized by such organisms.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of small beta-peptidomimetics based on the pharmacophore model of short cationic antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == we have synthesized a series of small beta-peptidomimetics (m(w) <650) that were  based on the minimal pharmacophore model for anti-staphylococcal activity of short cationic antimicrobial peptides. all beta-peptidomimetics had a net charge  of +2 and formed an amphipathic scaffold consisting of an achiral lipophilic beta(2,2)-amino acid coupled to a c-terminal l-arginine amide residue. by varying the lipophilic side-chains of the beta(2,2)-amino acids, we obtained a series of  highly potent beta-peptidomimetics with high enzymatic stability against alpha-chymotrypsin and a general low toxicity against human erythrocytes. the most potent beta-peptidomimetics displayed minimal inhibitory concentrations of 2.1-7.2 mum against staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), and escherichia coli. small amphipathic beta-peptidomimetics may be a promising class of antimicrobial agents by means of having a similar range of potency and selectivity as larger cationic antimicrobial peptides in addition to improved enzymatic stability and lower costs of production.

TI  == new antimicrobial hexapeptides: synthesis, antimicrobial activities, cytotoxicity, and mechanistic studies.
AB  == synthetic antimicrobial peptides have recently emerged as promising candidates against drug-resistant pathogens. we identified a novel hexapeptide, orn-d-trp-d-phe-ile-d-phe-his(1-bzl)-nh(2), which exhibits broad-spectrum antifungal and antibacterial activity. a lead optimization was undertaken by conducting a full amino acid scan with various proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids depending on the hydrophobic or positive-charge character of residues at various positions along the sequence. the hexapeptide was also cyclized to study the correlation between the linear and cyclic structures and their respective antimicrobial activities. the synthesized peptides were found to be active against the fungus candida albicans and gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, as well as the gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli; mic values for the most potent structures were in the range of 1-5 microg ml(-1) (ic(50) values in the range of 0.02-2 microg ml(-1)).  most of the synthesized peptides showed no cytotoxic effects in an mtt assay up to the highest test concentration of 200 microg ml(-1). a tryptophan fluorescence quenching study was performed in the presence of negatively charged and zwitterionic model membranes, mimicking bacterial and mammalian membranes, respectively. the results of the fluorescence study demonstrate that the tested peptides are selective toward bacterial over mammalian cells; this is associated  with a preferential interaction between the peptides and the negatively charged phospholipids of bacterial cells.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of silver-processed catheters for neurosurgery.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of silver-processed catheters for use in neurosurgery using clinically predictive tests. methods: the antimicrobial activity of a commercially available silver-processed external ventricular drain catheter was evaluated against staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli and propionibacterium acnes. non-impregnated catheters were used as controls. two assays were performed: (i) testing the ability of the catheter to kill 100% of the attached bacteria (tk100); and (ii) in vitro challenge to determine the ability to prevent colonization under flow conditions. high and low inocula (10(4) and 10(7) cfu/ml) were used. silver-processed and control catheters were examined by scanning electron microscopy and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy; electron back-scatter and energy-dispersive x-ray analyses were used to investigate the distribution of silver within the processed catheter. results: the silver-processed catheters were not able to kill any of the bacteria tested in the tk100 assay at high inoculum. at low inoculum s. epidermidis was eradicated and some activity was seen against e. coli but without complete eradication. mrsa was also not eradicated even at low inoculum. the in vitro challenge test showed no prevention of colonization for any of the strains. silver particles were shown to be >500 nm in size. conclusions: the commercial silver-impregnated catheter was not able to eradicate mrsa or e. coli and while it showed activity against s. epidermidis in one assay it was unable to prevent colonization in vitro under in-flow conditions. this is consistent with clinical  studies on silver-processed catheters.

TI  == management of vascular graft infections with soft tissue flap coverage: improving limb salvage rates--a veterans affairs experience.
AB  == graft infections are one of the most challenging issues in surgery with an incidence of 0.7 to 7 per cent, with femoral site infections being the most common (13% incidence). the gold standard treatment has been graft removal, wide  debridement, and extra-anatomical bypass. routine excision of infected peripheral arterial grafts and vascular reconstruction with extraanatomic conduits are associated with mortality rates ranging from 10 to 30 per cent and amputation rates of up to 70 per cent. as a result of the high morbidity and mortality associated with this approach, selective graft preservation techniques have been  developed. newer treatment plans discuss preservation of the graft with debridement and coverage of the infected region. better wound care, nutrition optimization, and robust flap coverage have led to significantly improved graft salvage, lower amputation rates, and improved outcomes. the objective of this study was to evaluate the veterans affairs (va) experience with flap coverage for femoral vascular graft infections. a retrospective review was conducted of all va data from 1997 to 2008 with inclusion criteria of patients with deep groin wound  infections requiring flap coverage after femoral bypass surgery. eleven such patients were identified with a mean age of 73 years and with multiple comorbidities (hypertension, malnutrition, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, chronic renal insufficiency). patients presented with wound drainage, exposed graft, hematoma, perigraft fluid  collection, and pseudoaneurysm. treatment protocol included: 1) aggressive debridement of the wound bed; 2) early soft tissue (flap) coverage; 3) wound vacuum assisted closure device or frequent dressing changes; and 4) skin graft once the bed was prepared. eighty-two per cent of wounds had positive cultures with equal numbers of patients with staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas, escherichia coli (22%), and higher methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (33%), whereas in the literature staphylococcus is the most common (greater than  50%). average hospital length of stay was 94 days with average follow up at 10 months. fifty-five per cent graft salvage (one dacron [50%], two polytetrafluoroethylene [33%], two saphenous vein graft [100%], one cryovein [100%]) was achieved with 91 per cent limb salvage. complications included graft  blowout (two) requiring partial flap loss (one), retroperitoneal hematoma (one),  limb loss (one), sepsis (one), and death (one). infected vascular grafts remain a challenging problem requiring multidisciplinary care. careful debridement and aggressive wound care followed by selective flap coverage appears to decrease morbidity and increase graft and limb salvage.

AB  == microbial adhesion to silicone elastomer biomaterials is a major problem often resulting in infection and medical device failure. several strategies have been employed to modulate eukaryotic cell adhesion and to hamper bacterial adherence to polymeric biomaterials. chemical modification of the surface by grafting of polyethylene glycol (peg) chains or the incorporation of non-antibiotic antimicrobial agents such as triclosan into the biomaterial matrix may reduce bacterial adhesion. here, such strategies are simultaneously applied to the preparation of both condensation-cure and addition-cure silicone elastomer systems, seeking a sustained release antimicrobial device biomaterial. the influence of triclosan incorporation and degree of pegylation on antimicrobial release, surface microbial adherence and persistence (escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis) were evaluated in vitro. non-pegylated silicone elastomers provided an increased percentage release of triclosan extending over a relatively short duration (99% release by day 64) compared with their pegylated (4% w/w) counterparts (65% and 72% release by day 64, for condensation and addition-cure systems respectively). viable e. coli adherence to a non-pegylated  silicone elastomer containing 1% w/w triclosan was reduced by over 99% after 24 h compared to the non-pegylated silicone elastomer containing no triclosan. no viable s. epidermidis adhered to any of the triclosan-loaded (>0.1% w/w) formulations other than the control. persistence of the antimicrobial activity of the triclosan-loaded pegylated silicone elastomers continued for at least 70 days compared to the triclosan-loaded non-pegylated elastomers (at least 49 days). understanding how peg affects the release of triclosan from silicone elastomers may prove useful in the development of a biomaterial providing prolonged, effective antimicrobial activity.

TI  == evaluation of antimicrobial peptides as novel bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored platelets.
AB  == background: a single cost-effective pathogen inactivation approach would help to  improve the safety of our nation's blood supply. several methods and technologies are currently being studied to help reduce bacterial contamination of blood components. there is clearly need for simple and easy-to-use pathogen inactivation techniques specific to plasma, platelets (plts), and red blood cells. study design and methods: in this report, we introduce a novel proof of concept: using known therapeutic antimicrobial peptides (amps) as bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored plt concentrates (pcs). nine synthetic amps, four from plt microbicidal protein-derived peptides (pd1-4) and five arg-trp (rw) repeat peptides containing one to five repeats, were tested for bactericidal activity in plasma and pc samples spiked with staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacillus cereus. a 3-log reduction of viable bacteria was considered as the bactericidal activity of a given peptide. results: in both plasma alone and pcs,  rw3 peptide demonstrated bactericidal activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and k. pneumoniae; pd4 and rw2 against p. aeruginosa; and rw4 against k. pneumoniae. the activity of each of these four peptides against the remaining bacterial species in the test panel resulted in less than a 3-log reduction in the number of viable bacteria and hence considered ineffective. conclusions: these findings suggest a new approach to improving the safety of blood components, demonstrating the potential usefulness of screening therapeutic amps against selected bacteria to identify suitable bactericidal agents for stored plasma, pcs, and other blood products.

TI  == biofouling characteristics using flow field-flow fractionation: effect of bacteria and membrane properties.
AB  == in this study, membrane biofouling caused by bacteria that have different characteristics was evaluated using flow field-flow fractionation (flfff). three  different bacteria which differed from size and shape (staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, flavobacterium lutescens) were investigated with gm ultrafiltration (uf, rough with a low negative surface charge and relatively high hydrophobicity) and ne70 nanofiltration (nf, smooth with a high negative surface charge and relatively low hydrophobicity) membranes. the flfff retention  time of s. epidermidis, e. coli and f. lutescens was highly influenced by the ionic strength of the solution and the surface polarity of the membranes and bacteria. the nf membrane was found to have a higher potential of biofouling than the uf membrane with the bacteria tested in this study. e. coli was the most significant biofoulant among the bacteria tested on both membrane surfaces based  on flfff retention times compared to other bacteria.

TI  == decreased linezolid uptake in an in vitro-selected linezolid-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis mutant.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to characterize the mechanism of resistance to linezolid in an in vitro-selected linezolid-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis mutant. methods: a linezolid-resistant strain of s. epidermidis was selected by serial passages with increasing concentrations of linezolid. the mics of linezolid, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, rifampicin, vancomycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol and oxacillin were determined. the 23s rrna gene was  amplified and sequenced, to search for mutations conferring linezolid resistance. the mic of linezolid was also determined in the presence of reserpine. finally, the accumulation of linezolid was measured and quantified by hplc/uv. results: the obtained resistant strain had an mic of linezolid of 64 mg/l and was stable after several passages on blood agar. the mic measured in the presence of 25 mg/l reserpine, an efflux pump inhibitor, was not altered (mic of 64 mg/l). the sequence of the 23s rrna gene showed that the mutation g2576t (escherichia coli numbering) was not present and no other mutation was found. an analysis of the accumulation of linezolid was performed, comparing the uptake of the resistant strain with that of the susceptible one. this showed that the resistant strain had significantly lower levels of linezolid accumulation than its susceptible parental strain. conclusions: the mechanism of resistance to linezolid, in this resistant strain, may be related to a decrease in the antimicrobial uptake. this  new mechanism of resistance was also related to a little loss of fitness.

TI  == evaluation of the type i signal peptidase as antibacterial target for biofilm-associated infections of staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == the development of antibacterial resistance is inevitable and is a major concern  in hospitals and communities. moreover, biofilm-grown bacteria are less sensitive to antimicrobial treatment. in this respect, the gram-positive staphylococcus epidermidis is an important source of nosocomial biofilm-associated infections. in the search for new antibacterial therapies, the type i signal peptidase (spase i) serves as a potential target for development of antibacterials with a novel mode of action. this enzyme cleaves off the signal peptide from secreted proteins, making it essential for protein secretion, and hence for bacterial cell viability. s. epidermidis encodes three putative spases i (denoted sip1, sip2 and sip3), of which sip1 lacks the catalytic lysine. in this report, we investigated  the active s. epidermidis spases i in more detail. sip2 and sip3 were found to complement a temperature-sensitive escherichia coli lepb mutant, demonstrating their in vivo functional activity. in vitro functional activity of purified sip2  and sip3 proteins and inhibition of their activity by the spase i inhibitor arylomycin a(2) were further illustrated using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fret)-based assay. furthermore, we demonstrated that spase i not only is an attractive target for development of novel antibacterials against free-living bacteria, but also is a feasible target for biofilm-associated infections.

TI  == in vitro assessment of the antibiotic efficacy of contrast media and antibiotics  and their combinations at various dilutions.
AB  == discography is a controversial diagnostic procedure involving the injection of radiographic contrast medium (rcm) into the intervertebral disc. iatrogenic bacterial discitis is a rare but serious complication. the intervention has been  increasingly performed in our patients here in the united arab emirates. prophylactic intravenous antibiotic administration can reduce post-interventional discitis; however, this may favour the development of bacterial resistance. direct intradiscal injection of an antibiotic together with the rcm is a potential alternative. to date, there has been only one study on the efficacy of  antibiotics added to an rcm. equally, there are only limited data regarding the potential direct effect of rcm on bacterial growth. the purpose of this study was to determine whether the efficacy of antibiotics is affected when rcm are added.  in an in vitro study, the effect of non-ionic rcm on the growth of five laboratory bacterial strains, alone and in combination with three broad-spectrum  antimicrobials, was tested. bacterial growth was assessed in the absence and the  presence of rcm, antibiotics and their combinations. all three rcm alone demonstrated some inhibition of bacterial growth at high concentrations. in the presence of the rcm, all three antibiotics retained their inhibitory effect on bacterial growth. in conclusion, our in vitro experiments did not reveal any changes in the antimicrobial efficacy of the three antibiotics in the presence of the three tested rcm. subsequent clinical trials will need to assess whether intradiscal antibiotic administration may be a suitable substitute for, or a supplement to, prophylactic systemic antibiotics before discography.

TI  == the uropathogenic species staphylococcus saprophyticus tolerates a high concentration of d-serine.
AB  == human urine contains a relatively high concentration of d-serine, which is toxic  to several nonuropathogenic bacteria, but can be utilized or detoxified by uropathogenic escherichia coli (upec). the sequenced genome of uropathogenic staphylococcus saprophyticus contains a gene with homology to the d-serine deaminase gene (dsda) of upec. we found the gene in several clinical isolates of  s. saprophyticus; however, the gene was absent in staphylococcus xylosus and staphylococcus cohnii, phylogenetically close relatives of s. saprophyticus, and  could also not be detected in isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and 13 other staphylococcal species. in addition, the genomes of other sequenced staphylococci do not harbor homologues of this operon. interestingly, s. saprophyticus could grow in media supplemented with relatively  high concentrations of d-serine, whereas s. aureus, s. epidermidis and other staphylococcal species could not. the association of the dsda gene with growth in media including d-serine was proved by introducing the gene into s. aureus newman. given the fact that upec and s. saprophyticus tolerate this compound, d-serine utilization and detoxification may be a general property of uropathogenic bacteria.

AB  == purpose: to analyse clinical and demographic factors of patients who suffered infection of the surgical site requiring mesh removal as a complication of prosthetic repairs, details of the hernioplasties in which meshes were implanted  and their management and outcomes. methods: factors related to infection (demographic variables and characteristics of the repairs and mesh utilised) and  the management before proceeding to mesh removal were obtained from patient charts. collected specimens (meshes and tissues) from 32 consecutive patients were cultured and observed microscopically. the outcomes after mesh removal were  prospectively evaluated. results: twenty-two patients underwent incisional hernioplasties and ten inguinal hernioplasties; most of the procedures took a long time, and 28 patients presented early wound complications (seroma or haematoma). during the "implantation-removal" interval, some conservative treatments, such as drainages or sinus resection, were attempted under local anaesthesia. twenty-two meshes were totally removed (nine after partial extraction); in the remaining ten cases partially removal was successful. most of the meshes (24) were made of multi-filament polypropylene; microscopic observation of neighbouring tissues showed leucocyte infiltration, giant cell reaction, disorganisation of the collagen fibres and abscedation. treatment of 32 patients required 51 operations. following mesh removal, there were six recurrences and two fistulas of the bowel. the average follow-up was 40 months (30-97). conclusions: most of the infections requiring mesh removal were related  to prolonged repair operations that presented untreated early postoperative wound complications. partial extraction of meshes frequently leads to failures and complications. surgical exploration should be performed under general anaesthesia to accomplish complete mesh extraction.

TI  == aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit staphylococcal and enterococcal biofilm formation.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus are the leading causative agents of indwelling medical device infections because of their ability to form biofilms on artificial surfaces. here we describe the antibiofilm activity of a class of small molecules, the aryl rhodanines, which specifically inhibit biofilm formation of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. gallinarum but not the gram-negative species pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli. the aryl rhodanines do not exhibit antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial strains tested and are not cytotoxic against hela cells. preliminary mechanism-of-action studies revealed that the aryl rhodanines  specifically inhibit the early stages of biofilm development by preventing attachment of the bacteria to surfaces.

TI  == at the crossroads of bacterial metabolism and virulence factor synthesis in staphylococci.
AB  == bacteria live in environments that are subject to rapid changes in the availability of the nutrients that are necessary to provide energy and biosynthetic intermediates for the synthesis of macromolecules. consequently, bacterial survival depends on the ability of bacteria to regulate the expression  of genes coding for enzymes required for growth in the altered environment. in pathogenic bacteria, adaptation to an altered environment often includes activating the transcription of virulence genes; hence, many virulence genes are  regulated by environmental and nutritional signals. consistent with this observation, the regulation of most, if not all, virulence determinants in staphylococci is mediated by environmental and nutritional signals. some of these external signals can be directly transduced into a regulatory response by two-component regulators such as srrab; however, other external signals require transduction into intracellular signals. many of the external environmental and nutritional signals that regulate virulence determinant expression can also alter bacterial metabolic status (e.g., iron limitation). altering the metabolic status results in the transduction of external signals into intracellular metabolic signals that can be "sensed" by regulatory proteins (e.g., cody, rex, and glnr).  this review uses information derived primarily using bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli to articulate how gram-positive pathogens, with emphasis on staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, regulate virulence determinant expression in response to a changing environment.

TI  == antimicrobial and antibiofilm efficacy of triclosan and dispersinb combination.
AB  == objectives: the objectives of this study were to examine: (i) synergy of the combination of triclosan and dispersinb (dspb); (ii) in vitro efficacy and durability of triclosan + dspb-coated vascular catheters; and (iii) in vivo efficacy of triclosan + dspb-coated catheters compared with chlorhexidine-silver  sulfadiazine (ch-ss)-coated and uncoated (control) vascular catheters in preventing colonization by staphylococcus aureus. methods: we investigated the potential synergistic antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of triclosan and dspb by biofilm assays. the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of triclosan + dspb-coated catheters was determined by microbial colonization assays. antimicrobial durability of the coated catheters was tested by soaking segments in bovine serum for 7 days and determining antimicrobial activity, and by a serial plate transfer method. the in vivo efficacy of triclosan + dspb-coated catheters compared with ch-ss-coated and uncoated catheters was assessed by subcutaneous implantation of segments in a rabbit model of s. aureus infection. results: the combination of triclosan and dspb showed synergistic antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli, significantly reduced bacterial colonization (p < 0.05) and generally demonstrated a prolonged superior antimicrobial activity against clinical pathogens compared with ch-ss-coated catheters. triclosan + dspb-coated  and ch-ss-coated catheters exhibited equal in vivo efficacy (p <or= 0.05) in reducing colonization by s. aureus compared with uncoated catheters. conclusions: catheters coated with the triclosan + dspb combination showed synergistic, broad-spectrum and durable antimicrobial activity. furthermore, the in vivo efficacy of catheters coated with this unique antimicrobial/antibiofilm composition prompts clinical evaluation of such an innovative approach.

TI  == interventions for control of salmonella: clearance of microbial growth from rubber picker fingers.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine if a surface material with antimicrobial properties combined with an effective disinfectant could achieve total clearance  of bacterial contamination. before beginning the project, new rubber picker fingers collected from 3 processing facilities were tested for endogenous microflora. five species of bacteria common to soil and human handling were present: bacillus amyloliquefaciens, bacillus cereus/thuringiensis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hominis ssp. novobiosepticus, and staphylococcus intermedius. in separate experiments, new (unused) rubber picker fingers from 3 manufacturers were exposed to broiler carcass rinses, and the kinetics of bacterial attachment to finger material was determined. turbidity of  the bacterial suspensions at varying dilutions containing picker finger sections  was compared hourly with controls to evaluate inhibition. new rubber finger material from the 3 manufacturers significantly inhibited bacterial growth (p < 0.05), without the aid of antibacterial additives. we improved an assay for screening disinfectants against growth of pathogens and determined the activity of 5 disinfectant compounds. two of the compounds were most effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enteritidis, and escherichia coli, and one of the compounds was selected for further study with salmonella enteritidis. scanning electron microscopy confirmed the levels of salmonella enteritidis before and after treatment. the most effective compound was nontoxic and completely cleared salmonella enteritidis contamination from the rubber picker finger surface.

TI  == silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coatings: antibacterial activity and surface analysis.
AB  == the colonisation of clinical and industrial surfaces with pathogenic microorganisms has prompted increased research into the development of effective  antibacterial and antifouling coatings. there is evidence that implanted biomedical surfaces coated with metallic silver can be inactivated by physiological fluids, thus reducing the bioactivity of the coating. in this work, we report the biofilm inhibition of staphylococcus epidermidis using a room temperature processed silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coating. the release of silver ions from these fluoropolymers over a six-day period inhibited  bacterial encrustation - as observed by scanning electron microscopy (sem). x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) analysis indicated differences in carbon, fluorine and sodium surface composition between silver doped and undoped fluoropolymers after exposure to nutrient rich media. these silver doped perfluoropolyether coatings also exhibited antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii; suggesting potential use in preventing transmission of pathogenic and opportunistic microbes on environmental surfaces in healthcare facilities. the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of these silver release coatings may be exploited on biomaterials surfaces to combat the development of resistant gram-negative enterobacteriaceae that can occur during prophylactic treatment for urinary tract infections.

TI  == dark secrets behind the shimmer of contact lens: the indian scenario.
AB  == background: we studied the bacteriological profile of soft contact lens and its accessories among the asymptomatic subjects and monitored the compliance level with the lens use and its cleaning protocol. findings: a total of 115 (104 daily  wear and 11 extended wear) subjects using contact lens were studied. data regarding the duration of use and frequency and method of cleaning were recorded. contact lens, lens cases, preserving solutions and tips of solution bottles were  the samples collected. the isolates were identified on the basis of their phenotypic characters. samples from 24 subjects (21 daily wear and 3 extended wear) were found contaminated. of the 24 contaminated cases, 23 showed medium adherence to the cleaning protocol. contamination rate was higher among the 56 daily wear lens users who used same lens for 2 years and more, than the 48 users  who used their lenses for less than 2 years. lens case contamination was found in all the 24 cases. the bacteria isolated were citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae. in extended wear lens users, there was no change in microbial flora on repeating the cultures on day 7 and 14. conclusion: non-compliance with contact lens use may lead to invitation of microbial flora. the accumulation of these bacteria may act as a precursor to biofilm formation, thus colonizing the lens accessories as well. the bacteria isolated in this study were similar to the ones causing microbial keratitis thus, predisposing the otherwise asymptomatic subjects to permanent visual damage.

TI  == neonatal cord blood subsets and cytokine response to bacterial antigens.
AB  == we compared lymphocyte subsets and cytokine responses to bacteria among term, preterm infants, and adults. lymphocyte subset percentages in cord blood (22 preterm, 27 term neonates) and peripheral blood from 21 adults and cytokine/chemokine interleukin (il)-6, il-8, il-10, il-12, interferon gamma (ifn  gamma) responses to escherichia coli, group b streptococcus (gbs), staphylococcus epidermidis, and lactobacillus plantarum (lp299v) were assessed by flow cytometry. preterm compared with term infants had increased cd8 (+) t cells (p =  0.02) and reduced naive cd4 (+) t cells (p < 0.0001). memory t and natural killer (nk) t cells were reduced (p < 0.001) in neonates; nk and cd56 (+)161 (+) nk cells were increased (p < 0.001). cd56 (+)cd8 (+) nk cells were higher in preterm compared with term infants. despite individual exceptions, cytokine responses in  neonates were weaker than adults except for il-8 response to e. coli in preterm and il-12 response to lp299v in term infants. il-10 responses were weaker in preterm (p = 0.01) and term (p = 0.005) infants to s. epidermidis and to e. coli  (p = 0.03 for both) compared with adults. differences in regulatory subpopulations of nk and t cells between neonates and adults and term compared with preterm infants were observed. these differences rather than intrinsic functional deficiency may account for neonatal cytokine responses to bacteria.

TI  == a new central venous catheter cap: decreased microbial growth and risk for catheter-related bloodstream infection.
AB  == objective: catheter-related blood stream infection (crbi) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is a source of significant healthcare expenditures in patients that require central venous catheters for intravenous nutrition, chemotherapy, and other products. the source of many catheter-related infections  is contamination of the catheter hub. herein an antimicrobial catheter cap, the ab cap is described. methods: the ab cap device is a catheter cleaning device designed to keep needleless luer valves clean by encapsulating them in a cleaning solution. this device was evaluated using an in vitro model of hub contamination  with staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epidermidis), klebsiella pneumonia (k. pneumonia), pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and candida albicans (c. albicans). following hub contamination on days 1, 3, 5 and 7, saline was infused through the ab cap and effluent collected from the efferent end. the effluent fluid was cultured for the index organisms, and allowed to incubate in culture for up to 7 days. negative control caps were not contaminated and positive controls lacked cleaning solution and were contaminated. results: microbial growth developed for all index organisms, and generally within 1 day of culture growth following the first day of contamination (day 1) in effluent from  all positive controls, while no growth occurred in effluent from negative controls. no growth of any organism occurred in any of the test items after the first day of contamination. growth of three organisms was detected in two of the  three test ab caps following contamination day 3, after 1-4 days of incubation. all organisms could be cultured in the effluent from two of the three test items  at contamination day 5, generally by the second day of incubation. one test item  remained free of growth for the entire test period except for one organism. by day 7, this particular test item grew an additional organism and the testing was  concluded. all positive growth test items remained positive on subsequent inoculations during culture of newly obtained effluent with the exception of test item a, from which effluent following inoculation on day 3 showed growth of s. epidermidis and k. pneumonia, but no growth for these organisms from effluent obtained on inoculation day 5. in addition, effluent from test item c showed growth of c. albicans from inoculation day 5, but no growth from effluent obtained on inoculation day 7. the growth of s. epidermidis from effluent of test item a from the day 3 inoculation, and c. albicans from effluent of test items b  and c did not occur until day 4 of incubation, suggesting a very small amount of  contamination. conclusion: an antimicrobial catheter cap is not a complete substitute for a proper catheter cleaning technique and other anti-infection precautions. however, we describe a unique catheter cap that significantly decreased the likelihood of a catheter-related infection from a non-cleaned cap in an in vitro model.

TI  == neonatal blood cultures: effect of delayed entry into the blood culture machine and bacterial concentration on the time to positive growth in a simulated model.
AB  == aims: to determine if: time from blood culture inoculation to positive growth (total time to positive) and time from blood culture machine entry to positive growth (machine time to positive) is altered by delayed entry into the automated  blood culture machine, and if the total time to positive differs by the concentration of organisms inoculated into blood culture bottles. methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli and group b beta-haemolytic streptococci were chosen as clinically significant representative organisms. two  concentrations (> or =10 colony-forming units per millilitre and <1 colony-forming units per millilitre) were inoculated into peds bact/alert blood culture bottles and randomly allocated to one of three delayed automated blood culture machine entry times (30 min/8.5 h/15.5 h). results: for all organisms at  all concentrations, except the staphylococcus epidermidis, the machine time to positive was significantly decreased by delayed entry. for all organisms at all concentrations, the mean total time to positive significantly increased with increasing delayed entry into the blood culture machine. higher concentrations of group b beta-haemolytic streptococci and escherichia coli grew significantly faster than lower concentrations. conclusion: bacterial growth in inoculated bottles, stored at room temperature, continues although at a slower rate than in  those blood culture bottles immediately entered into the machine. if a blood culture specimen has been stored at room temperature for greater than 15.5 h, the currently allowed safety margin of 36 h (before declaring a result negative) may  be insufficient.

TI  == polyelectrolyte multilayers with intrinsic antimicrobial functionality: the importance of mobile polycations.
AB  == cationic contact-killing is an important strategy for creating antimicrobial surfaces that prevent viable bacteria attachment. recent studies have shown that  highly swollen, compliant surfaces resist bacterial attachment and a sufficient density of mobile cationic charge can effectively disrupt bacterial cell membranes. polyelectrolyte multilayers (pems), a popular coating system for surface modification, have been used to kill bacteria through the incorporation of contact-killing or leaching biocides. in this work, we show that manipulation  of multilayer assembly and postassembly conditions (e.g., ph) to expose mobile cationic charge can create antimicrobial pems without the addition of specific biocidal species. as a model system, we explored pems comprising poly(allylamine  hydrochloride) (pah) and poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (sps) assembled at high ph and subsequently immersed in low ph solutions. this system undergoes a reversible ph-dependent swelling transition, and we demonstrate that antimicrobial functionality at physiological ph conditions can be turned on and off with suitable ph treatment. in both airborne and waterborne bacteria assays,  the viability of two strains of gram positive staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epidermidis), one biofilm forming and one nonbiofilm forming, and two strains of  gram negative escherichia coli (e. coli) was effectively reduced on sps/pah multilayers displaying accessible cationic charge. to generalize our results, the ph assembly conditions of pems comprising poly(acrylic acid) (paa) and pah were also modified to introduce antibacterial capabilities.

AB  == the present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a r. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. the bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium, and enterobacteriaceae (enterobacter spp., escherichia coli) while pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. the lactobacillus plantarum and l. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. while l. plantarum crl 1606 also inhibited  red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. however, by using a mrs medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. the surface properties of lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate abo human erythrocytes, while  the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. this  paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.

TI  == an antimicrobial modified silicone peritoneal catheter with activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == peritonitis, exit site and tunnel infections are serious complications of peritoneal dialysis (capd), which may lead to catheter loss, despite measures taken to reduce the infection rate. catheters coated with antimicrobials have shown only short-term activity. we have developed a process for conferring broad-spectrum, long-duration antimicrobial activity on capd catheters while reducing the risk of resistance. catheters were processed using an impregnation method. three agents were used: rifampicin, triclosan and trimethoprim. tests included establishing the duration of activity before test bacteria became resistant, the ability to kill 100% of attached bacteria in a predetermined time  (tk100), and ability to withstand multiple high-count challenges until failure in a flow model. antimicrobial activity continued until it was stopped at 280 days and the agents prevented the emergence of resistant strains. tk100 results showed a >99.9% reduction of attached bacteria. the flow model showed no colonization when repeatedly challenged with high loads of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus or escherichia coli for approximately 90 days. the antimicrobial catheter  material showed prolonged activity against common capd pathogens and promises to  reduce clinical capd infection.

TI  == the antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  == acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. the main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused  by organisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa. this study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect  of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (hibicet). former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. to cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial  strains were tested: escherichia coli, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii,  enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and beta-haemolytic streptococcus group a and b. the tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii. the microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested  at a low concentration of 3%. in comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. an evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic  acid is currently underway. it can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.

TI  == clinical investigation of isolated bacteria from urinary tracts of hospitalized patients and their susceptibilities to antibiotics.
AB  == complicated urinary tract infections (utis) are often difficult to treat, partly  because of the existence of isolated antibiotic-resistant strains. even though the definition of uti is determined by the quantity of cultured bacteria, it has  been unclear if the quantity of cultured uti bacteria affects their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. also, the gram stain is generally performed to assume the causative bacteria and their quantity before culture results can be obtained; therefore, we could start to use effective antibiotics if the relationship between bacterial quantity and resistance to antimicrobial agents were clear. we studied patients diagnosed as having complicated utis at the urological department in kobe university hospital between june 2002 and march 2003 and analyzed the relationships between the quantity of cultured bacteria and their antimicrobial mics for antibiotics. the most commonly isolated bacteria were serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. there was no significant correlation between the quantity of cultured bacteria and antimicrobial mics in all the bacteria and antibiotics that we tested, suggesting that resistant phenotype, but not inoculum of the organism, did determine resistance to antibiotics. in conclusion, our investigation suggested the total number of isolated bacteria in  urine culture did not determine the mics and that inoculum of the bacteria might  be important for this determination.

TI  == comparative assessment of antimicrobial activities of antibiotic-treated penile prostheses.
AB  == background: although infections associated with penile implants are relatively infrequent, they result in serious medical consequences. because treatment of these infections usually requires removal of the infected penile implant, prevention of infection is crucial. since bacterial colonization of the implant is a prelude to clinical infection, antimicrobial modification of the devices may inhibit device colonization and subsequent infection. objective: we compared the  spectrum and durability, both in vitro and in vivo, of two antibiotic-treated penile prostheses: inhibizone implants pre-impregnated with minocycline and rifampin (m/r) and titan implants dipped in vancomycin. design, setting, and participants: 1x1-cm cylinder segments of (1) control untreated, (2) m/r-impregnated, and (3) vancomycin-dipped implants were studied. baseline zones  of inhibition (zi) were determined against clinical isolates, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), and escherichia coli. in addition, zi against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus were compared both in vitro after being washed in a flow chamber and after subcutaneous implantation in rabbits for 1, 2, 7, and 14 d. measurements: zi were measured as  the diameter of the clear zone around each test device minus the external diameter of the device. results and limitations: implants pre-impregnated with m/r displayed a broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity than vancomycin-dipped implants against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. the m/r-impregnated devices also yielded significantly larger zones of inhibition against s. aureus than vancomycin-dipped implants, both in vitro (p<0.003) and in vivo throughout the 14-d period of device implantation in rabbits (p</=0.03). conclusions: penile prostheses impregnated with m/r have a broader spectrum in vitro and a more durable antimicrobial activity in vitro and in an animal model than implants dipped in vancomycin. therefore, along with being a more practical model for incorporating antimicrobials onto the device, the use of implants pre-impregnated with m/r may help reduce the incidence of penile implant infection.

AB  == to study the anti-infectious effect of a vascular allograft, the antimicrobial activity of tryptophan metabolites mediated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase was determined. the growth of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) over 10 h in extracts from post-transplantation vascular allograft was significantly slower than that of extracts from non-transplantation vascular allograft regardless of the presence of tryptophan (p<0.05). when the antimicrobial activity of the tryptophan metabolites in the l-tryptophan-l-kynurenine pathway was examined, 3-hydroxy-dl-kynurenine and alpha-picolinic acid had strong antibacterial activity against mrsa, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, although antimicrobial activities of  anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid against them were low. the results showed that, of the tested tryptophan metabolites, 3-hydroxy-dl-kynurenine and alpha-picolinic acid contributed to the anti-infectious effects of the allograft by inhibiting of the growth of microorganisms.

TI  == staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms: functional molecules, relation to virulence, and vaccine potential.
AB  == medical device-associated infections, most frequently caused by staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, are of increasing importance in modern medicine. the formation of adherent, multilayered bacterial biofilms is crucial in the pathogenesis of these infections. polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (pia), a homoglycan of beta-1,6-linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d: -glucopyranosyl residues, of which about 15% are non-n-acetylated, is central to biofilm accumulation in staphylococci. it transpires that polysaccharides - structurally  very similar to pia - are also key to biofilm formation in a number of other organisms including the important human pathogens escherichia coli, aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, yersinia pestis, and bordetella spp. apparently, synthesis of pia and related polysaccharides is a general feature important for biofilm formation in diverse bacterial genera. current knowledge about the structure and biosynthesis of pia and related polysaccharides is reviewed. additionally, information on their role in pathogenesis of biomaterial-related and other type of infections and the potential use of pia and related compounds for prevention of infection is evaluated.

TI  == in vitro anti-adhesive activity of green tea extract against pathogen adhesion.
AB  == camellia sinensis polysaccharide has been reported to possess anti-adhesive activity against pathogens. the present study was designed to investigate whether hot water extracts obtained from green tea leaves might inhibit pathogen adhesion to human or mouse cell lines. green tea extract-4 (csi-4) with the maximum yield  of 4% (w/v) is composed of a major proportion of carbohydrates containing 40% uronic acids, but lack of catechins. it showed strong inhibitory activities against hemagglutination mediated by pathogens helicobacter pylori, propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus aureus with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.01-0.5 mg/ml. csi-4 further demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the adhesion of these pathogens to host cell lines with the ic(50) values (50% inhibition of adhesion) of 0.14-2.3 mg/ml. it exhibited the highest activity against p. acnes, but no inhibitory effects were observed against lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. our results suggest that csi-4 may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria with no adverse effects against beneficial or commensal bacteria.

TI  == microbiological and toxicological effects of perla black bean (phaseolus vulgaris l.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == we investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. three different solvents were used to obtain perla black bean extracts. all three perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and  further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (ic(50)). methanol perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. all perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes did not. acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. the best ic(50) was observed for giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against entamoeba histolytica and trichomonas vaginalis. the vero cells toxicity levels (ic(50)) for methanol, acidified water  and acetic acid perla black bean extract were [mean +/- s.d. (95% ci)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. in vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. the acetic acid and methanol perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against giardia lamblia, entamoeba hystolitica and trichomonas vaginalis. the three perla black bean extracts assayed over vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.

TI  == four anti-protozoal and anti-bacterial compounds from tapirira guianensis.
AB  == tapirira guianensis is a common tree used in traditional medicine in french guiana against several infectious diseases (malaria, leishmaniasis, bacteria, etc.). the bioassay-guided purification of ch(2)cl(2) bark extract led to the isolation of four cyclic alkyl polyol derivatives: 4,6,2'-trihydroxy-6-[10'(z)-heptadecenyl]-1-cyclohexen-2-one (1a), 1,4,6-trihydroxy-1,2'-epoxy-6-[10'(z)-heptadecenyl]-2-cyclohexene (1b), 1,4,5,2'-tetrahydroxy-1-[10'(z)-heptadecenyl]-2-cyclohexene (2), and 1,3,4,6-tetrahydroxy-1,2'-epoxy-6-[10'(z)-heptadecenyl]-cyclohexane (3). the structures were established on the basis of 1d and 2d nmr analyses. the anti-leishmanial, anti-plasmodial, anti-bacterial (on staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli), and anti-fungal (on candida albicans) activities of the extracts and of these original compounds were evaluated. two showed medicinal interest supporting the traditional uses of the plant. the structures were established through spectral analyses of the isolates  and their derivatives.

TI  == innovative antimicrobial susceptibility testing method using surface plasmon resonance.
AB  == utilizing the ultra sensitivity of surface plasmon resonance (spr) biosensor to examine drug resistance of bacteria was studied in this research. susceptible and resistant strains of escherichia coli jm109 to ampicillin and those of staphylococcus epidermidis to tetracycline, served as a blind test, were examined. the bacteria adhered on the au thin film was treated by the injection of antibiotic flow. the optical property change of the bacteria responded to antibiotics were recorded through spr mechanism. as a result, the susceptible strain of e. coli generally revealed more than three times of spr angle shift when compared to the resistant one; the susceptible strain of s. epidermidis revealed irregular spr angle shift while the resistant strain kept the spr angle  almost unchanged. the new spr method took less than 2h of antibiotic treatment time to complete the antimicrobial susceptibility test. different from conventional applications of spr, specific antibodies is not required in this method. as compared to the conventional assays, kirby-bauer disk diffusion and variations of broth microdilution usually take 1 day to weeks to issue the report. using this spr assay can greatly reduce the waiting period for laboratory tests, and can therefore benefit patients who need proper antibiotic treatments to control bacterial infections. the sensitivity of the spr biosensor built for the application is around 1.4 x 10(-4) on the refractive index.

TI  == bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in ibadan, nigeria.
AB  == previous studies done on wound infections in this environment had been mostly on  the surgical variety rather than the non-surgical. however,few studies available  on the non-surgical type have indicated that changes do occur in the pattern and  antibiogram of the bacterial isolates of these non-surgical wound infections. this study was therefore designed to investigate the bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in this environment. a retrospective review of seven hundred and fifty four cases of non-surgical wound infections was conducted between september 2002 and february 2005 at the university college hospital, ibadan, nigeria. a total number of 871 bacterial, and seven fungal isolates were obtained from these wound cultures. in 477 (70.3%) cases, cultures were monomicrobial and 202 (29.8%) polymicrobial. staphylococcus aureus (38%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), klebsiella species (17%), escherichia coli (10.6%), proteus species (7.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (4.4%), streptococcus species (1.6%), enterococcus faecalis (1.4%), and candida albicans (0.8%). high rates of antibiotic resistance were recorded among these isolates. 53.4% of them  were sensitive to ceftriaxone, 42.5% to gentamycin and 39.3% to ofloxacin. this high antibiotic resistance gives credence to the value of determining the antibiogram of these pathogens in their management. continuous interaction between the wound care practitioners and microbiology department is also advocated.

TI  == enumeration of mycobacterium leprae using real-time pcr.
AB  == mycobacterium leprae is not cultivable in axenic media, and direct microscopic enumeration of the bacilli is complex, labor intensive, and suffers from limited  sensitivity and specificity. we have developed a real-time pcr assay for quantifying m. leprae dna in biological samples. primers were identified to amplify a shared region of the multicopy repeat sequence (rlep) specific to m. leprae and tested for sensitivity and specificity in the taqman format. the assay was specific for m. leprae and able to detect 10 fg of purified m. leprae dna, or approximately 300 bacteria in infected tissues. we used the rlep taqman pcr to assess the short and long-term growth results of m. leprae in foot pad tissues obtained from conventional mice, a gene knock-out mouse strain, athymic nude mice, as well as from reticuloendothelial tissues of m. leprae-infected nine-banded armadillos. we found excellent correlative results between estimates  from rlep taqman pcr and direct microscopic counting (combined r = 0.98). the rlep taqman pcr permitted rapid analysis of batch samples with high reproducibility and is especially valuable for detection of low numbers of bacilli. molecular enumeration is a rapid, objective and highly reproducible means to estimate the numbers of m. leprae in tissues, and application of the technique can facilitate work with this agent in many laboratories.

TI  == [the analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to fess method].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the fess method. material and methods: studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. during the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. results: in the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. in 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, vankomycin, teicoplanin and levofloxacin. staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. another bacteria (escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. in 3 cultures (4.17%) we found klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100%  resistance to penicillins. in three cases pseudomonas fluorescens and proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of klebsiella pneumoniae. two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures  were noted: citrobacter freundii, streptococcus oralis and hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and cefuroxime was as high as 100%. conclusion: in the  operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. this indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. the cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.

TI  == the inhibition of staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm formation by vancomycin-modified titanium alloy and implications for the treatment of periprosthetic infection.
AB  == peri-prosthetic infections are notoriously difficult to treat as the biomaterial  implant is ideal for bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, resulting in decreased antibiotic sensitivity. previously, we reported that vancomycin covalently attached to a ti alloy surface (vanc-ti) could prevent bacterial colonization. herein we examine the effect of this vanc-ti surface on staphylococci epidermidis, a gram-positive organism prevalent in orthopaedic infections. by direct colony counting and fluorescent visualization of live bacteria, s. epidermidis colonization was significantly inhibited on vanc-ti implants. in contrast, the gram-negative organism escherichia coli readily colonized the vanc-ti rod, suggesting retention of antibiotic specificity. by histochemical and sem analysis, vanc-ti prevented s. epidermidis biofilm formation, even in the presence of serum. furthermore, when challenged multiple times with s. epidermidis, vanc-ti rods resisted bacterial colonization. finally, when s. epidermidis was continuously cultured in the presence of vanc-ti, the bacteria maintained a vanc sensitivity equivalent to the parent strain. these findings indicate that antibiotic derivatization of implants can result in a surface that can resist bacterial colonization. this technology holds great promise for the prevention and treatment of periprosthetic infections.

AB  == the extracellular serine endopeptidase gluse (ec 3.4.21.19) is considered to be one of the virulence factors of staphylococcus epidermidis. the present study investigated maturation processing of native gluse and that heterologously expressed in escherichia coli. in addition to the 28-kda mature protease, small amounts of proenzymes with molecular masses of 32, 30, and 29 kda were identified in the extracellular and cell wall-associated fractions. we defined the pre (m1-a27)- and pro (k28-s66)-segments, and found that processing at the e32-s33 and d48-i49 bonds was responsible for production of the 30- and 29-kda intermediates, respectively. the full-length form of c-terminally his-tagged gluse was purified as three proenzymes equivalent to the native ones. these molecules possessing an entire or a part of the pro-segment were proteolytically  latent and converted to a mature 28-kda form by thermolysin cleavage at the s66-v67 bond. mutation of the essential amino acid s235 suggested auto-proteolytic production of the 30- and 29-kda intermediates. furthermore, an  undecapeptide (i56-s66) of the truncated pro-segment not only functions as an inhibitor of the protease but also facilitates thermolysin processing. these findings could offer clues to the molecular mechanism involved in the regulation  of proteolytic activity of pathogenic proteases secreted from s. epidermidis.

AB  == an immunoglobulin-rich fraction has been prepared from ovine blood in our laboratory. we have investigated its antibacterial activity and binding activity  to pathogenic whole cell antigens, lipopolysaccharide (lps) and staphylococcal enterotoxin b. ovine immunoglobulin concentrate (oic) comprised about 73 +/- 2% of igg and 11 +/- 1% of igm on a protein basis. it inhibited the growth of all 13 strains of pathogens tested, but the inhibitory activity varied according to bacterial strain. the inhibitory activity of oic was attributed to the high contents of undenatured immunoglobulin present because its inhibitory activity was destroyed by pepsin digestion and heat treatment (65 degrees c for 30 min). oic bound to all the gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, regardless of cell wall structure. the highest magnitude of crossreactivity to whole cell antigens was against staphylococcus epidermidis and shigella soneii strains (p <  0.001). the binding activity of oic to lps obtained from escherichia coli o111:b4 and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and lymphoblast k-562 proliferation assay. oic bound to lps with a binding activity that was dependent on oic concentration and saturable, showing typical hyperbolic curves. for toxin-binding activity, an oic concentration-dependent trend like that for lps-binding activity was also observed. this preliminary evidence suggests that the oic used in this study could be a promising supplement for protecting against pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == bacterial dna sample preparation from whole blood using surface-modified si pillar arrays.
AB  == a novel bacterial dna sample preparation device for molecular diagnostics has been developed. on the basis of optimized conditions for bacterial adhesion, surface-modified silicon pillar arrays for bacterial cell capture were fabricated, and their ability to capture bacterial cells was demonstrated. the capture efficiency for bacterial cells such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus mutans in buffer solution was over 75% with a flow rate of 400 microl/min. moreover, the proposed method captured e. coli cells present in 50% whole blood effectively. the captured cells from whole blood were  then in- situ lyzed on the surface of the microchip, and the eluted dna was successfully amplified by qpcr. these results demonstrate that the full process of pathogen capture to dna isolation from whole blood could be automated in a single microchip.

TI  == effect of electrical current on the activities of antimicrobial agents against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are resistant to conventional antimicrobial agents. prior in vitro studies have shown that electrical current (ec) enhances the activities of  aminoglycosides, quinolones, and oxytetracycline against pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus gordonii. this phenomenon, known as the bioelectric effect, has been only partially defined. the purpose of this work was to study the in vitro bioelectric effect on the activities of 11 antimicrobial agents representing a variety of different classes against p. aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and s. epidermidis. an eight-channel current generator/controller and eight chambers delivering a continuous flow of fresh medium with or without antimicrobial agents and/or ec to biofilm-coated coupons were used. no significant decreases in the numbers of log(10) cfu/cm(2) were seen after exposure to antimicrobial agents alone, with the exception of a 4.57-log-unit reduction for s. epidermidis and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. we  detected a statistically significant bioelectric effect when vancomycin plus 2,000 microamperes ec were used against mrsa biofilms (p = 0.04) and when daptomycin and erythromycin were used in combination with 200 or 2,000 microamperes ec against s. epidermidis biofilms (p = 0.02 and 0.0004, respectively). the results of these experiments indicate that the enhancement of  the activity of antimicrobial agents against biofilm organisms by ec is not a generalizable phenomenon across microorganisms and antimicrobial agents.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of vertilmicin and its susceptibility to modifications by the recombinant aac6'-aph2'' enzyme.
AB  == vertilmicin is a new semisynthetic aminoglycoside with a structure similar to that of netilmicin except for a methyl group at the c-6' position. in the present study, the in vitro antibacterial activity of vertilmicin was studied, and its susceptibility to modifications by the recombinant aminoglycoside bifunctional modifying enzyme aac(6')-aph(2'') was compared with those of verdamicin and netilmicin. a total of 1,185 clinical isolates collected from hospitals in beijing between 2000 and 2001 were subjected to the in vitro antibacterial activity evaluations, including mic, minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc), and time-kill curve tests. the mics were evaluated in non-gentamicin-resistant (gentamicin-susceptible and gentamicin-intermediate) strains and gentamicin-resistant strains, respectively. for most of the non-gentamicin-resistant bacteria (except for the isolates of pseudomonas spp.),  the mic(90)s of vertilmicin were in the range of 0.5 to 8 microg/ml, comparable to those of the reference aminoglycosides. for the gentamicin-resistant isolates, the three semisynthetic aminoglycosides (vertilmicin, netilmicin, and amikacin) demonstrated low mic(50)s and/or mic(90)s, as well as high percent susceptibility values. among the study drugs, vertilmicin showed the lowest mic(90)s, 16 microg/ml, for the gram-positive gentamicin-resistant isolates of staphylococcus  aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. meanwhile, vertilmicin was a potent bactericidal agent, with mbc/mic ratios in the range of 1 to 2 for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and s. aureus and 1 to 4 for s. epidermidis. the time-kill curve determination further demonstrated that this effect was rapid and concentration dependent. in evaluations of susceptibility to modifications by the recombinant aac(6')-aph(2'') with maximum rate of metabolism/k(m) measurements, vertilmicin exhibited susceptibilities to both acetylation and phosphorylation lower than those of netilmicin and verdamicin.

TI  == silver nanorod arrays as a surface-enhanced raman scattering substrate for foodborne pathogenic bacteria detection.
AB  == surface-enhanced raman scattering (sers) using novel silver nanorod array substrates has been used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. the substrate  consists of a base layer of 500 nm silver film on a glass slide and a layer of silver nanorod array with a length of approximately 1 microm produced by the oblique angle deposition method at a vapor incident angle of 86 degrees . spectra from whole cell bacteria, generic escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, e. coli dh 5alpha, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and salmonella typhimurium, and bacteria mixtures have been obtained. this sers active substrate can detect spectral differences between gram types, different species, their mixture, and strains. principal component analysis (pca) has been applied to classify the spectra. viable and nonviable cells have also been examined, and significantly reduced sers responses were observed for nonviable cells. sers detection of bacteria at the single cell level, excited at low incident laser power (12 micro  w) and short collection time (10 s), has also been demonstrated. these results indicate that the sers-active silver nanorod array substrate is a potential analytical sensor for rapid identification of microorganisms with a minimum of sample preparation.

TI  == surface antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of incorporated polyethylenimine nanoparticles.
AB  == the antimicrobial effect and biocompatibility of insoluble cross-linked quaternary ammonium polyethylenimine (pei) nanoparticles incorporated at 1 or 2%w/w in a resin composite were assayed. the antimicrobial effect against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli was tested using the direct contact test (dct), agar diffusion test (adt) and scanning electron microscopy (sem). biocompatibility was tested by assessing macrophage viability, and tnfalpha secretion. samples incorporating 2%w/w nanoparticles inhibited the growth of all  bacterial strains tested. reducing the amount of the added nanoparticles to 1%w/w resulted in complete inhibition of s. aureus and e. faecalis, and decreased growth of s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa and e. coli (p<0.0001). the dct results were confirmed by sem. however, adt showed no inhibition halo in all test bacteria, indicating the antimicrobial nanoparticles are not diffusing into the agar milieu. biocompatibility tests revealed macrophage viability, and tnfalpha secretion was not altered by the presence of the nanoparticles in the resin. incorporation of pei nanoparticles in a resin composite had a long lasing antimicrobial effect against a wide range of bacteria with no measured effect on  biocompatibility.

TI  == monitoring the physiologic stress response: a novel biophysical approach for the  rapid detection of bacteria in platelet concentrate.
AB  == background: currently approved culture-based methods for the bacterial testing of platelet concentrates (pcs) require an extended period of time to obtain results. a new approach based on the monitoring of the bacterial response to physiologic stress is presented. because the stress response is independent of the growth rate, decisive results can be obtained in near real time. study design and methods: pcs were spiked with gram-positive staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes and gram-negative escherichia coli organisms commonly implicated in posttransfusion septic reactions. all suspensions were treated with triton x-100 at concentrations that caused human cell lysis while acting as a stressor for bacterial cells. normalized impedance response (nir) profiles of these suspensions were recorded using the biosense technologies differential impedance sensing platform specifically designed to monitor subtle changes in the dielectric properties of biologic suspensions. further development of the approach included measurement of nirs for spiked pcs treated with nonlysing chemical stressors. results: nir profiles for bacteria conventionally growing under optimal conditions were characterized by an overall increase in the nir values. in contrast, the corresponding responses from chemically stressed bacteria revealed immediate and continuous decreases in value-enabling bacterial  detection in less than 30 minutes. conclusion: these pilot experiments demonstrated that monitoring of the bacterial stress response is a fast and effective way to detect bacteria in pcs. in addition, special culture conditions  are not required for detecting anaerobes and fastidious species.

TI  == reduced bacterial adhesion to fibrinogen-coated substrates via nitric oxide release.
AB  == the ability of nitric oxide (no)-releasing xerogels to reduce fibrinogen-mediated adhesion of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and escherichia coli is described. a negative correlation was observed between no surface flux and bacterial adhesion for each species tested. for s. aureus and e. coli, reduced adhesion correlated directly with no flux from 0 to 30 pmol cm(-2)s(-1).  a similar dependence for s. epidermidis was evident from 18 to 30 pmol cm(-2)s(-1). at a no flux of 30 pmol cm(-2)s(-1), surface coverage of s. aureus,  s. epidermidis, and e. coli was reduced by 96, 48, and 88%, respectively, compared to non-no-releasing controls. polymeric no release was thus demonstrated to be an effective approach for significantly reducing fibrinogen-mediated adhesion of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro, thereby illustrating the advantage of active no release as a strategy for inhibiting bacterial adhesion in the presence of pre-adsorbed protein.

TI  == an escherichia coli expression system for glutamyl endopeptidases optimized by complete suppression of autodegradation.
AB  == v8 protease (gluv8), a member of the glutamyl endopeptidase i family isolated from the v8 strain of staphylococcus aureus, is widely used for proteome analysis because of its unique substrate specificity and resistance to detergents. we recently developed an escherichia coli expression system for the production of gluv8 based on a technique that suppresses the autoproteolysis--the use of the prosequence of its homologue (gluse) from staphylococcus epidermidis as a chimeric form or the introduction of four substitutions in the prosequence of gluv8. in the current study, we refined this technique through five amino acid substitutions within the prosequence of gluv8 for complete suppression of the autodegradation. as a result, the recovery of gluv8 proform was enhanced to 20 fg/cell, which was comparable to the level of a constitutive inactive form of gluv8, indicating complete suppression of the autoproteolysis. this mutated propeptide was also effective for the expression of the mature sequence of the glutamyl endopeptidase from staphylococcus warneri. the recombinant proteins were successfully converted to their active forms through a common cleavage mechanism  mediated by thermolysin in vitro. this strategy may shed light on the way for the expression of the proteases that have been scarcely produced in e. coli to date.

TI  == ceftobiprole: a review of a broad-spectrum and anti-mrsa cephalosporin.
AB  == ceftobiprole, an investigational cephalosporin, is currently in phase iii clinical development. ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and meticillin-resistant s. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, gram-negative bacilli including ampc-producing escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but excluding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. like cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime, ceftobiprole demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. in single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance development studies, ceftobiprole demonstrated a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is a weak inducer and a poor substrate for ampc beta-lactamases.ceftobiprole medocaril, the prodrug of ceftobiprole, is converted by plasma esterases to ceftobiprole in <30  minutes. peak serum concentrations of ceftobiprole observed at the end of a single 30-minute infusion were 35.5 mug/ml for a 500-mg dose and 59.6 mug/ml for  a 750-mg dose. the volume of distribution of ceftobiprole is 0.26 l/kg ( approximately 18 l), protein binding is 16%, and its serum half-life is approximately 3.5 hours. ceftobiprole is renally excreted ( approximately 70% in  the active form) and systemic clearance correlates with creatinine clearance, meaning that dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal dysfunction. ceftobiprole has a modest post-antibiotic effect (pae) of approximately 0.5 hours for mrsa and a longer pae of approximately 2 hours for penicillin-resistant pneumococci. ceftobiprole, when administered intravenously at 500 mg once every 8 hours (2-hour infusion), has a >90% probability of achieving f t(>mic) (free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]) for 40% and 60%, respectively, of the dosing interval for isolates with ceftobiprole mic < or =4 and < or =2 mg/l, respectively.currently, only limited clinical trial data are published for ceftobiprole. in a phase iii trial, 784 patients with gram-positive skin infections were randomized to treatment with either ceftobiprole 500 mg or vancomycin 1 g, each administered twice daily for 7-14 days; 93.3% of patients were clinically cured with ceftobiprole compared with 93.5% receiving vancomycin, and the eradication rate for mrsa infections was 91.8% for ceftobiprole compared  with 90% for vancomycin. a phase iii, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours plus ceftazidime 1 g every 8 hours in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. of the 828 patients enrolled, 31% had diabetic foot infections, 30% had abscesses, and 22% had wounds. no difference in clinical cure was reported in the clinically evaluable, intent-to-treat and microbiologically evaluable populations with cure rates of 90.5%, 81.9%, and 90.8%, respectively, in the ceftobiprole-treated patients and 90.2%, 80.8%, and 90.5%, respectively, in the vancomycin plus ceftazidime-treated group. microbiologic eradication of gram-positive cocci meticillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) [ceftobiprole 91% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%] and mrsa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 80%), as well as gram-negative bacilli, e. coli (ceftobiprole 89% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%), and p. aeruginosa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 100%), was not significantly different between groups. similar cures rates in the microbiologically evaluable population occurred in both groups for panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl)-positive mssa and pvl-positive mrsa.currently, ceftobiprole has completed phase iii trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections due to mrsa and nosocomial pneumonia due to suspected or proven mrsa; phase iii trials are also ongoing in community-acquired pneumonia. ceftobiprole has so far demonstrated a good safety  profile in preliminary studies with similar tolerability to comparators. the broad-spectrum activity of ceftobiprole may allow it to be used as monotherapy in situations where a combination of antibacterials might be required. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftobiprole  and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == monitoring and identification of bacteria associated with safety concerns in the  manufacture of sao jorge, a portuguese traditional cheese from raw cow's milk.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the hygienic quality of raw milk used in the  manufacture of sao jorge, a protected denomination of origin portuguese semihard  cheese, as well as to ascertain the sanitary conditions prevailing during its processing. viable counts of enterobacteriaceae and micrococcaceae were accordingly obtained, pertaining to 21 independent batches (including samples of  raw milk, curd, and cheeses after 1, 3, and 4 months of ripening), from 7 dairy farms. standard plate counts (log cfu per milliliter or per gram) ranged from 6.1 to 8.6 in raw milk, whereas they ranged from 7.0 to 8.0 in 4-month-old cheeses. viable counts of enterobacteriaceae ranged between 5.9 and 7.0 in raw milk and between 0.0 and 1.3 in 4-month-old cheeses. species identified within this family encompassed klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sakazakii, and escherichia coli; klebsiella ornithinolytica, klebsiella terrigena, and serratia odorifera were detected only in raw milk. no salmonella whatsoever could be detected in any of the samples. viable counts of micrococcaceae ranged between 4.7 and 5.9 and between 1.3 and 3.3 in raw milk and 4-month-old cheeses, respectively. species identified within this family encompassed staphylococcus sciuri, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus (which was found mainly in ripened cheeses), and staphylococcus aureus (which was not detected in 4-month-old cheeses). accompanying physicochemical analyses included determination of moisture, salt, and ph. statistical analyses revealed a negative correlation between salt content and viable numbers of enterobacteriaceae in cheese, whereas in the case of micrococcaceae, a more negative correlation was found between viable numbers and  moisture content than between viable numbers and ph. the results of our study indicate, in general, poor milk handling conditions in all farms, given that the  indicators total mesophile and enterobacteriaceae counts were high, between 100-  and 1,000-fold those enforced by international standards pertaining to the matrices in question. however, by the time of regular consumption (i.e., after 4  months of ripening), sao jorge cheeses exhibit low levels of contamination by enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus, as well as absence of salmonella.

TI  == in vitro investigation of the antibacterial effect of ketamine.
AB  == background: antibacterial activity of local anesthetics especially lidocaine has  been shown previously. in this study, the antibacterial effect of ketamine, a general anesthetic agent was investigated. methods: the antibacterial effect of ketamine was studied using six different strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, entecoccus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes,  pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli) with disc diffusion method. ciprofloxacine discs (cip, oxoid) were used as a control to verify the methodology. minimal inhibition concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) of ketamine for these bacteria were also determined. results: no inhibition was evident in discs containing 62.5 microg of ketamine. ketamine 125 microg showed activity on all the bacteria tested with the exception of e. coli. the inhibition rates of ketamine were more prominent at the doses of 250 microg and 500 microg similar to the inhibition rate of cip. whereas mic and mbc  values of ketamine for s. aureus and s. pyogenes were 500 microg ml(-1), mic and  mbc values for p. aeruginosa were above 2000 microg ml(-1). for other bacteria, these values ranged between these levels. conclusions: ketamine with higher doses showed antibacterial activity. we thought that it will be proper to use ketamine  hesitantly in experimental animal studies like sepsis and translocation.

TI  == a staphylococcal ggdef domain protein regulates biofilm formation independently of cyclic dimeric gmp.
AB  == cyclic dimeric gmp (c-di-gmp) is an important biofilm regulator that allosterically activates enzymes of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. proteobacterial genomes usually encode multiple ggdef domain-containing diguanylate cyclases responsible for c-di-gmp synthesis. in contrast, only one conserved ggdef domain protein, gdps (for ggdef domain protein from staphylococcus), and a second protein with a highly modified ggdef domain, gdpp,  are present in the sequenced staphylococcal genomes. here, we investigated the role of gdps in biofilm formation in staphylococcus epidermidis. inactivation of  gdps impaired biofilm formation in medium supplemented with nacl under static and flow-cell conditions, whereas gdps overexpression complemented the mutation and enhanced wild-type biofilm development. gdps increased production of the icaadbc-encoded exopolysaccharide, poly-n-acetyl-glucosamine, by elevating icaadbc mrna levels. unexpectedly, c-di-gmp synthesis was found to be irrelevant  for the ability of gdps to elevate icaadbc expression. mutagenesis of the ggeef motif essential for diguanylate cyclase activity did not impair gdps, and the n-terminal fragment of gdps lacking the ggdef domain partially complemented the gdps mutation. furthermore, heterologous diguanylate cyclases expressed in trans  failed to complement the gdps mutation, and the purified ggdef domain from gdps possessed no diguanylate cyclase activity in vitro. the gdps gene from staphylococcus aureus exhibited similar characteristics to its s. epidermidis ortholog, suggesting that the gdps-mediated signal transduction is conserved in staphylococci. therefore, gdps affects biofilm formation through a novel c-di-gmp-independent mechanism involving increased icaadbc mrna levels and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. our data raise the possibility that staphylococci cannot synthesize c-di-gmp and have only remnants of a c-di-gmp signaling pathway.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == synergistic effect between different milk-derived peptides and proteins.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides derived from food proteins constitute a new field in the combined use of antimicrobial agents in food. the best examples of milk-derived peptides are those constituted by bovine lactoferricin [lactoferrin f(17-41)] (lfcin-b) and bovine alpha(s2)-casein f(183-207). the aim of this work was to study if the antimicrobial activity of a natural compound employed in food preservation, nisin, could be enhanced by combination with the aforementioned milk-derived peptides. furthermore, the possibility of a synergistic effect between these peptides and bovine lactoferrin (lf) against escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis was also studied. finally, the most active combinations were assayed against the foodborne pathogens listeria monocytogenes  and salmonella choleraesuis. results showed a synergistic effect when lfcin-b was combined with bovine lf against e. coli. in the same way, the combination of lfcin-b with bovine lf was synergistic against staph. epidermidis. bovine lf and  nisin increased their antimicrobial activity when they were assayed together with bovine alpha(s2)-casein f(183-207). it is important to note the synergistic effect among lfcin-b and bovine lf, because both compounds might be simultaneously in the suckling gastrointestinal tract and could, therefore, have  a protective effect on it. the other synergistic effect high-lighted is that between alpha(s2)-casein f(183-207) and nisin against l. monocytogenes because of the ability of l. monocytogenes to develop resistance to nisin.

TI  == yersinia pestis biofilm in the flea vector and its role in the transmission of plague.
AB  == transmission by fleabite is a relatively recent evolutionary adaptation of yersinia pestis, the bacterial agent of bubonic plague. to produce a transmissible infection, y. pestis grows as an attached biofilm in the foregut of the flea vector. biofilm formation both in the flea foregut and in vitro is dependent on an extracellular matrix (ecm) synthesized by the yersinia hms gene products. the hms genes are similar to the pga and ica genes of escherichia coli  and staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively, that act to synthesize a poly-beta-1,6-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine ecm required for biofilm formation. as with  extracellular polysaccharide production in many other bacteria, synthesis of the  hms-dependent ecm is controlled by intracellular levels of cyclic-di-gmp. yersinia pseudotuberculosis, the food- and water-borne enteric pathogen from which y. pestis evolved recently, possesses identical hms genes and can form biofilm in vitro but not in the flea. the genetic changes in y. pestis that resulted in adapting biofilm-forming capability to the flea gut environment, a critical step in the evolution of vector-borne transmission, have yet to be identified. during a flea bite, y. pestis is regurgitated into the dermis in a unique biofilm phenotype, and this has implications for the initial interaction with the mammalian innate immune response.

TI  == substrata mechanical stiffness can regulate adhesion of viable bacteria.
AB  == the competing mechanisms that regulate adhesion of bacteria to surfaces and subsequent biofilm formation remain unclear, though nearly all studies have focused on the role of physical and chemical properties of the material surface.  given the large monetary and health costs of medical-device colonization and hospital-acquired infections due to bacteria, there is considerable interest in better understanding of material properties that can limit bacterial adhesion and viability. here we employ weak polyelectrolyte multilayer (pem) thin films comprised of poly(allylamine) hydrochloride (pah) and poly(acrylic acid) (paa), assembled over a range of conditions, to explore the physicochemical and mechanical characteristics of material surfaces controlling adhesion of staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria and subsequent colony growth. although it is  increasingly appreciated that eukaryotic cells possess subcellular structures and biomolecular pathways to sense and respond to local chemomechanical environments, much less is known about mechanoselective adhesion of prokaryotes such as these bacteria. we find that adhesion of viable s. epidermidis correlates positively with the stiffness of these polymeric substrata, independently of the roughness,  interaction energy, and charge density of these materials. quantitatively similar trends observed for wild-type and actin analogue mutant escherichia coli suggest  that these results are not confined to only specific bacterial strains, shapes, or cell envelope types. these results indicate the plausibility of mechanoselective adhesion mechanisms in prokaryotes and suggest that mechanical stiffness of substrata materials represents an additional parameter that can regulate adhesion of and subsequent colonization by viable bacteria.

TI  == effect of growth conditions on poly-n-acetylglucosamine expression and biofilm formation in escherichia coli.
AB  == escherichia coli contains a four-gene operon, pgaabcd, which encodes the proteins necessary for the synthesis of polymeric n-acetylglucosamine, or pga. poly-n-acetyl-glucosamine was first described in staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and was found to have important roles in biofilm formation and immune evasion. pga also plays a role in biofilm formation in e. coli, but its role in immune evasion has not been thoroughly studied. we previously reported that e. coli pga cross-reacts with an opsonic-antibody raised against s. aureus pnag and this is the basis for an ongoing investigation regarding the development of a vaccine against both pathogens. in this paper we investigated pga expression in wild type and csra or nhar deletion mutant strains during different growth phases and temperatures, and in response to chemical stimuli using a pga promoter-reporter fusion construct, real-time reverse transcriptase-pcr, immunoblotting, and biofilm assays. expression of pga and polysaccharide synthesis were induced by glucose, nacl, and ethanol, but only glucose augmented biofilm formation. the regulatory factor nhar was required for  nacl-induced pga expression, whereas the effects of glucose and ethanol were independent of csra and nhar.

AB  == this study describes the use of cyclodextrins (cds) as a finishing agent of polyamide (pa) fibers used in order to obtain inguinal meshes with improved antibiotic delivery properties. the finishing process involved polymerization between citric acid and cds, which yielded a cross-linked polymer that physically adhered to the surface of pa fibers. this permanent functionalization was characterized by evaluating the damping property with a polar liquid (glycerol) via the drop contact angle method for various rates of modification of the fabrics. the biological and microbiological effects of the pa, which were functionalized with hydroxypropylated derivate of gamma-cd (hp-gamma-cds) and charged with ciprofloxacin (cfx), were evaluated by cell culture assays. we observed a good adhesion and proliferation of fibroblastic cells (nih3t3) after 3 and 6 days and no detectable toxicity of the modified substrate. the in vitro antibacterial activity of the hp-gamma-cd grafted pa fabrics charged with cfx against the bacteria staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli was greatly superior to that of the virgin sample within a 24h batch experiment in human blood plasma medium. in conclusion, these results from  our study offer an insight into the efficient performance of cds as drug delivery systems for multiple applications in the fields of biomaterials and medical textiles.

AB  == the linear homopolymer poly-beta-1,6-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (beta-1,6-glcnac; pga) serves as an adhesin for the maintenance of biofilm structural stability in  diverse eubacteria. its function in escherichia coli k-12 requires the gene products of the pgaabcd operon, all of which are necessary for biofilm formation. pgac is an apparent glycosyltransferase that is required for pga synthesis. using a monoclonal antibody directed against e. coli pga, we now demonstrate that pgad  is also needed for pga formation. the deletion of genes for the predicted outer membrane proteins pgaa and pgab did not prevent pga synthesis but did block its export, as shown by the results of immunoelectron microscopy (iem) and antibody adsorption assays. iem also revealed a conditional localization of pga at the cell poles, the initial attachment site for biofilm formation. pgaa contains a predicted beta-barrel porin and a superhelical domain containing tetratricopeptide repeats, which may mediate protein-protein interactions, implying that it forms the outer membrane secretin for pga. pgab contains predicted carbohydrate binding and polysaccharide n-deacetylase domains. the overexpression of pgab increased the primary amine content (glucosamine) of pga.  site-directed mutations targeting the n-deacetylase catalytic activity of pgab blocked pga export and biofilm formation, implying that n-deacetylation promotes  pga export through the pgaa porin. the results of previous studies indicated that n-deacetylation of beta-1,6-glcnac in staphylococcus epidermidis by the pgab homolog, icab, anchors it to the cell surface. the deletion of icab resulted in release of beta-1,6-glcnac into the growth medium. thus, covalent modification of beta-1,6-glcnac by n-deacetylation serves distinct biological functions in gram-negative and gram-positive species, dictated by cell envelope differences.

TI  == treatment of primary isolated shoulder sepsis in the adult patient.
AB  == isolated shoulder sepsis is an uncommon clinical problem with little information  in the literature on causative organisms and potential sequelae. we examined the  organisms involved, surgical treatments, antibiotic treatments rendered, and complications in these cases. we retrospectively reviewed the records of 19 adult patients (19 shoulders) who underwent operative treatment of isolated shoulder sepsis from 1996 to 2005. patient age, gender, laboratory studies, previous treatment, surgical procedures, surgical findings, cultured organism, antibiotic  treatment, and complications were reviewed. the organisms included methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (five), streptococcus b beta hemolytic (five), staphylococcus epidermidis (three), negative cultures (two), streptococcus viridans (one), escherichia coli (one), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (one), and propionibacterium acnes (one). we treated patients with intravenous antibiotics an average of 4.2 weeks (range, 3-8 weeks). one patient underwent humeral head resection with an antibiotic spacer. another patient died  during hospitalization. open or arthroscopic debridement in conjunction with appropriate antibiotics appears effective in eradicating infection in most adults who present with shoulder sepsis. functional outcome is poor in those patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears and/or cartilage loss. level of evidence: level iv, therapeutic study. see the guidelines for authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  == enhanced bactericidal activity against escherichia coli in calves fed morinda citrifolia (noni) puree.
AB  == background: although adequate colostrum intake and properly used antibiotics can  provide much protection for the bovine neonate, increased antibiotic scrutiny and consumer demand for organic products have prompted investigations of natural immunomodulators for enhancing calf health. one plant-based immunomodulator, morinda citrifolia (noni) fruit, is a well-recognized natural product that has a  broad range of immunomodulatory effects. hypothesis: neonatal calves fed noni puree would demonstrate whole blood phagocytic capacity in gram-negative and gram-positive in vitro assays. animals: blood samples from 18 neonatal holstein bull calves. methods: calves were divided into 2 groups: group 1 comprised control calves, whereas group 2 received 30 ml of noni puree twice a day in milk  replacer. day 0 blood samples were obtained between 36 and 48 hours of age before the first feeding of puree. ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid anticoagulated blood  was collected from each calf on days 0, 3, 7, and 14. bactericidal assays were performed to estimate the percentage killing of escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. results: blood samples from noni puree-fed calves displayed significantly more e. coli bacterial killing than did controls on day 14, and although differences were not significant on days 0, 3, and 7, bacterial  killing progressively increased over time. there was no significant difference between the groups for s. epidermidis killing. conclusions and clinical importance: the immunomodulatory effect of noni puree may prove valuable in the future as production animal antibiotic use becomes more restricted. additional clinical trials are warranted to investigate the clinical application of noni puree in promoting calf health.

TI  == application of pcr-sscp for molecular epidemiological studies on the exposure of  farm children to bacteria in environmental dust.
AB  == the environmental exposure of farm children to microorganisms in dust has become  a focus of interest, since microbial exposure on farms has been related to a reduced prevalence of asthma and atopic diseases in children. previous studies almost exclusively focused on the determination of microbial counts using conventional culturing or the determination of microbial compounds i.e. endotoxins. in this study pcr-sscp (single-strand conformation polymorphism) was  modified for characterising bacterial communities in environmental dusts and their sensitivity and reproducibility was validated. a fivefold repeated pcr-sscp analyses of a well homogenised mattress dust, cow-shed dust, swine-shed dust, chicken-shed dust and a horse-shed dust sample, respectively, showed similarities, based on pearson correlations, ranging from 89.7% to 95.2%. the reproducibility of day to day variations (five days) and gel to gel variations (five gels) was also around 90%. the detection limit of escherichia coli was 7 x  10(1) cfu g(-1) whereas listeria monocytogenes and bacillus licheniformis containing 30% spores showed visible bands at 7 x1 0(2) cfu g(-1). application of this method to dust samples of 37 sheds and 63 children's mattresses showed that  distinct farm environment dusts reflected different sscp profiles. however, digital analysis of the gels showed that some bands in the profiles of shed- and  mattress dusts were found at the same position in the gels. by excision, cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses, these bands were identified as corynebacterium tuberculostearicum, corynebacterium mucifaciens, staphylococcus epidermidis, acinetobacter lwoffii, brevibacterium iodinum, brevibacterium linens and arthrobacter spp, respectively. these results may reflect transfer of microorganisms from animal sheds to mattresses. in conclusion this study demonstrates that pcr-sscp is a promising method with sensitive detection limits  and moderate sample variances to be applied for epidemiological studies characterizing the exposure of farmers using environmental dust.

TI  == simulated joint infection assessment by rapid detection of live bacteria with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: although microbiological bacterial culture is currently considered the gold standard for diagnosis of septic arthritis, many studies have documented substantial false-negative and false-positive rates. the objective of this study  was to determine whether real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase  chain reaction can be used to detect bacterial messenger rna (mrna) in synovial fluid as a way to distinguish live and dead bacteria as an indicator of active infection. methods: synovial fluid samples were obtained from twelve consecutive  patients who presented with knee pain and effusion but no evidence of infection.  following assurance of sterility with plate cultures, each sample was inoculated  with clinically relevant bacteria and incubated for twenty-four hours to simulate septic arthritis. bacterial viability and load were assessed with cultures. selected samples were also treated with a single dose of a combination of two antibiotics, vancomycin and gentamicin, and sampled at several time points. total rna isolated from each sample was analyzed in triplicate with one-step real-time  quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to detect mrna encoding for the genes groel or femc. controls included sterile, uninoculated samples and inoculated samples analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction without reverse transcription. mrna content was estimated on the basis of detection limits as a function of serial dilutions and was expressed as a function of colony number in bacterial cultures and rna content as determined spectrophotometrically. results: all synovial fluid samples that had been inoculated with one of the four bacterial species, and analyzed in triplicate, were identified (distinguished from aseptic synovial fluid) with real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; there were no false-negative results. all inoculated samples produced bacterial colonies on culture plates, while cultures of the aseptic samples were negative for growth. the detection limit of the one-step bacterial mrna-based real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction varied depending on the bacterial species. a time-dependent decrease in the concentration of detectable bacterial mrna was seen after incubation of bacteria with antibiotics. conclusions: the direct quantification of the concentration of viable bacterial mrna with real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction allows identification of both culture-positive bacterial infection and so-called unculturable bacterial infection in a simulated septic arthritis model. in contrast to conventional polymerase chain reaction, real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction minimizes false-positive detection of nonviable bacteria and thus provides relevant information on the success or failure of antibiotic therapy.

TI  == the shf gene of a shigella flexneri homologue on the virulent plasmid paa2 of enteroaggregative escherichia coli 042 is required for firm biofilm formation.
AB  == enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaec) is an increasingly important cause of diarrhea in both developing and industrialized countries, and is characterized by strong biofilm formation on the intestinal mucosa. sequencing of the virulent plasmid paa2 of the prototype eaec 042 revealed a cluster of three open reading frames (orfs; shf, capu, and virk) ca. 93% identical to a similar cluster located in shigella flexneri. the function of the first orf shf protein is not known, but the closest well-characterized homologue is the icab protein of staphylococcus epidermidis, which plays a crucial role in exopolysaccharide modification in bacterial biofilm formation. to investigate the role of this cluster in the virulence of eaec, we mutated three genes at this locus. all the mutants maintained the aggregative phenotype in the liquid phase. however, the insertional mutant of shf formed a less abundant biofilm in a microtiter plate assay than did the wild type, while the capu mutant and the virk mutant did not.  the complementation of the shf mutant with this cluster restored the thick biofilm similar to that of the wild type. the shf transcriptional level decreased in the transcriptional regulator aggr mutant and was restored when the mutant was complemented with aggr. these results suggest that the shf gene is required for the firm biofilm formation of eaec 042, and transcription of the shf gene is dependent on aggr.

TI  == diabetic foot osteomyelitis.
AB  == bone infection in the diabetic foot is always a complication of a preexisting infected foot wound. prevalence can be as high as 66%. diagnosis can be suspected in two mains conditions: no healing (or no depth decrease) in spite of appropriate care and off-loading, and/or a visible or palpated bone with a metal  probe. the first recommended diagnostic step is to perform (and if necessary to repeat) plain radiographs. after a four-week treatment period, if plain radiographs are still normal, suspicion for bone infection will persist in case of bad evolution despite optimized management of off-loading and arterial disease. it is only in such cases that other diagnosis methods than plain radiographs must be used. staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen cultured from bone samples, followed by staphylococcus epidermidis. among enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia and proteus sp. are the most common, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa. surprisingly, bacteria usually considered contaminant (as coagulase negative staphylococci (cns) and corynebacterium sp.) have been documented to be pathogens in the osteomyelitis of diabetic foot. traditional approach to treatment of chronic osteomyelitis was by  surgical resection of infected and necrotic bone. but new classes of antibiotics  have both the required spectrum of activity and the capacity to penetrate and concentrate in the infected bone. recently, several observations of osteomyelitis remission following non-surgical management with a prolonged course of antibiotics have been published. lastly, combined approach with local bone excision and antibiotics has been proposed. prospective trials should be undertaken to determine the relative roles of surgery and antibiotics in managing diabetic foot osteomyelitis.

AB  == the second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. a simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast candida albicans, gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, neisseria sicca, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, gram-positive bacteria deinococcus radiodurans, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. a similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. the area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the wartburg law depending on exposure time. qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration  of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.

TI  == characterization of the glutamyl endopeptidase from staphylococcus aureus expressed in escherichia coli.
AB  == v8 protease, a member of the glutamyl endopeptidase i family, of staphylococcus aureus v8 strain (gluv8) is widely used for proteome analysis because of its unique substrate specificity and resistance to detergents. in this study, an escherichia coli expression system for gluv8, as well as its homologue from staphylococcus epidermidis (gluse), was developed, and the roles of the prosegments and two specific amino acid residues, val69 and ser237, were investigated. c-terminal his(6)-tagged progluse was successfully expressed from the full-length sequence as a soluble form. by contrast, gluv8 was poorly expressed by the system as a result of autodegradation; however, it was efficiently obtained by swapping its preprosegment with that of gluse, or by the  substitution of four residues in the gluv8 prosequence with those of gluse. the purified progluv8 was converted to the mature form in vitro by thermolysin treatment. the prosegment was essential for the suppression of proteolytic activity, as well as for the correct folding of gluv8, indicating its role as an  intramolecular chaperone. furthermore, the four amino acid residues at the c-terminus of the prosegment were sufficient for both of these roles. in vitro mutagenesis revealed that ser237 was essential for proteolytic activity, and that val69 was indispensable for the precise cleavage by thermolysin and was involved  in the proteolytic reaction itself. this is the first study to express quantitatively gluv8 in e. coli, and to demonstrate explicitly the intramolecular chaperone activity of the prosegment of glutamyl endopeptidase i.

TI  == reliability of serum procalcitonin concentrations for the diagnosis of sepsis in  neonates.
AB  == the evaluation of tests for neonatal sepsis is important because the infection may present a very serious threat to the baby. extensive literature exists on single laboratory test or combinations of tests, as well as tests used together with risk factors and/or clinical signs, to diagnose neonatal sepsis. in many instances, the results of the evaluations have been conflicting. it has recently  been suggested that serum procalcitonin (pct) is of value: in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, with varying results. this study was designed to determine the reliability of pct concentrations as a new marker for the diagnosis of early neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission comparing to the traditional inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 (il-6) and c-reactive protein (crp) values. the current study included 69 newborn babies. after full history and clinical examination, they were classified into 2 groups: group 1, included 27 of asymptomatic newborn infants admitted during the first 24 h of life to the neonatal unit because of prematurity, low birth weight. they had no clinical signs of sepsis during their first week of life and had a negative blood culture, and they did not receive antibiotic treatment. the second group: group 2, included 42 symptomatic neonates who were admitted to the neonatal care unit and  were evaluated for sepsis during the first 48 h of life, they were subclassified  into twosubgroups: group 2a; included 22 neonates of confirmed vertical neonatal  sepsis, defined as they had at least three clinical signs of infection with culture proven sepsis, and group 2b included 20 neonates of vertical clinical sepsis (they had at least three clinical signs of infection) with negative blood  culture. blood sampling for blood culture, complete blood count, blood gases and  blood chemistry, additionally, crp, serum il-6 and pct were measured. the microbial organisms isolated from the blood culture of group 2a; escherichia coli was isolated from 9 cases, staphylococcus aureus from 6 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis from 2 cases, group b streptococci (gbs) from 2 cases, ureaplasma from 2 cases and one case was gbs positive mother. the comparison between the studied groups revealed that, white blood cell counts (wbcs) and crp levels were  significantly increased in group 2a more than in group 1 and group 2b. while in group 2b the wbcs not differed from group 1 but crp differed from group 1. il-6 and pct values were significantly increased in group 2a more than in group 1 and  group 2b. furthermore in group 2b both were significantly increased as compared to group 1. for the diagnosis of neonatal infection, at cutoff >1.5 ng/ml, pct give a sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 85.2%, positive predictive value (ppv) of 84.8%, and negative predictive value (npv) of 76.7%. at a cutoff >140 ng/ml, il-6 gives a sensitivity of 76.2%, specificity of 70.4%, ppv of 64%, npv of 63.3%. however, at a cutoff >12 mg/l, crp gives a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 77.8%, ppv of 77.1%, npv of 70%. we conclude that the serum pct concentration showed a good diagnostic value for the early detection of neonatal  sepsis of vertical transmission comparing with the other traditional markers of inflammations, thus may facilitate early therapeutic intervention in those high risk group.

TI  == effect of ethanol/trisodium citrate lock on microorganisms causing hemodialysis catheter-related infections.
AB  == purpose: this in vitro study tested the effectiveness of a novel 30% ethanol/4% trisodium citrate (tsc) lock solution against the most common pathogens causing hemodialysis catheter-related infections. methods: clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n = 4), methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) (n = 8), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and escherichia coli (n = 4) were tested  in duplicate. bacterial suspensions of each isolate were made in a control solution of normal saline and mueller-hinton broth (mhb), and in a lock solution  of ethanol 30%, tsc 4% and mhb. suspensions were incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 h. colony counts were determined from samples collected at t = 0 h (before exposure to the ethanol/tsc lock), t = 1 h (one hour after exposure to the ethanol/tsc lock), t = 24 h and t = 48 h. to confirm the absence of viable organisms in the lock solution, the remaining volume at 48 h was filtered through a 0.45 microm filter. the filter was rinsed with 15 ml sterile water and plated on tryptic soy agar (tsa). results: all controls demonstrated significant growth  over 48 h. in the lock solutions, initial inocula were reduced to 0 viable colonies by t = 1 h (6-log kill), and there was no growth at t = 24 and 48 h. filtering of lock solutions also showed no growth. these results were consistent  among duplicates of all isolates. conclusions: the 30% ethanol/4% tsc lock solution consistently eradicated mrsa, mssa, mrse, p. aeruginosa and e. coli within 1 h of exposure. experiments are currently underway to test this novel lock solution on preventing biofilm production by these pathogens.

TI  == cytokine expression in response to bacterial antigens in preterm and term infant  cord blood monocytes.
AB  == background: neonatal susceptibility to bacterial infection is associated with an  immature immune system, but the role of different bacterial antigens in specific  responses is largely unknown. objective: to evaluate differences in intracellular cytokine response to physiologically relevant bacterial antigens in term and preterm infants as compared with adults. methods: cord blood samples from preterm and term neonates and adult peripheral blood samples were cultured ex vivo with and without whole heat-killed bacteria. intracellular leukocyte production of interleukin (il)-6, il-10, il-12, and il-8 responses was assessed by flow cytometry. results: monocytes were the primary producers of all mediators. escherichia coli was the most potent stimulant. lactobacillus plantarum 299v activated fewer monocytes as compared with e. coli for all responses (p < 0.05),  except for il-12 in term neonates. il-6 response to staphylococcus epidermidis was lower in both groups of neonates as compared with adults (p = 0.023 and p = 0.001). il-8 response to s. epidermidis was lower in term as compared with preterm neonates and adults (p = 0.003). il-10 response to group b streptococci was lower in term neonates as compared with adults and higher in preterm as compared with term neonates (p = 0.015). conclusions: monocytes from term neonates compared to preterm neonates show a downregulated anti-inflammatory response to specific bacteria. high neonatal response to pathogenic e. coli in the preterm infant could cause uncontrolled inflammatory response, while lower il-6 response to s. epidermidis in neonates may indicate a basis for vulnerability to s. epidermidis infection.

TI  == potential and limitation of uvc irradiation for the inactivation of pathogens in  platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: pathogen contamination, causing transfusion-transmitted diseases, is  an ongoing concern in transfusion of cellular blood products. in this explorative study, the pathogen-inactivating capacity of uvc irradiation in platelet (plt) concentrates was investigated. the dose dependencies of inactivation of several viruses and bacteria were compared with the effect on plt quality. study design and methods: the potential of uvc irradiation was studied with a range of lipid-enveloped (le) and non-lipid-enveloped viruses (nle) and bacteria. le viruses were bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv), human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), pseudorabies virus (prv), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev), and  vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv). nle viruses were canine parvovirus (cpv) and simian virus 40 (sv40). bacteria were staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus  aureus, escherichia coli, and bacillus cereus. after spiking and irradiation, samples were tested for residual infectivity and reduction factors (rfs) were calculated. furthermore, the effect of uvc irradiation on plt quality was determined by measuring in vitro quality variables. results: a uvc dose of 500 j  per m(2) resulted in acceptable plt quality (as measured by ph, lactate production, cd62p expression, and exposure of phosphatidylserine) and high rfs (>4 log) for cpv, tgev, vsv, s. epidermidis, s. aureus, and e. coli. intermediate rfs (approx. 3 log) were observed for bvdv, prv, and b. cereus. low rfs (approx.  1 log) were found for hiv and sv40. no differences in virus reduction were observed between cell-free and cell-associated virus. conclusion: uvc irradiation is a promising pathogen-reducing technique in plt concentrates, inactivating bacteria, and a broad range of viruses (with the exception of hiv) under conditions that have limited effects on plt quality. further optimization of the  uvc procedure, however, is necessary to deal with blood-borne viruses like hiv.

TI  == interaction of a magainin-pgla hybrid peptide with membranes: insight into the mechanism of synergism.
AB  == the antimicrobial peptides magainin 2 and pgla isolated from the skin of the african clawed frog xenopus laevis show marked functional synergism. we have proposed that the two peptides form a heterodimer composed of parallel helices with strong membrane permeabilizing activity [hara, t., mitani, y., tanaka, k., uematsu, n., takakura, a., tachi, t., kodama, h., kondo, m., mori, h., otaka, a., fujii, n., and matsuzaki, k. (2001) biochemistry 40, 12395-12399]. in this study, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the synergy, we synthesized a chemically  fixed heterodimer and investigated in detail the interaction of the hybrid peptide with bacteria, erythrocytes, and lipid bilayers. the hybrid peptide showed antimicrobial activity and membrane permeabilizing activity against negatively charged membranes, similar to or even stronger than those of a physical equimolar mixture of magainin and pgla, indicating that the synergy is due to the formation of a parallel heterodimer. the heterodimer assumed a more oblique orientation than the component peptides. in contrast, the cross-linking of the two peptides significantly strengthened the action against erythrocytes and zwitterionic lipid bilayers by enhancing the affinity for membranes without changing the basic mode of action. thus, the separate production of mutually recognizing peptides without cross-linking appears to be a good way to increase selective toxicity.

TI  == inherent antibacterial activity of a peptide-based beta-hairpin hydrogel.
AB  == among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main  concern is the introduction of infection. we have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, max1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. in experiments where max1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (cfus)/dm2 to 2 x 10(9) cfus/dm2, gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. results show that the hydrogel surface is  active against gram-positive (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. live-dead assays  employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. in addition, the surface of max1 hydrogels was shown to  cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient e. coli ml-35. these data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human  erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. these material attributes make max1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.

AB  == aim: to study the effect of antiseptics on bacterial biofilm formation. methods and results: biofilm formation and planktonic growth were tested in microtiter plates in the presence of antiseptics. for escherichia coli g1473 in the presence of chlorhexidine or benzalkonium chloride, for klebsiella pneumoniae cf504 in the presence of chlorhexidine and for pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 in the presence of  benzalkonium chloride, biofilm development and planktonic growth were affected at the same concentrations of antiseptics. for pao1 in the presence of chlorhexidine and cf504 in the presence of benzalkonium chloride, planktonic growth was significantly inhibited by a fourfold lower antiseptic concentration than biofilm development. for staphylococcus epidermidis cip53124 in the presence of antiseptics at the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic), a total inhibition of  biofilm formation was observed. for staph. epidermidis exposed to chlorhexidine at 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 mic, or to benzalkonium chloride at 1/8, 1/16 or 1/32 mic, biofilm formation was increased from 11.4% to 22.5% without any significant effect onto planktonic growth. conclusions: chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride inhibited biofilm formation of different bacterial species but were able to induce biofilm development for the staph. epidermidis cip53124 strain at sub-mics. significance and impact of the study: sublethal exposure to cationic antiseptics may contribute to the persistence of staphylococci through biofilm induction.

TI  == sperm motility changes after coincubation with various uropathogenic microorganisms: an in vitro experimental study.
AB  == objective: we investigated the relationship between semen motility and various uropathogenic microorganisms. materials and methods: semen specimens from healthy donors were divided into portions and incubated with uropathogenic microorganisms in concentrations varying from 2 x 10 to 2 x 10(7) microorganisms/ml(-1). uninfected suspensions of spermatozoa served as controls. in all samples, sperm motility was examined at the second, fourth, and sixth hours after incubation in  order to assess motility as a function of time. enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli were used as bacterial agents. besides these bacterial strains, candida albicans was also used. results and conclusions: observed negative impact on sperm motility was not correlated with microorganism  concentration. however, until a certain concentration threshold, this impact was  prominent. regardless of the microorganism, this deleterious effect could not be  confirmed in specimens coincubated with lower microorganism concentration. no or  poor correlation was found between motility and bacteria concentration except with e. aerogenes at the second hour. the data indicates that sperm function impairment is not related to direct sperm and bacteria interaction. instead, bacterial concentration enough to change the environment or to consume high energy might result in motility loss.

TI  == expression and functional characterization of gfpmut3.1 and its unstable variants in staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == reporter gene systems are an invaluable tool for investigation of gene transcription activity in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. in order to analyze the temporal and spatial resolution of gene expression patterns in situ and for quantitatively investigating gene expression, the green fluorescent protein (gfp) appears to be especially useful. gfp has been broadly used in various bacterial species, however, there is only limited knowledge about key biological properties in s. epidermidis. here, the crucial influence of different ribosomal binding sites (rbs) on gfpmut3.1 translation initiation in s. epidermidis 1457 is demonstrated. only by using the rbs of the delta-hemolysin promoter, after 24 hours a strong fluorescence signal was obtained. the half-life of gfpmut3.1 in s. epidermidis 1457 was significantly shorter than in e. coli (7 h vs. 24 h). gfpmut3.1 derivatives with shorter half-lives (gfp(aav) and gfp(asv)) did not reach sufficient quantitative protein levels, and the resulting low fluorescence  limits their use as reporter genes in s. epidermidis. this work provides fundamental insights into gfpmut3.1 expression in s. epidermidis and describes the crucial determinants of its biological behavior in this species. in general,  this study underlines the need to accurately characterize key biological properties of this transcription marker in gram-positive hosts.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of some salvia species essential oils from iran.
AB  == the aerial parts of salvia multicaulis, s. sclarea and s. verticillata were collected at full flowering stage. the essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary gc and gc-ms. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oils were studied against eight gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (bacillus subtilis, bacillus pumulis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae and aspergillus niger). the results of antibacterial activity tests of the essential oils according to the disc diffusion method and mic values indicated that all the samples have moderate to high inhibitory activity against the tested bacteria except for p. aeruginosa  which was totally resistant. in contrast to antibacterial activity, the oils exhibited no or slight antifungal property, in which only the oil of s. multicaulis showed weak activity against two tested yeasts, c. albicans and s. cerevisiae.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(ii) chelate.
AB  == some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. copper(ii) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-n-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. i report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(ii) chelate. they were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus lactis), yeasts (candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (aspergillus niger). two clinical isolates of bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. the ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except  for s. lactis, and its activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. it was highly active against a. niger and moderately active against c. albicans. the chelate was highly active against s. epidermidis and s. cerevisiae. both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and related compounds.
AB  == a systematic survey of the antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and some related aromatic aldehydes is reported. a total of 23 different compounds, each at four different concentrations, were studied using a  panel of seven microbes (aspergillus niger, bacillus cereus, candida albicans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, saccharomyces cerevisiae and staphylococcus epidermidis) and employing the paper disc agar diffusion method. several aldehydes, most notably halogenated, nitro-substituted and hydroxylated salicylaldehydes, displayed highly potent activity against the microbes studied,  giving inhibitory zones up to 49 mm in diameter (paper disc diameter 6 mm), while unsubstituted benzaldehyde and salicylaldehyde had minimal activity. further, 4,6-dimethoxysalicylaldehyde had considerable activity against c albicans and slight activity against s. cerevisiae, while displaying minimal activity against  bacteria. also two aromatic dialdehydes had interesting activity. in general, p.  aeruginosa was the least sensitive microbe, a result that is in line with observations from a large screening project, in which this microbe was the one against which the least number of active substances was found. interestingly, the structure-activity relationships of the aldehydes studied were clearly different  for different microbes. many of the aldehydes tested had such high antimicrobial  activity that they are noteworthy candidates for practical applications as well as interesting lead compounds for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs and disinfectants. the structure-activity relationships are discussed in detail.  for high activity, substituents are required in benzaldehyde as well as in its 2-hydroxy derivative salicylaldehyde. one hydroxy group alone (at the 2-position) is not enough, but further hydroxylation may produce high activity. the effects of substituents are in some cases dramatic. halogenation, hydroxylation and nitro substitution may produce highly active compounds, but the effects are not easily  predicted nor can they be extrapolated from one microbe to another.

TI  == carbohydrazones of substituted salicylaldehydes as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum antimicrobials.
AB  == certain substituted salicylaldehydes are known to have highly potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, but the mechanism underlying this remarkable activity is not known, and almost nothing has been reported on the effects of further modification of the structures, such as the formation of hydrazone-type derivatives. we report now a study on the antimicrobial properties of the carbohydrazone derivatives of several substituted salicylaldehydes. the compounds studied were synthesized from ring-substituted salicylaldehydes and carbohydrazide in the mole ratio 2:1. they were tested against aspergillus niger, bacillus cereus, candida albicans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, saccharomyces cerevisiae and staphylococcus epidermidis using the agar diffusion  method. the carbohydrazone derived from 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde had distinctly higher activity than the parent aldehyde in the same molar concentration. this activity was limited to one test organism (s. epidermidis), while the free aldehyde had at least some (in some cases even high) activity against all of the microbes studied. all other ones of the effective carbohydrazone compounds were distinctly less active than the parent salicylaldehydes as such. the hydrazones studied had in general a narrower antimicrobial spectrum than the free aldehydes and are thus of interest as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum anti-microbial drugs. the mechanism of action of the aldehydes as well as that of the carbohydrazones is discussed.

TI  == molecular cloning and functional characterization of a histidine decarboxylase from staphylococcus capitis.
AB  == aims: histamine intoxication is probably the best known toxicological problem of  food-borne disease. a histamine-producing staphylococcus capitis strain has been  isolated from a cured meat product. the aim of this study was to gain deeper insights into the genetic determinants for histamine production in staph. capitis. methods and results: the nucleotide sequence of a 6446-bp chromosomal dna fragment containing the hdca gene encoding histidine decarboxylase (hdc) has  been determined in staph. capitis ifij12. this dna fragment contains five complete and two partial open reading frames. putative functions have been assigned to gene products by sequence comparison with proteins included in the databases. the hdca gene has been expressed in escherichia coli resulting in hdc  activity. the presence of a functional promoter (phdc) located upstream of hdca has been demonstrated. insertion of the histamine biosynthetic locus in staph. capitis seems to be associated with a noticeable genome reorganization. conclusions: among the staphylococcal species analysed in this study only staph.  capitis strains produce histamine. the hdca gene cloned from staph. capitis encodes a functional hdc that produce histamine from the amino acid histidine. significance and impact of the study: the identification of the dna region involved in histamine production in staph. capitis will allow further work in order to avoid histamine production in foods.

TI  == levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced from cord blood in-vitro are pathogen dependent and increased in comparison to adult controls.
AB  == background: overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines may play a role in increased morbidity and mortality from neonatal sepsis. objective of this study was to compare secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the cord blood cells of healthy term neonates to the venous blood cells of healthy adults in vitro after  stimulation with common neonatal pathogens. method: blood samples were cultured in the presence of heat-killed group b beta-hemolytic streptococci (gbs), escherichia coli (e. coli) and staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epi). concentrations of secreted cytokines (interleukine-6, il-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, tnf-alpha, interleukine-1 beta, il-1beta and interleukine-8, il-8)  were measured after 0, 1, 2 and 4 h of incubation using chemiluminescent immunometric automated assay. results: blood samples from 22 neonates and 16 adults were compared. after stimulation by gbs and e. coli, cord blood cells secreted significantly higher levels of il-6 and il-8 than blood cells of healthy adults. in cord blood, e. coli induced secretion of higher concentration of il-6, tnf-alpha, il-1beta and il-8 than s. epi, and more il-6 than gbs; gbs induced more il-1beta than s.epi. conclusions: response of cord blood to microbial activators is different from that of adult controls. each isolate of heat-killed  bacteria induced different amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. this may represent a useful in vitro virulence test.

TI  == [a broad-range 16s rrna gene real-time pcr assay for the diagnosis of neonatal septicemia].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the usefulness of a broad-range real-time pcr assay aimed  at the 16s rrna gene of bacteria in a clinical setting in rapid and reliable diagnosis of neonatal septicemia for improving the speed and accuracy of bacterial detection. methods: the universal primer and taqman probe were designed based on the highly conserved sequences of the bacterial 16s rrna gene. the chosen primers and probe did not show any likely cross hybridization with human,  viral or fungal genome sequences. the taqman assay used the fluorescent signal on the probe, such as 6-carboxyfluorescin (6-fam), and quenched by the standard 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (tamra) probes. the broad-range 16s rrna gene real-time pcr array was established. then, three common pathogenic microorganisms including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli, which were prepared by a 10-fold dilution series respectively from 10(8) colony forming unit (cfu)/ml to 10(3) cfu/ml, as well as controls, were used for testing of both sensitivity and specificity of the real-time pcr assay. the blood samples from 830 cases of suspected septicemia, who were hospitalized in our neonatal ward and the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) and developed clinical signs suggestive of infection, were tested with routine culture and bacterial 16s rrna  genes real-time pcr separately. in addition, 30 neonates without infection were enrolled as the negative control group. results: all the three common pathogenic  bacterial species were positive on the 16s rrna genes real-time pcr assay. there  were no cross-reaction with cytomegalovirus (cmv), epstein-barr virus (ebv), hepatitis b virus (hbv), fungi, human dna and blank control, and the technique showed high specificity and sensitivity. the detection limit of the taqman assay  was tested by amplifying serial dilutions of the three common pathogenic bacterial dna. the minimal detection limit of the taqman system was equivalent to 3 cfu of bacteria, the threshold cycle (ct), which is inversely proportional to the log of the amount of target dna initially present, was 37.90 by calculation.  the real-time pcr assay was evaluated on 830 blood specimens for suspected neonatal septicemia, as compared to the results obtained from the routine bacterial cultures. the positive rate by the real-time pcr assay was 5.18% (43/830) in 830 samples, and was significantly higher than that of blood culture  [2.41% (20/830) (p < 0.01)]. the real-time pcr was positive in all the 20 positive blood culture samples. thirty non-infectious blood samples were negative by both the pcr assay and blood cultures. when blood culture was used as control, the sensitivity of the real-time pcr assay was 100%, the specificity was 97.16%,  and the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.972. moreover, three of the pcr positive amplicons were confirmed by sequencing to confirm the accuracy of the real-time pcr assay in testing clinical specimens. the sequencing showed that except for one sequence, all the others were demonstrated to be staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli respectively, which was in accord with the results of the blood cultures. conclusions: the bacterial 16s rrna genes real-time pcr had been established to diagnose the neonatal septicemia. the sensitivity and specificity the real-time pcr assay were higher than those of blood culture. this technique can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia, and was a convenient and accurate method in etiologic diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial inactivation in prestorage pooled, leukoreduced, whole blood-derived platelet concentrates suspended in plasma prepared with photochemical treatment.
AB  == background: photochemical treatment (pct) with amotosalen and ultraviolet light was developed to inactivate pathogens in platelet (plt) components suspended in 35 percent plasma and 65 percent additive solution (as). because plt additive solutions (ass) are not used in the united states, this study evaluated the ability of the pct process to inactivate low levels of bacteria in pooled whole blood-derived plts (rdp) suspended in 100 percent plasma. study design and methods: four replicate experiments were performed with two gram-positive organisms, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, and two gram-negative organisms, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. for each experiment, 6 abo-identical rdp units were pooled, leukoreduced before or after pooling, inoculated to approximately 1 to 10 colony-forming units per ml with plasma-resistant bacteria, and treated with the pct process. residual viable bacterial levels were measured before and after each step and 4 and 6 days after  inoculation. for each bacterium studied, a fifth rdp pool was prepared and contaminated, but not treated. these units served as controls for bacterial growth. results: growth of s. epidermidis, s. aureus, and k. pneumoniae was eliminated in all four treated pools while growth continued in the control pools. there was no growth of e. coli in the treated pools and the control pool. conclusion: these pilot experiments demonstrate inactivation of bacteria in plts  suspended in plasma, suggesting that the pct process may address contamination in conventional rdps. additional experiments with a wider range of bacteria and evaluation of plt function in 100 percent plasma will be needed before implementation.

TI  == antibacterial activation of hydroxyapatite (ha) with controlled porosity by different antibiotics.
AB  == in order to prevent the increasing frequency of per-operative infections, bioceramics can be loaded with anti-bacterial agents, which will release with respect to their chemical characteristics. a novel hydroxyapatite (ha) was elaborated with specific internal porosities for using as a bone-bioactive antibiotic (atb) carrier material. uv spectrophotometry and bacteria inhibition tests were performed for testing the atb adsorption and the microbiological effectiveness after loading with different antibiotics. the impregnation time, atb impregnating concentration, impregnation condition and other factors, which might influence the atb loading effect, were studied by exposure to different releasing solvents and different pathogenic bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli. it clearly showed that the facility of atb loading on this porous ha is even possible just under simple non-vacuum impregnation conditions in a not-so-long impregnating interval. the results also showed that, for all three types of atb (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin), adsorbed amount on the micro-porous ha were hugely higher than that on dense ha. the micro-porosity of test ha had also significantly prolonged  the release time of antibiotics even under mimic physiological conditions. furthermore, it also has primarily proved by a pilot test that the antibacterial  efficiency of crude micro-porous ha could be further significantly improved by other methods of functionalization such as cold plasma technique.

TI  == microcalorimetry: a novel method for detection of microbial contamination in platelet products.
AB  == background: measuring heat from replicating microorganisms in culture may be a rapid, accurate, and simple screening method for platelets (plts). microcalorimetry for detection of microorganisms in in vitro contaminated plt products was evaluated. study design and methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguinis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and candida albicans were inoculated in single-donor apheresis plts to achieve target concentrations of 10(5), 10(3), 10, or 1 colony-forming units (cfu) per ml of plts. contaminated plts in growth medium were incubated at 37 degrees c for 5 days in a calorimeter. positivity was defined as heat flow of at least 10 microw above the lowest value of the power-time curve. results: with microcalorimetry, inocula of 10 cfus per ml plts  could be detected with the following detection times: s. epidermidis (31.65 hr),  s. aureus (24.24 hr), s. sanguinis (7.82 hr), e. coli (7.53 hr), p. acnes (73.57  hr), and c. albicans (43.77 hr). the detection time was less than 4 hr at 10(5) cfus per ml plts for s. aureus, s. sanguinis, and e. coli. noncontaminated plts remained negative. the total heat ranged from 2.8 (s. sanguinis) to 8.3 j (e. coli). the shape of the power-time curve was species-specific and independent from the initial concentration of microorganisms. conclusion: the detection limit of microcalorimetry was 1 to 10 cfus per ml plts. microcalorimetry is a promising novel method for detection of contaminated plts. applying this method to all plt  products could reduce the frequency of transfusion-related sepsis and prolong the shelf life of plts.

TI  == raman spectroscopic discrimination of cell response to chemical and physical inactivation.
AB  == raman spectroscopy was applied to study escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis cells that were inactivated by different chemicals and stress conditions including starvation and high temperature. e. coli cells exposed to starvation conditions over several days lost viability at the same rate that spectral bands assigned to dna and rna bases decreased in intensity. band intensities correlate with standard plate counts with r(2) = 0.99 and r(2) = 0.97, respectively. principal components analysis and discriminant analysis multivariate statistical techniques were used to evaluate the spectral data collected. significant changes were observed in the spectra of treated cells in comparison with their respective controls (samples without treatment). as a result, there was a significant differentiation between viable and non-viable cells (treated and non-treated cells) in the first and second principal component plots for all the treatments. discriminant analysis was used along with pca to estimate a classification rate based on viability status of the cells. non-viable cells were differentiated from viable cells with classification rates that ranged between 60 and 90% for specific treatments (i.e., edta-treated cells versus control cells). the classification rate obtained considering all the treatments (non-viable cells) and controls (viable cells) at the same time for each of the species studied was 86%. the classification rate based on species differentiation when all the spectra (viable and non-viable) were used was 87%. these results suggest that raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool that can be used to evaluate viability and to study metabolic changes in microorganisms. it is a robust method for bacterial identification even when high spectral variations are introduced.

TI  == mechanical, tribological, and biocompatibility properties of zrn-ag nanocomposite films.
AB  == nanocomposite films of zrn-ag were produced by reactive unbalanced magnetron sputtering, and their structural, chemical, mechanical, tribological, haemocompatibility, and antibacterial properties were studied as a function of film composition. the films formed a dense and homogeneous microstructure whereby nanocrystals of ag are distributed evenly throughout the zrn matrix. for small additions of silver, the hardness was found to increase, whereas the elastic modulus was found to decrease drastically. in the process of optimizing the deposition conditions, three kinds of coatings were prepared on 316 l surgical steel and tested by accelerated electrochemical polarization tests in order to detect the influence of ag and the value of the bias potential on the corrosion performance of the system. films produced under the optimum deposition conditions were, subsequently, deposited on medical grade ti-al-v and worn against ball-bearing steel using a ball-on-disk tribotester in bovine serum and were found to have superior tribological properties compared with single-phase zrn coatings. the haemocompatibility of the films was assessed by investigating the adsorption of human serum albumin and fibrinogen on samples with different phase  compositions. quantification of the protein adsorption was carried out using spectroscopic ellipsometry, which confirmed the haemocompatibility of the films.  antibiotic activity of the films was quantified by incubating the films in bacterial cultures, namely, staphylococcus epidermis, staphylococcus aureus, and  escherichia coli. films with a silver content > 10% exhibited superior antibacterial activity compared with the uncoated samples.

TI  == structure-activity relationships of phenyl-furanyl-rhodanines as inhibitors of rna polymerase with antibacterial activity on biofilms.
AB  == the dramatic rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria over the past two decades has  stressed the need for completely novel classes of antibacterial agents. accordingly, recent advances in the study of prokaryotic transcription open new opportunities for such molecules. this paper reports the structure-activity relationships of a series of phenyl-furanyl-rhodanines (pfrs) as antibacterial inhibitors of rna polymerase (rnap). the molecules have been evaluated for their  ability to inhibit transcription and affect growth of bacteria living in suspension or in a biofilm and for their propensity to interact with serum albumin, a critical parameter for antibacterial drug discovery. the most active of these molecules inhibit escherichia coli rnap transcription at concentrations  of </=10 microm and have promising activities against various gram-positive pathogens including staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms, a major cause of nosocomial infection.

AB  == purpose: intrauterine device (iud) is one of the most convenient contraceptive procedures used by women of asian and african countries. previous surveys have revealed that 75% of the iuds recovered from patients suffering from reproductive tract infections (rtis) were covered with a consortium of microbes. this study was designed to characterize these microbes and recommend remedial measures. methods: quantitative measurement of biofilm formation was assessed by a microtitre plate assay on 86 samples of microorganisms dislodged from iuds of patients with rtis. susceptibility of biofilm to various antimicrobial agents was also quantified. scanning electron microscopy (sem) was used to scrutinize the microorganisms adherent to iuds. results: the organisms associated with iuds were predominantly composed of staphylococcus aureus (16%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5%), escherichia coli (27%), neisseria gonorrhoeae (2%), candida albicans (20%) and candida dubliniesis (12%). sem studies indicated that these organisms were organized into biofilms. studies on the in vitro adherence pattern by crystal violet staining on 96 well microtitre plates revealed that the biofilms were stably established after 60 hours. these biofilms are resistant to an array of antibiotics tested. conclusion: biofilm formation may be one of the major causes for persistent infection and antibiotic resistance in iud users.

TI  == free chlorine demand and cell survival of microbial suspensions.
AB  == the utility of chlorine residual and chlorine demand as a surrogate for microbial contamination in the water distribution system was evaluated. the chlorine demanded by and cell survival of pure culture suspensions of escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, and mycobacterium aurum were quantified in solutions  with initial free chlorine concentrations of 0.20, 0.40, and 0.80 mg/l. the chlorine demand increased with initial concentration of cells and free chlorine for all species. at equivalent initial cell concentrations, chlorine demand was greatest for m. aurum, followed by s. epidermidis and e. coli. the chlorine contact time required for a 3-log inactivation of e. coli, s. epidermidis, and m. aurum was calculated as 0.032+/-0.009, 0.221+/-0.080, and 42.9+/-2.71 mg min/l, respectively. the ultimate chlorine demand and cell survival were directly proportional. no chlorine demand was observed at cell concentrations less than 10(5)cfu/ml for e. coli or 10(4)cfu/ml for s. epidermidis. m. aurum demanded chlorine at all initial cell concentrations including 10(3)cfu/ml, which was the  detection limit of the cell quantification assay. chlorine demand was determined  to be a suitable surrogate indicator of the organisms studied and its utility may be enhanced in locations of the water distribution system that maintain a higher  free chlorine residual.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefatrizine and cefpirome in presence of essential and trace elements.
AB  == evidences supporting the introduction of metallic elements in several biological  processes are rapidly accumulating. likewise, many drugs possess modified toxicological and pharmacological properties when in the form of metal complexes. in order to ascertain the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various cephalosporins, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefatrizine and cefpirome in presence of essential and trace elements has been studied and compared with the parent drug. the essential and trace elements comprised of magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, ferric, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium in the form of their chloride. these studies were carried out by observing the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) using agar dilution method and compared with the mic's of the standard cephalosporins against various species of gram (+) and gram (-) microorganisms such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and shigella dysenteriae. different dilutions of cephalosporins and salts of essential and trace elements were used in these studies. the ratio of the drug and metal salts was 1:1 and the reactions were carried out at two different temperatures as 37 degrees c and 60 degrees c in order to study the complex formation. the aim of our study was on one hand to evaluate the changes in microbiological activity of the standard cephalosporins after in vitro metal interactions to study the synergetic or antagonistic behavior of the later through the difference in mics values of these cephalosporins and on the other hand to access the bioassay directed extent of drug metal complexations. our investigation reveal that interaction of above cephalosporins with essential and trace elements cause antagonistic effect in many cases which was shown by decrease in antimicrobial activity of cephalosporins and mic values were increased.

TI  == prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == the inhibition of the adhesion of clinically isolated bacterial strains on multi-component cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol)-based polymer coatings.
AB  == this study examined bacterial adhesion to a new multi-component cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol)-based polymer coating that can be applied by spin-coating or spraying onto diverse biomaterials. adhesion of five clinically isolated bacterial strains involved in biomaterial-centered infections were studied in a parallel-plate flow chamber at different shear rates and after exposure of the coating to different physiological fluids. the new chemistry inhibits non-specific biomolecular and cell binding interactions. relative to glass, the coating reduced adhesion of all strains used in this study by more than 80%, with the exception of escherichia coli o2k2. reductions in adhesion of staphylococcus  epidermidis 3,399 persisted beyond 168h exposure of the coatings to phosphate buffered saline or urine, but not after exposure to protein-rich fluids as saliva and blood plasma, despite evidence from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that the coating integrity was not affected by exposure to these fluids. we conclude that  this new coating chemistry provides beneficial properties to prevent or hinder bacterial adhesion and colonization in applications where low protein-conditions  prevail.

TI  == synthesis of schiff bases of naphtha[1,2-d]thiazol-2-amine and metal complexes of 2-(2'-hydroxy)benzylideneaminonaphthothiazole as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  == objective: a series of 2-benzylideneaminonaphthothiazoles were designed and synthesized incorporating the lipophilic naphthalene ring to render them more capable of penetrating various biomembranes. methods: schiff bases were synthesized by the reaction of naphtha[1,2-d]thiazol-2-amine with various substituted aromatic aldehydes. 2-(2'-hydroxy)benzylideneaminonaphthothiazole was converted to its co(ii), ni(ii) and cu(ii) metal complexes upon treatment with metal salts in ethanol. all the compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial  activities by paper disc diffusion method with gram positive staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and gram negative escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of all the schiff bases and metal complexes were determined by agar streak dilution method.  results: all the compounds moderately inhibited the growth of gram positive and gram negative bacteria. in the present study among all schiff bases 2-(2'-hydroxy)benzylideneaminonaphthothiazole showed maximum inhibitory activity  and among metal complexes cu(ii) metal complex was found to be most potent. conclusion: the results obtained validate the hypothesis that schiff bases having substitution with halogens, hydroxyl group and nitro group at phenyl ring are required for the antibacterial activity while methoxy group at different positions in the aromatic ring has minimal role in the inhibitory activity. the results also indicated that the metal complexes are better antibacterial agents as compared to the schiff bases.

TI  == geographical variation in cloacal microflora and bacterial antibiotic resistance  in a threatened avian scavenger in relation to diet and livestock farming practices.
AB  == the impact on wildlife health of the increase in the use of antimicrobial agents  with the intensification of livestock production remains unknown. the composition, richness and prevalence of cloacal microflora as well as bacterial resistance to antibiotics in nestlings and full-grown egyptian vultures neophron  percnopterus were assessed in four areas of spain in which the degree of farming  intensification differs. differences in diet composition, especially the role of  stabled livestock carrion, appear to govern the similarities of bacterial flora composition among continental populations, while the insular vulture population (fuerteventura, canary islands) showed differences attributed to isolation. evidence of a positive relationship between the consumption of stabled livestock  carrion and bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics was found. bacterial resistance was high for semisynthetic penicillins and enrofloxacin, especially in the area with the most intensive stabled livestock production. the pattern of antibiotic resistance was similar for the different bacterial species within each area. bacterial resistance to antibiotics may be determined by resistance of bacteria present in the livestock meat remains that constituted the food of this  species, as indicated by the fact that resistance to each antibiotic was correlated in escherichia coli isolated from swine carrion and egyptian vulture nestlings. in addition, resistance in normal faecal bacteria (present in the microflora of both livestock and vultures) was higher than in staphylococcus epidermidis, a species indicator of the transient flora acquired presumably through the consumption of wild rabbits. potential negative effects of the use of antimicrobials in livestock farming included the direct ingestion of these drug residues and the effects of bacterial antibiotic resistance on the health of scavengers.

AB  == cyclic peptides are a rich source of biologically active compounds and are produced in nature by plants, bacteria, fungi, and lower sea animals. a high-throughput methodology has been developed for the combinatorial synthesis, screening, and identification of cyclic peptide natural product analogues with improved biological activities or useful new activities. the methodology was applied to generate a library of 1716 tyrocidine a analogues, which were screened for antibacterial activity in 96-well plates. the identity of the active peptides was determined by partial edman degradation/mass spectrometry. this has resulted  in the discovery of a series of tyrocidine analogues that have significantly improved therapeutic indices compared to the natural product. the availability of tyrocidine analogues with varying antibacterial activities has provided important insights into the structure-function relationship of tyrocidine a, which should help reveal its mechanism of action.

TI  == infections related to coils used for embolization of arteries: review of the published evidence.
AB  == the embolization of arteries with the use of coils has been an advance in the management of patients such as those at risk for aneurysm rupture. however, this  procedure is not without complications. a systematic review was undertaken to evaluate the available evidence regarding infectious complications directly related to endovascular coil embolization. seven case reports of patients who experienced infection related to coils used for embolization of arteries were discovered. arteries embolized with coils in these patients were intracranial, intraabdominal, and intrathoracic, respectively, in four, two, and one case. abscess formation in the area of coil placement (n = 6; 85.7%) was the most common infectious complication directly related to endovascular coil embolization. staphylococcus aureus was the predominant isolated pathogen (n = 3; 42.9%). other isolated pathogens included salmonella species type d (n = 1; 14.3%), s. epidermidis (n = 1; 14.3%), escherichia coli (n = 1; 14.3%), and bacteroides fragilis (n = 1; 14.3%). surgical procedures were performed in four of the seven patients described (57.1%), and three patients were treated with only the administration of antimicrobial agents. all reviewed patients were cured. even though it may partially be a result of reporting bias, the scarcity of reports describing infections directly related to endovascular coils despite the increasing number of patients who received this treatment in various parts of the world suggests that infectious complications associated with this foreign endovascular material are very rare. however, the existence of the identified case reports suggests that clinicians should include coil-related infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever after this procedure.

TI  == a functional homing endonuclease in the bacillus anthracis nrde group i intron.
AB  == the essential bacillus anthracis nrde gene carries a self-splicing group i intron with a putative homing endonuclease belonging to the giy-yig family. here, we show that the nrde pre-mrna is spliced and that the homing endonuclease cleaves an intronless nrde gene 5 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the intron insertion site, producing 2-nt 3' extensions. we also show that the sequence required for efficient cleavage spans at least 4 bp upstream and 31 bp downstream of the cleaved coding strand. the position of the recognition sequence in relation to the cleavage position is as expected for a giy-yig homing endonuclease. interestingly, nrde genes from several other bacillaceae were also susceptible to cleavage, with those of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis (nrde1), b. anthracis, and bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian being better substrates than those of bacillus subtilis, bacillus lichenformis, and s. epidermidis (nrde2). on the other hand, nrde genes from lactococcus lactis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and corynebacterium ammoniagenes were not cleaved. intervening sequences (ivss) residing in protein-coding genes are often found in enzymes involved in dna metabolism, and the ribonucleotide reductase nrde gene is a frequent target for self-splicing ivss. a comparison of  nrde genes from seven gram-positive low-g+c bacteria, two bacteriophages, and nocardia farcinica showed five different insertion sites for self-splicing ivss within the coding region of the nrde gene.

AB  == we describe a new device for separation of complex biological particles and structures exploiting many physical properties of the biolytes. the device adds a new longitudinal gradient feature to insulator dielectrophoresis, extending the technique to separation of complex mixtures in a single channel. the production of stronger local field gradients along a global gradient allows particles to enter, initially transported through the channel by electrophoresis and electroosmosis, and to be isolated according to their characteristic physical properties, including charge, polarizability, deformability, surface charge mobility, dielectric features, and local capacitance. in this work, the separation mechanism is described in terms of the relevant electromechanical principles, and proof-of-principle is demonstrated using various bacteria cells as model systems. the results demonstrate the selectivity of the technique and suggest that it may form the foundation for a versatile and useful tool for separating mixtures of complex biological particles and structures.

TI  == protection against escherichia coli infection by antibody to the staphylococcus aureus poly-n-acetylglucosamine surface polysaccharide.
AB  == poly-n-acetylglucosamine (pnag) is a surface polysaccharide produced by staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and is an effective target for opsonic and protective ab for these two organisms. recently, it has been found that escherichia coli produces an exo-polysaccharide, designated polyglucosamine, that is biochemically indistinguishable from pnag. we analyzed 30 e. coli strains isolated from urinary tract and neonatal bloodstream infections for the pga locus, pnag antigen production, and susceptibility to opsonic killing and protection from lethal infection by ab to pnag. twenty-six of 30 strains carried the pga locus, 25 of 30 expressed immunologically detectable pnag, and 21 of 30 could be killed by rabbit igg specific for the deacetylated form of the staphylococcal pnag. ab to staphylococcal pnag protected mice against lethality from five different e. coli strains expressing pnag. pnag expression by both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms could make this antigen a conserved vaccine target for multiple pathogenic species of bacteria.

TI  == poly-n-acetylglucosamine mediates biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance in  actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.
AB  == most field isolates of the swine pathogen actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae form tenacious biofilms on abiotic surfaces in vitro. we purified matrix polysaccharides from biofilms produced by a. pleuropneumoniae field isolates ia1  and ia5 (serotypes 1 and 5, respectively), and determined their chemical structures by using nmr spectroscopy. both strains produced matrix polysaccharides consisting of linear chains of n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac) residues in beta(1,6) linkage (poly-beta-1,6-glcnac or pga). a small percentage of the glcnac residues in each polysaccharide were n-deacetylated. these structures were nearly identical to those of biofilm matrix polysaccharides produced by escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. pcr analyses indicated that a gene encoding the pga-specific glycoside transferase enzyme pgac was present on the chromosome of 15 out of 15 a. pleuropneumoniae reference strains (serotypes 1-12) and 76 out of 77 a. pleuropneumoniae field isolates (serotypes 1, 5 and 7). a pgac mutant of strain ia5 failed to form biofilms in vitro, as did wild-type strains ia1 and ia5 when grown in broth supplemented with the pga-hydrolyzing enzyme dispersin b. treatment of ia5 biofilms with dispersin b rendered them more sensitive to killing by ampicillin. our findings suggest that pga functions as a major biofilm adhesin in a. pleuropneumoniae. biofilm formation may have relevance to the colonization and pathogenesis of a. pleuropneumoniae in pigs.

AB  == the research of microorganisms includes the development of methods for the inactivation of viruses and other microbes. it also means to efficiently eliminate the infectivity of microorganisms without damage of their integrity and structure. according to the results of the last 5 years the capillary electromigration techniques appear to be very perspective for the comparison of the methods applicable for inactivation in the diagnostics and study of the pathogens. in this paper we suggest the capillary isoelectric focusing of the model microorganisms, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, candida albicans and bacteriophage phix 174, native or inactivated by different procedures. uv detection and fluorometric detection for the dynamically modified  microbes by pyrenebutanoate on the basis of the non-ionogenic tenside were used here. isoelectric points of native and/or dynamically modified microorganisms and other properties were compared with those obtained after microorganisms inactivation. the segmental injection of the sample pulse enabled the reproducible and efficient capillary isoelectric focusing in different ph gradients. the low-molecular-weight pi markers were used for tracing of the ph gradient.

TI  == action mechanism of tachyplesin i and effects of pegylation.
AB  == pegylation of protein and peptide drugs is frequently used to improve in vivo efficacy. we investigated the action mechanism of tachyplesin i, a membrane-acting cyclic antimicrobial peptide from tachypleus tridentatus and the  effects of pegylation on the mechanism. the pegylated peptide induced the leakage of calcein from egg yolk l-alpha-phosphatidylglycerol/egg yolk l-alpha-phosphatidylcholine large unilamellar vesicles similarly to the parent peptide. both peptides induced lipid flip-flop coupled to leakage and was translocated into the inner leaflet of the bilayer, indicating that tachyplesin i forms a toroidal pore and that pegylation did not alter the basic mechanism of membrane permeabilization of the parent peptide. despite their similar activities against model membranes, the peptides showed very different biological activities. the cytotoxicity of tachyplesin i was greatly reduced by pegylation,  although the antimicrobial activity was significantly weakened. we investigated the enhancement of the permeability of inner membranes induced by the peptides. our results suggested that outer membranes and peptidoglycan layers play an inhibitory role in the permeation of the peg moiety. furthermore, a reduction in  dna binding by pegylation may also contribute to the weak activity of the pegylated peptide.

TI  == effect of ovotransferrin, protamine sulfate and edta combination on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria.
AB  == aims: to determine the effect of a composition comprising ovotransferrin (ot), protamine sulfate (ps) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. methods and results: the in vitro activity of ot, ps and edta alone and in combinations against biofilm formation by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. all the three compounds either alone or in combinations failed to inhibit the growth completely at the concentrations tested. however, the subinhibitory concentrations of three compounds in a composition showed synergistic inhibitory  effect on biofilm formation by k. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis.  furthermore, 79-95% reduction in ps. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis biofilm formation was observed in a clear vinyl urinary catheter treated with the composition. conclusion: the subinhibitory concentrations of ot, ps and edta in a composition were effective in reducing biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. significance and impact of the study: this study shows that a synergistic composition-comprising non-antibiotic generally regarded as safe (gras) compounds such as ot, ps and edta may be used in the prevention of catheter-related infections.

TI  == bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  == the most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. the most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. three bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. other prevalent bacterial isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis and  enterococcus faecalis, while acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all intensive care unit (icu) isolates. 7% of s. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. although e. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. all the gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)=4 microg/ml. almost 10% of escherichia coli, 14% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of serratia marcescens and 50% of enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. amikacin was the most active antibiotic against p. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. finally, acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). the results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital  setting in italy.

TI  == dry reagent dipstick test combined with 23s rrna pcr for molecular diagnosis of bacterial infection in arthroplasty.
AB  == periprosthetic joint infections present a challenging problem in orthopaedics. conventional methods for detection of arthroplasty infections rely on bacterial culture of synovial fluid aspirates. during recent years, however, molecular tests that are based on dna amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr), followed by electrophoretic analysis of the products, have been introduced. we report a simple and inexpensive assay that allows visual detection and confirmation of the pcr-amplified sequences by hybridization within minutes. the  assay is performed in a dry reagent dipstick format (strip) and does not require  special instrumentation. universal primers are used for pcr of the 23s ribosomal  rna (rrna) gene. the biotinylated amplification product is hybridized with da-tailed probes that are specific for six pathogens commonly involved in periprosthetic joint infections. the mixture is applied to the strip, which is then immersed in the appropriate buffer. the buffer migrates along the strip by capillary action and rehydrates gold nanoparticles with oligo(dt) strands attached to their surface. the nanoparticles bind to the target dna through hybridization, and the hybrids are captured by immobilized streptavidin at the test zone of the strip, producing a characteristic red line. unbound nanoparticles are captured by immobilized oligo(dt) strands at the control zone of the strip, generating a second line. the dipstick test was applied to the detection of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faesium, and haemophilus influenza. twelve samples of synovial fluids from patients were analyzed for the detection and identification of the infection caused by the six pathogens. the results were compared with bacterial cultures.

AB  == the antimicrobial activities of crude dichloromethane fractions from acetone extracts of agrobacterium rhizogenes transformed roots and roots of field-grown plants of salvia sclarea as well as four pure abietane diterpenoids isolated from the hairy root cultures were determined. the growth of gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis) but not gram-negative ones (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) or pathogenic fungi (candida albicans) was inhibited by fractions tested at concentrations of 37.5-75.0 microgml(-1). abietane diterpenoids: salvipisone, aethiopinone, 1-oxoaethiopinone and ferruginol were shown to be bacteriostatic as well as bacteriocidal for the cultures of s. aureus and s. epidermidis strains, regardless of their antibiotic susceptibility profile. this was demonstrated by using simultaneously the optical density measuring method and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide-reduction assay. the highest activity was shown by salvipisone which demonstrated also a very interesting activity when its effect on 24-h-old staphylococcal biofilm cells viability was examined. it limited the survival of biofilms formed by s. aureus as well as by s. epidermidis, putting this compound to the list of potential anti-biofilm agents, better than most of known antibiotics.

TI  == catalases are nad(p)h-dependent tellurite reductases.
AB  == reactive oxygen species damage intracellular targets and are implicated in cancer, genetic disease, mutagenesis, and aging. catalases are among the key enzymatic defenses against one of the most physiologically abundant reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide. the well-studied, heme-dependent catalases accelerate the rate of the dismutation of peroxide to molecular oxygen and water  with near kinetic perfection. many catalases also bind the cofactors nadph and nadh tenaciously, but, surprisingly, nad(p)h is not required for their dismutase  activity. although nad(p)h protects bovine catalase against oxidative damage by its peroxide substrate, the catalytic role of the nicotinamide cofactor in the function of this enzyme has remained a biochemical mystery to date. anions formed by heavy metal oxides are among the most highly reactive, natural oxidizing agents. here, we show that a natural isolate of staphylococcus epidermidis resistant to tellurite detoxifies this anion thanks to a novel activity of its catalase, and that a subset of both bacterial and mammalian catalases carry out the nad(p)h-dependent reduction of soluble tellurite ion (teo(3)(2-)) to the less toxic, insoluble metal, tellurium (te(o)), in vitro. an escherichia coli mutant defective in the katg catalase/peroxidase is sensitive to tellurite, and expression of the s. epidermidis catalase gene in a heterologous e. coli host confers increased resistance to tellurite as well as to hydrogen peroxide in vivo, arguing that s. epidermidis catalase provides a physiological line of defense against both of these strong oxidizing agents. kinetic studies reveal that bovine catalase reduces tellurite with a low michaelis-menten constant, a result suggesting that tellurite is among the natural substrates of this enzyme.  the reduction of tellurite by bovine catalase occurs at the expense of producing  the highly reactive superoxide radical.

TI  == bismuth-norfloxacin complex: synthesis, physicochemical and antimicrobial evaluation.
AB  == norfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent which is active against various gram-positive as well as gram-negative microorganisms. presence of metal  ions considerably alters the activity of fluoroquinolones against potentially susceptible bacteria. as bismuth is known to possess a good antibacterial activity, bismuth complex of norfloxacin was prepared by reacting bismuth citrate with aqueous solution of norfloxacin. the structure of the bismuth-norfloxacin complex (bnc) was confirmed by spectral, chemical and elemental analysis. antimicrobial studies were carried out using agar diffusion method against escherichia coli (atcc 25922), klebsiella pneumoniae (ntcc 10320), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), bacillus pumilis (ntcc 8241) and staphylococcus epidermidis  (atcc 12228). the results showed significant increase (p<0.05, tukeys test) in antibacterial activity of bnc as compared with norfloxacin and physical mixture of norfloxacin and bismuth citrate. this increase in activity is being considered due to increased bioavailability of the metal drug complex. thus, the use of the  bnc may be preferable over norfloxacin alone.

TI  == detection and identification of bacteria using antibiotic susceptibility and a multi-array electrochemical sensor with pattern recognition.
AB  == this work proposes the use of amperometric signals generated by a 96-well multi-array dissolved oxygen multi-electrode sensor (dox) coupled with principal  component analysis for continuous monitoring, identification and differentiation  of bacteria. two types of differentiation mechanisms were tested: (1) direct monitoring of respiratory activity via oxygen consumption and (2) quantification  of the effect of three broad-spectrum antibiotics on bacteria growth and respiration over time. five species of bacteria were examined including: escherichia coli, escherichia adecarboxylata, comamonas acidovorans, corynebacterium glutamicum and staphylococcus epidermidis. the addition of small  concentrations of antibiotics to the growth medium alters the oxygen consumption  of the cells and a unique fingerprint is created for a specific cell. this fingerprint is shown to evolve over a specific concentration range that is dependant of instrumental constraints of the dox system. the application of principal component analysis (pca) to classify the data was also examined. it was shown that bacteria could be classified simply by their oxygen consumption rates  over a varying concentration range. discrimination between species can also be increased by the effects of the antibiotics on the oxygen consumption of varying  concentrations of cells. the proposed dox-pca system illustrates a generic template that can be tailored to meet specific research goals by the selection of specific cell/antibiotic combinations and concentrations.

AB  == septic shock is one of the major direct causes of death in patients in hematology departments. the aim of the study was to identify situations and factors associated with septic shock in patients with blood diseases. we analyzed the medical treatment of septic shock and its outcome, we based on data from clinical history. material and methods: the analyzed group consisted of 60 patients with septic shock, 32 women and 28 men, aged between 20 and 79 years with different blood diseases, hospitalized between 1998 and 2004. results: value of apache iii  scale (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation iii scale) at the beginning of septic shock was statistically significantly higher for the non-survivors of septic shock than for the survivors (p < 0.001). septic shock in the analyzed group was associated in similar proportion with presence of gram-positive (the most often cultured: staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative bacteria (the  most often cultured: escherichia coli). the mortality due to septic shock caused  by gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms was also similar. we have found no differences in the mortality between neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients. if empirical treatment instituted at the beginning of shock was concordant with result of in vitro sensitivity testing received later, 81% of patients survived septic shock. the survival rate of patients with septic shock receiving discordant antimicrobial treatment was equal 11% and it was statistically less in comparison with patients, when the treatment was concordant (81% vs 11% p < 0.05). when the blood cultures were negative, the adequacy of antibiotic therapy  was impossible to confirm and in this group 53% survival rate was noted (81% vs 53%, p < 0.05). in 37 cases, septic shock appeared in patients treated with antibiotics before the onset of septic shock. in this group of patients the highest percent of deaths was noted, when the antibiotic therapy after the moment of starting of septic shock was not changed and was higher in comparison to group, where the treatment was totally changed (64% vs 43% respectively, p < 0.05). conclusions: the most important factors influencing survival in septic shock is patient's organ sufficiency and adequacy of applied antibiotics (early goal-directed antibiotic therapy)--in the same way the sensitivity of microorganisms to this treatment. the neutropenia didn't influence an outcome. the best results were achieved in patients whom combinations of three antibiotics were given: beta-lactam + aminoglicoside + glicopeptide antibiotic or carbapenem  + glicopeptide antibiotic + fluorochinolon.

AB  == the 16s rdna specific primers were designed for rapid detection of pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) by the fluorescence quantitative pcr (fq-pcr) assay, based upon multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis of the 16s rdnas of over 20 bacteria. after extraction of pa genomic dna, the target 16s rdna fragment was amplified by pcr with specific primers, and used to construct recombinant pmdt-pfr plasmid, the dilution gradients of which were subjected to the standard quantitation curve in fq-pcr assay. different concentrations of pa genomic dna were detected by fq-pcr in a 20microl of reaction system with sybr green i. at the same time, various genomic dnas of staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and mycobacterium tuberculosis were used as negative controls to confirm specificity of the fq-pcr detection assay. results demonstrated that the predicted amplified product of designed primers was of high homology only with pa 16s rdna, and that sensitivity of the fq-pcr assay was of 3.6pg/microl of bacterial dna or (2.1 x 10(3) +/- 3.1 x 10(2)) copies/microl of 16s rdna, accompanied with high specificity, and that the whole detection process including dna extraction could be completed in about two hours. in contrast to traditional culture method, the fq-pcr assay targeting 16s rdna gene can be used  to detect pa rapidly, which exhibits perfect application prospect in future.

TI  == the response of spleen dendritic cell-enriched population to bacterial and allogeneic antigens.
AB  == the dendritic cells (dc) play crucial role in initiation and modulation of immune response especially innate immune response. we investigated the influence bacterial (e. coli and s. epidermidis) and allogeneic antigens (heart, skin and bone marrow transplants) on splenic dc- enriched population. we found that 1) the in culture stimulation of rat splenic dc-enriched population by e. coli, s.epidermidis, lps and cpg dna caused increase in class ii-positive cells. simultaneously, a decrease in percentage of edi, b cells and ox62 migrating dc upon treatment with s.epidermidis was observed. lps caused decreased frequency of ox62 and nk cells. 2) similarly to the in vitro the in vivo stimulation by e. coli, s.epidermidis, lps and cpg dna increased the percentage of class ii-positive cells. there was a decrease in the ed1, ox62 and b cell populations following stimulation by s. epidermidis. 3) mixed dc-enriched population and donor pbm culture showed high level of response in both populations. 4) syngeneic and allogeneic transplants of heart, skin and bmc caused increase in class ii-positive cells. moreover, there was an increase in frequency of the ed1 and w3/13 populations after both syn- and allogeneic transplantation. the ox62 cells  did not react, whereas the b cell frequency rose only after allogeneic transplantation. a significant decrease in nk cell population was noticed. 5) the in vitro and in vivo bacterial stimulation brought about expression of tlr receptors and hsp. mixed recipient dc with donor pbm culture caused expression of hsp 90 but not tlrs. allogeneic stimulation by transplanted tissues did not evoke expression of the investigated receptors and proteins. 6) recipient dc-enriched population produced ifn gamma upon stimulation with bacteria and skin but not heart and bmc. further studies on simultaneous stimulation of splenic dcs by bacterial and allo-antigens will throw light on additive effects of bacterial activation in allograft rejection.

TI  == construction of a leftover bath water model for microbial testing.
AB  == in this study, in order to construct a model of leftover bath water, we analyzed  one hundred samples of used bath water samples which were provided by twenty-eight volunteer families. it appeared that the number of detected bacteria from such bath water was correlated closely with the number of bathers. moreover, the ph, acidity, chemical oxygen demand (cod), ion, protein content of the leftover bath water were measured. the number of bathers had no connection with the ph, acidity, cod, and ion content of the leftover bath water. however, the protein content of the bath water correlated with the number of detected bacteria. based on these results, the model of leftover bath water was constructed. achromobacter xylosoxidans, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa were incubated with the model bath water as indices of bath water contamination. the number of incubated viable cells in the model bath water increased with increasing concentrations of casamino acid. consequently, it was suggested that varying the concentration of casamino acid based on family size or contamination  would be necessary in the efficient use of the constructed model of leftover bath water for microbial testing.

AB  == a series of pyrazolidine-3,5-dione and 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-one inhibitors  of escherichia coli udp-n-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase (murb) has been prepared. the 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-ones show low micromolar ic(50) values versus e. coli murb and submicromolar minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) against staphylococcus aureus gc 1131, enterococcus faecalis gc 2242, streptococcus pneumoniae gc 1894, and e. coli gc 4560 imp, a strain with increased outer membrane permeability. none of these compounds show antimicrobial activity against candida albicans, a marker of eukaryotic toxicity. moreover, these compounds inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis, as assessed by measuring the  amount of soluble peptidoglycan produced by streptococcus epidermidis upon incubation with compounds. a partial least squares projection to latent structures analysis shows that improving murb potency and mic values correlate with increasing lipophilicity of the c-4 substituent of the 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-one core. docking studies using flo and pharmdock produced several binding orientations for these molecules in the murb active site.

TI  == antibacterial agent discovery using thymidylate synthase biolibrary screening.
AB  == thymidylate synthase (ts, thya) catalyzes the reductive methylation of 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate to 2'-deoxythymidine 5'-monophosphate, an essential precursor for dna synthesis. a specific inhibition of this enzyme induces bacterial cell death. as a second round lead optimization design, new 1,2-naphthalein derivatives have been synthesized and tested against a ts-based biolibrary, including human thymidylate synthase (hts). docking studies have been performed to rationalize the experimentally observed affinity profiles of 1,2-naphthalein compounds toward lactobacillus casei ts and hts. the best ts inhibitors have been tested against a number of clinical isolates of gram-positive-resistant bacterial strains. compound 3,3-bis(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)-1h,3h-naphtho[1,2-c]furan-1-one (5) showed significant antibacterial activity, no in vitro toxicity, and dose-response effects against staphylococcus epidermidis (mic=0.5-2.5 microg/ml) clinical isolate strains, which are resistant to at least 17 of the best known antibacterial agents, including vancomycin. so far this compound can be regarded  as a leading antibacterial agent.

TI  == studying bacterial metabolic states using raman spectroscopy.
AB  == natural metabolic variability expected during characteristic growth phases in batch cultures of escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis were studied by raman spectroscopy. spectral changes induced by metabolic changes found in the growth phases (i.e., lag, exponential, stationary, and decay) were identified. maximum intensity of bands assigned to dna and rna bases are seen at the beginning of the exponential phase, when cells are metabolically active, and minimum intensities are seen when cells are decaying. high agreement in spectral  variation due to growth phases was seen for all the trials that were performed, four growth cycles for e. coli and two for s. epidermidis. batch cultures were monitored by standard plate counts to identify all growth phases, including decay. spectral data were analyzed by principal component analysis (pca) and discriminant analysis to identify similarities and differences and to estimate a  classification performance based on growth phases. for the species evaluated, spectra during decay are grouped closer to each other and separated from lag, exponential, and stationary cells. these results suggest that raman spectroscopy  can be used to study metabolic states in bacteria and in particular cell viability.

TI  == bacterial adherence to surgical sutures: can antibacterial-coated sutures reduce  the risk of microbial contamination?
AB  == background: surgical site infections are associated with severe morbidity and mortality. the role of surgical sutures in the etiology of surgical site infection has been the objective of discussion for decades. this study used a standardized in vitro microbiologic model to assess bacterial adherence and the antibacterial activity of a triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 (braided) suture against selected gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates that may infect surgical wounds. study design: standardized cultures (2.0 log(10) colony forming units/ml and 5.0 log(10) colony forming units/ml of three clinical strains, staphyllococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s aureus [mrsa]), s epidermidis (biofilm-positive) and escherichia coli (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl]-producer) were inoculated to triclosan-coated and noncoated polyglactin 910 sutures to evaluate comparative adherence of bacterial isolates to the antibacterial coated and noncoated surgical sutures; to assess the impact  of serum proteins (bovine serum albumin) on antibacterial activity of triclosan-coated suture; and to document the duration of antibacterial activity of the triclosan-coated material. selected suture samples were prepared for scanning electron microscopy to demonstrate bacterial adherence. results: substantial (p < 0.01) reductions in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial adherence were observed on triclosan-coated sutures compared with noncoated material. pretreatment of surgical sutures with 20% bsa did not diminish antibacterial activity of the triclosan-coated braided device compared with noncoated suture (p < 0.01), and antibacterial activity was documented to persist for at least 96 hours compared with controls (p < 0.01). conclusions: the in vitro model demonstrated a considerable reduction (p < 0.01) in gram-positive  and gram-negative bacterial adherence to a triclosan-coated braided suture, which was associated with decreased microbial viability (p < 0.001). because bacterial  contamination of suture material within a surgical wound may increase the virulence of a surgical site infection, treating the suture with triclosan provides an effective strategy for reducing perioperative surgical morbidity.

TI  == ft-ir microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  == aims: to investigate the potentials and limitations of fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. methods and  results: a total of 1570 ft-ir spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. a classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium at the species level. an average accuracy of about 80% was reached with gram negative bacteria from the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae families; enterobacter aerogenes,  enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and citrobacter koseri; and proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. results were comparable with ft-ir measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. conclusions: early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with ft-ir microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is  necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. significance and impact of the study: combination of ft-ir microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.

TI  == effects of commensal bacteria on intestinal morphology and expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the gnotobiotic pig.
AB  == a germ-free neonatal pig model was established to determine the effects of bacterial colonization by different species on small intestinal morphology and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression. two experimental groups of 16 pigs were aseptically delivered by cesarian section and allocated into 4 gnotobiotic isolators. pigs were either maintained germ-free (gf), or were orally inoculated  with either a single strain of nonpathogenic escherichia coli (ec) or lactobacillus fermentum (lf) or conventionalized with adult porcine feces (cv). after 13 days tissue samples were collected at 5 regions corresponding to 5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95% of the small intestine (si) length. in experiment 2, the gf isolator became contaminated with staphylococcus epidermidis (se). in general, intestinal responses to bacterial colonization were similar among gf, lf, and se  pigs, and intestinal responses in ec pigs were more similar to cv pigs. responses to bacterial colonization were most pronounced in the distal si regions (50%-95%), suggesting that nonmicrobial factors may be more important in the proximal si. relative to cv pigs, the distal intestines of gf, lf, and se pigs were characterized by long villi, shallow crypts, increased relative intestinal mass, and decreased lamina propria cellularity, whereas si morphology was intermediate in ec pigs. relative expression of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (il-1beta ) and il-6 generally increased distally in the si and was highest in ec and cv pigs. we observed regional variation in si morphology and proinflammatory cytokine expression, which differed with bacterial species. this study demonstrates that bacterial species differentially affect intestinal morphology and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and suggests that neonatal bacterial colonization patterns may have long-term effects on intestinal health and development.

TI  == effect of gamma irradiation on viability and dna of staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli.
AB  == gamma irradiation is widely used for sterilization; however, its effect on elimination of amplifiable dna, an issue of relevance to molecular diagnostic approaches, has not been well studied. the effect of gamma irradiation on the viability of staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli (using quantitative  cultures) and on their dna (using quantitative 16s rrna gene pcr) was evaluated.  viability was abrogated at 2.8 and 3.6 kgy for s. epidermidis and e. coli, respectively. the radiation dose required to reduce viable bacteria by one log10  (d10 value) was 0.31 and 0.35 kgy for s. epidermidis and e. coli, respectively. d10 values for amplifiable dna extracted from bacteria were 2.58 and 3.09 kgy for s. epidermidis and e. coli, respectively, whereas d10 values for amplifiable dna  were significantly higher for dna extracted from irradiated viable bacterial cells (22.9 and 52.6 kgy for s. epidermidis and e. coli, respectively; p<0.001).  this study showed that gamma irradiation of dna in viable bacterial cells has little effect on amplifiable dna, was not able to eliminate amplifiable 16s rrna  genes at a dose of up to 12 kgy and cannot therefore be used for elimination of dna contamination of pcr reaction components or laboratory equipment when this dna is present in microbial cells. this finding has practical implications for those using molecular diagnostic techniques in microbiology.

TI  == microbiology of postoperative infections.
AB  == background: surgical infections, accounting for approximately one quarter of all  nosocomial infections, contribute to longer hospital stays and higher medical costs. clinical failure of antibiotic treatment often is associated with increasing drug resistance. methods: non-duplicated microbial isolates obtained at our institution from surgical patients were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the sceptor system in 2001-2002 and the phoenix system in 2003-2005. epidemiologic data were extracted using epicenter and powerlab. during selected periods, genetic and biochemical characterization was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, colony blot hybridization, gene amplification and sequencing, isoelectric focusing, and enzyme kinetics. results: the specimens were most commonly isolated from infections at surgical sites (24.0%), the urinary tract (19.0%), and blood stream (10.6%). isolates of escherichia coli showed an increasing prevalence of resistance to penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, whereas the prevalence of resistant staphylococcus aureus generally declined. highly aggressive multi-drug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were widespread, although colistin remained effective in 100% of cases. a significant  increase was seen in infections attributable to s. epidermidis and candida albicans. the overall number of enterobacteriaceae carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases increased continuously, and new resistance traits emerged. it appeared that the tem-92 determinant moved from enterobacteriaceae to nonfermenting gram-negative rods such as acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: the number and type of antimicrobial-resistance determinants are increasing.

AB  == background: because major complications are rare in day surgery, minor morbidities such as surgical site infections, which become evident only after patient discharge, have a major impact on the perceived quality of care. we performed an audit of such infections over a oneyear period. methods: all procedures were performed in a multidisciplinary day surgery setting. there were  155 inguinal hernia repairs, 44 excisions of lipomas, and 27 excisions of pilonidal cysts. all patients received antibiotic prophylaxis according to a rotation protocol. results: one patient (0.65%) operated on for inguinal hernia developed a deep incisional infection caused by staphylococcus schleiferi. the patient was treated using selective antibiotics, and complete recovery ensued. one patient (2.27%) who underwent excision of a lipoma revealed developed a deep  incisional infection associated with fever (39 degrees c) caused by staphylococcus aureus. he was treated by daily antibiotics and application of dressings for two weeks and recovered. one patient (3.7%) treated for pilonidal cyst developed a deep incisional surgical site infection. a group a streptococcus was isolated, and he received an intravenous antibiotic for ten days. in the seven patients treated for pilonidal cyst with the wound left open, swab specimens were taken because of persisting local pain, and the following bacteria were found: pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus constellatus. no antibiotic therapy was given, and local wound care led to complete recovery. conclusion: in our day surgery unit, the rates of surgical site infection are similar to those described in the literature. continuing audit is essential to maintain and improve the quality and standard of the surgery provided. prevention of surgical site infection is very much the responsibility of the persons working in the operating theater. therefore, it is vital not only to apply strict regulations concerning everyday management but also to maintain a high degree of motivation among the personnel.

TI  == antimicrobial activity in the egg wax of the african cattle tick amblyomma hebraeum (acari: ixodidae).
AB  == eggs of the tick amblyomma hebraeum koch (acari: ixodidae) inhibited the growth of escherichia coli and serratia marcescens (gram-negative bacteria) in solid culture, but not the growth of staphylococcus epidermidis, and only marginally the growth of bacillus subtilis (gram-positive bacteria). when egg wax was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1), the extract contained antibacterial activity, but the denuded eggs did not. when assayed against bacteria in liquid culture, the aqueous phase inhibited the growth of s. epidermidis. however, the activity against e. coli was lost during extraction. the antimicrobial component  of the aqueous phase was heat stable (100 degrees c for 10 min), resistant to proteinase k (15 min at 55 degrees c) and to pronase (30 min at 37 degrees c). the antibacterial activity in the aqueous phase increased the permeability of the cell membrane of susceptible bacterial cells within 30 min. however, lysis of the cells was detected by optical density measurements (od(600 nm)) only after 1.5 h. the most evident cytological changes observed by transmission electron microscopy were a thickening of the cell wall and the appearance of numerous electron lucent areas within the cytoplasm of treated bacteria. gene's organ, the egg-waxing organ in ticks, grew enormously during the first 16 days post-engorgement, and gained antimicrobial activity by day 10 (when oviposition began). this suggests that gene's organ is the major source of the antibacterial substance in the egg wax. the vitellogenic hormone in a. hebraeum, 20-hydroxyecdysone, when injected into recently engorged females, did not stimulate growth of gene's organ or precocious secretion of antimicrobial activity.

TI  == naturally processed dermcidin-derived peptides do not permeabilize bacterial membranes and kill microorganisms irrespective of their charge.
AB  == dermcidin (dcd) is a recently described antimicrobial peptide, which is constitutively expressed in eccrine sweat glands and transported via sweat to the epidermal surface. by postsecretory proteolytic processing in sweat the dermcidin protein gives rise to several truncated dcd peptides which differ in length and net charge. in order to understand the mechanism of antimicrobial activity, we analyzed the spectrum of activity of several naturally processed dermcidin-derived peptides, the secondary structure in different solvents, and the ability of these peptides to interact with or permeabilize the bacterial membrane. interestingly, although all naturally processed dcd peptides can adopt  an alpha-helical conformation in solvents, they have a diverse and partially overlapping spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. this indicates that the net charge and the secondary structure of the peptides are not important for the toxic activity. furthermore, using carboxyfluorescein-loaded liposomes, membrane permeability studies and electron microscopy we investigated whether dcd peptides are able to permeabilize bacterial membranes. the data convincingly show that irrespective of charge the different dcd peptides are not able to permeabilize bacterial membranes. however, bacterial mutants lacking specific cell envelope modifications exhibited different susceptibilities to killing by dcd peptides than wild-type bacterial strains. finally, immunoelectron microscopy studies indicated that dcd peptides are able to bind to the bacterial surface; however, signs of membrane perturbation were not observed. these studies indicate that dcd peptides do not exert their activity by permeabilizing bacterial membranes.

TI  == automated detection and quantitation of bacterial rna by using electrical microarrays.
AB  == low-density electrical 16s rrna specific oligonucleotide microarrays and an automated analysis system have been developed for the identification and quantitation of pathogens. the pathogens are escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis, which are typically involved in urinary tract infections. interdigitated gold array electrodes (ida-electrodes), which have structures in the nanometer range, have been used for very sensitive analysis. thiol-modified oligonucleotides are immobilized on the gold ida as capture probes. they mediate  the specific recognition of the target 16s rrna by hybridization. additionally three unlabeled oligonucleotides are hybridized in close proximity to the capturing site. they are supporting molecules, because they improve the rna hybridization at the capturing site. a biotin labeled detector oligonucleotide is also allowed to hybridize to the captured rna sequence. the biotin labels enable  the binding of avidin alkaline phophatase conjugates. the phosphatase liberates the electrochemical mediator p-aminophenol from its electrically inactive phosphate derivative. the electrical signals were generated by amperometric redox cycling and detected by a unique multipotentiostat. the read out signals of the microarray are position specific current and change over time in proportion to the analyte concentration. if two additional biotins are introduced into the affinity binding complex via the supporting oligonucleotides, the sensitivity of  the assays increase more than 60%. the limit of detection of escherichia coli total rna has been determined to be 0.5 ng/microl. the control of fluidics for variable assay formats as well as the multichannel electrical read out and data handling have all been fully automated. the fast and easy procedure does not require any amplification of the targeted nucleic acids by pcr.

AB  == optimal detection of a pathogen present in biological samples depends on the ability to extract dna molecules rapidly and efficiently. in this paper, we report a novel method for efficient dna extraction and subsequent real-time detection in a single microchip by combining laser irradiation and magnetic beads. by using a 808 nm laser and carboxyl-terminated magnetic beads, we demonstrate that a single pulse of 40 seconds lysed pathogens including e. coli and gram-positive bacterial cells as well as the hepatitis b virus mixed with human serum. we further demonstrate that the real-time pathogen detection was performed with pre-mixed pcr reagents in a real-time pcr machine using the same microchip, after laser irradiation in a hand-held device equipped with a small laser diode. these results suggest that the new sample preparation method is well suited to be integrated into lab-on-a-chip application of the pathogen detection  system.

AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

TI  == activity of the major staphylococcal autolysin atl.
AB  == the major autolysin of staphylococcus aureus (atla) and of staphylococcus epidermidis (atle) are well-studied enzymes. here we created an atla deletion mutant in s. aureus that formed large cell clusters and was biofilm-negative. in  electron micrographs, the mutant cells were distinguished by rough outer cell surface. the mutant could be complemented using the atle gene from s. epidermidis. to study the role of the repetitive sequences of atle, we expressed  in escherichia coli the amidase domain encoded by the gene, carrying no repeat regions (amie) or two repeat regions (amie-r1,2), or the three repeat regions alone (r1,2,3) as n-terminal his-tag fusion proteins. only slight differences in  the cell wall lytic activity between amie and amie-r1,2 were observed. the repetitive sequences exhibit a good binding affinity to isolated peptidoglycan and might contribute to the targeting of the amidase to the substrate. amie and amie-r1,2 have a broad substrate specificity as shown by similar activities with  peptidoglycan lacking wall teichoic acid, o-acetylation, or both. as the amidase  activity of atla and atle has not been proved biochemically, we used purified amie-r1,2 to determine the exact peptidoglycan cleavage site. we provide the first evidence that the amidase indeed cleaves the amide bond between n-acetyl muramic acid and l-alanine.

AB  == diamond-like carbon (dlc) films were deposited by acetylene plasma immersion ion  implantation-deposition (piii-d) on biomedical polyethylene terephthalate (pet).  the capacities of staphylococcus aureus (sa), staphylococcus epidermidis (se), escherichia coli (ec), pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) and candida albicans (ca) for  adhesion to pets are quantitatively determined by the plate counting and gamma-ray counting of 125i radio labeled bacteria in vitro. the results indicate  that the capacities of five types of bacteria for adhesion to pets are all suppressed by c2h2 piii-d (p<0.05). the surface energy components of the various  substrates and bacteria are calculated based on measurements in water, formamide  and diiodomethane and lifshitz-van del waals/acid-base approach (lw-ab). the surface free energies obtained are used to calculate the interfacial free energies of adhesion (deltaf(adh)) of five kinds of bacteria on various substrates, and the results show that it is energetically unfavorable for bacterial adhesion to the dlc films already deposited on pet by c2h2 piii-d.

TI  == pectin-like acidic polysaccharide from panax ginseng with selective antiadhesive  activity against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of an acidic polysaccharide purified from the root of panax ginseng against the adhesion of helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells and the ability of porphyromonas gingivalis to agglutinate erythrocytes. in this study, this acidic polysaccharide from p. ginseng, pg-f2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/ml. however, results showed no inhibitory effects of pg-f2 against lactobacillus acidophilus,  escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. pg-f2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean mw of 1.2 x 10(4) da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. the complete hydrolysis of pg-f2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (ec. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor pg-f2 (the mic of ca. 0.01 mg/ml against h. pylori and p. gingivalis). our results suggest that pg-f2 may exert a selective antiadhesive effect against pathogenic bacteria, while having no effects on beneficial and commensal bacteria.

TI  == antibiofilm activity of glmu enzyme inhibitors against catheter-associated uropathogens.
AB  == the colonization of uropathogenic bacteria on urinary catheters resulting in biofilm formation frequently leads to the infection of surrounding tissue and often requires removal of the catheter. infections associated with biofilms are difficult to treat since they may be more than 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts. we have developed an antibiofilm  composition comprising an n-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase (glmu) inhibitor and protamine sulfate, a cationic polypeptide. the antibiofilm activity of glmu inhibitors, such as iodoacetamide (ida), n-ethyl maleimide (nem), and nem analogs, including n-phenyl maleimide, n,n'-(1,2-phenylene)dimaleimide (opdm), and n-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (pyrm), was tested against that of catheter-associated uropathogens. both ida and nem inhibited biofilm formation in escherichia coli. all nem analogs showed antibiofilm activity against clinical isolates of e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterococcus faecalis. the combination of opdm with protamine sulfate (ps) enhanced its antibiofilm activity and reduced its effective concentration to as low as 12.5 microm. in addition, we found that the in vitro inhibitory activity of opdm-plus-ps-coated silicone catheters against p. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis colonization was superior to that of catheters coated with silver hydrogel. confocal scanning laser microscopy further confirmed that the opdm-plus-ps-coated silicone catheters were almost free from bacterial colonization. thus, a broad-spectrum antibiofilm composition comprising a glmu inhibitor and protamine  sulfate shows promise for use in anti-infective coatings for medical devices, including urinary catheters.

TI  == novel antibiotics: c-2 symmetrical macrocycles inhibiting holliday junction dna binding by e. coli ruvc.
AB  == holliday junctions (hjs) are formed as transient dna intermediates during site-specific and homologous recombination. both of these genetic exchange pathways are critical for normal dna metabolism and repair. trapping hjs leads to bacterial cell death by preventing proper segregation of the resulting interlinked chromosomes. macrocyclic peptides designed to target this intermediate were synthesized with the goal of identifying compounds with specificity for this unique molecular target. we discovered ten macrocycles, both hexameric and octameric peptides, capable of trapping hjs in vitro. those macrocycles containing tyrosine residues proved most effective. these data demonstrate that c-2 symmetrical macrocycles offer excellent synthetic targets for the development of novel antibiotic agents. furthermore, the active compounds identified provide valuable tools for probing different pathways of recombinational exchange.

AB  == background: the high frequency of streptococcus pneumoniae as a cause of bacteraemia in homozygous sickle cell (ss) disease and its effective prevention has led to the routine use of pneumococcal prophylaxis in developed countries. the reported infrequency of this organism as a cause of bacteraemia in ss disease in africa raises questions on the epidemiology of bacterial infection and on the  need for pneumococcal prophylaxis in that continent. methods: a study of blood cultures in 155 ugandan children (165 episodes) with ss disease and axillary temperatures of > or =38 degrees c, attending the university teaching hospital in kampala (uganda, east africa). results: positive blood cultures, obtained in 47/165 episodes, showed staphylococcus aureus in 28 (60%) samples, haemophilus influenzae in 9 (19%), staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 (9%), and single cases of  streptococcus viridans, escherichia coli and an unidentified gram negative rod. streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in only 3 (6%) episode. conclusion: the infrequent isolation of streptococcus pneumoniae from febrile children with ss disease in this study and in four other studies from nigeria raises questions on  a different spectrum of bacterial causes for bacteraemia in malarial areas. there are several possible explanations for this finding, but the data cast sufficient  doubt on the case for pneumococcal prophylaxis for a controlled trial on its effectiveness in that environment to seem justified. these data are necessary to  determine its role in african children and to provide the evidence base for healthcare authorities in equatorial africa.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == biofilm formation by escherichia coli is stimulated by synergistic interactions and co-adhesion mechanisms with adherence-proficient bacteria.
AB  == laboratory strains of escherichia coli do not show significant ability to attach  to solid surfaces and to form biofilms. we compared the adhesion properties of the e. coli phl565 laboratory strain to eight environmental e. coli isolates: only four isolates displayed adhesion properties to glass significantly higher than phl565. the ability of the adhesion-proficient isolates to attach to glass tubes strongly correlated with their ability to express curli (thin aggregative fimbriae), thus suggesting that curli are a common adhesion determinant in environmental strains. despite its inability to attach to solid surfaces, growth  of e. coli phl565 in mixed cultures with pseudomonas putida mt2 resulted in co-adhesion and in formation of a mixed e. coli/p. putida biofilm, which was able to colonize glass surfaces with dramatic efficiency compared to p. putida alone.  e. coli/p. putida interactions stimulate initial adhesion to glass, and the presence of both bacterial species in the mature biofilm was confirmed by quantitative pcr. in contrast, no synergistic biofilm formation was observed in mixed cultures of e. coli with the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus epidermidis. interestingly, e. coli phl565 also stimulated biofilm formation by bacterial communities isolated from drinking water distribution systems. our results strongly suggest that co-adhesion and synergistic interaction with biofilm-forming species might represent an important mechanism, and a possible alternative strategy to production of adhesion determinants, for persistence and  propagation of e. coli in the environment.

TI  == multiarray sensors with pattern recognition for the detection, classification, and differentiation of bacteria at subspecies and strain levels.
AB  == this work describes the integration of a fully autonomous electrochemical biosensor with pattern recognition techniques for the detection and classification of bacteria at subspecies and strain level. the system provides a  continuous, real-time monitoring of bacteria activity upon exposure to antibiotics. the system utilizes 96-well-type electrodes array (dox-dissolved oxygen sensor) with principal component analysis (pca) for rapid and routine classification of different classes of bacteria and related strains. a representative sample of a section of the bacteria kingdom has been analyzed and  classified using the proposed dox-pca system, including the following: corynebacterium glutamicum, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus epidermidis, yersinia ruckeri, escherichia adecarboxylata, comamonas acidovorans, alcaligenes  odorans, bacillus globigii, and three strains of escherichia coli (k12, sm10, atcc 25922). the new classification scheme is based on the hypothesis that, under identical experimental conditions, various bacteria consume oxygen at different rates and are affected in different ways by selected antibiotics. thus, the response of the individual electrode in the array is indirectly altered, compared to that of cells growing on medium, by the addition of the antibiotic. by using three different antibiotics in separate wells, a unique fingerprint can be created for a specific bacterium. with the proposed dox-pca system, classification of bacteria was achieved at subspecies and strain level in real time. this study represents a basic research tool that may allow researchers to rapidly detect, quantify, and classify bacteria type at subspecies and strain levels.

TI  == raman spectroscopy and chemical imaging for quantification of filtered waterborne bacteria.
AB  == rapid and reliable assessment of pathogenic microbial contamination in water is critically important. in the present work we evaluated the suitability of raman spectroscopy and chemical imaging as enumeration techniques for waterborne pathogens. the prominent c-h stretching band observed between 2800-3000 cm(-1) of the spectrum is used for quantification purposes. this band provides the highest  intensity of the bacterial-spectrum bands facilitating the detection of low number of microorganisms. the intensity of the raman response correlates with number of cells present in drops of sample water on aluminum-coated slides. however, concentration of pathogens in drinking and recreational water is low, requiring a concentration step, i.e., filtering. subsequent evaluation of filtering approaches for water sampling for raman detection showed significant background signal from alumina and silver membranes that reduces method sensitivity. samples concentrated by filtration show good correlation between raman spectroscopy and other quantification methods including turbidity (r(2)=0.92), plate counts (r(2)=0.87) and dry weight (r(2)=0.97). background interferences did not allow for evaluation of this relationship at low cell concentrations.

TI  == efficient growth inhibition of bacillus anthracis by knocking out the ribonucleotide reductase tyrosyl radical.
AB  == bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is a worldwide problem because of the need for effective treatment of respiratory infections shortly after exposure. one potential key enzyme of b. anthracis to be targeted by antiproliferative drugs is ribonucleotide reductase. it provides deoxyribonucleotides for dna synthesis needed for spore germination and growth of the pathogen. we have cloned, purified, and characterized the tyrosyl radical-carrying nrdf component of b. anthracis class ib ribonucleotide reductase. its epr spectrum points to a hitherto unknown three-dimensional geometry of the radical side chain with a 60 degrees rotational angle of c(alpha)-(c(beta)-c(1))-plane of the aromatic ring. the unusual relaxation behavior of the radical signal and its apparent lack of line broadening at room temperature suggest a weak interaction with the nearby diiron site and the presence of a water molecule plausibly bridging the phenolic oxygen of the radical to a ligand of the diiron site. we show that b. anthracis cells are surprisingly resistant to the radical scavenger hydroxyurea in current use as an  antiproliferative drug, even though its nrdf radical is efficiently scavenged in  vitro. importantly, the antioxidants hydroxylamine and n-methyl hydroxylamine scavenge the radical several orders of magnitude faster and prevent b. anthracis  growth at several hundred-fold lower concentrations compared with hydroxyurea. phylogenetically, the b. anthracis nrdf protein clusters together with nrdfs from the pathogens bacillus cereus, bacillus thuringiensis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. we suggest the potential use of n-hydroxylamines in combination therapies against infections by b. anthracis and closely related pathogens.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

TI  == a study of the role of multiple site blood cultures in the evaluation of neonatal sepsis.
AB  == background: the optimal number of blood cultures needed to document sepsis in an  ill neonate has undergone little critical evaluation. multiple site cultures may  improve pathogen detection if intermittent bacteremia occurs, or if a low density of bacteria is present in the blood. we hypothesized, however, that bacterial clearance is slower and bacteremia more continuous in septic neonates, so that a  single site blood culture should be sufficient to accurately document true septicemia. objective: to determine the need for multiple site blood cultures in  the evaluation of neonates for sepsis. design/methods: clinical data were prospectively collected for 216 neonates who had 269 pairs of blood cultures taken from two different peripheral sites for the evaluation of possible sepsis.  a minimum of 1 ml of blood was obtained from the two peripheral sites within 15-30 min of each other. based on prior retrospective data, we determined that 203 infants would need to have two site blood cultures to demonstrate a significant improvement in pathogen detection at an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20 (80%) power. results: a total of 186 culture pairs were taken for evaluation of early-onset sepsis in 186 neonates, while 83 pairs were drawn for evaluation of late-onset sepsis in 43 neonates. in all, 21 neonates from the late-onset group were evaluated more than once, and 12 neonates were evaluated for both early- and late-onset sepsis. in all, 20 (9.2%) of 216 neonates had 22 episodes of culture-proven sepsis at a median age of 18 days. all neonates with positive cultures had the same organism with a similar sensitivity pattern obtained from the two different peripheral sites. the other 196 study neonates had negative blood cultures from both sites. the single episode of early-onset sepsis was caused by listeria monocytogenes, while all remaining episodes were late-onset with the following organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis (7), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (3), combined mrsa and candida albicans (2), candida albicans alone (2), late-onset group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gbs) (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), enterococcus fecalis (1), escherichia coli (1), and serratia marcescens (1). since no infant grew organisms from only one of the two sites, the data indicate that the diagnosis of sepsis would have been made correctly in all infants with a single site culture. conclusions: two site blood cultures for the initial evaluation of neonatal sepsis do not have a better yield in pathogen detection. sepsis in neonates can be detected with no loss of accuracy with a single site blood culture with blood  volume of>or=1 ml.

AB  == norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the south american bullfrog, leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. the primary structure of a  previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as gly-leu-leu-asp-thr-leu-lys-gly-ala-ala-lys-asn-val-val-gly-ser-leu-ala-ser-lys-v al-met-glu-lys-leu.nh2. the second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the caribbean mountain chicken frog l. fallax. pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus group b) but potencies were relatively low (mic values in the range 25-200 microm). the peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (ld50>400 microm).

TI  == bloodstream infections in pediatric patients.
AB  == objective: blood stream infection (bsi) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. this study aims to describe the clinical, microbiological characteristics and outcome of bsi in pediatric patients. methods: we collected the clinical data from all pediatric patients with positive blood cultures. we identified all isolates from these patients from january 2004  to december 2004 at king khalid university hospital (kkuh), riyadh, saudi arabia, and determined antimicrobial susceptibilities by microscan walk away 96 (dade behring inc., west sacramento, ca95691, usa). results: two hundred and twenty pediatric patients had bsi, of whom 147 (67%) were males and 71 (32.2%) were from intensive care units (icus). two hundred and ten (95.4%) had single blood culture isolate. one hundred and seventy-three (78.6%) of the isolates were gram positive bacteria and included the following: staphylococcus epidermidis (55.4%), staphylococcus aureus (9.5%) of which 14% were methicillin resistant, streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae) (4.5%), 40% of which were resistant to penicillin and enterococcus faecalis (4%). gram negative bacteria were 44 (20%) and included escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (k.pneumoniae) (3.6% each). three isolates (1.3%) were candida glabrata. none of the gram positive isolates were vancomycin resistant. three k.pneumoniae and one pseudomonas spp. isolates were multiresistant. one hundred and ninety-four (88%) of bsi isolates were hospital acquired. fever was the most common presentation of pediatric patients (26%) with positive blood culture with no apparent focus of infection. respiratory tract infections 26 (12%) were the next most common. we seen sepsis in (7.7%) children between 8 days and 6 months of age. bone and joint infections, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal diseases, malignancy and surgical cases were other associated clinical diagnoses of bsi in pediatric patients. patients with immuno- suppressive disorders with bsi had isolates such as salmonella spp., s. pneumoniae and pseudomonas spp. overall mortality was 13 (6%) (p<0.005) and those patients had underlying serious medical conditions with associated risk factors such as prolonged hospital stay, intensive care unit (icu) admission, indwelling  catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial use. conclusion:  bloodstream infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. risk factors for hospital acquired infection include: prematurity, prolonged hospitalization, icu admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == n,n-dichlorotaurine: chemical and bactericidal properties.
AB  == the biogenous antimicrobial agent n-chlorotaurine (nct) converts by disproportionation to n,n-dichlorotaurine (ndct) at a rate proportional to acidity. this occurs at appreciable amounts already in weakly acidic biological systems. to understand the consequences of ndct formation, a thorough investigation of this undescribed compound was mandatory, which needed its synthesis. differently from nct, this was possible in the aqueous system using trichloroisocyanuric acid. while the free acid, cl(2)hnch(2)ch(2)so(3)h, was not  available in pure form, its sodium and potassium salts were analytically pure and showed melting points (decomposition) of 125-128 degrees c (potassium) and 162-164 degrees c (sodium). the sodium salt demonstrated unexpected long-term stability even at room temperature (8.4 % loss of activity within 4 months). the  aqueous solutions of both salts exhibited a weak acid reaction, and they were less stable than nct. with regard to chlorination of amines (transhalogenation),  ndct was, surprisingly, less efficacious than nct, which manifested itself by a lack of reactivity at ph < 7, for which a mechanistic explanation is given. compared on a molar scale, ndct was more bactericidal than nct against the gram-negative bacteria e. coli, p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis, while there was no difference concerning the gram-positive ones, s. aureus and s. epidermidis. the increase of bactericidal activity at acidic ph was the same as observed with  nct and is attributed to a higher susceptibility of bacteria in this environment. taken together, ndct seems not to be suited to substitute nct as a preparation fit for medical practice.

TI  == antibacterial properties of ag nanoparticle loaded multilayers and formation of magnetically directed antibacterial microparticles.
AB  == antibacterial coatings based on hydrogen-bonded multilayers containing in situ synthesized ag nanoparticles were created on planar surfaces and on magnetic colloidal particles. we report the antibacterial properties of these coatings, determined using a disk-diffusion (kirby-bauer) test, as a function of the film thickness and the concentration of ag nanoparticles in the hydrogen-bonded multilayers. the zone of inhibition (zoi) determined by the disk-diffusion test increases as the thickness of the multilayer film is increased. results obtained  for the values of the zoi as a function of film thickness can be described adequately with a simple diffusion model (i.e., the square of the zone of inhibition (zoi) depended linearly on the logarithm of the thickness of the silver-loaded films). this observation suggests that, in order to incrementally increase the zoi, an exponentially increasing amount of ag is required within the multilayers. in general, there was no statistically significant correlation between the zone of inhibition and the number of ag loading and reduction cycles. the duration of sustained release of antibacterial ag ions from these coatings, however, could be prolonged by increasing the total supply of zerovalent silver in the films via multiple loading and reduction cycles. these results indicate that the release of silver is controlled by an oxidation mechanism at the surface of the nanoparticles and that repeated loading and reduction of silver leads preferentially to growth of the existing silver nanoparticles in the film as opposed to nucleation of new ag nanoparticles. we also show that magnetic microspheres coated with silver nanoparticle loaded hydrogen-bonded multilayer thin films can be used to deliver antibacterial agents to specific locations. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of nanocomposite coated microspheres was determined by the agar dilution technique: antibacterial magnetic microspheres with higher concentrations of ag nanoparticles exhibited lower mic values.

TI  == metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-af), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ab), and benzidine (bz). the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and intestinal anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay. in addition, the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome p450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (co) difference spectrum. this was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-af, 4-ab, and bz into mutagens. the metabolic activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome p450 enzyme. for those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a p450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.

TI  == [bacteriological study of chronic sinusitis].
AB  == objective: to explore the characteristics of bacteria isolated from patients with chronic sinusitis (cr) and antibiotic-resistance. methods: the purulent discharges taken from the maxillary sinus and posterior ethmoid sinus of 76 patients during endoscopic sinus surgery were cultured for both bacteria and fungi, then the antimicrobial susceptibility test and beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (beta-lpb) were detected. in the control group, the discharges from the  nasal cavity from 10 healthy adults were also cultured for bacteria. results: twenty species, including staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and streptococcus pneumoniae, were cultured from the testing group. the total positive rate of bacteria was 81.8%. the detectable rates of aerobe, anaerobe, gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria were 83.4%, 16.6%, 56.3% and 43.7%, respectively. the fungi was only detected in 1.4% patients. the antimicrobial susceptibility test demonstrated that imipenem, cefotaxime and amoxicillin-clavulanate were good in vitro activity to aerobic pathogens and metronidazole, imipenem and chloramphenicol was good to anaerobic pathogens. the  beta-lpb was detected in 37.7% strains in which staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and branhamella catarrhalis  were more frequent. five species including staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli etc were cultured from the control group. there was no significant difference of distribution of the same bacteria between the control group and the testing group (p > 0.05). conclusions: the pathogenic bacteria of cr mostly involve aerobes. the antibiotics-resistance of these pathogen is serious. the bacterial infection plays no leading role in cr, so the need of antibiotics should not be excessively emphasized. before treatment by antibiotics, the antimicrobial susceptibility test should be performed. the broad-spectrum antibiotics containing beta-lactamase inhibitor such as cefotaxime and amoxicillin-clavulanate is recommended in condition that the test can not be  finished.

TI  == identification of immunogenic and serum binding proteins of staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis is a commensal of human skin and a leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections. limited information is available about s. epidermidis proteins that are expressed upon transition to the bloodstream or those involved in host-pathogen interactions. a cell surface fraction from s. epidermidis 0-47 grown in rabbit serum to mimic environmental signals encountered during a bloodstream infection was separated by two-dimensional (2d) gel electrophoresis. following 2d separation, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and detected with either pooled sera generated in rabbits immunized with live s. epidermidis 0-47 or with biotin-labeled serum proteins eluted from the surface of bacteria grown in rabbit serum. twenty-nine immunoreactive or serum binding proteins of s. epidermidis were identified by mass spectrometry. twenty-seven of the corresponding genes were expressed in escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant proteins were used to immunize mice. in a preliminary screen, 12 of the 27 recombinant proteins induced a response that reduced the number of bacteria recovered from the spleen or bloodstream of infected mice. in subsequent vaccination studies, 5 of the 12 proteins resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the number of bacteria. the identification of five candidate vaccine antigens from the initial  screen of only 29 proteins demonstrates the utility of this approach.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

TI  == recombinant expression of indolicidin concatamers in escherichia coli.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are part of the innate immune system of vertebrates and invertebrates. they are active against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria,  fungi, and protozoa. currently, most antimicrobial peptides are extracted from host organisms or produced by solid-phase peptide synthesis. recombinant protein  expression in escherichia coli is a tool for greater production yields at a decreased cost and reduces the use of hazardous materials. we have constructed a  concatamer of indolicidin and successfully expressed a fusion product with thioredoxin in e. coli bl21de3. codons for methionine residues flanking individual indolicidin genes were incorporated for cyanogen bromide cleavage of the fusion protein and liberation of active monomeric indolicidin. peptide yields of 150 microg/l monomeric indolicidin were achieved in this first report of recombinant production of indolicidin with demonstrated antimicrobial activity.

TI  == implications of the changing pattern of bacterial infections following total joint replacements.
AB  == purpose: to retrospectively review the causative organisms isolated from infected hip and knee replacements requiring revision. methods: we reviewed a consecutive  series of 36 patients who underwent revision hip or knee arthroplasties due to bacterial infection at pamela youde nethersole eastern hospital in hong kong between 1995 and 2003. the male to female ratio was 1:2, and the mean age of patients was 70 years (range, 54-82 years). the mean duration of follow-up was 3.8 years (range, 1.1-8.3 years). no patient was lost to follow-up. all 14 revision knee patients had previously undergone cemented and patella-resurfacing  total knee arthroplasties. of the 22 revision hip patients, 9 had cementless, 6 had cemented, and 7 had hybrid total hip arthroplasties previously. results: none of the bacteria isolated from 1995 to 1996 were multiple-drug resistant. subsequently, however, most of the isolates were multiple-drug resistant, with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) being the most common. half of the isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli demonstrated multiple-drug resistance. the incidence of positive culture in revision hip patients was 59%, 46% of which were mrsa. all 13 revision hips with positive cultures showed chronic sepsis: 4 occurred within one year and 10 occurred 2 or more years after the index arthroplasty. the incidence of positive culture in revision knee patients was 57%, 46% of which were mrsa. all 8 revision knees with positive cultures showed chronic sepsis: 3 occurred within one year, 5 occurred 2 or more years after the index arthroplasty. only one patient, who was infected with gram-negative bacilli, required a second revision for residual sepsis. harris hip scores for the revision hip patients improved from a mean of 65 (range, 55-75) to 85 (range, 75-90). knee society knee scores of the revision knee patients improved from a mean of 68 (range, 55-75) to 80 (range, 70-85). there were no radiological signs suggestive of loosening in the 2 groups at the latest follow-up. conclusion: this study found a definite increase in multiple-drug-resistant bacteria isolated from periprosthetic infections around total hip and knee prostheses.

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

AB  == the reaction of salicylaldehyde with 1-phenyl-1-methyl-3-(2-chloro-1-oxoethyl) cyclobutane (1) and potassium carbonate was used to prepare (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl) methanone (2) for the starting reagent purposes. (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) was synthesized from the reaction of the compound (2) with hidroxylamine. new derivatives of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) such  as, o-glycidylketoxime (4) and o-phenylacylketoxime (5a-c) were obtained very high yields. alkyl, allyl and aryl substituted n-oxime ethers (6a-e) were obtained from the reaction compound 3 and various halogen contained compounds. the syntheses of the compounds (7a-f) were carried out from the reaction of the compound (4) and different amines such as, isopropyl amine, natrium azide, morpholine and piperazine. all of the synthesized compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis atcc 14153 and candida albicans atcc 10231. among the synthesized compounds (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl)-o-[2-hydroxy-3-(n-methylpiperazino)] propylketoxime (7d) was found the most active derivative against s. aureus atcc 6538. the compounds 2, 5b, 6b,  6c, 7b and 7f showed very strong and the same antimicrobial effect against c. albicans atcc 10231. similarly (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl)-o-benzylketoxime 6a showed good antimicrobial effect against c. albicans atcc 10231. none of the other compounds  exhibited activity against the other test microorganisms.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == rapid diagnosis of bacterial sepsis with pcr amplification and microarray hybridization in 16s rrna gene.
AB  == in this study, blood culture and pcr-microarray analysis were used to examine 172 cases of suspected septicemia. primers and oligonucleotide probes, based on the sequences of bacterial 16srrna gene, were arrayed by imprinting on microarray slides. blood specimens collected from 172 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and then tested separately by pcr for the bacterial 16s rrna. of the 172 clinical cases, 17 cases tested positive by pcr. the number of positives identified by pcr (9.88%) was significantly higher than the number of positives identified by the blood culture (4.65%). when blood culture was used as control,  the sensitivity of pcr was 100%, the specificity was 97.85%, and the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.979. when the 17 pcr positive specimens were further analyzed by hybridization against the microarrays, five were found to be probe positive for e. coli, four were positive for s. epidermidis, four were positive for cons, and two were positive for bacillus and propionibacterium, respectively. in the eight specimens showing positive results by both pcr and blood culture, the species determined by microarray analysis corresponded with the result obtained from blood culture. detection of the bacterial 16srrna genes in clinical specimens by pcr and microarray analysis can be used to accurately diagnose neonatal sepsis. this method has a higher sensitivity and specificity than blood  culture and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

TI  == antibacterial activity of clonidine and neostigmine in vitro.
AB  == we conducted an in vitro study to investigate the antibacterial activity of clonidine and neostigmine on common microorganisms encountered during infectious  complications after regional anesthesia. standardized suspensions of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli were incubated during 1, 3, 6, and 24 h at 37 degrees c with concentrations of 37.5, 75, and 150 microg/ml of clonidine and 125, 250, and 500 microg/ml of neostigmine. after 24 h incubation at 37 degrees c, the colony counts were compared by two-way analysis of variance. the mean colony counts for s. aureus decreased significantly from control as the exposure to clonidine increased (p <  0.05), with a approximately 100% kill at 6 h for the largest concentration (150 microg/ml) and at 24 h for the intermediate concentration (75 microg/ml). similar results were observed for s. epidermidis, with a approximately 100% kill at 6 h for the largest concentrations (75 and 150 microg/ml). no bactericidal activity of clonidine was observed for e. coli and no bactericidal activity of neostigmine was observed for any of the tested strains. in the conditions of this experiment, clonidine, but not neostigmine, exhibited a concentration-dependent and time-dependent bactericidal activity in vitro on the microorganisms most frequently encountered in infectious complications after regional anesthesia.

TI  == structure--antimicrobial activity of some natural isocoumarins and their analogues.
AB  == three naturally occurring isocoumarins (paepalantine, paepalantine 9-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside and paepalantine 9-o-beta-d-allopyranosyl(1 --> 6) glucopyranoside) and two semi-synthetic analogues, 9,10-acylated compound and 9-oh-10-methylated compound, structurally similar to paepalantine, were evaluated for antimicrobial activity using a spectrophotometric microdilution technique. the paepalantine was active against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and e. faecalis while the other four compounds proved ineffective against all microorganisms tested at concentrations of 500 microg/ml. variations in phenolic substitution at oh-9 and/or oh-10 in the paepalantine molecule resulted in compounds without antimicrobial activity. a combination of structural features, two phenolic groups as cathecolic system, forms an oxygenated system arrangement that may reflect the potentially antimicrobial properties of paepalantine.

TI  == bacterial contamination of test stimulation leads during percutaneous nerve stimulation.
AB  == objectives: to analyze the bacterial contamination of conventional percutaneous nerve stimulation (pne) leads. sacral neuromodulation has become an important tool for the treatment of urgency and chronic retention. patients likely to benefit from this type of therapy are identified by pne testing before implantation of the definitive system. recently, a new system was introduced, using a self-blocking electrode that remains in place for both pne testing and final implantation. pne testing warrants an extracorporeal stimulator. thus, using the same electrode for both external stimulation and definitive implantation may carry a significant risk of infection. methods: bilateral pne testing was performed in 11 consecutive patients (8 women and 3 men, mean age 41.6 years) for either urgency (n = 7) or chronic retention (n = 4). electrodes were placed under aseptic conditions and stimulated for 3 days. at the end of each test, the electrodes were removed and evaluated microbiologically. results:  in 5 of the 11 patients (9 of 22 leads), significant bacterial growth was detected: staphylococcus epidermidis in 5, escherichia coli in 3, and enterococcus faecalis in 1. however, no patient showed signs of inflammation at the electrode insertion sites. conclusions: bacterial growth was found in 45.5% of the patients after conventional pne testing under aseptic conditions. therefore, the new electrodes may well carry an elevated risk of infection. infection of the implant can lead to major surgical revision or even explantation. thus, additional studies of the infection risk of this new electrode are warranted before its general use can be recommended.

TI  == vascular graft infections: in vitro and in vivo investigations of a new vascular  graft with long-term protection.
AB  == we investigated a polyester vascular prosthesis (pet) coated with elemental silver (sc). measurement of silver release over a period of 52 weeks by means of  inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry of pet with (pet-g) and without (pet-n) gelatine impregnation revealed a silver release on the first day  of 1.2 +/- 0.2 microg (pet-n) and 1.2 +/- 0.1 microg (pet-g) (calculated for 1 g  of prosthesis); from the 90th day onward, it was between 0.22 +/- 0.14 microg (pet-n) and 0.18 +/- 0.12 microg (pet-g) per day. the prostheses were incubated with staphylococcus aureus (s.a.), staphylococcus epidermidis (s.e.), or escherichia coli (e.c.) to investigate in vitro antibacterial efficacy. after 6 h of incubation, no colony-forming units were to be seen for any of the bacterial suspensions for pet with sc (p < 0.001). to investigate in vivo antibacterial efficacy, pet-g rings with and without sc contaminated with s.a., s.e., or e.c. were implanted in 18 albino rabbits and examined 7 days after agar culture for 48 h. the silver coating was associated with a significant reduction in bacterial growth (s.a., p = 0.001; s.e., p < 0.005; e.c., p < 0.001). the silver-coated prosthesis, with and without gelatine impregnation, had a significantly antibacterial effect with continuous release of silver.

TI  == a novel peptide screened by phage display can mimic trap antigen epitope against  staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen. pathogenic effects are largely due to production of bacterial toxins, whose synthesis is controlled by an mrna molecule termed rnaiii. the s. aureus protein called rap (rnaiii-activating protein) is secreted and activates rnaiii production by inducing the phosphorylation of its target protein trap (target of rap). antibodies to trap have been shown to suppress exotoxin production by s. aureus in vitro, suggesting that trap may be a useful vaccine target site. here we showed that a peptide ta21 was identified by screening a phage display library using anti-trap antibodies. mice vaccinated with escherichia coli engineered to express ta21 on their surface (fta21) were protected from s. aureus infections, using sepsis and cellulitis mice models. by sequence analysis, it was found that the ta21 is highly homologous to the c-terminal sequence of trap which is conserved among s. aureus  and staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that peptide ta21 may be a useful broad vaccine to protect from infection caused by various staphylococcal strains.

TI  == correlation between the activities of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and hydrophobicities represented as rp hplc retention times.
AB  == ptp7 is a 13-amino acid residue peptide designed from gaegurin 6, an antimicrobial peptide isolated from skin secretions of rana rugosa. in order to examine the effect of hydrophobicity on antimicrobial activity, a series of ptp7  derivatives were constructed and analyzed the activity against bacteria and artificial membrane. we found that the mean hydrophobicity by simple summation of hydrophobicity of each constituent amino acid did not necessarily describe the hydrophobic property of antimicrobial peptides. the mean hydrophobicity did not show close correlation with the observed hydrophobicity by measuring reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (rp hplc) retention time. the observed hydrophobicity represented as rp hplc retention time correlated well with the activity against artificial membrane and gram positive bacterial species, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and micrococcus luteus, rather than mean hydrophobicity. however, antimicrobial activity against gram negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, did not show correlation with rp hplc retention time. these data indicate that the rp hplc retention time should be exploited rather than the mean hydrophobicity in the analysis of the relationship between hydrophobicity and antimicrobial activity.

TI  == chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different anatolian propolis samples.
AB  == propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. it is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. the aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from four different anatolian propolis samples and examined whether eep inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. for the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mic) were determined by using macrodilution method. the mic values of the most effective propolis (tb) were 2 microg/ml for streptococcus sobrinus and enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for micrococcus luteus, candida albicans and c. krusei, 8 microg/ml for streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for escherichia coli and c. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the chemical compositions of eep's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. the main compounds of four anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. although propolis samples were collected from different regions of anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the gram positive bacteria and yeasts. propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and c. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.

TI  == synthesis and characterization of polymeric soybean oil-g-methyl methacrylate (and n-butyl methacrylate) graft copolymers: biocompatibility and bacterial adhesion.
AB  == peroxidation, epoxidation, and/or perepoxidation reactions of soybean oil under air at room temperature resulted in cross-linked polymeric soybean oil peroxides  on the surface along with the waxy soluble part, spsb, with a molecular weight of 4690, containing up to 2.3 wt % peroxide. this soluble polymeric oil peroxide, spsb, initiated the free radical polymerization of either methyl methacrylate (mma) or n-butyl methacrylate (nbma) to give psb-g-pmma and psb-g-pnbma graft copolymers. the polymers obtained were characterized by (1)h nmr, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and gel permeation chromatography techniques. polymeric oil as a plasticizer lowered the glass transition of the psb-g-pmma graft copolymers. psb-g-pmma and psb-g-pnbma graft copolymer film samples were also used in cell culture studies. fibroblast and macrophage cells were strongly adhered and spread on the copolymer film surfaces, which is important in tissue engineering. bacterial adhesion on psb-g-pmma graft  copolymer was also studied. both staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli  adhered on the graft copolymer better than on homo-pmma. furthermore, the latter  adhered much better than the former.

AB  == the deposition of organic monolayers containing quaternary ammonium groups has been shown by many authors to confer biocidal properties on a large variety of solid surfaces. in a search for the controlling factors, the authors have grafted quaternized poly(vinylpyridine) chains on glass surfaces by two different methods and varied the charge density within the organic layer between 10(12) and 10(16)  positive charges per cm2. the measurements show that this parameter has a large influence on the killing efficiency. bacterial death occurs in less than 10 min in the quiescent state above a threshold value. the value is smaller for bacteria in the growth state. it also depends on the bacterial type. an electrostatic mechanism based on the exchange of counterions between the functionalized cationic surface and the bacterial membrane is proposed and appears consistent with the results.

TI  == photodynamic effects of novel xf porphyrin derivatives on prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
AB  == the worldwide rise in the rates of antibiotic resistance of bacteria underlines the need for alternative antibacterial agents. a promising approach to the killing of gram-positive antibiotic-resistant bacteria of the skin uses light in  combination with a photosensitizer to induce a phototoxic reaction. different concentrations (0 to 100 microm) of porphyrin-based photosensitizers (ctp1, xf70, and xf73) and different incubation times (5 min, 1 h, and 4 h) were used to determine phototoxicity against two methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, one methicillin-sensitive s. aureus strain, one methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis strain, one escherichia coli strain, and human keratinocytes and fibroblasts. incubation with 0.005 microm xf70 or xf73, followed by illumination, yielded a 3-log10 (> or = 99.9%) decrease in the viable cell numbers of all staphylococcal strains, indicating that the xf drugs have high degrees of potency against gram-positive bacteria and also that the activities of these novel drugs are independent of the antibiotic resistance pattern of the staphylococci examined. ctp1 was less potent against the staphylococci under the same conditions. at 0.005 microm, xf70 and xf73 demonstrated no toxicity toward fibroblasts or keratinocytes. no inactivation of  e. coli was detected at this concentration. xf73 was confirmed to act via a reactive oxygen species from the results of studies with sodium azide (a quencher of singlet oxygen), which reduced the killing of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic  cells. when a quencher of superoxide anion and the hydroxyl radical was used, cell killing was not inhibited. these results demonstrate that the porphyrin-based photosensitizers had concentration-dependent differences in their efficacies of killing of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal strains via reactive oxygen species without harming eukaryotic cells at the same concentrations.

AB  == all beta-lactam sensitive bacteria contain enzymatic penicillin binding proteins  (pbps), which are membrane-bound enzymes and targets of beta-lactam antibiotics.  in this work evaluation of the significance of pbps in immune response to benzylpenicillin was presented. 35 patients with allergic reactions to penicillin and 17 subjects without penicillin allergy, but exposed, were studied. proliferative t-cell responses to benzylpenicillin, penicillin and pbps conjugates (pc-pbps) from e. coli, k. oxytoca, s. aureus, s. epidermidis or serum protein (pc-s) were measured. although each allergic individual responds to pc-pbps in several different ways, specific proliferation of t lymphocytes with pc-pbps from bacterial membranes was significant higher than with pc or pc-s. this observation gives us a real insight into the causes of the drug allergy: individual allergic reaction and susceptibility to the drug is in strict correlation with bacterial infection. it seems likely that acylation of pbps could be the trigger for primary immune response to the hapten benzylpenicillin.

TI  == cd40 ligand (cd154) takes part in regulation of the transition to mononuclear cell dominance during peritonitis.
AB  == background: cd40 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (tnf) family of receptors whose ligand (cd154) is found mainly on membranes of activated mononuclear cells. cd154-cd40 cross-linking is a central event in antigen presentation, b-cell activation, and regulation of cytokine and chemokine secretion from various types of cells. we have previously demonstrated in vitro the presence of cd40 on human peritoneal mesothelial cells (pmc) and have also shown that cd40 ligation synergizes with interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) to up-regulate cc chemokine secretion from these cells. the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of cd40 ligation in leukocyte recruitment during peritonitis. methods: peritonitis was induced in mice by bacterial inoculation, cd40 levels were analyzed on pmc by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and immunohistochemistry. cd154 levels on leukocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry and rt-pcr. chemokines mrna levels were analyzed by rt-pcr. cd154 was blocked in vivo using monoclonal antibodies. results. in mice inoculated by staphylococcus epidermidis or escherichia coli, cd40 in pmc increased twofold at 24 hours and cd154 was induced and reached a peak at 48 hours. in both gram-positive and gram-negative-peritonitis, peritoneal macrophages were the main peritoneal leukocyte population to express cd154. similar results were observed in human subjects during peritonitis. injection of  cd154 blocking monoclonal antibody (mr1) reduced the mononuclear infiltrate by 50% and had no effect on granulocyte recruitment 48 hours after inoculation of s. epidermidis. conclusion: our data suggest that cd40 plays a significant role in the process of the mononuclear infiltration during peritonitis.

TI  == induction of inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide in j774.2 cells and murine macrophages by lipoteichoic acid and related cell wall antigens from staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis causes infections associated with medical devices including central venous catheters, orthopaedic prosthetic joints and artificial  heart valves. this coagulase-negative staphylococcus produces a conventional cellular lipoteichoic acid (lta) and also releases a short-glycerophosphate-chain-length form of lta (previously termed lipid s) into  the medium during growth. the relative pro-inflammatory activities of cellular and short-chain-length exocellular lta were investigated in comparison with peptidoglycan and wall teichoic acid from s. epidermidis and lps from escherichia coli o111. the ability of these components to stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6 and tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha] and nitric oxide was investigated in a murine macrophage-like cell line (j774.2), and in peritoneal and splenic macrophages. on a weight-for-weight basis the short-chain-length exocellular lta was the most active of the s. epidermidis products, stimulating significant amounts of each of the inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide, although it was approximately 100-fold less active than lps from e. coli. by comparison the full-chain-length cellular lta and peptidoglycan were less active and the wall teichoic acid had no activity. as an exocellular product potentially released from s. epidermidis biofilms, the short-chain-length exocellular lta may act as the prime mediator of the host inflammatory response to device-related infection by this organism and act as the gram-positive equivalent of lps in gram-negative sepsis. the understanding of the role of short-chain-length exocellular lta in gram-positive  sepsis may lead to improved treatment strategies.

AB  == objectives: although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely  clarified. using n-chlorotaurine (nct), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. it was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. methods: pathogens were incubated in nct, which was subsequently washed off. the oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. results: superficial chlorination in the form of covalent n-cl bonds to staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. for s. aureus, 3 min incubation with nct produced a cover of  3.3 x 10(-16) mol cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. the kind of microorganism, coating time, ph, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. the relative cover strength on  s. aureus by nct, chloramine t, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or n,n-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees c (>8 h at 1 degrees c), even  without a reduction of cfu. however, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal nh(2)cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. conclusions: the chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. furthermore, it may be a decisive  step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.

TI  == survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  == in 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  we assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints recommended by the national committee  for clinical standards (nccls). methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the most common gram-positive species was enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (bls), fluoroquinolones (fqs), and tetracyclines (tcs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. the proportion of fq-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). all the esbl-producing strains (esbls) possess resistance to fqs. over 95% of klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. the distribution of antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and  an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among proteus species. no esbl-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from serratia marcescens. this survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of esbl-producing or fqs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == enhanced biofilm-production in pathogens isolated from patients with rare metabolic disorders.
AB  == biofilm-producing bacteria were isolated from the urine of 19 patients with very  rare metabolic disorders including: hyperlactacidaemia (8 cases), sugar intolerance and gammopathy (1 case), cystinuria (2 cases), parkinson's disease (1 case), lipidaemia (2 cases), hyperaminoaciduria (1 case) and others (4 cases). a  total of 34 strains were collected, gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms were equally distributed among the slime-producing bacteria, with  a prevalence of staphylococcus epidermidis (30%) the most frequent microorganism  isolated together with escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis that accounted for  15% of this group of strains. a quantitative assay of the biofilm production revealed that in gram-positive pathogens it was three times greater than that observed in bacteria collected from patients not affected by metabolic diseases (p = 0.0001). in gram-negative strains the biofilm synthesis was 2.2 times higher than those detected in the same bacteria isolated in the absence of metabolic disorders (p = 0.0033). the results observed indicate that biofilm production is  enhanced in bacteria isolated from the urine of patients with metabolic disorders. it is suggested that unusual metabolites might facilitate pathogen production of biofilm found in the urine of these patients.

TI  == [a 7-year survey of strains identified in blood cultures in a clinical hematology unit].
AB  == goal: this study had for aim to analyze the epidemiology of strains identified in blood cultures (hopital d'instruction des armees percy, clamart, france, hematology unit) to compare the rate of identified micro-organisms with literature data, and to search for a possible correlation between antibiotherapy  management and evolution of resistance profiles. material and methods: all the micro-organisms (n = 690) collected over seven years (january 1996 to december 2002), from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in conventional and sterile sector were studied. results: gram positive cocci rate (gpc) was 62.6% and gram negative bacilli (gnb) 31.3%. evolution in time showed a decrease of gpc and an increase of gnb, notably the non fermenting gram negative bacilli, leading to an  equal rate by 2001-2002. the most frequently identified species were staphylococcus epidermidis (36.4%), escherichia coli (8.7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.8%), and staphylococcus aureus (4.9%). the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococci was 63.6%. fifty-five percent of e. coli strains had a penicillinase phenotype. pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance was 8.5, 8.5, 6.4 and 8.5%, respectively for ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and amikacin. conclusion: this study showed a tendency to inversion of  former bacteremia epidemiology with increasing negative gram bacilli. it justifies the antibiotherapy protocols adopted in the hematology unit.

TI  == in vitro exposure of bacteria to antimicrobial impregnated-central venous catheters does not directly lead to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == objective: use of central venous catheters (cvcs) impregnated with minocycline and rifampin reduces the density of bacterial growth on catheters and decreases the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections. questions have been raised over the possibility that the use of these catheters will lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. in this study, we sought to determine if in vitro exposure of four test organisms to catheter segments impregnated with minocycline and rifampin would lead to the development of antibiotic resistance. methods: catheter segments (1.0 cm) were placed on the surface of agar plates previously inoculated with bacterial suspensions, such that a subconfluent lawn of colony growth would be apparent after 24 h incubation at 35 degrees c in air. test organisms included american type culture collection  strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. zones of inhibition of colony growth surrounding catheters were measured at 24-h intervals up to 7 days  (two catheter segments per test). colonies on agar surfaces located at varying distances from catheter segments were examined for minocycline and rifampin resistance following various periods of exposure (six catheter segments per test). in addition, selected colonies were subsequently exposed to minocycline and rifampin in broth and examined for selection of minocycline and rifampin resistance (> 28 colonies per selection test). results: inhibitory zones of 14 to 47 mm were observed with s aureus, s epidermidis, e faecalis, and e coli. growth  of p aeruginosa was not inhibited by cvc segments. testing of colonies of the first four organisms at various distances from cvc segments after varying periods of exposure revealed only a single instance of the emergence of resistance (eg, s aureus vs rifampin). recovery of resistant clones was enhanced with minocycline and rifampin broth selection; however, a direct link between cvc exposure and the emergence of resistance was not established. conclusions: our in vitro data suggest that the exposure of gram-positive cocci to either rifampin or minocycline can lead to the development of resistance. however, exposure of bacteria to these antibiotics in combination does not directly lead to resistance. clinical investigations will be required to determine the true risk and implications of the development of resistance.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == objective: to explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  methods: (1) the primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16srrna gene. the gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. the gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, gram positive bacterial probe, gram negative bacterial probe 1, gram negative bacterial probe 2, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) 1, cons 2, escherichia coli, hemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus, meningococcus, corynebacterium, propionibacterium; (2) blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16s rrna gene was detected separately; dna isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by pcr, and pcr products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. results: (1) of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by pcr and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (p < 0.01). when blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of pcr was 100% and specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) the 17 specimens which showed positive results by pcr were further hybridized on the gene chip. all were positive by universal probes. among all of them, 5 were positive by e. coli probe; 4 were positive by staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by bacillus and propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by cons. the 8 specimens which showed positive results by both pcr and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. conclusion: detection of the bacterial 16srrna genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia  rapidly. this method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical  in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

TI  == two novel real-time reverse transcriptase pcr assays for rapid detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == the incidence of platelet bacterial contamination is approximately 1 per 2,000 units and has been acknowledged as the most frequent infectious risk from transfusion. in preliminary studies, the sterility of platelet concentrates (pcs) was tested with an automated bacterial blood culturing system and molecular genetic assays. two real-time reverse transcriptase pcr (rt-pcr) assays performed in a lightcycler instrument were developed and compared regarding specificity and sensitivity by the use of different templates to detect the majority of the clinically important bacterial species in platelets. primers and probes specific  for the conserved regions of the eubacterial 23s rrna gene or the groel gene (encoding the 60-kda heat shock protein hsp60) were designed. during the development of the 23s rrna rt-pcr, problems caused by the contamination of reagents with bacterial dna were noted. treatment with 8-methoxypsoralen and uv irradiation reduced the level of contaminating dna. the sensitivity of the assays was greatly influenced by the enzyme system which was used. with rtth dna polymerase in a one-enzyme system, we detected 500 cfu of escherichia coli or staphylococcus epidermidis/ml. with a two-enzyme system consisting of moloney murine leukemia virus rt and taq dna polymerase, we detected 16 cfu/ml. with groel mrna as the target of rt-pcr under optimized conditions, we detected 125 cfu of e. coli/ml, and no problems with false-positive results caused by reagent  contamination or a cross-reaction with human nucleic acids were found. furthermore, the use of mrna as an indicator of viability was demonstrated. here  we report the application of novel real-time rt-pcr assays for the detection of bacterial contamination of pcs that are appropriate for transfusion services.

AB  == thermotoga maritima, a fermentative, anaerobic, hyperthermophilic bacterium, was  found to attach to bioreactor glass walls, nylon mesh, and polycarbonate filters  during chemostat cultivation on maltose-based media at 80 degrees c. a whole-genome cdna microarray was used to examine differential expression patterns between biofilm and planktonic populations. mixed-model statistical analysis revealed differential expression (twofold or more) of 114 open reading frames in  sessile cells (6% of the genome), over a third of which were initially annotated  as hypothetical proteins in the t. maritima genome. among the previously annotated genes in the t. maritima genome, which showed expression changes during biofilm growth, were several that corresponded to biofilm formation genes identified in mesophilic bacteria (i.e., pseudomonas species, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus epidermidis). most notably, t. maritima biofilm-bound cells exhibited increased transcription of genes involved in iron and sulfur transport, as well as in biosynthesis of cysteine, thiamine, nad, and isoprenoid side chains of quinones. these findings were all consistent with the up-regulation of iron-sulfur cluster assembly and repair functions in biofilm cells. significant up-regulation of several beta-specific glycosidases was also noted in biofilm cells, despite the fact that maltose was the primary carbon source fed to the chemostat. the reasons for increased beta-glycosidase levels are unclear but are  likely related to the processing of biofilm-based polysaccharides. in addition to revealing insights into the phenotype of sessile t. maritima communities, the methodology developed here can be extended to study other anaerobic biofilm formation processes as well as to examine aspects of microbial ecology in hydrothermal environments.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 13 institutions in japan were supplied between august  2002 and july 2003. the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. of them, 578 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the investigation. the number of them was 578 strains consisting of 177 gram-positive bacterial strains (30.6%) and 401 gram-negative bacterial strains (69.4%). against staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (vcm) showed a strong activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 1 microg/ml. the susceptibility of staphylococcus epidermidis to cephems including cefotiam (ctm)  was relatively good. against enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (abpc), imipenem (ipm), and vcm showed the strongest antibacterial activity (mic90: 2-4 microg/ml). in addition, the low sensitive strains (mic: > or = 256 microg/ml) to clarithromycin (cam) were detected at 48.3% but none to cefozopran (czop). the antibacterial activity of cephems to escherichia coli was generally good, and especially czop and cefpirome (cpr) showed the highest activity (mic90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). quinolone resistant e. coli was detected at frequency of 13.5%, which was higher than that in the last year. the antibacterial activity of cephems to citrobacter freundii was generally low but czop and cpr had a strong acitivity (mic90: 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). the antibacterial activity of cephems to klebsiella pneumoniae was good and especially cefmenoxime  (cmx), cefixime (cfix), flomoxef (fmox), cpr, and czop showed stronger activity (mic90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). against serratia marcescens, meropenem (mepm) had the highest antibacterial activity followed by cpr and czop. against proteus  mirabilis, cmx, ceftazidime (caz), cpr, mepm, carumonam (crmn), and levofloxacin  (lvfx) showed the strongest activity (mc90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). among other  cephems, czop and cfix were also strong (mic90: 0.25 microg/ml). the antibacterial activity of the drugs to pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low,  and mic90 of all the drugs were ranged from 64 to > or = 256 microg/ml except ipm and amikacin (amk) having 16 microg/ml. the antibacterial activity of czop was relatively good (mic50: 8 microg/ml).

TI  == improved laboratory diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections in patients with hematological malignancies using pcr and ribosomal rna sequence analysis.
AB  == during october 1999 to november 2000, 98 blood culture specimens from the same number of febrile episodes originating from 49 patients with hematological malignancies were examined for the presence of eubacteria and fungi based on 16s  rrna gene and the 5.8, 18 and 28s rrna combined with in vitro pcr amplification and sequencing, in addition to conventional blood culture laboratory techniques.  nineteen of the samples were associated with positive blood cultures. eubacterial (16s rrna) pcr detected bacterial dna in 26 febrile episodes, i.e. in an additional 7 febrile episodes than blood-culture alone. the species identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing were as follows staphylococcus spp (n = 6), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), acinetobacter spp (n = 5), escherichia coli (n = 2), enterobacter agglomerans (n = 2), campylobacter spp (n = 1), citrobacter spp (n = 1), corynebacterium spp (n = 1), enterobacter faecium (n = 1), ralstonia spp (n = 1), acidovorax spp. (n = 1) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). gram-positive bacteria were found in 12/27 (44.6%) and gram-negative bacteria were found in 15/27 (55.6%). after optimization of a pcr-based fungal detection method, none of the febrile episodes were shown to be attributable to fungi. the  results of this study suggest that fungi are not common causal agents of febrile  episodes in patients with a hematological malignancy at this centre and that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of causal agents of bacteremia in patients, so that appropriate antibiotic regimens may be  commenced in patients with culture-negative episodes of infection.

TI  == newer carbapenems for urinary tract infections.
AB  == four carbapenems have been available clinically in japan. these are imipenem/cilastatin (imip/cs) and panipenem/ betamipron (pani/bp) of the older compounds and newer carbapenems such as biapem (biap) and meropenem (mero). the latter compounds are relatively stable to dehydropeptidase-1 (dhp-1) and have been reported to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the earlier carbapenems. the antimicrobial activity of these four carbapenems against fresh urinary isolates showed high activities against enterobacteriacae such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli containing the class c-beta-lactamase- and extended spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl)-producing strains compared to piperacillin (pipc) and ceftazidime (ctaz).  against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the carbapenems, with the exception of panipenem  showed strong antimicrobial activities compared to pipc and ctaz. high activities were also seen against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, but methicillin-resistant strains were not affected.  the first generation carbapenems showed better activity against e. faecalis than  newer carbapenems. all four carbapenems were similar in clinical effectiveness in double blind trials for complicated urinary tract infections (utis). however, pani/bp is less effective in utis caused by p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. mero showed better eradication rate of p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. retrospective analysis of treated cases using carbapenems showed a rapid defervescence in the treatment of febrile complicated utis, which were mainly caused by mixed infection of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, especially those involving p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis.

TI  == determination of the critical concentration of neutrophils required to block bacterial growth in tissues.
AB  == we showed previously that the competition between bacterial killing by neutrophils and bacterial growth in stirred serum-containing suspensions could be modeled as the competition between a first-order reaction (bacterial growth) and  a second-order reaction (bacterial killing by neutrophils). the model provided a  useful parameter, the critical neutrophil concentration (cnc), below which bacterial concentration increased and above which it decreased, independent of the initial bacterial concentration. we report here that this model applies to neutrophil killing of bacteria in three-dimensional fibrin matrices and in rabbit dermis. we measured killing of 10(3)-10(8) colony forming units/ml staphylococcus epidermidis by 10(5)-10(8) human neutrophils/ml in fibrin gels. the cnc was approximately 4 x 10(6) neutrophils/ml gel in the presence of normal serum and approximately 1.6 x 10(7) neutrophils/ml gel in the presence of c5-deficient serum. application of our model to published data of others on killing of approximately 5 x 10(7) to 2 x 10(8) e. coli/ml rabbit dermis yielded cncs from approximately 4 x 10(6) to approximately 8 x 10(6) neutrophils/ml dermis. thus, in disparate tissues and tissuelike environments, our model fits the kinetics of  bacterial killing and gives similar lower limits (cncs) to the neutrophil concentration required to control bacterial growth.

TI  == antibody-directed photodynamic therapy of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a world-wide public health  problem, causing nosocomial and community-acquired infections. furthermore, mrsa  is increasingly resistant to many conventional antimicrobials, so there is a real need to develop alternative approaches for mrsa decolonization and treatment. previously, we have demonstrated that mrsa can be killed with an immunoglobulin g (igg)-snce6 conjugate and red light, but effectiveness was dependent on the particular strain and the growth phase. in this investigation, we used an antibody raised against mrsa to make an ab-snce6 conjugate capable of targeting many mrsa strains in all growth phases. to suspensions of important epidemic mrsa, each grown to stationary, lag, or exponential phase, the ab-snce6 conjugate was added and samples exposed to red light. survivors were then enumerated. this  treatment was very effective at killing all the different mrsa strains tested, in all growth phases. the ab-snce6 conjugate was able to kill emrsa-16 selectively in a mixed suspension of emrsa-16 and escherichia coli, and was much better at killing emrsa-16 than a coagulase-negative staphylococcus, s. epidermidis. these  results demonstrate that photodynamic therapy of mrsa is very effective when the  photosensitizer is targeted to the pathogen using a suitable antibody and may be  a good candidate for a novel treatment of mrsa infections.

AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

AB  == three peptides, ygaa[kkaakaa](2) (akk), klfkrhlkwkii (sc4), and yg[akakaaka](2) (kak), were conjugated with lauric acid and tested for the effect on their structure, antibacterial activity, and eukaryotic cell toxicity. the conjugated akk and sc4 peptides showed increased antimicrobial activity relative to unconjugated peptides, but the conjugated kak peptide did not. the circular dichroism spectrum of akk showed a significantly larger increase in its alpha-helical content in the conjugated form than peptide kak in a solution containing phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphotidylglycerol vesicles, which mimics bacterial membranes. the kak and akk peptides and their corresponding fatty acid  conjugates showed little change in their structure in the presence of phosphatidylcholine vesicles, which mimic the cell membrane of eukaryotic cells.  the hemolytic activity of the kak and akk peptides and conjugates was low. however, the sc4 fatty acid conjugate showed a large increase in hemolytic activity and a corresponding increase in helical content in the presence of phosphatidylcholine vesicles. these results support the model of antimicrobial peptide hemolytic and antimicrobial activity being linked to changes in secondary structure as the peptides interact with lipid membranes. fatty acid conjugation may improve the usefulness of peptides as antimicrobial agents by enhancing their ability to form secondary structures upon interacting with the bacterial membranes.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 899 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1500 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 158 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 28 medical institutions during 2002 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mepm was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. mic90 of mepm against pseudomonas aeruginosa was the lowest of the drugs tested. mepm showed low cross-resistant rate against both imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa. mepm was active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse). 2. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in escherichia coli and 1.9% (2 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae. carbapenems including mepm were active against these esbl strains. in conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem; at present, 7 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == kidney transplants from infected donors: our experience.
AB  == organ procurement from infected donors may transmit a disease to the recipient that could cause a graft loss and/or recipient morbidity. retrospectively, all kidney transplants from infected donors at our center in the last 4 years were reviewed. a donor was considered infected in the presence of at least one positive culture before procurement. from january 1999 to 2003, 23 of 160 donors  (14.5%) were infected: in 10 donors a positive blood culture; in 3, a urine culture; and in 13, a bronchial culture. in a further 12 (7%) donors, only the preservation solution was contaminated. organisms isolated were: staphylococcus coagulase.neg. (n = 7); staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 3); staphylococcus aureus (n = 6); klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3); pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4); acinetobacter (n = 1); candida albicans (n = 13); aspergillus (n = 1); and escherichia coli (n = 1). all except 2 kidneys were transplanted with positivity  in all cultures. all recipients received general, nonspecific, antibacterial and  antifungal prophylaxis until the antibiotic and antifungal spectrum was ready. patient and graft survival rates at 6 months were 94% and 93%, respectively. two  deaths occurred due to bacterial arteritis (p aeruginosa), and 2 acute graft losses due to fungal arteritis. kidneys from infected donors seem suitable for transplants. only grafts infected by vasculotropic agents (s aureus, p aeruginosa, and c albicans) should be discarded.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == peritoneal fluid titer test for peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis.
AB  == standard microbiological tests (i.e., mic) do not account for the unique factors  of peritoneal dialysis (pd)-related peritonitis which can significantly influence treatment response. our goals were to develop a peritoneal fluid titer (pft) test and to conduct a pilot study of its association with clinical outcome. the methodology was developed by using spent dialysate collected from patients with bacterial pd-related peritonitis prior to the initiation of antibiotics. dialysate was processed and spiked with antibiotic to simulate two standard intraperitoneal regimens: cefazolin plus tobramycin and cefazolin alone. thirty-six clinical isolates, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested. in the pilot study, dialysate was collected from 14 patients with bacterial pd-related peritonitis. titers were determined by using each patient's dialysate and infecting pathogen. titers were  highly reproducible, with discrepancies in only 1% of cases. overall, pfts were notably higher against gram-positive bacteria (p < 0.0001). the addition of tobramycin increased titers significantly from zero to values of 1/16 to 1/64 against e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa (p < 0.0001). in the pilot study, peritoneal fluid inhibitory titers were significantly associated with clinical outcome, with a median value of 1/96 for patients who were cured compared to 1/32 for those who failed treatment (p = 0.036). in conclusion, this study provides preliminary support for the pft as a pharmacodynamic index specific to the treatment of pd-related peritonitis. with further characterization and validation in patients, the pft test may advance the study of antibiotic therapies for pd-related peritonitis.

TI  == evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in plt components.
AB  == background: a microbial detection system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux [formerly organon teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in plts. the recovery of nine organisms seeded into plts with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. the use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis plt  units to 10 and 100 cfus per ml. replicate samples (4 ml) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. results: all organisms (with the exception of p. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 cfus/ml). in aggregate (with the exception of p. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). in all cases,  the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. p. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with  the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 cfus/ml), respectively. the narrower bottle  neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. conclusions: these data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.

TI  == different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  == we examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (egcg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods. compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of egcg against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, and s. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher mics (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against gram-negative rods, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens. and difference was observed between the binding abilities of egcg with viable s. aureus and with e. coli. the bactericidal activity of egcg for s. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide  or dextran. it was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of egcg. these results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different  affinities of egcg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the  different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to egcg.

TI  == microbial screening of uc blood units by an automated culture system: effect of delayed testing on bacterial detection.
AB  == background: microbial screening is a mandatory test for banked uc blood (ucb) to  comply with the code of good manufacturing practice (gmp). cord blood banks (cbbs) are not always closely located to a gmp-licensed microbiology laboratory,  resulting in time delays for transport of specimens prior to microbiological testing. this study investigated the influence of >/=24 h delays in initiating automated microbial screening on the detection of bacteria in ucb, by analysis of specimens deliberately spiked with bacteria and the recovery of bacteria from cryopreserved spiked-ucb. materials and methods: ucb was processed according to standard cbb procedures and spiked with staphylococcus epidermidis or escherichia coli [2-2000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml]. spiked-ucb (0.5 ml) was (1) held at  room temperature (rt) and inoculated into pediatric bact/alert bottles (biomerieux) at days 1, 4 and 7 (delayed inoculation); and (2) inoculated directly (day 0) into replicate bact/alert bottles and held at rt for 1, 4 or 7 days before loading onto the bact/alert system (delayed loading). spiked-ucb samples were cryopreserved. bacterial counts were quantitated on horse blood agar plates. results: bacterial growth in ucb spiked with a single bacterium was capable of detection by the bact/alert system. s. epidermidis grew in all conditions of delayed testing (ie. delayed inoculation and delayed loading). e. coli failed to grow under conditions of delayed inoculation but grew at all time  points of delayed loading. s. epidermidis and e. coli were recovered from cryopreserved spiked-ucb. discussion: inoculation of culture bottles as soon as possible after sample preparation is preferable. bacteria can maintain viability  in bact/alert bottles inoculated and held at rt for up to 7 days prior to automated culture testing. bacteria can be successfully recovered from cryopreserved ucb.

TI  == mechanism of action of the mannopeptimycins, a novel class of glycopeptide antibiotics active against vancomycin-resistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the naturally occurring mannopeptimycins (formerly ac98-1 through ac98-5) are a novel class of glycopeptide antibiotics that are active against a wide variety of gram-positive bacteria. the structures of the mannopeptimycins suggested that they might act by targeting cell wall biosynthesis, similar to other known glycopeptide antibiotics; but the fact that the mannopeptimycins retain activity  against vancomycin-resistant organisms suggested that they might have a unique mode of action. by using a radioactive mannopeptimycin derivative bearing a photoactivation ligand, it was shown that mannopeptimycins interact with the membrane-bound cell wall precursor lipid ii [c(55)-murnac-(peptide)-glcnac] and that this interaction is different from the binding of other lipid ii-binding antibiotics such as vancomycin and mersacidin. the antimicrobial activities of several mannopeptimycin derivatives correlated with their affinities toward lipid ii, suggesting that the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis was primarily through lipid ii binding. in addition, it was shown that mannopeptimycins bind to lipoteichoic acid in a rather nonspecific interaction, which might facilitate the accumulation of antibiotic on the bacterial cell surface.

TI  == epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in infants after cardiac surgery.
AB  == background: the pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (np) in infants in a pediatric surgical icu after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult icus. study objectives: the primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of np  in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. methods: data were collected between june 1999 and june 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. we retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. results: of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired np after cardiac surgery. the incidence of np was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (chd) compared to simple chd (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). the proportion of late-onset np was higher in patients with complex chd (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). a total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. gram-negative bacilli (gnb) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). the main gnb were acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen gnb were flavobacterium meningosepticum (7  isolates, 8.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). the most commonly seen gram-positive cocci were staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). the frequent fungi were candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). most gnb were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. the bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from k pneumoniae and e coli; the susceptibility of esbl-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. there were one case of methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant s epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. from 1999 to 2002 in infants with np after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant gnb such as a baumanii, p aeruginosa, and k pneumoniae. however, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. early onset episodes of np were frequently caused by haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive s aureus, and other susceptible enterobacteriaceae. conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset np, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, other multiresistant gnb, mrsa, and fungi were the predominant organisms. conclusions: the pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in np in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of gram-positive pathogens as reported by several  adult icus. gnb still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years  in our hospital. there was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.

TI  == role of commensal bacteria in development of gut-associated lymphoid tissues and  preimmune antibody repertoire.
AB  == intestinal bacteria are required for development of gut-associated lymphoid tissues (galt), which mediate a variety of host immune functions, such as mucosal immunity and oral tolerance. in rabbits, the intestinal microflora are also required for developing the preimmune ab repertoire by promoting somatic diversification of ig genes in b cells that have migrated to galt. we studied the mechanism of bacteria-induced galt development. bacteria were introduced into rabbits in which the appendix had been rendered germfree by microsurgery (we refer to these rabbits as germfree-appendix rabbits). we then identified specific members of the intestinal flora that promote galt development. the combination of bacteroides fragilis and bacillus subtilis consistently promoted galt development and led to development of the preimmune ab repertoire, as shown by an increase in somatic diversification of vdj-c micro genes in appendix b cells. neither species alone consistently induced galt development, nor did clostridium subterminale, escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. b. fragilis, which by itself is  immunogenic, did not promote galt development; hence, galt development in rabbits does not appear to be the result of an ag-specific immune response. to identify bacterial pathways required for galt development, we introduced b. fragilis along with stress-response mutants of b. subtilis into germfree-appendix rabbits. we identified two spo0a-controlled stress responses, sporulation and secretion of the protein yqxm, which are required for galt development. we conclude that specific members of the commensal, intestinal flora drive galt development through a specific subset of stress responses.

TI  == structure-based design of an indolicidin peptide analogue with increased protease stability.
AB  == indolicidin is an antimicrobial cationic peptide with broad-spectrum activity isolated from bovine neutrophils. an indolicidin analogue cp-11, ilkkwpwwpwrrk-nh(2), with improved activity against gram-negative bacteria had increased positive charge and amphipathicity while maintaining the short length of the parent molecule. the structure of cp-11 in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine (dpc) micelles was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. cp-11 was found to be an amphipathic molecule with a u-shaped backbone bringing the n- and c-termini in close proximity. on the basis  of this close proximity, a cyclic disulfide-bonded peptide cyclocp-11, iclkkwpwwpwrrck-nh(2), was designed to stabilize the lipid-bound structure and to increase protease resistance. the three-dimensional structure of cyclocp-11 was determined under the same conditions as for the linear peptide and was found to be similar to cp-11. both cp-11 and cyclocp-11 associated with phospholipid membranes in a similar manner as indicated by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of cp-11 and cyclocp-11 for a range of bacteria differed by no more than 2-fold, and they were nonhemolytic at  concentrations up to 256 microg/ml. cyclization was found to greatly increase protease stability. the half-life of cyclocp-11 in the presence of trypsin was increased by 4.5-fold from 4 to 18 min. more importantly, the antibacterial activity of cyclocp-11, but not that of cp-11, in the presence of trypsin was completely retained up to 90 min since the major degradation product was equally  active. a structural comparison of cp-11 and cyclocp-11 revealed that the higher  trypsin resistance of cyclocp-11 may be due to the more compact packing of lysine and tryptophan side chains. these findings suggest that cyclization may serve as  an important strategy in the rational design of antimicrobial peptides.

AB  == poly(ethylene oxide) (peo)-brushes are generally recognized as protein-repellent  surfaces, and although a role in discouraging microbial adhesion has been established for some strains and species, no study exists on the effects of peo-brushes on a large variety of bacterial and yeast strains. in this paper, a peo-brush has been covalently attached to glass and silica by reaction in a polymer melt. subsequently, the presence of a peo-brush was demonstrated using contact angle measurements, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry. for five bacterial (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two yeast strains (candida albicans and candida tropicalis), adhesion to peo-brushes  was compared with adhesion to bare glass in a parallel plate flow chamber. the initial deposition rates of sta. epidermidis, sta. aureus and str. salivarius to  glass were relatively high, between 2400 and 2600 cm(-2) s(-1), while e. coli and p. aeruginosa deposited much more slowly. the initial deposition rates of the yeasts to glass were 144 and 444 cm(-2) s(-1) for c. albicans gb 1/2 and c. tropicalis gb 9/9, respectively. coating of the glass surface with a peo-brush yielded more than 98 % reduction in bacterial adhesion, although for the more hydrophobic p. aeruginosa a smaller reduction was observed. for both yeast species adhesion suppression was less effective than for the bacteria and here too the more hydrophobic c. tropicalis showed less reduction than the more hydrophilic c. albicans. the peo-brush had a thickness of 22 nm in water, as inferred from ellipsometry. assuming that on bare glass the adhered micro-organisms are positioned only a few nanometers away from the surface and that the brush keeps them at a distance of 22 nm, it is calculated that the brush yields a sevenfold attenuation of the lifshitz-van der waals attraction to the surface between the micro-organisms and the surface. decreased lifshitz-van der waals attraction may be responsible for the suppression of the microbial adhesion observed.

TI  == influence of air-ions on selected microorganisms.
AB  == in the following work the influence of air-ions and ozone on the selected microorganisms, first of all on staphylococcus epidermidis is discussed. carried  out investigations proved that the levels of air-ions concentrations, causing specific changes in the development of particular microorganisms, are very differentiated and depend on individual parameters of those organisms. these levels are generally characterized by high values of concentrations, range n +/-  =4 x 10(6) ions/cm3 and are connected with the type of the air-ions used. however investigations did not confirm any negative influence of the positive air-ions seen as a destructive factor upon any of the investigated microorganisms.

TI  == isdg and isdi, heme-degrading enzymes in the cytoplasm of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus requires iron for growth and utilizes heme as a source of iron during infection. staphylococcal surface proteins capture hemoglobin, release heme from hemoglobin and transport this compound across the cell wall envelope and plasma membrane into the bacterial cytoplasm. here we show that staphylococcus aureus isdg and isdi encode cytoplasmic proteins with heme binding properties. isdg and isdi cleave the tetrapyrrol ring structure of heme in the presence of nadph cytochrome p450 reductase, thereby releasing iron. further, isdi complements the heme utilization deficiency of a corynebacterium ulcerans heme oxygenase mutant, demonstrating in vivo activity of this enzyme. although staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus anthracis encode homologues of isdg and isdi, these proteins are not found in other bacteria or mammals. thus, it appears that bacterial pathogens evolved different strategies to retrieve iron from scavenged heme molecules and that staphylococcal isdg and isdi represent examples of bacterial heme-oxygenases.

TI  == identification and characterization of a novel autolysin (aae) with adhesive properties from staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm formation on polymer surfaces is considered a  major pathogenicity factor in foreign-body-associated infections. previously, the 148 kda autolysin atle from s. epidermidis, which is involved in the initial attachment of the cells to polymer surfaces and also binds to the extracellular matrix protein vitronectin, was characterized. here, the characterization of a novel autolysin/adhesin (aae) in s. epidermidis is described. aae was identified  as a 35 kda surface-associated protein that has bacteriolytic activity and binds  vitronectin. its n-terminal amino acid sequence was determined and the respective gene, aae, was cloned. dna-sequence analysis revealed that aae encodes a deduced  protein of 324 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 35 kda. aae contains three repetitive sequences in its n-terminal portion. these repeats comprise features of a putative peptidoglycan binding domain (lysm domain) found  in a number of enzymes involved in cell-wall metabolism and also in some adhesins. expression of aae by escherichia coli and subsequent analysis revealed  that aae possesses bacteriolytic activity and adhesive properties. the interaction of aae with fibrinogen, fibronectin and vitronectin was found to be dose-dependent and saturable and to occur with high affinity, by using the real-time biomolecular interaction analysis (bia). aae binds to the aalpha- and bbeta-chains of fibrinogen and to the 29 kda n-terminal fragment of fibronectin.  in conclusion, aae is a surface-associated protein with bacteriolytic and adhesive properties representing a new member of the staphylococcal autolysin/adhesins potentially involved in colonization.

TI  == [prostate histopathology of nih category iv prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

TI  == antiplasmid effect of promethazine in mixed bacterial cultures.
AB  == promethazine has been recognised as an effective antiplasmid agent in cultures containing a single bacterial species such as escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus and agrobacterium tumefaciens. the objective of this study was to examine the effect of heterogenity of the microbial flora on plasmid elimination by promethazine in a laboratory based model system of mixed bacterial infection. f'lac plasmid elimination of e. coli k12 le140 was studied in the presence of a numerically predominant gram-positive  species (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis) by promethazine (0-120 mg/l) at 23, 37 and 39 degrees c. growth kinetics of different bacterial species  were studied at various temperatures without drug treatment in mixed bacterial cultures and it was found that the small number of added bacteria overgrew the pre-existing flora during the incubation period. we observed that bacterial-bacterial interactions modified the growth rate of individual bacterial species and gave selective advantages to some bacterial species of the microbial  community. some interactions between coexisting bacterial species enhanced the frequency of plasmid curing by promethazine in mixed cultures with s. epidermidis. in our experiments the plasmid curing action of promethazine was more effective at elevated temperature than at lower temperatures.

TI  == risk factors for the development of bacterial infections in multiple myeloma treated with two different vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone schedules.
AB  == background and objectives: we evaluated bacterial infections (bis) in patients with multiple myeloma (mm) treated with two different schedules of vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone (vad). design and methods: ninety-seven patients were studied during 340 vad cycles. vad was given by either continuous intravenous infusion (cii) to hospitalized patients or rapid intravenous infusion (rii) to outpatients. the characteristics of patients and vad schedules were retrospectively analyzed to detect correlations with the incidence of bi. results: by analyzing each vad cycle, we found that profound hypogammaglobulinemia (p=0.06) and post-treatment neutropenia (p=0.08) were associated with a trend for a higher risk of infection, while renal function impairment was significantly correlated with bi risk at both univariate (p<0.02)  and multivariate (p<0.002) analyses. evaluating only the first 4 months of therapy, characterized by a significantly higher incidence of bi than the later period (p<0.0001), previously untreated disease was significantly correlated with bi risk (p<0.04), while male sex (p=0.06), cii schedule (p=0.07), and profound hypogammaglobulinemia (p=0.1) were associated with a tendency to a higher risk of infection; however, at multivariate analysis the latter two parameters independently predicted bi probability (p<0.015 and p<0.03, respectively) as did  previously untreated disease (p<0.025). the high probability of cii-related infection was demonstrated to depend on the frequent development of nosocomial infections. interpretation and conclusions: patients with profound hypogammaglobulinemia who receive vad as first line treatment are at a major risk of bi up to the completion of the fourth month of therapy. in this setting hospitalization should be avoided and, if patients require admission, antibacterial prophylaxis with intravenous immunoglobulins could be appropriate and effective.

TI  == comparison of microbial adherence to antiseptic and antibiotic central venous catheters using a novel agar subcutaneous infection model.
AB  == an agar subcutaneous infection model (agar model), which simulates the rat subcutaneous infection model (rat model), was developed to assess the ability of  antimicrobial catheters to resist microbial colonization. the catheters were implanted in the agar and rat models and the insertion sites were infected immediately or on day 7, 14 or 21 post-implantation. the catheters implanted in the agar model were transferred to fresh media one day before infection on day 7, 14 or 21. the efficacy of chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine impregnated (cs)  catheters, cs catheters with higher levels of chlorhexidine (cs+ catheters), minocycline-rifampicin (mr) catheters and silver catheters against staphylococcus aureus and rifampicin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis rif-r2 was compared in the agar and rat models. no significant difference in the adherence or the drug release was found between the in vitro and in vivo models. in both models, cs+ and mr catheters were effective against s. aureus even when infected on day 14, whereas cs catheters were colonized when challenged on day 7. cs+ catheters were  effective against s. epidermidis rif-r2, whereas mr catheters showed adherence when infected on day 7. cs+ catheters prevented colonization of all the organisms including, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans in the agar model, whereas mr catheters were effective only against s. aureus and s. epidermidis strains. silver catheters were ineffective against all the organisms. the agar model may be used to predict the in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters against various pathogens.

AB  == a presumed antimicrobial enzyme system, the curvularia haloperoxidase system, was examined with the aim of evaluating its potential as a sanitizing agent. in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, curvularia haloperoxidase facilitates the oxidation of halides, such as chloride, bromide, and iodide, to antimicrobial compounds. the curvularia haloperoxidase system caused several-log-unit reductions in counts of bacteria (pseudomonas spp., escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, aeromonas salmonicida, shewanella putrefaciens, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes), yeasts (candida sp. and rhodotorula sp.), and filamentous fungi (aspergillus niger, aspergillus tubigensis, aspergillus versicolor, fusarium oxysporum, penicillium chrysogenum, and penicillium paxilli) cultured in suspension. also, bacteria adhering to the surfaces of contact lenses were killed. the numbers of s. marcescens and s. epidermidis cells adhering to contact lenses were reduced from 4.0 and 4.9 log cfu to 1.2 and 2.7 log cfu, respectively, after treatment with the curvularia haloperoxidase system. the killing effect of the curvularia haloperoxidase system was rapid, and 10(6) cfu of e. coli cells/ml were eliminated within 10 min of treatment. furthermore, the antimicrobial effect was short lived, causing no antibacterial effect against e. coli 10 min after the system was mixed. bovine serum albumin (1%) and alginate (1%) inhibited the antimicrobial activity of the  curvularia haloperoxidase system, whereas glucose and tween 20 did not affect its activity. in conclusion, the curvularia haloperoxidase system is an effective sanitizing system and has the potential for a vast range of applications, for instance, for disinfection of contact lenses or medical devices.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == chlamydia pneumoniae binds to platelets and triggers p-selectin expression and aggregation: a causal role in cardiovascular disease?
AB  == objective: evidence linking chlamydia pneumoniae to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is expanding. platelets are considered to play an essential role in cardiovascular diseases; however, so far platelets have not been associated with an infectious cause of atherosclerosis. this study aims to clarify the interaction between c pneumoniae and platelets and possibly present a novel mechanism in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. methods and results: the  effects of c pneumoniae on platelet aggregation and secretion were assessed with  lumiaggregometry, and the ability of c pneumoniae to bind to platelets and stimulate expression of p-selectin was analyzed with flow cytometry. we found that c pneumoniae, at a chlamydia:platelet ratio of 1:15, adheres to platelets and triggers p-selectin expression after 1 minute and causes an extensive aggregation and atp secretion after 20 minutes of incubation. inhibition of glycoprotein iib/iiia with arg-gly-asp-ser or abciximab markedly reduced c pneumoniae-induced platelet aggregation. exposure of c pneumoniae to polymyxin b, but not elevated temperature, abolished the stimulatory effects on platelet activation, suggesting that chlamydial lipopolysaccharide has an active role. in  contrast, other tested bacteria had no or only moderate effects on platelet functions. conclusions: our findings demonstrate a new concept of how c pneumoniae activates platelets and thereby may cause atherosclerosis and thrombotic vascular occlusion.

TI  == characterization of rap, a quorum sensing activator of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus are gram-positive bacteria and cause diverse serious diseases in humans and animals through the production of toxins. the production of toxins is regulated by quorum sensing mechanisms, where proteins such as rnaiii activating protein (rap) are secreted by the bacteria and induce virulence. antibodies to rap have been shown to protect mice from infection, but  the molecular structure of rap was not known and hindered vaccine development. to characterize rap, recombinant protein was made and tested for its ability to induce genes important for pathogenesis (agr). in addition, monoclonal antibodies were produced to identify its cellular localization. results shown here indicate  that rap is a 277-aa protein that is an ortholog of the ribosomal protein l2. like the native molecule, recombinant rap activates the production of rnaiii (encoded by agr). using rap specific monoclonal antibodies we demonstrate that rap is continuously secreted and while rap is expressed also in other bacteria (like staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus xylosus and escherichia coli), it is secreted to the culture medium only by s. aureus. our results show that the ribosomal protein l2 has an extraribosomal function and that when secreted rap acts as an autoinducer of virulence to regulate s. aureus pathogenesis.

AB  == as part of our on-going search for bioactive compounds from scottish plants, two  secoiridoid glycosides, swertiamarin and sweroside, have been isolated from the aerial parts of centaurium erythraea rafn (family: gentianaceae) by reversed-phase preparative hplc coupled with a photo-diode-array detector. the structures of these compounds were elucidated unambiguously by uv, fabms and extensive 1d and 2d nmr spectroscopic analyses and also by comparing experimental data with literature data. antibacterial, free radical scavenging activities and  general toxicity of these glycosides have been assessed. both compounds inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli. while swertiamarin was also active against proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens, sweroside inhibited the growth of staphylococcus epidermidis. swertiamarin and sweroside exhibited significant general toxicity in brine shrimp lethality bioassay and the ld50 values were 8.0 microg/ml and 34 microg/ml, respectively, whereas that of the positive control podophyllotoxin, a  well known cytotoxic lignan, was 2.79 microg/ml. chemotaxonomic implications of these compounds in the family gentianaceae have also been discussed briefly.

TI  == comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). time killing curves against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pneumoniae  were performed. serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. in the urine series,  levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs cfu/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on e. coli (both), p. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and p. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). in the bronchial mucosa series,  s. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and k. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. in conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.

TI  == ultrasound increases the rate of bacterial cell growth.
AB  == ultrasound was employed to increase the growth rate of bacterial cells attached to surfaces. staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia  coli cells adhered to and grew on a polyethylene surface in the presence of ultrasound. it was found that low-frequency ultrasound (70 khz) of low acoustic intensity (<2 w/cm(2)) increased the growth rate of the cells compared to growth  without ultrasound. however, at high intensity levels, cells were partially removed from the surface. ultrasound also enhanced planktonic growth of s. epidermidis and other planktonic bacteria. it is hypothesized that ultrasound increases the rate of transport of oxygen and nutrients to the cells and increases the rate of transport of waste products away from the cells, thus enhancing their growth.

TI  == [long-term cefadroxil prophylaxis in children with recurrent urinary tract infections].
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose, long-term cefadroxil prophylaxis in preventing recurrent urinary tract infections in children. a prospective, randomized trial in 33 children (32 female, 1 male) aged 2-14 years (mean 8.1+/-2.8) was conducted. children with recurrent urinary tract infections were commenced to six-month prophylaxis with cefadroxil at the dosage of 12.5-15.0 mg/kg at bedtime administered every night (group i, n=15) or  alternate night (group ii, n=18). escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated agent (90.9%), followed by proteus mirabilis (3.0%) and klebsiella oxytoca (3.0%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (3.0%). cefadroxil prophylaxis was  effective in 80% of patients in group i and in 78% patients in group ii. reinfection occurred in 3/15 (20%) patients in-group i and in 4/18 (22.2%) patients in-group ii (odds ratio--1.14; 95% confidence interval--0.16-8.3). the difference of reinfection rate between the groups was not significant (p=0.88). the rate of day- and night-time wetting in both groups before prophylaxis of urinary tract infections was high. it decreased significantly at the end of prophylactic treatment with cefadroxil (from 42.4% to 9.1% and from 39.4% to 6.1% respectively). mild adverse reaction (nausea) was observed in 1/33 patient. in conclusion our study shows that cefadroxil is an effective, well-tolerated and safe agent in the urinary tract infections prophylaxis. prophylaxis of recurrent  urinary tract infections in children with cefadroxil on alternate night regimen might reduce the cost of the treatment.

TI  == wound infections in two health institutions in ile-ife, nigeria: results of a cohort study.
AB  == the control of wound infections is increasingly complicated, yet treatment is not always guided by microbiological diagnosis. to describe the distribution of wound infections and causative agents, a prospective, 6-month cohort study involving 102 outpatients was conducted at the university teaching hospital and the health  center in ile-ife, nigeria. location and type of infected wounds were recorded and bacterial isolates were identified by standard microbiological techniques. almost half (40%) of all infected wounds were attributed to trauma and, in most cases, located on the extremities. of the 162 bacterial isolates obtained from wound cultures, 39 were monomicrobial and 55 were polymicrobial; no bacterial isolate was obtained in eight cases. staphylococcus aureus was the predominant micro-organism (25%), followed by escherichia coli (12%), pseudomonas aeruginosa  (9%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (9%). the diversity of micro-organisms and the high incidence of polymicrobic flora in this study give credence to the value of identifying one or more bacterial pathogens from wound cultures. the recognition of causative agents of wound infections can assist wound care practitioners in taking appropriate measures. continuous dialogue between the microbiology department and wound care practitioners is strongly advised in order to improve treatment outcomes and slow the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

TI  == sol-gel column technology for capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms and biopolymers with uv or fluorometric detection.
AB  == the sol-gel surface modification is used for capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms and biopolymers. the coating strongly decreases the electroosmotic flow so that it enables the use of the short capillaries down to 100 mm in the separation length. the examples of capillary isoelectric focusing of the low-molecular-mass pi markers and mixed cultures of microbial populations of escherichia coli, candida albicans, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enteroccocus  faecalis with uv detection are shown. it is possible to quantify bacterial cells  according to their peak areas; the minimum detectable number of microbial cells was 5 x 10(2)-1 x 10(3). the compatibility of sol-gel capillaries with sensitive  fluorometric detection of fluorescent pi markers together with fluorescein labeled proteins is demonstrated.

TI  == capd peritonitis induces the production of a novel peptide, daintain/allograft inflammatory factor-1.
AB  == objectives: to study the occurrence of a novel macrophage-derived peptide, daintain/allograft inflammatory factor-1 (aif-1), in dialysate from continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd) patients at commencement and after a follow-up period of therapy and during peritonitis. in addition, we studied peptide production in response to bacterial stimulation of monocytes and macrophages. design: peritoneal fluid and supernatants from cells stimulated with different bacteria were analyzed for daintain/aif-1. patients and setting: peritoneal fluid was obtained from 5 patients at commencement of capd therapy and during 8 weeks' follow-up, and from 14 patients (10 males, 4 females) during capd peritonitis and during the noninfected steady state. all patients were admitted to the karolinska hospital. a human monocyte cell-line, thp-1 was differentiated  to macrophages, and both monocytes and macrophages were stimulated with live and  heat-inactivated escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis. cells were also stimulated with interleukin (il)-1beta and interferon gamma (ifngamma). daintain/aif-1 was analyzed with radioimmunoassay technique and il-8  with enzyme immunoassay technique. results: an increased production of daintain/aif-1 was observed in the first spent dialysate in the newly started capd patients, with a decrease during the follow-up period (p < 0.05). during peritonitis, the first spent dialysate revealed significantly higher levels of daintain/aif-1 (3.9 ng/ml) compared to the noninfected state (0.8 ng/ml), with production normalizing after 9-12 days. bacterial stimulation with e. coli, s. aureus, or s. epidermidis induced higher daintain/aif-1 response in monocytes compared to macrophages (p < 0.05). live bacteria induced higher production of the peptide compared to heat-inactivated bacteria (p < 0.05). interleukin-1beta and ifngamma were used to stimulate monocytes and macrophages; however, no daintain/aif-1 production was found, although increased il-8 levels were detected. conclusion: capd peritonitis induces a high and prominent daintain/aif-1 response. bacteria are able to induce a response of the peptide from monocytes and macrophages, and it is likely that the virulent parts of the bacteria are heat-labile structures. the early rise in daintain/ aif-1 might be used as a marker of capd peritonitis.

TI  == affinity of helicobacter pylori to cholesterol and other steroids.
AB  == helicobacter pylori has a particular affinity to cholesterol. it is not known, however, whether other steroidal substances are bound as well. in order to characterize the specificity and nature of the h. pylori-steroid interaction, the affinity of h. pylori to cholesterol and several steroidal hormones was investigated. seven strains of h. pylori (five reference strains, two wild strains) and one strain each of staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli were cultured on a cholesterol-free medium. cholesterol-free bacteria were incubated with cyclodextrin-mediated cholesterol and several cyclodextrin-mediated steroidal hormones (beta-estradiol, testosterone, progesterone, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone). the steroid contents of the bacteria were determined by gas liquid chromatography. high amounts of cholesterol were detected in all h. pylori strains, whilst steroidal hormones were not found. neither s. epidermidis nor e. coli showed an appreciable amount of cholesterol in the chromatographic examinations. bacterial pretreatment with proteinase k diminished cholesterol adsorption of h. pylori. these data indicate  a specific affinity of h. pylori to cholesterol. this unique property might serve as a pathogenicity component enabling survival and colonization of h. pylori in the gastric environment.

TI  == surgical infants on total parenteral nutrition have impaired cytokine responses to microbial challenge.
AB  == background/purpose: cytokines are essential for the prevention of microbial infections. total parenteral nutrition (tpn) in infancy is associated with an increased risk of infection, and this could be related to altered cytokine production. the aim of the study was to determine if cytokine production is altered in monocytes from surgical infants receiving tpn. methods: there were 3 study groups: (a) infants receiving tpn, (b) enterally fed healthy control infants, and (c) enterally fed healthy control adults. blood samples were incubated with either escherichia coli lps, staphylococcus epidermidis, or with medium alone. flow cytometry was used to measure monocyte intracellular cytokine: tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, interleukin (il)-6, il-1beta. results: after lps stimulation, the percent of monocytes producing tnf-alpha and il-6 were lower in infants on tpn than both control infants and adults. this was most apparent for tnf-alpha. the difference for il-1beta was significant only between infant on tpn and control adults. when blood was stimulated with s. epidermidis, all 3 cytokines were significantly lower in the tpn group compared with control adults. however, the differences between infants on tpn and infant controls only reached  statistical significance for il-6. conclusions: the inflammatory response to bacterial challenge is impaired in infants on tpn compared with enterally fed infants or adults. the pattern of this response may be dependent on the nature of the microbial challenge. our results indicate that the susceptibility of tpn-fed  surgical infants to bacterial infections may in part be caused by impaired cytokine responses after bacterial invasion.

TI  == prevalence and drug susceptibility of pathogens causing bloodstream infections in northern italy: a two-year study in 16 hospitals.
AB  == the epidemiology of bacterial pathogens causing bloodstream infection was studied in 16 hospitals in lombardy (northern italy) over a 2-year period (1999 and 2000). overall, 2924 microorganisms causing significant bacteremia were collected. the most frequent isolates were escherichia coli ( n=663; 22.7%), staphylococcus aureus ( n=534; 18.3%), staphylococcus epidermidis ( n=242; 8.2%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa ( n=176; 6.0%). unlike escherichia coli, which was usually acquired from the community, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were usually acquired in hospitals. rates of resistance to oxacillin and its associated traits were significantly higher among hospital-acquired staphylococci as compared to those of isolates from the community. escherichia coli was highly susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, with a very low percentage of strains producing extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (esbls). on the contrary, production of esbl appeared to be an important mechanism of resistance among nosocomial isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae. resistance to ciprofloxacin was widespread in several members of the  family enterobacteriaceae, with rates often exceeding 10%. moreover, with regard  to ciprofloxacin, there were no significant differences between rates of resistance among enterobacteriaceae causing hospital-acquired infections versus those causing community-acquired infections. multidrug resistance was commonly observed in pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the need for new antimicrobial agents that are more active against nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria. in conclusion, epidemiological studies of the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of blood isolates in northern italy appear to provide useful information for both empirical treatment of suspected infections and better management of patients.

TI  == evaluation of antibacterial efficacy of drugs for urinary tract infections by genotyping based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge).
AB  == we attempted to determine whether the same bacterium isolated from patients with  urinary tract infections (uti) before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents was of the same strain ("persisted") or of a different strain ("changed"). furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents for uti, we investigated whether bacterial strains could be classified as persisted or changed based on their electrophoretic patterns in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). we examined eight species of bacteria ( enterococcus avium, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas fluorescens, serratia marcescens,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and escherichia coli), consisting of 41 strains (19 pairs isolated before and after treatment with antimicrobial agents) isolated from patients with complicated uti. it was concluded that all bacteria were unchanged, based on the clinical effect on bacteriuria. the chromosomal dna of these bacteria was digested with restriction enzymes and classified based on their electrophoretic pattern in pfge. a comparison of the patterns of the fragments revealed that 14 pairs were indistinguishable before and after treatment, 3 pairs were closely related, 1 pair was possibly related, and 1 pair was different. these results demonstrated that 18 pairs of isolates (indistinguishable, closely related, and possibly related) were highly likely to be continued infections by the same strain, and that 1 pair (different) had been replaced by another strain. based on these results, we believe that bacterium genotyping by pfge is a more effective method  for evaluating the antibacterial efficacy of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == keratinocyte expression of human beta defensin 2 following bacterial infection: role in cutaneous host defense.
AB  == human beta defensin 2 (hbetad-2) is thought to play an important role in cutaneous immune defense. we hypothesized that (i) keratinocyte expression of hbetad-2, measured by reverse transcription-pcr, would be upregulated in response to challenge with pathogenic bacteria, particularly highly adherent strains of streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus, and (ii) hbetad-2 would have potent antimicrobial activity against pathogenic but not commensal organisms. expression of hbetad-2 was induced consistently by s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas strains of s.  pyogenes were poor and variable inducers of hbetad-2. no correlation was found between levels of bacterial adherence and keratinocyte expression of hbetad-2. s. pyogenes was significantly more sensitive to killing by hbetad-2 than s. epidermidis. we conclude that the ability to induce hbetad-2 expression in combination with sensitivity to its antimicrobial effects may contribute to the rarity of skin infections with the gram-negative bacterial organisms, whereas lack of stimulation of hbetad-2 expression by s. pyogenes may be important in its ability to evade innate defenses and cause skin disease. induction of expression  of hbetad-2 but relative tolerance to it may enable s. epidermidis to survive on  the skin surface and modulate hbetad-2 expression when the stratum corneum barrier is disrupted.

TI  == subdural empyema.
AB  == subdural empyema represents loculated infection between the outermost layer of the meninges, the dura, and the arachnoid. the empyema may develop intracranially or in the spinal canal. intracranial subdural empyema is most frequently a complication of sinusitis or, less frequently, otitis or neurosurgical procedures. spinal subdural empyema is rare and may result from hematogenous infection or spread of infection from osteomyelitis. the most common organisms in intracranial subdural empyema are anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, in  particular those of the streptococcus milleri group (s. milleri and streptococcus anginosus). staphylococcus aureus is present in a minority of cases, and multiple additional organisms, including gram-negative organisms, such as escherichia coli, and anaerobic organisms, such as bacteroides, may be present. pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus epidermidis may be present in cases related to neurosurgical procedures, and salmonella species have been detected in patients with advanced aids; multiple organisms may be present simultaneously. spinal subdural empyemas are almost invariably caused by streptococci or by s. aureus. subdural empyema--whether it occurs in the skull or the spinal canal--may cause rapid compression of the brain or spinal cord, and represents an extreme medical  and neurosurgical emergency. the diagnostic procedure of choice for intracranial  and spinal subdural empyema is mri with gadolinium enhancement. computed tomography scan may miss intracranial subdural empyemas detectable by mri. conversely, occasion spinal subdural empyemas may be detected by ct myelography where mri is negative. treatment in virtually all cases of intracranial or spinal subdural empyema requires prompt surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy. pus from the empyema should always be sent for anaerobic, as well as aerobic, culture. because intracranial subdural empyemas may contain multiple organisms, provisional antibiotic therapy of intracranial subdural empyema, where the organism is unknown, should be directed against s. aureus, microaerophilic and anaerobic streptococci, and gram-negative organisms. antibiotics should include 1) nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin; plus 2) a third generation cephalosporin; plus 3) metronidazole. provisional antibiotic therapy of spinal subdural empyemas should be directed against s. aureus and streptococci, and should include nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin. morbidity and mortality in intracranial and  spinal subdural empyema relate directly to the delay in institution of therapy. both conditions should, thus, be treated with great urgency.

TI  == cloning and characterization of a novel chromosomal drug efflux gene in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == a novel drug efflux gene (named sepa, staphylococcal efflux pump gene) is cloned  from antiseptic-resistant mutants of staphylococcus aureus into escherichia coli. the sepa gene conferred the reduction of susceptibility to acriflavine and the acceleration of ethidium bromide efflux from the e. coli cells. the sepa (474 bp) encoded the protein that has four predicted transmembrane segments. these results indicate that sepa gene is a multidrug-resistant gene and encodes a drug efflux protein.

TI  == activity of antimicrobial-impregnated silicone tissue expanders.
AB  == because bacterial colonization of medical devices may result in clinical infection, it is conceivable that antimicrobial impregnation of tissue expanders  may reduce the rate of infection. the objective of this in vitro study was to examine the spectrum, durability, and shelf-life antimicrobial activity of minocycline/rifampin-impregnated silicone tissue expander shells. the impregnated devices exhibited zones of inhibition at baseline against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the impregnated devices exhibited strong residual activity against s. epidermidis and s. aureus after suspension in serum at 37 degrees c for 4 weeks. there was no significant decrease in the size of zones of inhibition after storing the impregnated devices at room temperature for 1 year. these results indicate that minocycline/rifampin-impregnated tissue expander shells provide broad-spectrum and durable antimicrobial activity and that the shelf-life antimicrobial activity exceeds 1 year. these findings prompt future exploration of the anti-infective efficacy of these antimicrobial-impregnated devices.

TI  == superior antimicrobial activity of trisodium citrate over heparin for catheter locking.
AB  == background: haemodialysis catheters used for vascular access are frequently complicated by infection and catheter-related thrombosis. improvement of interdialytic locking solutions could reduce these problems. trisodium citrate (tsc) has been advocated in recent years because it might have antimicrobial qualities. methods: antimicrobial efficacy of four concentrations of tsc (2.2, 7.5, 15 and 30%) was compared with three equi-osmolal sodium chloride (nacl) concentrations, unfractionated heparin 5000 iu/ml and a solution of gentamicin 1  mg/ml in tsc 7.5%. we analysed antimicrobial properties by two classical in vitro susceptibility tests. all tests were performed in triplicate by incubation of test fluids with staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. results: increasing tsc concentrations effectively killed the staphylococcal strains in both assays. for  e.coli and p.aeruginosa complete killing was achieved only with tsc 30%. tsc 30%  was also the only solution that significantly inhibited growth of c.albicans. heparin manifested no antimicrobial effect of any significance. adding gentamicin to tsc provided superior bacterial growth inhibition but had no effect on yeast growth. tsc solutions manifested superior antimicrobial activity compared with iso-osmolal nacl solutions in both assays. conclusion: this in vitro study demonstrates superior antimicrobial activity of tsc, especially in higher concentrations, in contrast to heparin. the mechanism seems to differ from hyperosmolality. ca(2+) and mg(2+) chelating effects are probably more important. adding gentamicin provided the most potent antimicrobial solution. however, for reasons concerning development of bacterial resistance and sensitization of the patient, continuous exposition to aminoglycosides seems not advisable.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == [bacteria-selective synergism between the antimicrobial peptides magainin 2 and tachyplesin i: toward cocktail therapy].
AB  == magainin 2 and tachyplesin i (t-ss) are membrane-permeabilizing antimicrobial peptides discovered in frog skin and horseshoe crab hemolymph, respectively. they are classified into different secondary structural classes, i.e., alpha-helix and cyclic beta-sheet, respectively. we found that f5w-magainin 2 (mg2) and t-ss showed marked synergistic effects against gram-negative and-positive bacteria without enhancing hemolytic activity as a measure of toxicity. the results of dye-release experiments using liposomes suggested that the selective synergism is mainly due to anionic phospholipid-specific synergism in membrane permeabilization. furthermore, the cyclic structure of t-ss was found to be necessary for synergism because a linear analogue of t-ss did not show good synergism with mg2. these novel observations suggest the possibility of development of cocktail therapeutic regimens using combinations of antimicrobial  peptides.

TI  == a retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients. extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before hsct to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. the primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. study design: a retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic hsct to treat hematologic malignancies. radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a schei ruler on all teeth. microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or  any body sites. spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. results: radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. during the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. no statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. conclusion: in this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or  mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. a larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == efficacy and tolerability of prophylactic treatment with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
AB  == background: infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct). about 80% of patients experience fever during aplasia and early engraftment despite oral antibacterial chemoprophylaxis. methods: in a pilot study, 50 patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic hsct received a prophylactic antibacterial treatment with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam beginning on day of stem cell or bone marrow transfusion. they were analyzed retrospectively for frequencies of fever of unknown origin (fuo), documented infection, bacteremia and death because of infection. furthermore, data from microbiological monitoring and tolerability were evaluated. results: among 28 autologous transplanted patients, 10 (36%) developed fever more than 38.5 degrees c; 9/10 fuo, 1/28 pulmonary infiltrates. eighteen patients (64%) remained without any symptom of infection. in the allogeneic group (n = 22), there were eight patients (36%) with fuo, and five patients (23%) with documented infections (pneumonia 2, enteritis 1, pyelonephritis 1, escherichia coli bacteremia 1). in nine patients (41%), escalation of antimicrobial treatment was not necessary. the majority of detected microbes in cultures of throat and nose secretions, blood, urine and stool were gram-positive bacteria (77.8%), among them staphylococcus epidermidis (23.5%), streptococci (group a, b, c; 21.0%) and enterococci (10.6%). incidence of gram-negative bacteria and fungi was similar with 11.8% and 10.4%, respectively. the most frequent gram-negative strains were escherichia coli (6.5%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.7%). there was no severe toxicity or hypersensitivity. conclusion: compared to oral decontamination and chemoprophylaxis, an intravenous prophylactic regimen as described above could be an effective and well-tolerated approach in prevention of bacterial infections and related complications, with a higher acceptance in recipients of bone marrow  or stems cell grafts. further evaluation in comparison with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis regarding efficacy, development of resistances as well as cost-benefit analyses is warranted.

TI  == conservative medical therapy of infections following osteosynthesis: a retrospective analysis of a six-year experience.
AB  == the conventional therapeutic approach to bone infection associated with osteosynthesis is based on the idea that microbial eradication is most readily achieved by removal of the foreign material together with adequate antimicrobial  therapy. this strategy usually requires implantation of external fixation devices with additional discomfort to the patient. we report our experience with conservative medical and antimicrobial therapy without removal of the osteosynthesis until adequate bone callus deposition is documented by bone radiography scan. twenty patients with infections associated with intramedullary  nailing (9 patients), screws and plate (9 patients) or screws (2 patients) were treated between 1995 to 2000. osteosynthesis implantation sites were tibia (7 patients), femur (6 patients), femur and tibia (1 patient), humerus (1 patient),  others (5 patients). diagnosis of infection was based on clinical-microbiological evidence and confirmed by 99tc-labeled leukocyte scan studies. offending pathogens were staphylococcus aureus 17 cases, staphylococcus aureus + escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, unknown, 1 case each. most infections were initially treated with intravenous or intramuscular teicoplanin +/- ciprofloxacin or rifampin followed by oral antimicrobial therapy usually with ciprofloxacin or minocycline plus rifampin. mean duration of antimicrobial therapy was 27.7 weeks (range 12-64 weeks). all patients (100%) were cured, and none complained of side-effects requiring antibiotic therapy discontinuation. we  conclude that conservative medical therapy is feasible for osteosynthesis-associated bone infection.

TI  == serum levels of prophylactic cefazolin during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.
AB  == background: controversy exists regarding the appropriate prophylactic dose of cefazolin for coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb) because the effect of cpb on serum drug levels is poorly understood. current standards of prophylaxis are based primarily on empiric studies. few studies have attempted to quantify serum cefazolin levels in either cardiac or noncardiac surgeries. this study was conducted to measure and assess the adequacy of the intraoperative serum levels of prophylactic cefazolin  in cpb surgery. methods: this prospective study serially measured six intraoperative serum cefazolin levels in 10 subjects undergoing elective and urgent cabg surgery. we compared the serum levels with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic90) for the most common organisms causing postoperative infection. results: serum-free cefazolin levels fluctuated considerably during the operation but remained above the mic90, for staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. the serum levels fell below the mic90 for enterobacter, serratia, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis. conclusions: serum cefazolin levels during cpb remained consistently above the mic for two of the three main organisms causing postoperative infection but were suboptimal for the remainder.  additional studies are needed to assess the intraoperative serum levels of single-dose cefazolin prophylaxis and to explore alternate dosing methods that minimize intraoperative fluctuations in serum cefazolin levels.

TI  == is there a need for postoperative surveillance after day case groin surgery in children?
AB  == there is increasing awareness of the value of day case paediatric surgery in fulfilling the needs of the community. is this cost effective, are there hidden complications and is there a need for routine follow-up? seven hundred and thirty-one children attending the red cross war memorial children's hospital day  surgery unit over a 32-month period, and undergoing 912 procedures confined to the inguinoscrotal region, were enrolled in the study. surgical procedures performed included inguinal herniotomy, orchidopexy and circumcision. of the 731  children, 159 consecutive children had their inguinal and perineal skin flora analysed preoperatively and in 59 of these children three skin swabs were taken from the groin area: before routine skin preparation for surgery, after the skin  preparation and on completion of the operation. staphylococcus epidermidis predominated as the normal skin flora (70%), followed by escherichia coli (19%) and proteus mirabilis (10%), while s. aureus was only found in 2.5% of cases. the efficacy of cleaning with 4% chlorhexidine and 2% povidone-iodine in 70% alcohol  is shown by virtual complete eradication of the organisms isolated from the preoperative skin cultures. in only 2 cases (3.4%) were organisms (s. aureus and  s. epidermidis respectively) isolated following skin preparation. cultures taken  at the end of operative procedures grew predominantly s. epidermidis (5 cases, 8.5%). children were discharged from the day unit once they had taken fluids and  had passed urine. the wounds were also checked for any evidence of bleeding. follow-up was done 2 weeks later by means of a visit to the day unit where the same surgeon assessed wound healing according to the southampton wound assessment scale. ninety-four per cent of the wounds had healed by primary intention; 4.5% had minor complications and 1.5% had septic complications. our trial confirms that wound sepsis is an infrequent but significant complication of day case groin surgery. routine follow-up by surgical day units of minor surgical cases is not warranted and will incur unnecessary cost. only 1.5% of postoperative cases will  require further medical attention and septic lesions in the lymphatic drainage area should be regarded as risk factors.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == is the gehd lipase from staphylococcus epidermidis a collagen binding adhesin?
AB  == the opportunistic human pathogen staphylococcus epidermidis is the major cause of nosocomial biomaterial infections. s. epidermidis has the ability to attach to indwelling materials coated with extracellular matrix proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, vitronectin, and collagen. to identify the proteins necessary for s. epidermidis attachment to collagen, we screened an expression library using digoxigenin-labeled collagen as well as two monoclonal antibodies generated against the staphylococcus aureus collagen-adhesin, cna, as probes. these monoclonal antibodies recognize collagen binding epitopes on the surface of s. aureus and s. epidermidis cells. using this approach, we identified gehd, the  extracellular lipase originally found in s. epidermidis 9, as a collagen-binding  protein. despite the monoclonal antibody cross-reactivity, the gehd amino acid sequence and predicted structure are radically different from those of cna. the mature gehd circular dichroism spectra differs from that of cna but strongly resembles that of a mammalian cell-surface collagen binding receptor, known as the alpha(1) integrin i domain, suggesting that they have similar secondary structures. the gehd protein is translated as a preproenzyme, secreted, and post-translationally processed into mature lipase. gehd does not have the conserved lpxtg c-terminal motif present in cell wall-anchored proteins, but it can be detected in lysostaphin cell wall extracts. a recombinant version of mature gehd binds to collagens type i, ii, and iv adsorbed onto microtiter plates in a dose-dependent saturable manner. recombinant, mature gehd protein and anti-gehd antibodies can inhibit the attachment of s. epidermidis to immobilized  collagen. these results provide evidence that gehd may be a bi-functional molecule, acting not only as a lipase but also as a cell surface-associated collagen adhesin.

TI  == transposase-dependent formation of circular is256 derivatives in staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == is256 is a highly active insertion sequence (is) element of multiresistant staphylococci and enterococci. here we show that, in a staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolate, as well as in recombinant staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli carrying a single is256 insertion on a plasmid, is256 excises as an extrachromosomal circular dna molecule. first, circles were identified that contained a complete copy of is256. in this case, the sequence connecting the left and right ends of is256 was derived from flanking dna sequences of the parental genetic locus. second, circle junctions were detected in which one end of is256 was truncated. nucleotide sequencing of circle junctions revealed that (i) either end of is256 can attack the opposite terminus and (ii) the circle junctions vary significantly in size. upon deletion of the is256 open reading frame at the 3' end and site-directed mutageneses of the putative dde motif, circular is256 molecules were no longer detectable, which implicates the is256-encoded transposase protein with the circularization of the element.

TI  == assessment of peo/ptmo multiblock copolymer/segmented polyurethane blends as coating materials for urinary catheters: in vitro bacterial adhesion and encrustation behavior.
AB  == the effective long-term use of indwelling urinary catheters has often been hindered by catheter-associated infection and encrustation. in this study, the suitability of poly(ethylene oxide) (peo)-based multiblock copolymer/segmented polyurethane (spu) blends as coating materials for the commercial urinary catheters was assessed by measuring swellability, bacterial adhesion, and encrustation behavior. when exposed to pbs (ph 7.4), the blends absorbed a significant amount of water, which was proportional to the copolymer content. it  was demonstrated from bacterial adhesion tests that compared to bare spu, the blend surfaces could significantly reduce the adhesion of e. coli, p. mirabilis,  and s. epidermidis; the number of adherent bacteria correlated with the amount of copolymer additive. indicating that the swellability of the blends affected bacterial adhesion. of the bacteria studied, the greatest effect of the copolymer additive was observed in s. epidermidis adhesion, in which there was an 85% decrease compared to bare spu with a small amount of copolymer additive as low as 5% based on a dried blend. by using an artificial bladder model, allowing the catheter to be blocked by encrustation, it was revealed that the blend surfaces could effectively resist encrustation. the duration of patency was extended up to 20 +/- 3.1 h on the blend surface containing 10% of the copolymer additive, whereas the silicone-coated catheter, a control, required the least time for blockage, 7.8 +/- 3.1 h. the superior characteristics of the blends compared to other surfaces might be attributed to their peo-rich surfaces, produced by the migration of peo phase in the copolymer chain of the blends in an aqueous environment, and provide promising potential as a coating material on the urinary catheter for long-term catheterization.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of the marine alkaloids haminol and pulo'upone and related compounds.
AB  == the marine alkaloids haminol a, haminol b and pulo'upone as well as 17 related compounds (twelve 2-substituted pyridine derivatives, four 3-substituted ones and one analogue of the bicyclic terminus of pulo'upone) were tested for antimicrobial activity against a panel of six microbes (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae) using the paper disc agar diffusion method. six compounds were tested also against the mold aspergillus niger. some of the compounds displayed noteworthy antimicrobial activity, only one congener being completely devoid of activity. nearly all compounds had activity against b. cereus and s. epidermidis. the growth of e. coli, c albicans and s. cerevisiae was also distinctly inhibited by many compounds. in contrast, most compounds were inactive or had minimal activity against p. aeruginosa. interestingly, most of the compounds tested against the opportunistic pathogen a. niger were active, one of them having noteworthy inhibitory potency.

TI  == characterization and molecular cloning of a glutamyl endopeptidase from staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == a novel extracellular endopeptidase, designated gluse, was purified from staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 14990 cultured by the dialysis membrane technique, and the structural gene (gsea) was cloned. gluse was a 27kda, glutamic acid-specific protease, and the optimal ph was 8.0. the proteolytic activity was  specifically inhibited with diisopropyl fluorophosphate, indicating that it is a  serine protease. the gsea encoded a single polypeptide of 282 amino acids with a  deduced molecular weight of 30,809, in which the first 19 n-terminal amino acids  completely matched the deduced sequence starting at val-67, suggesting that gluse is synthesized with a propeptide. the amino acid sequence of gluse exhibited 50.5% identity to staphylococcus aureus v8-protease (gluv8). although gluse lacks a c-terminal 12 repeats of the pbn/pbz tripeptide of gluv8, a catalytic triad of  his-117, asp-159 and ser-235 was conserved in gluse. southern hybridization analysis revealed that gsea exists as a single copy on the chromosomal dna. the finding that production of gluse was obviously observed in the adherent culture conditions of the dialysis membrane technique, but not in the planktonic culture  conditions, strongly suggests that gluse could be involved in an important etiologic process in s.epidermidis infection leading to multiple tissue damages.

AB  == in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of a series of 25 diazolidinium  salts, 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium (1), together with 1,3-dialkylpyrimidinium (2), were evaluated against standard strains: escherichia coli (atcc 25922), staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 12228), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), enterobacter cloacae (atcc 13047), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853) and candida albicans (atcc 10239). selective  and effective antibacterial activity against one gram-negative (p. aeruginosa) and two gram-positive (e. faecalis and s. aureus) bacteria were found in salts 1a, 1i and 1j, in contrast to modest to poor activity observed in the rest of the salts. the enhanced antibacterial activity is clearly linked to the introduction  of two bulky mesityl or mesitylbenzyl substituents on the nitrogen atoms of the imidazoline skeleton, while the side chain of the backbone of the molecule has no influence.

TI  == the outer membrane localization of the neisseria gonorrhoeae msra/b is involved in survival against reactive oxygen species.
AB  == the pilb protein of neisseria gonorrhoeae has been reported to be involved in the regulation of pilin gene transcription, but it also possesses significant homology to the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase family of enzymes, specifically msra and msrb from escherichia coli. msra and msrb in e. coli are able to reduce methionine sulfoxide residues in proteins to methionines. in addition, the gonococcal pilb protein encodes for both msra and msrb activity associated with the repair of oxidative damage to proteins. in this work, we demonstrate that the pilb protein of neisseria gonorrhoeae is not involved in pilus expression. additionally, we show that wild-type n. gonorrhoeae produces two forms of this polypeptide, one of which contains a signal sequence and is secreted from the bacterial cytoplasm to the outer membrane; the other lacks a signal sequence and is cytoplasmic. furthermore, we show that the secreted form of the pilb protein is involved in survival in the presence of oxidative damage.

TI  == [neonatal meningitis. epidemiological study of the grupo de hospitales castrillo].
AB  == objectives: a prospective multicenter study was designed to assess the incidence, etiology, risk factors and outcomes of vertically transmitted and nosocomial meningitis in neonates over a two-year period. patients and methods: cases of neonatal meningitis diagnosed between january 1, 1997 and december 31, 1998 in the neonatology departments of 28 acute-care hospitals in spain ("grupo de hospitales castrillo") were prospectively studied. bacteriological meningitis was considered confirmed when cerebrospinal fluid culture (csf) was positive for bacteria, virus or fungi, probable when csf culture was negative but blood culture was positive, and unconfirmed when both cultures were negative. results:  during the study period, 151 cases of meningitis were diagnosed. transmission was vertical in 84 cases and nosocomial in 67. the incidence of vertically transmitted meningitis was 0.51 of live births, and was significantly higher in very low birth weight (vlbw) infants. confirmed bacteriological meningitis was diagnosed in 66 patients (78.6 %). no risk factors were identified in 46.4 % of the patients. group b streptococcus (agalactiae) was isolated in 48.5 % of cases  of confirmed meningitis and escherichia coli was isolated in 18.2 %. in 69.7 % of cases the results of blood culture were in agreement with those of csf culture. the overall mortality rate was 8.3 %; mortality was significantly higher in vlbw  infants (33.3 % vs 4.2 % in infants weighing 1,500 g). thirteen percent of survivors had sequelae. the incidence of meningitis of nosocomial transmission was 0.2 % of admissions and was more frequent in vlbw infants. confirmed bacteriological meningitis was diagnosed in 49 patients (73.1 %). two or more risk factors were present in 62.7 % of patients. e. coli was isolated in 26.5 % of cases of nosocomial meningitis and staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in  24.5 %. in 55 % of patients the results of blood culture agreed with those of csf culture. the overall mortality rate was 19.4 %. mortality was significantly higher in vlbw infants and 18.5 % of survivors showed sequelae. conclusions: the  incidence, mortality and sequelae of neonatal meningitis in spain were similar to those reported in recent studies. the most commonly isolated pathogens were group b streptococcus in vertically transmitted meningitis and e. coli and s. epidermidis in nosocomial meningitis. we believe the distinction between vertical and nosocomial meningitis to be appropriate because the epidemiology of these diseases is different, which implies a different therapeutic approach. the high percentage of positive blood cultures indicates the need to include lumbar puncture whenever systemic infection is suspected in the neonatal period.

TI  == bacterial contamination of saline nasal spray/drop solution in patients with respiratory tract infection.
AB  == this study evaluated the potential for bacterial contamination of saline nasal spray/drop solution after 3 days of clinical use in patients. twenty patients with upper respiratory infection used the saline as a spray, and 20 patients used the solution as drops. bacterial growth was present in 18 (907%) solution containers of the spray group and in 3 (157%) solution containers of the drops group (p <.005). twenty isolates were recovered from the spray group and 3 from the drops group. the predominate isolates included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha streptococcus species, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  escherichia coli, and proteus spp. this study demonstrates the contamination of nasal saline-dispensing solution used as a spray with micro-organisms that are part of the normal skin and nasal flora and gram-negative organisms of potential  enteric origin. these data support the use of nasal saline-dispensing solution as drops, rather than as spray. they also illustrate the risk for crossinfection if  a nasal solution is used by more than 1 patient.

TI  == neonatal sepsis of nosocomial origin: an epidemiological study from the "grupo de hospitales castrillo".
AB  == a prospective multicenter study was designed to assess the frequency, etiology, and mortality of nosocomial neonatal sepsis diagnosed between 1996 and 1997 in the neonatology services of 27 acute-care hospitals in spain ("grupo de hospitales castrillo"). nosocomial sepsis is defined in the literature using chronological criteria (> 3-7 days of life at the onset of symptoms); accordingly, there is the possibility of including late-onset maternally acquired sepsis or of excluding early-onset nosocomial sepsis (< 3-7 days of life). for these reasons, in this study, cases of nosocomial sepsis that developed at < or = 3-7 days after birth (early onset) were also recorded and maternally acquired sepsis diagnosed beyond 3-7 days of life were excluded. using these criteria in a total of 30,993 admissions to the neonatal units of the participating hospitals,  the nosocomial sepsis rate was 2.1% with an incidence density of 0.89 per 1000 patient days. sepsis rate was significantly more frequent among very low birth weight (vlbw) infants (15.6%) than among those weighing > or = 1500 g (1.16%) (p  < 0.001). fifty-eight percent of all isolates were gram-positive organisms, mainly staphylococcus epidermidis (42%). gram-negative organisms were isolated in 29.5% of cases (escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. were the most commonly isolated pathogens) and fungal infections in 12%, with absolute predominance of candida spp. the overall mortality rate was 11.8% and the following subgroups had significantly higher (p < 0.001) mortality rates: sepsis caused by gram-negative  organisms (19% vs. 5.1% in gram-positive pathogens) and sepsis caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa (33.3% vs. 9.4% for the total number of sepsis caused by the remaining causative pathogens). sepsis caused by s. epidermidis showed a significantly lower mortality rate (5.5%) compared with overall sepsis for the remaining etiologies (14.2%) (p < 0.001). in vlbw infants, the mortality rate was significantly higher than in infants weighing > 1500 g (17.3% vs. 6.5%, p < 0.001).

AB  == the sex pheromone cam373 of enterococcus faecalis and the related staph-cam373 of staphylococcus aureus were found to correspond to heptapeptides located within the c-termini of the signal sequences of putative prelipoproteins. the deduced mature forms of the lipoproteins share no detectable homology and presumably serve unrelated functions in the cells. the chromosomally encoded genetic determinants for production of the pheromones have been identified and designated came (encoding cam373) and cams (encoding staph-cam373). truncated and full-length clones of came were generated in escherichia coli, in which cam373 activity was expressed. in e. faecalis, insertional inactivation in the middle of came had no detectable phenotypic effects on the pheromone system. establishment  of an in frame translation stop codon within the signal sequence resulted in reduction of cam373 activity to 3% of normal levels. the cams determinant has homologues in staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis and listeria monocytogenes; however, corresponding heptapeptides present within those sequences do not resemble staph-cam373 closely. the particular significance of staph-cam373 as a potential intergeneric inducer of transfer-proficient genetic elements is discussed.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

AB  == introduction: urinary tract infections (uti) account for 2-5% of consultations in general practice, but only about half the patients with dysuria have significant  bacteriuria (> 100,000 bacteria per ml). a microbiological diagnosis can be made  by examination of a urine sample, and in danish family practice the diagnosis of  uti is often reached by a microscopic analysis or a dip-slide culture test. these methods have a high validity when performed in hospital, but we need knowledge about the validity of microbiological urine examinations when performed in general practice. the aim of this study was to validate detection of bacteriuria  by urine microscopy and dip-slide culture in general practice. material and methods: urine specimens artificially produced by adding a known quantity of bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis) to sterile urine were sent  to 25 general practices for microscopic examination and dip-slide culture. no prior instruction in testing procedure was given. as the gold standard, the results of a standardised culture method performed by skilled laboratory technicians at the department of microbiology, university of southern denmark, were used. results: significant bacteriuria was identified by microscopy with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83%. the corresponding figures for urine  culture were 95% and 96%. the morphology of bacteria was interpreted correctly in 80% of microscopic examinations, and 60% of the bacteria strains were classified  correctly in terms of their motility. discussion: the results of urine microscopy and culture performed in general practice are to be relied on.

AB  == objective: efficacy and duration of antibacterial activity of rifampicin-gelatin  grafts against virulent organisms were evaluated in an animal model. materials and methods: rifampicin-gelatin grafts were prepared with impregnation of gelseal (vascutek ltd, scotland) graft in 1 mg/ml rifampicin solution. rifampicin-gelatin grafts (6 cm long; n = 24) and plain gelseal grafts as controls (n = 4) were implanted into the canine abdominal aorta with inoculation of staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and the rifampicin-gelatin grafts were retrieved after 1 to 4 weeks. disks cut from the retrieved rifampicin-gelatin grafts were placed on agar plates streaked with one of the organisms, and the graft antibacterial activity was assessed with the width of the inhibition zone. results: in in vitro tests, initial inhibition zones (inhibition zone of 24 hours after incubation) of rifampicin-gelatin grafts against s epidermidis, mrsa, and e coli were 40.0 +/- 0.3 mm, 36.0 +/- 0.2 mm, and 11.8 +/- 0.1 mm, respectively. in the implantation,  s epidermidis -inoculated rifampicin-gelatin grafts had no findings of graft infection, and no colony growth was recognized on the plates streaked with the perigraft fluids. initial inhibition zones of s epidermidis -inoculated rifampicin-gelatin grafts retrieved at 1 or 2 weeks were 20.1 +/- 1.1 mm and 7.6  +/- 1.0 mm, respectively. in e coli -inoculated and mrsa-inoculated rifampicin-gelatin grafts, all of the eight animals had perigraft abscess, and blood culture test results probed septicemia in five animals with patent grafts at death. inhibition zones against e coli or mrsa were not formed on the plates streaked with the same organism, whereas initial inhibition zones of e coli -inoculated and mrsa-inoculated rifampicin-gelatin grafts on s epidermidis -streaked plates were 8.0 +/- 0.2 mm and 18.5 +/- 0.5 mm, respectively. in the mrsa group, however, recolonization of high minimal inhibitory concentration strains developed within the inhibition zones as early as 24 hours. histologically, neither organisms nor inflammatory cells were found in s epidermidis -inoculated rifampicin-gelatin grafts and tissue ingrowth was recognized at 2 to 4 weeks, whereas e coli -inoculated and mrsa-inoculated rifampicin-gelatin grafts had aggressive neutrophil infiltration into the graft interstices, revealing establishment of uncontrollable graft infection. conclusion: these results suggested that rifampicin-gelatin grafts are clearly valid for s epidermidis infection, whereas no efficacy was recognized against either mrsa or e coli graft infection because of early development of high minimal inhibitory concentration mrsa strains or poor susceptibility.

TI  == men 10700, a new penem antibiotic: in vitro antibacterial activity on clinical isolates.
AB  == men 10700 is a new broad-spectrum penem, currently in preclinical development. in the present study, the activity of men 10700 was compared to that of imipenem, meropenem, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin against 619 gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains, and to that of imipenem, meropenem, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime and ampicillin/sulbactam against 38 strains of ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli, and against 19 extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains of the kes group. men 10700 was highly active against most gram-positive and gram-negative strains, and overall demonstrated comparable activity to imipenem and meropenem. methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis were highly susceptible to men 10700, which was the most potent among the antibiotics tested. men 10700 was less potent than the carbapenem antibiotics on morganella morganii, serratia marcescens and acinetobacter spp. ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli were uniformly  susceptible to men 10700, imipenem and meropenem, with mic90 values in the range  of < or = 0.12-0.25 mg/l, while showing much lower susceptibility to the other antibiotics tested, including the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime. this  feature was even more evident in esbl-producing strains of the kes group, with an mic90 of 1- 2 mg/l for men 10700, imipenem and meropenem, and a mic90 of 16-64 mg/l for the other antibiotics tested, including cefepime.

TI  == nosocomial pneumonia in pediatric patients: practical problems and rational solutions.
AB  == nosocomial pneumonia is a common hospital-acquired infection in children, and is  often fatal. risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia include admission to an intensive care unit, intubation, burns, surgery, and underlying chronic illness.  viruses, predominantly respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), are the most common cause of pediatric nosocomial respiratory tract infections. gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) are the predominant bacterial pathogens, and are associated with a high mortality rate. staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis are the most common gram-positive bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia; infections with these organisms have a better outcome than those with gram-negative organisms. an increasing problem is the emergence of multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative nosocomial pathogens. distinguishing nosocomial pneumonia from other pulmonary processes may be difficult; diagnosis is based on clinical signs, radiological findings, and microbiological results. recommended empiric therapy should consider factors such as the time of onset of illness, severity of disease, and specific risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia, including use of mechanical ventilation, underlying disease, or recent use of antibacterials. the  resident local hospital flora should be considered when selecting therapy for nosocomial pneumonia. early initiation of appropriate empiric therapy reduces morbidity and mortality. for empiric treatment of bacterial nosocomial pneumonia, an intravenous antibacterial regimen that includes coverage of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive organisms should be used. a carbapenem or ureidopenicillin derivative (piperacillin) plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor should be used where extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae are endemic. therapy should be modified when a specific pathogen and its antimicrobial susceptibility are identified. effective prevention of nosocomial pneumonia requires infection control measures that affect the environment, personnel, and patients. of these, hand hygiene, appropriate infection control policies, and judicious use of antibacterials are essential.

TI  == [in vitro antimicrobial activity of glutaraldehyde plus o-phenylphenol association (ratio 2:1)].
AB  == background: the correct use of antiseptics, disinfectants and sterilization processes to inactivate or remove micro-organisms is an essential component of an effective infection control program. to reach this result the use of phenolic detergent-disinfectants which work well as a presoak has always been suggested in lieu of sterilization involving submerging instruments in a properly prepared glutaraldehyde solution for about 6 to 10 hrs. this study investigated the in vitro effectiveness of disinfectant solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 1%  o-phenylphenol. methods: the organisms used were purchased from the american type culture collection (escherichia coli atcc 25922, candida albicans atcc 10231, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228), and from our clinical collection (proteus mirabilis ch 14, klebsiella oxytoca ch 22, serratia liquefaciens ch 90). mic and  mbc were evaluated as testing solution for antimicrobial activity. the contact time studied between disinfectant and bacteria were 30 sec, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min. results: the results showed that mic values for most bacteria were 3.75 mg/ml. the mbc values were similar or higher than the mic. the disinfectant solution killed e. coli and c. albicans already after 10 min, but for s. aureus 30 min was necessary. conclusions: this study proved that this solution attained  the sterilization of surgical instruments in good timing and at low cost.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of covalently coupled quaternary ammonium silane coatings on silicone rubber.
AB  == biomaterial-centered infection is a dreaded complication associated with the use  of biomedical implants. in this paper, the antimicrobial activity of silicone rubber with a covalently coupled 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyldimethyloctadecylammonium chloride (qas) coating was studied in vitro and in vivo. gram-positive staphylococcus aureus atcc 12600, staphylococcus epidermidis hbh, 102, and gram-negative esherichia coli o2k2 and pseudomonas aeruginos ak1 were seeded on silicone rubber with and without qas-coating, in the absence or presence of adsorbed human plasma proteins. the viability of the adherent bacteria was determined using a live/dead fluorescent stain and a confocal laser scanning microscope. the coating reduced the viability of adherent staphylococci from 90% to 0%), and of gram-negative bacteria from 90% to 25% while the presencc of adsorbed plasma proteins had little influence. the biomaterials were also subcutaneously implanted in rats for 3 or 7 days, while pre- or postoperatively seeded with s. aureus atcc 12600. preoperative seeding resulted in infection of 7 out of 8 silicone rubber implants against 1 out of 8 qas-coated silicone rubber implants. postoperative seeding resulted in similar infection incidences on both implant types, but the numbers of adhering bacteria  were 70% lower on qas-coated silicone rubber. in conclusion, qas-coated silicone  rubber shows antimicrobial properties against adhering bacteria, both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides isolated from skin secretions of the diploid frog, xenopus tropicalis (pipidae).
AB  == seven peptides (xt-1-xt-7) with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the diploid clawed frog, xenopus tropicalis. structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that amino acid sequence similarity to antimicrobial peptides previously isolated from xenopus laevis was low, suggesting that the species are not closely related phylogenetically. peptides xt-5 and xt-3 are probably the orthologs of x. laevis  peptide glycine-leucine amide (pgl(a)) and the n-terminal spacer region of prolevitide, respectively. xt-1, xt-6 and xt-7 show limited structural similarity to the spacer region of x. laevis procaeruleins and the paralogs xt-2 and xt-4 are similar to corresponding regions of proxenopsin. orthologs of the magainins were not identified. the c-terminally alpha-amidated peptide xt-7 (gllgpllkiaakvgsnll.nh2) showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations against reference microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus 5 microm, escherichia coli 5 microm, and candida albicans 40 microm) and was also active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus group c, shigella sonnei, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. the peptide was, however, hemolytic against  human erythrocytes (50% lysis at 70 microm). circular dichroism studies showed that xt-7 has a random structure in aqueous solution, ph 7.0 but adopts an alpha-helical conformation in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol. decreasing the cationicity of xt-7 either by replacement of the c-terminal conh2 group by cooh or by deletion of the lys(8) residue produced analogs with greatly (>10-fold) decreased antimicrobial potencies.

TI  == grazing rates of diverse morphotypes of bacterivorous ciliates feeding on four allochthonous bacteria.
AB  == aims: the permanence in aquatic systems of allochthonous bacteria coming from sewage effluents is a risk for public health. this work aimed to analyse the elimination of the bacteria staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae by a riverine ciliate community. methods and results: the ciliates were characterized and identified on the basis  of morphological and behavioural features and grouped in nine morphotypes. differential grazing by each morphotype on the four allochthonous bacteria was carried out by adding fluorescently labelled bacteria to the water samples, and measuring their uptake along time. conclusions: the nine morphotypes were present in all the samples but in different proportions, being the most abundant the small scuticociliates and hipotrichs. the smallest morphotypes showed grazing rates lower than 20 flb ciliate(-1) h(-1), with a preference towards k. pneumoniae. the larger morphotypes showed in general the highest grazing rates, but the selectivity was hardly attributable to bacterial size or type of cell wall. conclusions, significance and impact of the study: the elimination of allochthonous bacteria in an aquatic system may be highly different depending on  the diversity of the ciliated protistan community in the system and on the nature of the bacterial prey.

TI  == first results using automated epifluorescence microscopy to detect escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis in wbc-reduced platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: many methods have been tested for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelets. however, only those using molecular biology or cell culturing consistently detect contamination at levels below 10(5) bacteria per ml. this report describes the initial investigation into an alternative method that offers the possibilities of high sensitivity and rapid response while using  available laboratory equipment and supplies. this method relies on a fluorescent  nucleic acid stain, which preferentially stains bacteria but not platelets, and automated epifluorescence microscopy for rapid analysis. measurements in wbc-reduced platelet concentrates (pcs) contaminated with bacteria are reported at concentrations between 10(3) and 10(6) bacteria per ml. study design and methods: staphylococcus epidermidis or escherichia coli was inoculated into aliquots of wbc-reduced pcs on days 2 through 5 of storage. bacterially inoculated and control pcs were stained, platelets and residual wbcs were lysed,  and 200 microl of sample was filtered onto black polycarbonate filters. all preparations were done in triplicate. an automated epifluorescence microscope examined approximately 2 percent of the area of each filter and used image analysis to select the fluorescent particles that should be counted as bacteria.  results: samples containing 3 to 5 x 10(3) bacteria per ml produced about three times as many fluorescent particles classified as bacteria as the controls. lower concentrations of s. epidermidis were detected because of higher fluorescence intensity. simultaneous preparation of six samples requires about 35 minutes. analysis of each prepared sample takes 10 minutes, for a total preparation and analysis time of about 95 minutes for 6 samples. conclusion: low concentrations (<5 x 10(3) bacteria/ml) of deliberately inoculated s. epidermidis or e. coli can be measured quickly in wbc-depleted pcs by using a fluorescent nucleic acid stain, differential lysis, and automated microscopy. continued refinement of the  method, studies employing other bacterial strains, and further validations of assay performance are warranted.

TI  == quantification of expression of staphylococcus epidermidis housekeeping genes with taqman quantitative pcr during in vitro growth and under different conditions.
AB  == the aims of the present study were (i) to develop and test a sensitive and reproducible method for the study of gene expression in staphylococci and (ii) to study the expression of five housekeeping genes which are involved in nucleic acid metabolism (gmk, guanylate kinase; the dihydrofolate reductase [dhfr] gene), glucose metabolism (tpi, triosephosphate isomerase), and protein metabolism (the  16s rrna gene; hsp-60, heat-shock protein 60) during in vitro exponential and stationary growth. a modified method for instant mrna isolation was combined with gene quantification via taqman real-time quantitative pcr. the detection limit of our method was 10 copies of rna. the average intersample variability was 16%. a 10-fold increase in the expression of the hsp-60 gene was induced by exposure to  a 10 degrees c heat shock (37 to 47 degrees c) for 10 min. during in vitro growth, the expression of all five housekeeping genes showed rapid up-regulation  after inoculation of the bacteria in brain heart infusion medum and started to decline during the mid-exponential-growth phase. maximal gene expression was 110- to 300-fold higher than gene expression during stationary phase. this indicates that housekeeping metabolism is a very dynamic process that is extremely capable  of adapting to different growth conditions. expression of the 16s rrna gene decreases significantly earlier than that of other housekeeping genes. this confirms earlier findings for escherichia coli that a decline in bacterial ribosomal content (measured by 16s rrna gene expression) precedes the decline in  protein synthesis (measured by mrna expression).

TI  == identification and characterization of a novel 38.5-kilodalton cell surface protein of staphylococcus aureus with extended-spectrum binding activity for extracellular matrix and plasma proteins.
AB  == the ability to attach to host ligands is a well-established pathogenic factor in  invasive staphylococcus aureus disease. in addition to the family of adhesive proteins bound to the cell wall via the sortase a (srta) mechanism, secreted proteins such as the fibrinogen-binding protein efb, the extracellular adhesion protein eap, or coagulase have been found to interact with various extracellular  host molecules. here we describe a novel protein, the extracellular matrix protein-binding protein (emp) initially identified in western ligand blots as a 40-kda protein due to its broad-spectrum recognition of fibronectin, fibrinogen,  collagen, and vitronectin. emp is expressed in the stationary growth phase and is closely associated with the cell surface and yet is extractable by sodium dodecyl sulfate. the conferring gene emp (1,023 nucleotides) encodes a signal peptide of  26 amino acids and a mature protein of a calculated molecular mass of 35.5 kda. using pcr, emp was demonstrated in all 240 s. aureus isolates of a defined clinical strain collection as well as in 6 s. aureus laboratory strains, whereas  it is lacking in all 10 s. epidermidis strains tested. construction of an allelic replacement mutant (memp50) revealed the absence of emp in memp50, a significantly decreased adhesion of memp50 to immobilized fibronectin and fibrinogen, and restoration of these characteristics upon complementation of memp50. emp expression was also demonstrable upon heterologous complementation of s. carnosus. remp expressed in escherichia coli interacted with fibronectin, fibrinogen, and vitronectin in surface plasmon resonance experiments at a k(d) of 21 nm, 91 nm, and 122 pm, respectively. in conclusion, the biologic characterization of emp suggests that it is a member of the group of secreted s.  aureus molecules that interact with an extended spectrum of host ligands and thereby contribute to s. aureus pathogenicity.

TI  == rl-37, an alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide of the rhesus monkey.
AB  == rhesus monkey bone marrow expresses a cathelicidin whose c-terminal domain comprises a 37-residue alpha-helical peptide (rl-37) that resembles human ll-37.  like its human counterpart, rl-37 rapidly permeabilized the membranes of escherichia coli ml-35p and lysed liposomes that simulated bacterial membranes. when tested in media whose nacl concentrations approximated those of extracellular fluids, rl-37 was considerably more active than ll-37 against staphylococci. whereas human ll-37 contains five acidic residues and has a net charge of +6, rhesus rl-37 has only two acidic residues and a net charge of +8. speculating that the multiple acidic residues of human ll-37 reduced its efficacy against staphylococci, we made a peptide (ll-37 pentamide) in which each aspartic acid of ll-37 was replaced by an asparagine and each glutamic acid was replaced by a glutamine. ll-37 pentamide's antistaphylococcal activity was substantially greater than that of ll-37. thus, although the precursor of ll-37 is induced in human skin keratinocytes by injury or inflammation, its insufficiently cationic antimicrobial domain may contribute to the success of staphylococci in colonizing and infecting human skin.

TI  == [experimental study of photodynamic effect on bacterial wound microflora].
AB  == the in vitro study of the influence of photodynamic action (with the use of photosensitizer "photosens", laser and non-laser irradiation) on the strains of the main representatives purulent wound microflora was carried out. staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli,  proteus mirabilis cultures have been isolated from wound secretions and identified. the photosensitizer was shown to produce no bactericidal effect by itself. irradiation with laser and non-laser light sources induced a sharp decrease in the number of viable cells in the cultures under study. the irradiation of the photosensitizer led to its activation, manifested in bactericidal action. the results thus obtained confirm good prospect of using photodynamic therapy for the treatment of purulent wounds.

TI  == the significance of asymptomatic bacteremia for the newborn.
AB  == background: so far, there has been no systematic detection of asymptomatic bacteremia in pregnant women. consequently, its possible effects on newborn infants have not been discussed. the aim of this study was to determine the incidence of asymptomatic bacteremia in pregnant and parturient women and neonates as well as to assess its influence on the health condition of newborn infants during the first three months of life. methods: a total of 626 blood cultures were taken from 353 pregnant women (with single-fetus pregnancy)and their newborns: 156 during pregnancy, and immediately after delivery from 235 mothers and their 235 newborns. blood culture results were clinically and statistically analyzed along with data on the development of the newborns. results: positive blood culture was found in 12% of pregnant women, in 19% of parturient women and 25% of the newborns. the most often isolated bacteria were:  staphylococcus epidermidis in 36 cases (18%), escherichia coli in 35 cases (17.5%) and enterococcus in 20 cases (10%). asymptomatic bacteremia was found to  be in a statistically significant correlation with signs and symptoms of life-threatening conditions (p<0.01), early-onset and late-onset infections and other disorders occurring in newborn infants (p<0.05), mostly of the female sex.  conclusion: it seems that asymptomatic bacteremia cannot be considered harmless but appears to influence the health of newborns.

TI  == multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  == cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. amikacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance  to ss-lactam antibiotics. only 1% of the escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. this rate was higher for other enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for p. aeruginosa. the cross-resistance of oxacillin with other  antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. cross-resistance was only a minor problem in h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis. cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

TI  == comparison of translocation of different types of microorganisms from the intestinal tract of burned mice.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the ability of various microorganisms to translocate from the intestine to the mesenteric lymph nodes (mlns), liver, and spleen in a burned mouse model. balb/c mice were gavaged with 1 x 10(9) or 1 x 10(10) of one of 11 different microorganisms. all animals were then given a 20% burn. survival after 10 days showed no significant difference between any of the  groups at the 10(10) dose. at the 10(9) dose, significantly higher survival rates were found in three of the 11 strains. microbial translocation (gavage of 10(10)  111in-labeled organisms) and host's ability to kill translocated bacteria (viable bacteria in tissues) were measured followed by burn injury and sacrifice four hours later. translocation and killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli was high in the mlns compared with all other groups but translocation was lower to the liver. klebsiella, pseudomonas, and serratia translocated more evenly to all the tissues. however, these groups showed very high clearance of bacteria in the liver and spleen except for klebsiella and one  strain of pseudomonas in the spleen. candida showed poor translocation to all of  the tissues and high clearance. it is concluded that various strains of bacteria  translocate from the intestine to a similar degree after injury, but the tissues  to which they translocate and the rate at which they are killed are somewhat strain dependent.

TI  == uv raman spectral intensities of e. coli and other bacteria excited at 228.9, 244.0, and 248.2 nm.
AB  == resonance raman spectral intensities per average bacterial cell have been measured quantitatively for gram-negative escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes, as well as gram-positive bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus epidermidis. spectra have been obtained from cultures in the lag,  log, and stationary growth phases excited in turn by 228.9, 244.0, and 248.2 nm light. although raman spectral peak positions (cm(-1)) excited by a given wavelength are very similar for all five bacterial species, the organisms are characterized by significantly different spectral intensity values. intensity changes are associated with growth phase changes in all of the species as well. a comparison of measured with estimated average intensities has been made for spectra of log-phase e. coli. it is possible to compare measured intensities with intensities estimated for log-phase e. coli on the basis of the knowledge of its  known average cellular molecular composition. a significant degree of hypochromism is observed in e. coli nucleic acid spectra. in contrast, strong average hyperchromism characterizes all aromatic amino acid peaks belonging to the same e. coli cells. results suggest that knowledge of spectral intensity values will enhance significantly the capability to identify bacteria by means of their uv resonance raman spectra.

TI  == assessment of resistance towards biocides following the attachment of micro-organisms to, and growth on, surfaces.
AB  == aims: to develop a rapid method for the assessment of biocidal activity directed  towards intact biofilms. methods and results: escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis were cultured for up to 48 h within 96-well microtitre plates. the planktonic phase was removed and the wells rinsed. residual biofilms were exposed to various concentrations of chloroxylenol, peracetic acid, polyhexamethylene biguanide (phmb), cetrimide or phenoxyethanol for 1 h. at 15-min intervals, biocide was removed, and the wells washed in neutraliser and filled with volumes  of fresh medium. re-growth of the cultures was monitored during incubation at 35  degrees c in the plate reader. times taken for the treated wells to re-grow to fixed endpoints were determined and related to numbers of surviving cells. time--survival curves were constructed and the survival of the attached bacteria, following exposure to the agents for 30 min, interpolated for each biocide concentration. log--log plots of these survival data and biocide concentration were constructed, and linear regression analysis performed in order to (i) calculate concentration exponents and (ii) compare the effectiveness of the biocides between variously aged biofilm and planktonic cells. from such analyses  iso-effective concentrations of biocide (95% kill in 30 min) were calculated and  expressed as planktonic : biofilm indices (pbi). conclusion: pbi varied between 1.02 and 0.02, were relatively unaffected by age of the biofilms but differed significantly between organism and biocide. notably those compounds with the higher activity against planktonic bacteria (phmb and peracetic acid) were most prone to a biofilm effect but remained the most effective of the agents selected. significance and impact of the study: the endpoint method proved robust, enabled  the bactericidal effects of the biocides to be assessed against in-situ biofilms, and was suitable for routine screening applications.

TI  == diagnosis and management of osteomyelitis.
AB  == acute osteomyelitis is the clinical term for a new infection in bone. this infection occurs predominantly in children and is often seeded hematogenously. in adults, osteomyelitis is usually a subacute or chronic infection that develops secondary to an open injury to bone and surrounding soft tissue. the specific organism isolated in bacterial osteomyelitis is often associated with the age of  the patient or a common clinical scenario (i.e., trauma or recent surgery). staphylococcus aureus is implicated in most patients with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli are commonly isolated in patients with chronic osteomyelitis. for optimal results, antibiotic therapy must be started early, with antimicrobial agents administered parenterally for at least four to six weeks. treatment generally involves evaluation, staging, determination of microbial etiology and susceptibilities, antimicrobial therapy and, if necessary, debridement, dead-space management and stabilization of bone.

TI  == activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  == this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were  susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was  statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the  presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of positively charged surfaces on adhering gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the infection of biomaterials is determined by an interplay of adhesion and surface growth of the infecting organisms. in this study, the antimicrobial effects on adhering bacteria of a positively charged poly(methacrylate) surface (xi potential +12 mv) were compared with those of negatively charged poly(methyl  methacrylate) (-12 mv) and a highly negatively charged poly(methacrylate) (-18 mv) surface. initial adhesion of staphylococcus aureus atcc 12600, staphylococcus epidermidis hbh(2) 102, escherichia coli o2k2 and pseudomonas aeruginosa ak1 to these surfaces was measured in a parallel plate flow chamber in phosphate-buffered saline. adhering bacteria were allowed to multiply by perfusing the flow chamber with growth medium. all bacteria adhered most rapidly  to the positively charged surface, but there was no subsequent surface growth of  the gram-negative strains. on the negatively charged surfaces, despite a slower initial adhesion, surface growth of the adhering bacteria was exponential for both gram-positive and gram-negative strains. these results suggest that positively charged biomaterial surfaces exert an antimicrobial effect on adhering gram-negative bacteria, but not on gram-positive ones.

TI  == sdrg, a fibrinogen-binding bacterial adhesin of the microbial surface components  recognizing adhesive matrix molecules subfamily from staphylococcus epidermidis,  targets the thrombin cleavage site in the bbeta chain.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis is an important opportunistic pathogen and is a major  cause of foreign body infections. we have characterized the ligand binding activity of sdrg, a fibrinogen-binding microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules from s. epidermidis. western ligand blot analysis showed that a recombinant form of the n-terminal a region of sdrg bound to the native bbeta chain of fibrinogen (fg) and to a recombinant form of the bbeta chain expressed in escherichia coli. by analyzing recombinant truncates and synthetic peptide mimetics of the fg bbeta chain, the binding site for sdrg was localized to residues 6-20 of this polypeptide. recombinant sdrg bound to a synthetic 25-amino acid peptide (beta1-25) representing the n terminus of the fg  bbeta chain with a kd of 1.4 x 10(-7) m as determined by fluorescence polarization experiments. this was similar to the apparent k(d) (0.9 x 10(-7) m)  calculated from an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay where sdrg bound immobilized fg in a concentration-dependent manner. sdrg could recognize fibrinopeptide b (residues 1-14), but with a substantially lower affinity than that observed for sdrg binding to synthetic peptides beta1-25 and beta6-20. however, sdrg does not  bind to thrombin-digested fg. thus, sdrg appears to target the thrombin cleavage  site in the fg bbeta chain. in fact, sdrg was found to inhibit thrombin-induced fibrinogen clotting by interfering with fibrinopeptide b release.

AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

AB  == human peritoneal mesothelial cells (hmcs) have a critical role in maintaining the intraperitoneal balance between fibrinolysis and coagulation by expressing the fibrinolytic enzyme, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tpa), as well as a specific plasminogen activator inhibitor (type 1; pai-1). during bacterial peritonitis, the balance between intraperitoneal generation and degradation of fibrin is disturbed. as a consequence, severe peritoneal damage occurs, which is  one of the leading causes of patient dropout from continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd) therapy. cultured hmcs isolated from omental biopsy specimens were used to study the effect of heat-killed strains (2 x 10(8)/ml) of  staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and escherichia coli on the synthesis of tpa and pai-1. conditioned media were obtained by incubating cells with the different bacterial strains. tpa and pai-1 antigen concentrations were measured in the cell supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. each of the three heat-killed microorganisms induced a time-dependent increase in pai-1 synthesis. after a 48-hour incubation period, the strongest effect was seen in the presence of s aureus (3.5-fold versus control), followed by s epidermidis (2.5-fold versus control) and e coli (1.5-fold versus control). under the same conditions, tpa antigen levels did not change after exposure to s aureus or e coli, whereas the addition of s epidermidis resulted in enhanced tpa antigen production (2-fold versus control). the increase in pai-1 synthesis in the presence of the heat-killed microorganisms was preceded by similar changes in interleukin-1alpha (il-1alpha) levels. inhibiting the activity of il-1alpha with  a neutralizing antibody significantly reduced bacterial-induced pai-1 production. our results indicate that the fibrinolytic imbalance during bacterial peritonitis depends on the bacterial species. the increase in pai-1 synthesis, not the decrease in the production of tpa, alters mesothelial fibrinolytic activity. because the increase in pai-1 expression is significantly quenched by blocking the activity of il-1alpha, the mesothelial release of this cytokine is involved in bacterial-induced changes in the fibrinolytic system.

TI  == synthesis of mannich bases of some 2,5-disubstituted 4-thiazolidinones and evaluation of their antimicrobial activities.
AB  == 5-phenyl/methyl-5-morpholinomethyl/pyrrolidinomethyl-2-(5- aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (5a-m) were synthesized by the reaction of 5-phenyl/methyl-2-[(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol -2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (4a-j) with formaldehyde and morpholine or pyrrolidine. the structures of the compounds were determined by analytical and spectral (ir, 1h-nmr, eims) methods. the antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against candida albicans atcc 10231 were tested using the disk diffusion method. compounds 5a, 5b, 5c, 5e, 5g, and 5h were found  to be active against s. aureus atcc 6538 (mic: 312.5; 39; 19.5; 39; 156; and 78 micrograms/ml respectively) and compounds 5c and 5h against s. flexneri (mic: both 312.5 micrograms/ml). the minimal inhibitory concentrations of these compounds were determined using the micro dilution method.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol, the main constituents of magnolia officinalis was investigated. the antimicrobial activity was assayed by  the agar dilution method using brain heart infusion medium and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were determined for each compound using a twofold  serial dilution assay. the results showed that honokiol and magnolol have a marked antimicrobial effect (mic = 25 microg/ml) against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis, but did not show antimicrobial activity (mic > or = 100 microg/ml) for shigella flexneii, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. our results indicate that honokiol and magnolol, although less potent than tetracycline, show a significant antimicrobial activity for periodontal pathogens. hence we suggest that honokiol and magnolol might have the potential to be an adjunct in the treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == optimization of the resistance of arterial allografts to infection: comparative study with synthetic prostheses.
AB  == arterial allografts can be used for in situ treatment of prosthetic graft infection. the purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the resistance of allografts and synthetic prostheses to infection by five strains of bacteria and  to study antibiotic treatments designed to reduce allograft infection. fresh and  cryopreserved allografts were compared with synthetic prostheses made of various  biomaterials including ptfe, plain dacron, gelatine-sealed dacron, and gelatine-sealed, rifampicine-bonded dacron. allografts were used with or without  treatment using an antibiotic containing gentamycine, lincomycine, and vancomycine. the bacterial strains tested were escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, slime-producing staphylococcus epidermidis, non-slime-producing staphylococcus epidermidis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. infection was evaluated by counting the number of adherent bacteria on the allograft or synthetic material after rinsing and ultrasonication. statistical analysis was achieved using nonparametric mann-whitney tests. results showed that allografts not treated with antibiotics were highly susceptible to bacterial infection. antibiotic treatment decreased infection. application of antibiotic after thawing cryopreserved allografts led to a significant decrease. none of the biomaterials  tested provided sufficient protection against bacteria resistant to the antibiotics used.

TI  == interaction of bladder glycoprotein gp51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  == purpose: a major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein gp51 (molecular weight 51 kd.). gp51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. gp51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). increased urinary gp51 occurs during urinary tract infection. to elucidate the role of gp51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. materials and methods: elisa was performed to demonstrate the binding of gp51 and various uropathogens. immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to gp51 to determine the interaction of gp51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis. infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize gp51. antigen inhibition elisa was done to quantitate urinary gp51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. results: elisa revealed that gp51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. immunochemical methods confirmed that purified gp51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. clinical specimens showed gp51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial  cells. we observed a significant increase in urinary gp51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). conclusions: these studies suggest that gp51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.

TI  == how quantitative is quantitative pcr with respect to cell counts?
AB  == quantitative diagnostic pcr systems based upon rdna targeted primer and probe combinations were developed for the detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas alcaligenes, enterococci, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. primers and probes were designed in silico using the arb software package (tu munich) in combination with primer design software of pe applied biosystems. purified genomic dna or bacterial cells of target and reference organisms were used for the evaluation of the pcr assays applying the taqman technique on an abi prism tm 7700 sequence detection system (pe applied biosystems). sensitive, reliable and reproducible quantification of target rdna could be achieved applying primer-probe combinations that mediate in vitro amplification of dna fragments smaller than 100 base pairs. large amounts of non target dna (1 mg per sample) remarkably affected the quantification potential of the approach resulting in an underestimation of the amounts of target dna. one of the principal goals was to use quantitative pcr to study the correlation of gene and cell numbers depending  on the growth behavior of target organisms and to explore the potential to estimate cell numbers from target dna quantification. a clear correlation of rdna quantification and bacterial growth was observed, however, cell numbers cannot directly be estimated from quantitative pcr data, given that the cellular genome  content varies with the growth phase of the organisms. in the case of escherichia coli the cell numbers which could be assigned to a certain number of rdna targets varied reasonably depending upon the growth phase of batch cultures.

TI  == determination of the antibacterial efficacy of several antiseptics tested on skin by an 'ex-vivo' test.
AB  == there are many skin antiseptics commercially available. although their antibacterial activity has often been well studied, their potential effectiveness on skin remains poorly documented. to date, in-vivo protocols designed for the testing of the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics cannot use, for ethical reasons, pathogenic bacteria or new formulations whose toxicity in human subjects is unknown. an 'ex-vivo' test was recently developed to overcome these problems.  freshly excised human skin from abdominal or breast reduction was placed in a diffusion cell containing a maintenance medium in the recipient compartment. a bacterial inoculum was then applied to the stratum corneum and, after a drying step, antiseptic formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. several micro-organisms were investigated: - staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant ent. faecium (vre), s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli--with several biocides--para-chloro-meta-xylenol (pcmx, active compound of dettol), povidone iodine, triclosan (in isopropanol) and chlorhexidine. results from the ex-vivo test were compared with results obtained  in suspension and glass-carrier tests. the bactericidal activity of the biocides  depended upon the test performed and results were generally significantly different from one method to the other. all biocides tested in the suspension test achieved >4 log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentrations, apart from povidone iodine tested against ent. faecalis and vre. the antibacterial activity  of biocides tested in the glass-carrier test was significantly lower than in the  suspension test, with the exception of triclosan in isopropanol, which was as effective in both suspension and glass-carrier test. in the ex-vivo test, triclosan in isopropanol achieved a log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentration of 1.105-1.771 (with the exception of p. aeruginosa with 0.758 log10 reduction). pcmx, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine achieved log10 reductions in viable bacterial concentration of 0.303-0.901. chlorhexidine tested against p. aeruginosa produced a 1.94 log10 reduction in concentration. these results confirm previous observations about the need for testing the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics on skin surface to determine their in-situ  efficacy and encourage further the use of the ex-vivo protocol.

TI  == predictors of acquiring a nosocomial bloodstream infection on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to identify independent predictors of acquiring a nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo). methods: this retrospective cohort consisted of 202 neonates  treated with ecmo from 1989 to 1998 at the author' institution. data collected included patient demographics, primary and secondary diagnoses, white blood cell  counts, antibiotic usage, presence of central lines, operative procedures, and outcome. surveillance blood cultures were drawn daily from the circuit using sterile technique to identify acquired pathogens. statistical analyses included logistic regression, cox proportional regression analysis, and discriminate analysis. results: there were 1,245 blood cultures drawn on 202 patients (6.2 cultures per patient), and a nosocomial bsi was identified in 7 patients (3.4%) during this 10-year span. these were infections that were neither present nor incubating on admission. pre-ecmo diagnoses of patients who had a nosocomial bsi  while on bypass included group b beta-hemolytic streptococcal sepsis (n = 2), herpes simplex viral sepsis (n = 1), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (n = 2), persistent pulmonary hypertension (n = 1), and congenital heart disease (n = 1).  the median time on ecmo before obtaining a positive culture was 390 hours. the infectious agents responsible for these bsis included staphylococcus epidermidis  (n = 5), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), and escherichia coli (n = 1). the major factor associated with acquiring a nosocomial bsi on ecmo was the duration of bypass (391 v 141 hours, p =.002). additionally, patients in the bsi group were more likely to have had an arterial catheter in place (16 v 7 days, p =.009) and  to have received more screening blood cultures (16 v 6 cultures, p < 001). white  blood cell counts, absolute neutrophil counts, and immature/total (i/t) ratios were not useful in predicting a nosocomial bsi. of the 31 patients who required ecmo for more than 10 days, 7 (23%) had a positive blood culture, and 5 of these  7 infants (71%) died (p =.03). conclusions: the only predictor of acquiring a nosocomial bsi on ecmo was the duration of support for greater than 10 days. because classical predictors of infection are unreliable while the patient is on  ecmo, the authors suggest that obtaining daily surveillance blood cultures beginning on the tenth day should be performed with prolonged ecmo courses. the authors confirmed previous reports of the association between a prolonged ecmo course and a high mortality rate. however, the authors speculate that, in actuality, the primary diagnosis leads to the prolonged course of support and is  the major factor in the infant' demise.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (ah plus, sealapex, ketac endo, and fill canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (calen and calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; micrococcus luteus atcc 9341, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 10541. there was a wild strain of streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with brain  heart infusion agar and muller hinton medium seeded by pour plate. calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm  wells or by using absorbent paper points. the plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. after incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% ttc gel and inhibition haloes were measured. all bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. however, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by ah plus, fill canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. we conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% ttc gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.

TI  == influence of human wet cerumen on the growth of common and pathogenic bacteria of the ear.
AB  == the available data on the effect of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth are not conclusive. nevertheless it is widely accepted that cerumen has a bactericidal effect. in this study the activity of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth was assessed by applying cerumen suspensions to bacterial cultures. bacterial counts  were performed before and after application of cerumen suspensions. a total of 383 assays was carried out with 73 pools of cerumen that were tested against cultures of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium spp., escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. an increase in growth occurred much more frequently than a decrease in growth in almost every microrganism tested, with the mean increase percentage  being much higher than the mean decrease percentage, except in the case of s. aureus. the largest average growth increase was obtained with e. coli. the largest average decrease in bacterial growth was recorded with s. marcescens. our study does not support the conception of a decrease in bacterial growth produced  by humen wet cerumen. in vitro, the most observable effect was in fact an increase in microbial growth.

TI  == cloning of the soda gene from corynebacterium melassecola and role of superoxide  dismutase in cellular viability.
AB  == the soda gene encoding the corynebacterium melassecola manganese-cofactored superoxide dismutase (sod) has been cloned in escherichia coli and sequenced. the gene is transcribed monocistronically; the predicted polypeptide is 200 amino acids long and associates in a homotetrameric, manganese-dependent form, able to  complement an sod-deficient e. coli mutant. a second open reading frame, coding for a putative 217-amino-acid protein with high homology to peptide methionine sulfoxide reductases from various origins, has been identified immediately upstream of soda in the opposite transcription orientation. the soda gene was inactivated by insertion of an integrative vector carrying a kanamycin resistance gene. the growth rate of the sod-deficient integrant was only slightly affected in bhi rich medium as well as in bmcg chemically defined medium, but was strongly affected by the presence of the redox-cycling agent paraquat. the sod deficiency  had, on the other hand, a deleterious effect on viability as soon as the culture  entered the stationary phase of growth in bhi medium. surprisingly, sod deficiency was able to rescue the dramatic loss of viability observed for the wild-type strain in bmcg synthetic medium when glucose was not the limiting growth factor.

TI  == inhibition of neutrophil elastase prevents cathelicidin activation and impairs clearance of bacteria from wounds.
AB  == the host defense roles of neutrophil elastase in a porcine skin wound chamber model were explored. analysis of wound fluid by acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, western blot, and bacterial overlay confirmed that the neutrophil-derived protegrins constituted the major stable antimicrobial polypeptide in the wound fluid. the application to the wound of 0.10 and 0.25 mm  n-methoxysuccinyl-alanine-alanine-proline-valine (aapv) chloromethyl ketone, a specific neutrophil elastase inhibitor (nei), blocked the proteolytic activation  of protegrins and diminished the associated antimicrobial activity as detected by radial diffusion assay against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans or by bacterial gel overlay against s epidermidis and e coli. the application of the related cathepsin g inhibitor (cgi), benzyloxycarbonyl-glycine-leucine-phenylalanine (zglf) chloromethyl ketone, had no effect. in wound chambers that received 10(6)  colony-forming unit (cfu)/ml of s epidermidis, the presence of nei significantly  decreased the 24-hour clearance of bacteria from the wound compared to wounds treated with cgi or solvent only. neither inhibitor, at 0.10 or 0.25 mm concentration, affected leukocyte accumulation or degranulation in the wound chambers. the in vitro microbicidal decrement due to nei was restored by an amount of the specific protegrin (pg-1), which was equivalent to the measured difference of protegrin between control and inhibited chambers. administration of 1 microg/ml exogenous pg-1 4 hours after chamber preparation was sufficient to normalize in vivo antimicrobial activity. although pharmacologic neis are promising candidates as anti-inflammatory drugs, they may impair host defense in  part by inhibiting the activation of cathelicidins by neutrophil elastase.

TI  == hepcidin, a urinary antimicrobial peptide synthesized in the liver.
AB  == cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides are abundant in animal and plant tissues involved in host defense. in insects, most are synthesized in the fat body, an organ analogous to the liver of vertebrates. from human urine, we characterized a cysteine-rich peptide with three forms differing by amino-terminal truncation, and we named it hepcidin (hepc) because of its origin in the liver and its antimicrobial properties. two predominant forms, hepc20 and hepc25, contained 20  and 25 amino acid residues with all 8 cysteines connected by intramolecular disulfide bonds. reverse translation and search of the data bases found homologous liver cdnas in species from fish to human and a corresponding human genomic sequence on human chromosome 19. the full cdna by 5' rapid amplification  of cdna ends was 0.4 kilobase pair, in agreement with hepcidin mrna size on northern blots. the liver was the predominant site of mrna expression. the encoded prepropeptide contains 84 amino acids, but only the 20-25-amino acid processed forms were found in urine. hepcidins exhibited antifungal activity against candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus, and aspergillus niger and antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and group b streptococcus. hepcidin may be a vertebrate counterpart of cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides produced in the fat body of insects.

TI  == effect of subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations on polysaccharide intercellular adhesin expression in biofilm-forming staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == biofilm production is an important step in the pathogenesis of staphylococcus epidermidis polymer-associated infections and depends on the expression of the icaadbc operon leading to the synthesis of a polysaccharide intercellular adhesin. a chromosomally encoded reporter gene fusion between the ica promoter and the beta-galactosidase gene lacz from escherichia coli was constructed and used to investigate the influence of both environmental factors and subinhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics on ica expression in s. epidermidis. it was shown that s. epidermidis biofilm formation is induced by external stress (i.e., high temperature and osmolarity). subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline and the semisynthetic streptogramin antibiotic quinupristin-dalfopristin were found to enhance ica expression 9- to 11-fold, whereas penicillin, oxacillin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, gentamicin, ofloxacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin had no effect on ica expression. a weak (i.e., 2.5-fold) induction of ica expression was observed for subinhibitory concentrations of erythromycin. the results were confirmed by northern blot analyses of ica transcription and quantitative analyses of biofilm formation in a colorimetric assay.

AB  == pathogen-specific antibiotics kill the offending species without inviting the patient's flora to help develop a resistance mechanism. the current scarcity of pathogen-specific antibiotics reflects the rarity of essential genes that are also not widely represented in and conserved among species. the femx enzyme that  initiates the synthesis of the interchain peptide of the peptidoglycan in a subset of bacterial species was purified from lactobacillus viridescens. subsequently, the encoding femx gene was cloned and sequenced using reverse genetics. the femx gene is a member of the femab family, a large family of genes  previously implicated in interchain peptide synthesis but with unknown specific functions. mutagenesis of the femx gene identified the members of the extended femabx family as novel nonribosomal peptidyltransferases. determinants of femx complex substrate recognition and a strong stimulator of femx activity were also  identified. the femabx family members are ideal candidates for pathogen-specific  antibiotic development.

AB  == the microbial cause of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis is an important determinant of clinical outcome and the basis of widely used treatment guidelines. five hundred forty-six cases of peritonitis in 374 patients from 1991 to 1998 were analyzed. the rate of peritonitis declined significantly from 1.37 episodes/patient-year in 1991 to 0.55 episode/patient-year in 1998 (p = 0.02). the rate of gram-positive peritonitis decreased significantly from 0.75 to 0.28 episode/patient-year during the same period (p = 0.02). conversely, the occurrence of gram-negative peritonitis remained constant at approximately 0.16 episode/patient-year (p = 0.28). staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus were the most common causes of peritonitis, isolated in 27.8% and 19.3% of the culture-positive cases, respectively. a distinct decrease in peritonitis caused by s epidermidis was observed, with 0.40 episode/patient-year in 1991 compared with 0.11 to 0.20 episode/patient-year during subsequent years. the rate of infections caused by s aureus decreased significantly over time from a high of 0.21 episode/patient-year in 1992 to a low of 0.04 episode/patient-year in 1998 (p = 0.01). pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and klebsiella: species were the most common causes of gram-negative peritonitis, identified in 7.1%, 6.8%, and 5.2% of culture-positive cases, respectively. the most dramatic increase in antibiotic resistance was seen among s epidermidis. from 1991 and 1992 to 1997 and 1998, resistance to ciprofloxacin increased from 5.4% to 47.8% (p = 0.003), and resistance to methicillin increased from 18.9% to 73.9% (p = 0.03). our study showed significant trends in the causative pathogens of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis and dramatic increases in antibiotic resistance. these data support further study and warrant reevaluation of current  treatment practices.

TI  == ecological antibiotic policy.
AB  == development of resistance to antibiotics is a major problem worldwide. the normal oropharyngeal flora, the intestinal flora and the skin flora play important roles in this development. within a few days after the onset of antibiotic therapy, resistant escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus epidermidis can be detected in the normal flora of volunteers or patients. horizontal spread  of the resistance genes to other species, e.g. salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, occurs by conjugation or transformation. an  ecologically sound antibiotic policy favours the use of antibiotics with little or no impact on the normal flora. prodrug antibiotics which are not active against the bacteria in the mouth and the intestine (before absorption) and which are not excreted to a significant degree via the intestine, saliva or skin are therefore preferred. prodrugs such as pivampicillin, bacampicillin, pivmecillinam and cefuroxime axetil are favourable from an ecological point of view. experience from scandinavia supports this, since resistance to mecillinam after 20 years of  use is low (about 5%) and stable.

AB  == we reviewed all documented cases of septicaemia following caesarean deliveries in kandang kerbau hospital between 1st january 1993 to 31st december 1995. there were 22 cases of septicaemia among 8201 caesarean births, and hence the incidence is 2.7:1000. there were 45,412 deliveries, and the overall caesarean section rate was 18.1%. among the 22 documented cases of septicaemia which came under this study, the most common clinical conditions found were endomyometritis (7 cases),  urinary tract infection (6 cases), and wound infection (3 cases). one of the three cases with wound infection also had pneumonia. there was one patient who had mild transient myocarditis. we could not determine with certainty any site of infection in five patients. the most common bloodstream bacterial isolates was staphylococcus aureus (16), while the uncommon ones were acinetobacter baumanii (2), escherichia coli (1), klebsiella sp. (1), staphylococcus epidermidis (1), streptococcus group f (1), peptostreptococcus species and veillonella species (1). there was no mortality and prompt, vigorous treatment had led to uneventful  recovery in all the cases.

TI  == activity of cecropin p1 and fa-ll-37 against urogenital microflora.
AB  == two mammalian antimicrobial peptides, fa-ll-37 and cecropin p1, were tested for activity against six uropathogens and five lactobacillus strains by broth microdilution assay. both peptides inhibited escherichia coli at 25 microm (fa-ll-39), and 1.56 microm (cecropin p1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5 microm, and 25 microm), and klebsiella pneumoniae, (50 microm, and 1.56 microm), but not  enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis. fa-ll-37 acted bacteriocidally against e. coli and bacteriostatically against the other two gram-negative organisms. cecropin p1 was bacteriocidal to all susceptible bacteria. lactobacilli were resistant to both peptides, with the exception of poultry isolate lactobacillus fermentum b-54, which was susceptible to fa-ll-37 at 100 microm. the differential activities of these peptides toward gram-negative uropathogens versus urogenital lactobacilli demonstrate their potential as a topical treatment for urinary tract infections. in addition, production of such peptides in vivo could be a natural mechanism to aid in the maintenance of the lactobacilli-dominated urogenital flora at the expense of pathogens.

AB  == 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-[(chloroacetyl/alpha-chloropropionyl/al pha- bromobutyryl/alpha-chloro-(alpha-phenylacetyl)amino]thiazoles (i-iv) were synthesized by reacting 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-aminothiazole with chloroacetyl chloride, alpha-chloropropionyl chloride, alpha-bromobutyryl bromide and alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl chloride, respectively. furthermore, i-iv were refluxed with ammonium thiocyanate to give 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (v-viii). v was refluxed with various aromatic aldehydes to give 5-arylidene-2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-t hiazolidinones (ix-xiv). the structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, hydrolysis, uv, ir, 1h-nmr and ei mass spectral data. the antimicrobial activities of the compounds were assessed by microbroth dilution technique using  mueller-hinton broth and mueller-hinton agar. in this study, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis and candida albicans atcc  10231 were used as test microorganisms. among the tested compounds, xi and xiv showed activity against s. aureus (mic: 78 micrograms/ml, 1.6 micrograms/ml), whereas compound v had an activity against s. flexneri (mic: 39 micrograms/ml) and compound i against c. albicans (mic: 125 (micrograms/ml). compounds i, iv-xiv were also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv using the bactec 460 radiometric system and bactec 12b medium. only compounds i and xiv showed 86% and 67% inhibition in the primary screen.

TI  == the serine-aspartate repeat (sdr) protein family in staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis can express three different cell-surface-associated proteins, designated sdrf, sdrg and sdrh, that contain serine-aspartate dipeptide repeats. proteins sdrf and sdrg are similar in sequence and structural organization to the sdr proteins of staphylococcus aureus and comprise unique 625- and 548-residue a regions at their n termini, respectively, followed by 110-119-residue b-repeat regions and sd-repeat regions. the c termini contain lpxtg motifs and hydrophobic amino acid segments characteristic of surface proteins covalently anchored to peptidoglycan. in contrast, sdrh has a short 60-residue a region at its n terminus followed by a sd-repeat region, a unique 277-residue c region and a c-terminal hydrophobic segment. sdrh lacks a lpxtg motif. recombinant proteins representing the a regions of sdrf, sdrg and sdrh were expressed and purified from escherichia coli. antisera specific to these proteins were raised in rabbits and used to identify sdr proteins expressed by s. epidermidis. only sdrf was released from lysostaphin-generated protoplasts of cells grown to late-exponential phase. sdrg and sdrh remained associated with the protoplast fraction and thus appear to be ineffectively sorted along the conventional pathway used for cell-wall-anchored proteins. in southern hybridization analyses, the sdrg and sdrh genes were present in all 16 strains tested, whilst sdrf was present in 12 strains. antisera from 16 patients who had  recovered from s. epidermidis infections contained antibodies that reacted with recombinant a regions of sdrg and sdrh, suggesting that these proteins can be expressed during infection.

TI  == effect of radiographic contrast agents on leukocyte metabolic response.
AB  == background: the use of radiographic contrast media in the setting of possible bowel ischemia and potential perforation is known to carry a risk of morbidity and mortality. however, studies of the effect of available contrast media on host immunological defense mechanisms are lacking. we have examined the effect of barium and of two water-soluble contrast agents of differing iodine concentration and osmolality, conray 30 and cysto conray ii, on leukocyte phagocytosis. materials and methods: blood samples were incubated with the contrast media alone (termed the "resting state"), and in combination with a standard phagocytic challenge (zymosan polysaccharide extract) and with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis and escherichia coli, to determine the effect of contrast  media upon leukocyte phagocytic response. incubation with saline was used as control. in the case of barium, the "resting state" and standard challenge experiments were repeated at nine dilutions, ranging from 1:1 to 1:1000. the leukocyte phagocytic response was measured in two ways: co2 generation (an index  of metabolic activity) and chemiluminescence (an index of generation of reactive  oxygen species and bacterial killing). results: barium, at clinical dilutions, causes a significant increase of baseline "resting state" phagocytic activity, which in turn leads to significant blunting of subsequent response to phagocytic  challenge and adversely affects the response to all bacteria tested. there is no  baseline activation of leukocytes by the water-soluble media, although there was  some inhibition (rather than activation) of leukocyte metabolic activity. the effect of the water-soluble media on bacteria was more complex (although inhibition is minor compared to barium). conclusions: our data demonstrate that barium is a significant activator of phagocytic cells, which results in deactivation of phagocytic response when challenged; these data serve to explain  the enhanced adverse effect of barium in cases of fecal peritonitis.

TI  == evolution of microbial pathogens.
AB  == various genetic mechanisms including point mutations, genetic rearrangements and  lateral gene transfer processes contribute to the evolution of microbes. long-term processes leading to the development of new species or subspecies are termed macroevolution, and short-term developments, which occur during days or weeks, are considered as microevolution. both processes, macro- and microevolution need horizontal gene transfer, which is particularly important for the development of pathogenic microorganisms. plasmids, bacteriophages and so-called pathogenicity islands (pais) play a crucial role in the evolution of pathogens. during microevolution, genome variability of pathogenic microbes leads to new phenotypes, which play an important role in the acute development of an infectious disease. infections due to staphylococcus epidermidis, candida albicans and escherichia coli will be described with special emphasis on processes of microevolution. in contrast, the development of pais is a process involved in macroevolution. pais are especially important in processes leading to new pathotypes or even species. in this review, particular attention will be given to the fact that the evolution of pathogenic microbes can be considered as  a specific example for microbial evolution in general.

AB  == patients with antibody deficiency disorders are highly susceptible to bacterial infections. replacement therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin preparations (ivig) has been established in such patients for two decades. the efficacy of ivig treatment depends on the amount of functional pathogen-specific antibodies provided. the present study was undertaken to determine the levels of immunoglobulin classes, igg subclasses, and specific antibodies to bacterial surface antigens in two different ivig preparations (sandoglobulin and gamimmune) and blood sera of ivig-treated immunodeficient patients. the levels of igg, iga,  igm and igg subclasses were determined in both ivig preparations and in patients' sera and were compared with those of healthy individuals. sandoglobulin contained significantly higher concentrations of iga, igg, and igg4 than gamimmune. the latter contained higher concentrations of igg1. patients treated with gamimmune)  had significantly lower concentration of igg4 as compared with healthy individuals and sandoglobulin-treated patients. this finding was related to the preparation's composition. screening of 20 lots from each preparation for antibodies to frequent clinically isolated strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterococci spp. showed a high lot-to-lot variability. in order to overcome the lot-to-lot variability and correlate the observed effects with each ivig preparation, the administered ivig lots were selected so that their titers were in the interval of mean value +/- s.d. for each pathogen. the two tested preparations showed significant differences in their content of specific antibodies that ultimately affected the levels of these antibodies in treated patients. more specifically, sandoglobulin contained higher levels of antibodies to e. coli and s. epidermidis strains. infusion of this preparation maintained the respective antibodies in the recipients significantly higher than those of healthy individuals. gamimmune infusion led to similar and comparable levels. both ivig preparations had comparable antibody titers towards k. pneumoniae, provided high amounts of antibodies, and kept recipients' specific igg at levels significantly higher than those of the healthy individuals. enterococci spp. specific antibodies were significantly higher in gamimmune, whereas titers of antibodies towards s. aureus were comparable. levels of antibodies against both enterococci spp. and s. epidermidis after administration of both preparations were close to those in healthy individuals. none of the patients developed infection during the time of  the study. in conclusion, most of the lots of the two ivig preparations studied,  despite some quantitative differences, provide patients with sufficient amounts of antibodies to bacterial surface antigens that protect them against infections.

AB  == gemifloxacin (sb-265805) is a potent, novel fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. in this study, the efficacy of gemifloxacin was studied in experimental models of gram-negative pyelonephritis (caused by escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis) and gram-positive wound infection resulting from streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis or staphylococcus aureus. gemifloxacin activity against these pathogens was compared with those of amoxycillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, azithromycin, trovafloxacin,  grepafloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. oral treatment was initiated 1 h after infection and continued once or twice daily for 3 days. around 17 h after the end of treatment, animals were killed and the infected kidneys or the skin around the wound site were excised for the enumeration of viable bacteria. in the pyelonephritis model (either microorganism), gemifloxacin reduced bacterial numbers significantly (p < 0.01) compared with no treatment. no comparator agent  had a greater effect than gemifloxacin. notably, grepafloxacin and azithromycin were significantly less effective (p < 0.01) than gemifloxacin against e. coli pyelonephritis, and amoxycillin-clavulanate, azithromycin and trovafloxacin were  inferior (p < 0.01) against p. mirabilis infection. in the s. pyogenes wound infection model, gemifloxacin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and azithromycin reduced bacterial numbers significantly compared with controls (p <  0.01). results for the comparator quinolones were not significantly different from untreated controls (p > 0.05). gemifloxacin was also effective against staphylococcal infection, as were grepafloxacin and levofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin and tosufloxacin were significantly less effective against these pathogens than gemifloxacin (p < 0.01). no comparator agent had greater activity than gemifloxacin against s. pyogenes or s. aureus infections. these data demonstrate the potential benefit of gemifloxacin in the treatment of  gram-negative urinary tract infection and gram-positive skin and soft tissue infection.

(1998) j. infect. dis. 178, 1067-1078]. in this study, we showed that the adherence of h. influenzae to various epithelial, fibroblast-like and endothelial cell types was significantly enhanced by defensins (20 microg ml(-1)). defensins stimulated also the adherence of moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis and nonencapsulated streptococcus pneumoniae to the nci-h292 cell line. in contrast, defensins did not affect the adherence of pseudomonas aeruginosa, encapsulated s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. these results suggest that the defensin-enhanced  adherence might support the adherence and possibly persistence of the selected bacterial species using the respiratory tract as port of entry.

AB  == plastic materials used for food packaging are clean but not sterile when the food is just packaged. accidental wet contamination may occur at every moment between  packaging and opening by the consumer: on polyethylene (pet), bacteria may adhere strongly and constitute a biofilm in less than 24 h. by rolling on themselves, pet sheets may contaminate food. we tried to show that contact with salted foodstuffs favoured microbial recovery. four strains were chosen to perform biofilms on pet: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. biofilms were dried up 24 h. biofilm bacteria were stressed by adhesion, by starvation and by dehydration. however, they were capable of recovery in salted solutions or media, probably because one (or more)  stress protected them against another stress. stress was demonstrated by stress protein production, by mean of electrophoresis, and membrane lesions by mean of flow cytometry. stress recovery was performed in aqueous salted solutions or salted brain-heart infusion with nacl 9, 15, 20 and 30 g/l. staphylococci were more sensitive to these stresses and recovery was a function of salt concentration. gram-negative bacteria were little affected by stresses; salt effects were less important. if all these biofilms were capable of recovery from  stresses in salted media, flexible pet could possibly lead to a health hazard when it is used for wet salt meats, e.g.

AB  == the authors report the problem of central venous catheter appliance to the children with malignant diseases, employed for the first time in bosnia and herzegovina with the aim of pediatric oncologic patients treatment. during 1997 central venous catheter type hickman was used in nine children between two and half to eleven years old (average six years and one months). the average time of  catheter placement was six months, in two cases catheter were eliminated after two and three months respectively since application (spontaneous elimination and  repeated septic attacks, caused bu resistant bacterial strains). gram-positive bacteria have been isolated with eight children (staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis), and gram-negative enterobacteriaceae (serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytocia and pneumoniae, escherichia coli, salmonella group c and enterococcus faecalis) in samples taken  from the catheter and hemoculture. the central venous catheter is useful in treating oncological patients, but may cause serious consequences, like local infections or septicaemia.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of peptide deformylase inhibitors.
AB  == peptide deformylase catalyzes the removal of the n-terminal formyl group from newly synthesized polypeptides in eubacteria. its essential character in bacterial cells makes it an attractive target for antibacterial drug design. in this work, we have rationally designed and synthesized a series of peptide thiols that act as potent, reversible inhibitors of purified recombinant peptide deformylase from escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. the most potent inhibitor has a k(i) value of 11 nm toward the b. subtilis enzyme. these inhibitors showed antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) as low as 5  microm ( approximately 2 microg/ml). the pdf inhibitors induce bacterial cell lysis and are bactericidal toward all four bacterial strains that have been tested, b. subtilis, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and e. coli. resistance evaluation of one of the inhibitors (1b) against b. subtilis showed that no resistant clone could be found from >1 x 10(9) cells. quantitative analysis using a set of inhibitors designed to possess varying potencies against  the deformylase enzyme revealed a linear correlation between the mic values and the k(i) values. these results suggest that peptide deformylase is the likely molecular target responsible for the antibacterial activity of these inhibitors and is therefore a viable target for antibacterial drug design.

TI  == antimicrobial chemotherapy in the control of surgical infectious complications.
AB  == in spite of the progress in surgical technique and antibiotic prophylaxis, postoperative infection still accounts for both the commonest surgical complication and one of the most frequent nosocomial infections, also causing an  increase in duration and costs of hospital stay. the choice of treatment for post-surgical infections requires an understanding of the usual infecting flora,  available antimicrobial agents, and susceptibility patterns. the most common organisms in simple wound infection are gram-positive cocci and mainly staphylococcus aureus. staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus (quite often methicillin-resistant strains) are the organisms which predominate in the infectious complications following clean surgical procedures with implantation of vascular grafts or prosthetic devices. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora are mainly responsible for cases of intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic postoperative infections: the most common aerobes are enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, proteus spp., and others) and enterococci, and among anaerobes bacteroides fragilis group prevails. adequate drainage and surgical control of the source of  infection, when needed, and adjunctive effective antimicrobial therapy are important factors in successful treatment of postoperative infections. semisynthetic penicillinase-resistant penicillins and glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) are the drugs of choice for the treatment of infections caused by penicillin-resistant methicillin-sensitive, and methicillin-resistant, respectively, s. aureus and s. epidermidis. for the treatment of intra-abdominal  and intra-pelvic infections, animal and human studies support the recommendation  that treatment should be directed against both gram-negative enteric and anaerobic bacteria. combinations of aminoglycosides with clindamycin or metronidazole have been widely used with great success; however adverse reactions such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity have been a problem in some patients. in recent years monotherapy with either a carbapenem (imipenem/cilastatin or meropenem) or a penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination has been proposed. among these combination antimicrobials, piperacillin combined with tazobactam is a very well designed formulation. indeed, piperacillin is active against a broad range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, and tazobactam is a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor which acts on a variety of clinically important plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. this combination seems particularly attractive for the treatment of mixed polymicrobial anaerobic-aerobic infections such as intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic postoperative infections.

TI  == safety and cleaning of medical materials and devices.
AB  == a study was undertaken to evaluate different procedures to safely remove microorganisms, protein, and mammalian cells from materials and provide a suitable method for cleaning and assessing effectiveness of cleaning medical devices for reuse or for analysis of failure. safety considerations for the personnel performing the cleaning or handling the device after cleaning are important issues. polystyrene plates (96 well) were used to simulate device surfaces not amenable to manual scrubbing. staphylococcus epidermidis, candida albicans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oral flora were grown in  the plates. the plates were stained with crystal violet and the optical densities recorded. the results indicated that e. coli did not adhere well and pseudomonas  formed clumps that were easily detached from the surface of the plates. however,  s. epi, c. albicans, and the oral organisms formed adherent biofilms that were difficult to remove from the plates. detergents with enzymes and sodium hypochlorite (naocl) bleach were both effective in removing the biofilm. other detergents and surfactants were not effective. the aldehyde agents did not remove the organisms and made further cleaning difficult. allowing the biofilm to dry first made cleaning very difficult. only the naocl bleach could subsequently remove the dried or aldehyde fixed organisms from the wells. the same 96-well polystyrene plate format was used to measure the amount of protein and cell adherence as well as the effectiveness of subsequent cleaning. bradford reagent was used to detect protein as a measure of the cleaning efficacy. as with the bacteria, naocl bleach was effective at removing the protein and cells that had been dried or fixed by formalin or alcohol, whereas detergent with enzymes was not very effective. this study confirmed that used medical devices, contaminated  with microorganisms, protein, and/or mammalian cells, should not be allowed to dry before cleaning and that a thorough cleaning procedure should precede sterilization or disinfection (with the exception of naocl bleach which also cleans).

AB  == clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. the resistance of 50  strains each of methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus sp. (p. mirabilis 25 strains and p. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (isp), amikacin (amk), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against p. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. isp was effective against all strains except for 14% of mrsa, 2% of proteus sp., and 4% of p. aeruginosa. 2. six strains of mrsa were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases isp exhibited a relatively  low minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) compared to the other compounds. 3. four strains of mrsa were resistant to all drugs except isp. mrsa was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. twenty-one strains of mrsa and 1 strain of p. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both isp and amk. 5. against all strains tested, isp generally exhibited a lower mic compared to amk. these results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, isp is still an aminoglycoside having a  high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.

TI  == pyogenic psoas abscess: analysis of 27 cases.
AB  == from 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in taichung veterans general hospital. their age range was 25 to 85 years. diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. the duration of symptoms prior  to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (ct) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded  as primary. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, s. epidermidis, and salmonella spp.. in the secondary abscess category, e. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and candida albicans. the associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal  abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. the  initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess.  one patient had both drainage and debridement. others received medical treatment  only. two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is  still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.

TI  == a bone sialoprotein-binding protein from staphylococcus aureus: a member of the staphylococcal sdr family.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus bacteria, isolated from bone and joint infections, specifically interact with bone sialoprotein (bsp), a glycoprotein of bone and dentine extracellular matrix, via a cell-surface protein of m(r) 97000 [yacoub, lindahl, rubin, wendel, heinegard and ryden, (1994) eur. j. biochem. 222, 919-925]. amino acid sequences of seven trypsin fragments from the 97000-m(r) bsp-binding protein were determined. a gene encoding a protein encompassing all seven peptide sequences was identified from chromosomal dna isolated from s. aureus strain o24. this gene encodes a protein with 1171 amino acids, called bsp-binding protein (bbp), which displays similarity to recently described proteins of the sdr family from s. aureus. sdrc, sdrd and sdre encode putative cell-surface proteins with no described ligand specificity. bbp also shows similarity to a fibrinogen-binding protein from s. epidermidis called fbe. a serine-aspartic acid repeat sequence was found close to the cell-wall-anchoring leu-pro-xaa-thr-gly sequence in the c-terminal end of the protein. escherichia coli cells were transformed with an expression vector containing a major part of  the bbp gene fused to the gene for glutathione s-transferase. the affinity-purified fusion protein bound radiolabelled native bsp, and inhibited the binding of radiolabelled bsp to staphylococcal cells. serum from patients suffering from bone and joint infection contained antibodies that reacted with the fusion protein of the bsp-binding protein, indicating that the protein is expressed during an infection and is immunogenic. the s. aureus bbp protein may be important in the localization of bacteria to bone tissue, and thus might be of relevance in the pathogenicity of osteomyelitis.

TI  == mannose-binding lectin binds to a range of clinically relevant microorganisms and promotes complement deposition.
AB  == mannose-binding lectin (mbl) is a collagenous serum lectin believed to be of importance in innate immunity. genetically determined low levels of the protein are known to predispose to infections. in this study the binding of purified mbl  to pathogens isolated from immunocompromised children was investigated by flow cytometry. diverse candida species, aspergillus fumigatus, staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic group a streptococci exhibited strong binding of mbl, whereas  escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and haemophilus influenzae type b were characterized by heterogeneous binding patterns. in contrast, beta-hemolytic group b streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus epidermidis showed low levels of binding. bound mbl was able to promote c4 deposition in a concentration-dependent manner. we conclude that mbl may be of importance in first-line immune defense against several important pathogens.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial action of the essential oils of salvia desoleana and s. sclarea.
AB  == the chemical composition of the essential oils of salvia desoleana atzei & picci  and salvia sclarea l. from sardinia (italy) was analysed by gc and gc/ms. s. desoleana oil had a high content of monoterpenic esters (linalyl acetate and alpha-terpinyl acetate) and a lower amount of the corresponding alcohols while s. sclarea oil was characterised by a higher content of alcohols and lower quantity  of esters. we studied the antimicrobial activity of these oils concerning their use in pharmaceutical preparations for local application. only weak microbiostatic inhibitory activity was seen against s. aureus, e. coli, s. epidermidis and c. albicans, but since inhibition increased progressively with contact time, better results could be obtained by using these oils in bioadhesive formulations that would also have anti-inflammatory and peripheral analgesic action at a local level, as demonstrated in experimental animals following systemic application.

TI  == optimizing breast pocket irrigation: an in vitro study and clinical implications.
AB  == subclinical infections have been implicated in the etiology of capsular contracture. intraoperatively, breast pocket irrigation with povidone-iodine or other antibiotic solutions has been popularized; however, detrimental effects on  wound healing for these agents have been reported and their efficacy against common organisms found around breast implants has not been studied. the purpose of this study was to compare the in vitro efficacy of serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and two double antibiotic solutions dab-1 (gentamicin/polymyxin b) and dab-2 (gentamicin/cefazolin), against organisms most commonly found around breast implants. in phase i trials, serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and dab were combined 1:1 with cultures of five common organisms found around implants. in phase ii, povidone-iodine was serially diluted in dab-1 rather than saline. in phase iii, povidone-iodine was serially diluted with dab-2. efficacy for all phases was determined by plating the mixture onto agar plates and incubating at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. povidone-iodine was 100 percent effective at a dilution of 12.5% against staphylococcus epidermidis and 25% against staphylococcus aureus but relatively ineffective against escherichia coli and pseudomonas, dab-1 was found to be ineffective against s. epidermidis but effective against s. aureus, propionibacterium acnes, e. coli, and pseudomonas. in phase ii trials, a concentration of 12.5% povidone-iodine in dab was effective at killing all experimental bacteria. in phase iii trials, 10% povidone-iodine in dab-2 was effective at killing all bacteria tested. in conclusion, to maximize bacterial control of common breast implant organisms and to minimize the detrimental effects on wound healing, 10% povidone-iodine in gentamycin/cefazolin may be used with excellent results and its use clinically may reduce the incidence of capsular contracture.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide for prevention of bacterial growth on polymer biomaterials.
AB  == background: despite widespread use of potent antibiotics, infections of artificial implants and catheters are of increasing concern. we tested whether local treatment with 3% hydrogen peroxide (h2o2), long known as an inexpensive wound disinfectant, could prevent or reduce bacterial growth on polymer biomaterials. methods: two-centimeter-long pieces of polyurethane and silicone tubing were contaminated with a standardized solution of staphylococcus epidermidis (10(5)/ml) and then rinsed and wiped with saline (0.9%) solution. bacterial growth was assessed after incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 hours. bacterial colonies were compared for the following treatments: wiping only with saline; wiping with 1.5%, 2%, or 3% h2o2; pretreating biomaterials with 3% h2o2 and subsequent contamination for 2 and 4 hours without treatment after contamination; and contamination of tubings 1 month after pretreatment with 3% h2o2. the effect of 3% h2o2 was also assessed on contamination with escherichia coli. results: bacterial growth was reduced by more than 99% when the contaminated tubes were treated with 3% h2o2 compared with saline control (p < 0.001). lower concentrations of h2o2 were less effective. the length of the contamination period had no influence on the effectiveness of h2o2 when used on polyurethane but did with silicone tubings. pretreatment with h2o2 1 month before contamination still reduced bacterial growth rate by 90% on polyurethane and by 75% on silicone tubings. comparable effects on bacterial growth rate were observed for staphylococci (-90%, p < 0.001) and escherichiae (-90%, p < 0.001).  conclusions: local treatment with 3% h2o2 significantly reduced bacterial growth  on polymer biomaterials even for 1 month after treatment. this finding might influence clinical strategies of prevention of foreign body infection.

AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

(2 per cent each). the bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. the study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. it highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.

TI  == cell surface analysis techniques: what do cell preparation protocols do to cell surface properties?
AB  == cell surface analysis often requires manipulation of cells prior to examination.  the most commonly employed procedures are centrifugation at different speeds, changes of media during washing or final resuspension, desiccation (either air drying for contact angle measurements or freeze-drying for sensitive spectroscopic analysis, such as x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), and contact with hydrocarbon (hydrophobicity assays). the effects of these procedures on electrophoretic mobility, adhesion to solid substrata, affinity to a number of sepharose columns, structural integrity, and cell viability were systematically investigated for a range of model organisms, including carbon- and nitrogen-limited psychrobacter sp. strain sw8 (glycocalyx-bearing cells), escherichia coli (gram-negative cells without a glycocalyx), and staphylococcus epidermidis (gram-positive cells without a glycocalyx). all of the cell manipulation procedures severely modified the physicochemical properties of cells, but with each procedure some organisms were more susceptible than others.  considerable disruption of cell surfaces occurred when organisms were placed in contact with a hydrocarbon (hexadecane). the majority of cells became nonculturable after air drying and freeze-drying. centrifugation at a high speed  (15,000 x g) modified many cell surface parameters significantly, although cell viability was considerably affected only in e. coli. the type of washing or resuspension medium had a strong influence on the values of cell surface parameters, particularly when high-salt solutions were compared with low-salt buffers. the values for parameters obtained with different methods that allegedly measure similar cell surface properties did not correlate for most cells. these results demonstrate that the methods used to prepare cells for cell surface analysis need to be critically investigated for each microorganism so that the final results obtained reflect the nature of the in situ microbial cell surface as closely as possible. there is an urgent need for new, reliable, nondestructive, minimally manipulative cell surface analysis techniques that can  be used in situ.

AB  == c-reactive protein (crp) is an unreliable diagnostic tool in the early diagnosis  of neonatal septicaemia. however, serial measurements have been shown to be useful in monitoring the effectiveness of treatment. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether a specific crp response pattern to different groups of pathogens could be identified during treatment of neonatal septicaemia. serial crp measurements from day 1 to 4 in monomicrobial blood culture-proven episodes of septicaemia were reviewed. in 4416 admissions, 180 out of 206 positive blood cultures were monomicrobial; 121 monomicrobial septic episodes were eligible for  final analysis of the crp response during treatment. a low median (m) value (day  1 to 4) was identified in coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (m=23 mg/l), contrasting with high median values in staphylococcus aureus (m=58 mg/l), group b streptococci (m=51 mg/l), escherichia coli (m=51 mg/l) and candida species (m=76  mg/l) (p<0.001). median crp values in the two groups were different for each of the treatment days 1 to 4 (p<0.001). an increase (p<0.001) in crp during the 24 h before initiation of treatment was a sign of late-onset cons septicaemia. in episodes where antimicrobial treatment failed, crp levels were moderately elevated the day prior to treatment start and increased continuously thereafter,  whereas successful treatment was generally accompanied by a decline in crp in less than 4 days. the crp response to cons is significantly less pronounced than  to other commonly encountered pathogens in neonatal septicaemia. a rise in crp beyond the third day of empirical treatment should give rise to a suspicion of fungal infection or ineffective antibacterial treatment.

TI  == prolonged leaching time of peptide antibiotics from acrylic bone cement.
AB  == the leaching time of antibiotics in growth inhibitory concentrations from polyacrylic bone cements was determined using escherichia coli, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa as target bacteria. the leaching time of the peptide antibiotics vancomycin and polymyxin b nonapeptide was considerably longer than that of gentamicin, novobiocin, and erythromycin. among the nonpeptide antibiotics, the leaching time of novobiocin lasted longer than did that of gentamicin. the acylated parent polymyxin b antibiotic leached for a considerably shorter period than did the deacylated polymyxin b nonapeptide derivative, suggesting that the lipids impede the leaching process from the cement. cement beads impregnated with polymyxin b nonapeptide and introduced into the tibia of three rabbits receiving oral novobiocin protected bone infection against a challenge of pseudomonas aeruginosa that otherwise caused infection in  tibias containing gentamicin impregnated cement beads. the peptide antibiotics alone or in combination with other antibiotics (polymyxin b nonapeptide and novobiocin) impregnated in cements for orthopaedic procedures may provide longer  periods of protection against a wide range of bacterial pathogens.

TI  == comparative evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of acticoat antimicrobial barrier dressing.
AB  == this study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of acticoat antimicrobial barrier dressing (westaim biomedical corp, fort saskatchewan, alberta, canada), a silver-coated wound dressing, and compared it with silver nitrate, silver sulfadiazine, and mafenide acetate. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic),  minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc), zone of inhibition, and killing curves were determined with 5 clinically relevant bacteria. the data indicate that acticoat silver had the lowest mic and mbc and generated similar zones of inhibition to silver nitrate and silver sulfadiazine. viable bacteria were undetectable 30 minutes after inoculation with the dressing, whereas it took 2 to 4 hours for silver nitrate and silver sulfadazine to achieve the same result. mafenide acetate generated the biggest zones of inhibition, but it had the highest mics and mbcs, and a significant number of bacteria still survived after  6 hours of treatment. the results suggest that acticoat antimicrobial barrier dressing has better antimicrobial performance than either of the existing silver-based products. acticoat dressing killed the bacteria that were tested much faster, which is a very important characteristic for a wound dressing acting as a barrier to invasive infection to have. the study also suggests that a single susceptibility test such as a mic or zone of inhibition test does not provide a comprehensive profile of antimicrobial activity of a topical antimicrobial agent  or dressing. a combination of tests is desirable.

TI  == adherence of staphylococcus aureus is enhanced by an endogenous secreted protein  with broad binding activity.
AB  == a novel mechanism for enhancement of adherence of staphylococcus aureus to host components is described. a secreted protein, eap (extracellular adherence protein), was purified from the supernatant of s. aureus newman and found to be able to bind to at least seven plasma proteins, e.g., fibronectin, the alpha-chain of fibrinogen, and prothrombin, and to the surface of s. aureus. eap  bound much less to cells of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, or  escherichia coli. the protein can form oligomeric forms and is able to cause agglutination of s. aureus. binding of s. aureus to fibroblasts and epithelial cells was significantly enhanced by addition of eap, presumably due to its affinity both for plasma proteins on the cells and for the bacteria.

AB  == a cdna encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant african snail achacina fulica ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rach) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kda. carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rach was composed  of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol n-acetylglucosamine residues. antimicrobial activity  using escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus showed that the rach had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. the rach showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rach inhibited the growth of pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis in addition to e. coli and s. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus and micrococcus luteus. the rach was also effective in preventing growth of vibrio anguillarum and vibrio parahaemolyticus. the results suggested that the rach had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.

TI  == increased levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 and basic fibroblast growth factor in patients on capd: a study during non-infected steady state and peritonitis.
AB  == long-term influence of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd) on concentrations of transforming growth factor beta1 (tgf-beta1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bfgf) in the peritoneal effluent, and the effect of peritonitis on these cytokines were investigated. tgf-beta1 and bfgf were assayed in effluent samples from dialysate bags collected during the initial week of treatment with capd and at 5 months. to determine the effect of peritonitis, dialysate bags were collected on admission to the hospital and on days 3 and 10 and also during non-infected steady state. serum was drawn prior to infection and on days 1 and 10. tgf-beta1 increased more than threefold during the longitudinal follow-up period, median concentrations of 35 pg/ml to 106 pg/ml (p<0.05). no change in bfgf was seen during this initial 5 months. tgf-beta1 was increased on  the first day of peritonitis (median concentration 169 pg/ml) and reached its maximum on day 3 of infection, (median concentration 216 pg/ml) (p<0.05 vs non-infected state, median concentration 39 pg/ml). basic fgf reached a maximum on day three of infection (median concentration 7.7 pg/ml; p=0.01 vs non-infected state) and then slowly declined. in conclusion, tgf-beta1 is influenced by capd treatment per se, and together with bfgf is increased during peritonitis, indicating its importance in the peritoneum and its potential involvement in the  development of tissue fibrosis and eventually ultrafiltration failure.

TI  == stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants.
AB  == aim: to serially characterise aerobic and anaerobic stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants and to correlate colonisation patterns with clinical risk factors. methods: stool specimens from 29 infants of birthweight <1000 g were collected on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth. quantitative aerobic and anaerobic  cultures were performed. results: by day 30, predominant species were enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterbacter  cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp were identified in only one infant. in breast milk fed (but not in formula fed) infants, the total number of bacterial species/stool specimen increased significantly with time (2.50 (se 0.34) on day 10; 3.13 (0.38) on day 20; 4.27 (0.45) on day 30) as did quantitative bacterial counts; gram negative species accounted for most of the increase. on day 30, significant inverse correlations were found between days of previous antibiotic treatment and number of bacterial species (r=0.491) and total organisms/g of stool (r=0.482). gestational age, birthweight, maternal antibiotic or steroid treatment, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and mode of delivery did not seem to affect colonisation patterns. conclusions: the gut of extremely low birthweight infants  is colonised by a paucity of bacterial species. breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical to increasing fecal microbial diversity.

TI  == identification and characterization of sira, an iron-regulated protein from staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the acquisition of iron by pathogenic bacteria is often a crucial step in establishing infection. to accomplish this, many bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, produce low-molecular-weight iron-chelating siderophores.  however, the secretion and transport of these molecules in gram-positive organisms are poorly understood. the sequence, organization, and regulation of genes involved in siderophore transport are conserved among gram-negative bacteria. we used this information to identify a putative siderophore transport locus from an s. aureus genomic sequence database. this locus contains three predicted open reading frames with a high degree of homology to genes involved in siderophore uptake in several bacterial species, in particular the cbr locus of the plant pathogen erwinia chrysanthemi. the first gene in the locus, which we have designated sir for staphylococcal iron regulated, encodes a putative lipoprotein with a molecular mass of 37 kda. the open reading frame is preceded by a 19-bp region of dyad symmetry with homology for operator sequences controlling iron-regulated expression of genes in other bacteria. fur titration experiments indicate that this region of dyad symmetry is sufficient for fur-dependent regulation in escherichia coli. the expression of this gene was repressed, in a dose-dependent manner, by the addition of iron to the s. aureus culture medium. sir-encoded proteins may be involved in iron acquisition in vivo  and therefore may be targets for antimicrobial agents.

AB  == in this paper we assessed the suitability of the charm hvs and a newly developed  microbiological multiplate system as post-screening tests to confirm the presence of residues in raw milk at or near the maximum permissible residue level (mrl). the multiplate system is composed of bacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis plate at ph 8.0 for detection of beta-lactam antibiotics and tylosin, bacillus cereus plate at ph 6.0 for detection of tetracyclines, micrococcus luteus plate at ph 8.0 for detection of macrolides, bacillus subtilis bga plate at ph 8.0 for detection of aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-containing plate seeded with b. subtilis bga at ph 7.0 for detection of sulphonamides, escherichia coli plate at ph 6.0 for detection of quinolone and polymyxin, and staphylococcus epidermidis plate at ph 6.0 for detection of novobiocin. for each  test plate an action level is proposed in such a way that residues can be detected in raw bulk tank milk at levels near or below the established eu mrls of beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, macrolides, sulphonamides, colistin, and quinolones. the charm hvs test used to confirm the presence of tetracycline and macrolide residues gave false-positive results near  the eu mrls. the multiplate system gave valid results. based on data for raw bulk tank milk samples and the proposed action level for each test plate for suspected samples, we demonstrated that the multiplate system is a reliable post-screening  method that can be performed easily and cheaply in microbiological laboratories.

TI  == penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  == background: a prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. methods: cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. in application mode i, patients received on the day  before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. in application mode ii, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees c. the hplc method was used for measuring the concentration. results: the highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. in this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). these mean concentration are all above the mic90 of gram-negative bacteria like proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. in some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the mic90 of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. conclusions: the mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the mic90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == impact of either elevated or decreased levels of cytochrome bd expression on shigella flexneri virulence.
AB  == shigella spp. are the major cause of bacillary dysentery worldwide. the pathogenic process involves bacterial invasion and lysis of the phagocytic vacuole, followed by replication and movement within the cell cytoplasm and, ultimately, spread directly into adjacent cells. this study demonstrates that s.  flexneri cytochrome bd expression is necessary for normal intracellular survival  and virulence. cytochrome bd is one of two terminal oxidases in the bacterial respiratory chain that reduce molecular oxygen to water, utilizing intermediates  shuttled through the electron transport chain. s. flexneri mutants that contain a disruption in the cydc locus, which leads to defective cytochrome bd expression,  or in the riboflavin (ribe) or ubiquinol-8 (ubih) biosynthetic pathway, which leads to elevated cytochrome bd expression, were evaluated in intracellular survival and virulence assays. the cydc mutant formed significantly smaller plaques, had significantly decreased intracellular survival, and had a 100-fold increase in lethal dose for mice compared with the wild type. the ribe and ubih mutants each formed significantly larger plaques and had a 10-fold decrease in lethal dose for mice compared with the wild type. the data indicate that expression of cytochrome bd is required for s. flexneri intracellular survival and virulence.

TI  == interaction of the cyclic antimicrobial cationic peptide bactenecin with the outer and cytoplasmic membrane.
AB  == bactenecin, a 12-amino acid cationic antimicrobial peptide from bovine neutrophils, has two cysteine residues, which form one disulfide bond, making it  a cyclic molecule. to study the importance of the disulfide bond, a linear derivative bac2s was made and the reduced form (linear bactenecin) was also included in this study. circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that bactenecin existed as a type i beta-turn structure regardless of its environment, while the  reduced form and linear bactenecin adopted different conformations according to the lipophilicity of the environment. bactenecin was more active against the gram-negative wild type bacteria escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium than its linear derivative and reduced form, while all three peptides were equally active against the outer membrane barrier-defective mutants of the first two bacteria. only the two linear peptides showed activity against the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus facaelis. bactenecin interacted well with the outer membrane and its higher affinity for e. coli ub1005 lipopolysaccharide and improved ability to permeabilize the outer membrane seemed to account for its better antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria. the interaction of bactenecin with the cytoplasmic membrane was determined by its ability to dissipate the membrane potential by using the fluorescence probe 3, 3-dipropylthiacarbocyanine and an outer membrane barrier-defective mutant e. coli dc2. it was shown that the linear derivative and reduced form were able to dissipate the membrane potential at much lower concentrations than bactenecin despite the similar minimal inhibitory concentrations of all three against this barrier-defective mutant.

TI  == microbiological examinations and in-vitro testing of different antibiotics in therapeutic endoscopy of the biliary system.
AB  == background and study aims: prior to endoscopic therapeutic procedures, no antibiotic prophylaxis is administered routinely. because of the reported incidence of infectious complications, which may reach up to 10%, a prospective study was undertaken to investigate the effects of a prophylactic dose of cefuroxime on the incidence of bacteremia and clinical signs of infection, but no significant effects could be demonstrated. in addition to this published work, blood and bile cultures obtained in this trial were also investigated, and the in-vitro susceptibility to several antibiotics was tested in order to recommend the appropriate substances. patients and methods: ninety-nine consecutive patients (51 men, 48 women; mean age 61.4 +/- 17 years) with biliary obstruction  who underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography with drainage (ptcd) were included. sequential blood cultures were taken before and up to 60 minutes after the endoscopic intervention. bile cultures were obtained in 56 patients with biliary  drainage. aerobic and anaerobic cultures were prepared from all obtained specimens and the isolated organisms were identified. in the case of positive cultures, an in-vitro resistance test for 15 different antibiotics was performed. results: the incidence of bacteremia was 11.1% (n = 11), and 16 bacteria were isolated. twelve different microorganisms were detected, with escherichia coli found in four cases. from 41 positive out of 56 prepared bile cultures (73.2%), 91 isolates were found with 25 different species. a single agent was detected in  eight cases (19.5%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to six species, was found in 33 cases (80.5%). the seven most frequently isolated germs  were e. coli and enterococcus (each n = 19), klebsiella (n = 10), streptococcus viridans (n = 9), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), morganella morganii (n = 4), and bacteroides fragilis (n = 3), representing 76% of all agents. examination for fungal infection revealed positive cultures of candida albicans in 16.1% of bile cultures (nine of 56). interestingly, the use of proton-pump inhibitors (ppis), with a consequent rise in the gastric ph value, led to an increase in the rate of bacteremia to 26.2% (five of 19) compared to the other patients not on ppis (n = 80), who developed bacteremia in only six cases (7.5%; p = 0.02). in-vitro testing of different antibiotics was carried out in 73 isolates. imipenem showed the best antimicrobial activity (98.4%), followed by trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (90%), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (87.3%), vancomycin  (82.4%), and ofloxacin (76.9%). conclusions: escherichia coli was found to be the pathogen most frequently detected in blood and bile following endoscopic interventions in the biliary tract. enterococci, klebsiella and streptococcus viridans were found in bile cultures with an incidence exceeding 10%. in view of  the in-vitro test results, possible side effects, and contraindications, amoxicillin plus beta-lactamase inhibitors or quinolones are considered to be suitable antibiotics for the prophylaxis of biliary infections.

AB  == this study aimed to investigate the possible association between canine parvoviral enteritis and asymptomatic bacteriuria. forty-three puppies that were  admitted to the outpatient service of the animal medical clinic with clinical signs compatible with parvoviral enteritis formed the exposed group. the clinical diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by a positive fecal elisa test (cite test: iddex lab., westbrook, me). twenty-three (53.5%) of these puppies were males and  20 (46.5%) were females. their age ranged from 1.5 to 5.5 months. forty-eight clinically normal and age-matched puppies, that had been admitted to the clinic for vaccinations and had a negative result in the aforementioned elisa test, were randomly selected to form the unexposed group. urine samples were collected by antebupic cystocentesis from all puppies and submitted for bacterial culture. in  the parvovirus exposed group, 11 of 43 puppies had detectable bacteriuria. the isolates were escherichia coli alone (8/11-72.7%) staphylococcus aureus alone (1/11-9.1%) and mixed cultures of e. coli and s. epidermitis (2/11-18.2%). in the unexposed group there were three puppies with detectable bacteriuria, one isolate each of e. coli, enterococcus durans and corynebacterium spp. puppies with parvoviral enteritis had five (95% ci: 1.3-19.8) times higher odds of developing  asymptomatic bacteriuria than puppies without the disease. the observed increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria among puppies with parvoviral enteritis was probably due to the fecal contamination of the external genitalia and the neutropenia these puppies exhibited.

AB  == background: the rate at which the bactericidal activity of preservative-free bupivacaine develops at body temperature and at room temperature is not known. we studied the bactericidal activity of preservative-free bupivacaine on two strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), two strains of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), and each of staphylococcus epidermidis  and escherichia coli. methods: the pathogen was exposed to 0.5% bupivacaine for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h at 37 degrees c and room temperature. in addition, each strain of mrsa, mssa, and s. epidermidis was exposed to distilled water, and 0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 0.75% bupivacaine at 37 degrees c. the inocula from the  suspensions were cultured for 48 h at 37 degrees c. results: the 1- through 24-h  exposures of 4 strains of s. aureus to 0.5% bupivacaine at room temperature reduced the colony count by 21.7%, 34.7%, 51.1%, 65.6%, and 81.1%, respectively,  and the exposure at 37 degrees c reduced the count by 34.1%, 50.8%, 66.3%, 94.5%, and 96.0%, respectively. the differences were significant at all exposure times (p < 0.001, respectively). no organisms grew in the strain of e. coli after 24-h  exposure and in the strain of s. epidermidis after 12- and 24-h exposures at 37 degrees c. the percent change from controls in the strains of e. coli and s. epidermidis was significantly higher than that in the strains of s. aureus at all exposure times at room temperature and 37 degrees c (p < 0.0001, respectively). higher concentrations of bupivacaine were associated with lower colony count. conclusion: our results show that preservative-free bupivacaine possesses a temperature- and concentration-dependent bactericidal activity, and s. aureus is  more resistant to the bactericidal activity of bupivacaine than are s. epidermidis and e. coli.

TI  == reassessment of the incubation time in a controlled clinical comparison of the bact/alert aerobic fan bottle and standard anaerobic bottle used aerobically for  the detection of bloodstream infections.
AB  == this study assessed the minimum incubation time required to detect bloodstream infections during a controlled clinical comparison of the performance characteristics of the bact/alert aerobic fan bottle and the standard anaerobic bottle used aerobically except on a selective basis. blood was collected from adults with suspected bloodstream infections and inoculated into each bottle, which was monitored in the bact/alert microbial detection system. the anaerobic bottle was vented before incubation except when cultures were obtained from patients on the colorectal and gynecologic surgical and emergency services. statistical analysis was limited to those culture sets in which each bottle was inoculated with > or = 8 ml of blood and bacterial growth was considered to be clinically significant. a total of 682 positive cultures from 243 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. significantly more isolates of staphylococcus aureus (p < 0.001), s. epidermidis (p < 0.001), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (p < 0.001), enterococcus spp. (p = 0.04), escherichia coli (p = 0.03), all enterobacteriaceae (p < 0.001), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.001), and candida spp. (p < 0.001) were detected by the aerobic fan bottle. significantly more septic episodes due to s. aureus, s. epidermidis, other coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa, and candida  spp. were detected by the aerobic fan bottle. significantly more bacterial isolates were detected by the aerobic fan whether or not antibiotics were being administered at the time of blood culture, whereas there were significantly fewer positive cultures in the vented standard anaerobic bottle when patients were receiving antimicrobial therapy than when they were not. all but 5% of positive cultures were detected within three days. only six of the cultures requiring four or five days of incubation represented true misses, and only one of these six resulted in a change in therapy which, however, did not affect the patent's outcome.

TI  == [detection of bacteremia in patients discharged from an emergency unit: study of  61 cases].
AB  == background: to know the prevalence, the clinical and microbiological characteristics of bacteremia episodes detected on discharged patients at the emergency unit, as well as the accordance of diagnostics and the predicting factors. patients and methods: we analysed the cases with bacteria detected on discharged patients during 2 years (1995-1996) in an university hospital. we reported: age, sex isolated organism in blood cultures, bacteremia source, leukocytes count, presence of underlying conditions, and accordance between initial and final diagnosis. we compared the characteristics of the groups with bacteremia without apparent origin and the ones with evident clinical source. results: we detected 61 cases, the mean age was 55 years (sd = 21), and 54% were  males. the most commonly isolated agent was e. coli (50%). the leukocytes count was higher 10 x 10(9)/l in 15%. the source of bacteremia was: urinary tract infection (54%) no clinical focus (31%), respiratory tract (11%) and biliary duct (3%). the 90% of urinary tract and the 71% of respiratory infections were correctly diagnosed. however only the 5% of bacteremias without apparent source was correctly diagnosed. we found these differences statistically a significant (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002). underlying conditions were detected in the 84% of cases in bacteremia without apparently source: aids (22%), cirrhosis (22%), parenteral drugs addiction (17%) and venous catheter (17%). comparing both groups, with apparent focus and without it, we found that the presence of underlying condition is the only independent factor which predispose to bacteremia (p = 0.000; rr = 4.6; ic 95% = 1.9-11.8). conclusions: the prevalence  of bacteremia detected in discharged patients at the emergency unit seems acceptable. however those results suggest that we could decrease the number of patients with bacteremia without apparently source, because this group shows up to be the less successful in diagnosis. in patients with fever and no clinical focus in the emergency unit, it is useful to consider the presence of underlying  factors to decide its management.

TI  == bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in nottingham, uk, 1985-1996.
AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == pharmacokinetics of cefdinir and its transfer to dialysate in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  == cefdinir (cas 91832-40-5) was administered orally as a 100-mg capsule (cefzon) to a total of 12 patients with chronic renal failure undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd) to investigate changes in the serum concentrations, excretion rate into the dialysate and serum-protein binding of cefdinir. cmax values were 1.64-4.34 micrograms/ml, t1/2 values were 10.8-21.9 h., and auc values were 31.1-73.1 micrograms.h/ml (0-30 h) in four patients given a single oral dose of 100 mg of cefdinir as a capsule. about 1 microgram/ml of cefdinir had still remained in the blood of all the patients 24 h after administration. the serum concentrations of cefdinir were dose-dependent in four  patients of each group who were given an oral daily dose of 100 mg for 3 to 8 days and 200 mg (2 capsules) for 4 to 14 consecutive days. no marked change in laboratory test values or clinical symptoms before and after administration were  observed in these dose regimes. protein levels of 5.17-5.71 g/day were eliminated from the peritoneal dialysate and urine. cefdinir inhibited 90 to 100% of the clinical isolates such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria causing catheter infection and peritonitis, and its antibacterial activity was stronger than that of amoxicillin (cas 26787-78-0) or cefaclor (cas 53944-73-3) against these clinical isolates.

TI  == activities of ll-37, a cathelin-associated antimicrobial peptide of human neutrophils.
AB  == human neutrophils contain two structurally distinct types of antimicrobial peptides, beta-sheet defensins (hnp-1 to hnp-4) and the alpha-helical peptide ll-37. we used radial diffusion assays and an improved national committee for clinical laboratory standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of ll-37, hnp-1, and protegrin (pg-1). although generally less potent than pg-1, ll-37 showed considerable activity (mic, <10 microgram/ml) against pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus,  and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mm nacl. certain organisms (methicillin-resistant s. aureus, proteus mirabilis, and candida albicans) were resistant to ll-37 in media that contained 100 mm nacl but were susceptible in low-salt media. burkholderia cepacia was resistant to ll-37,  pg-1, and hnp-1 in low- or high-salt media. ll-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of e. coli ml-35p. chromogenic limulus assays revealed that ll-37 bound to e. coli o111:b4 lipopolysaccharide (lps) with a high affinity and  that this binding showed positive cooperativity (hill coefficient = 2.02). circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that ll-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid a, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. the broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of ll-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hcap-18) may protect skin and other tissues  from bacterial intrusions and lps-induced toxicity. the potent activity of ll-37  against p. aeruginosa, including mucoid and antibiotic-resistant strains, suggests that it or related molecules might have utility as topical bronchopulmonary microbicides in cystic fibrosis.

TI  == influence of preformed alpha-helix and alpha-helix induction on the activity of cationic antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == one prominent class of cationic antibacterial peptides comprises the alpha-helical class, which is unstructured in free solution but folds into an amphipathic alpha-helix upon insertion into the membranes of target cells. to investigate the importance of alpha-helicity and its induction on interaction with membranes, a series of peptides was constructed based on a hybrid of moth cecropin (amino acids 1-8) and bee melittin (amino acids 1-18) peptides. the new  peptides were predicted to have a high tendency to form alpha-helices or to have  preformed alpha-helices by virtue of construction of a lactam bridge between glutamate and lysine side-chains at positions i and i + 4 at various locations along the primary sequence. in two examples where the use of lactam bridge constraints induced and stabilized alpha-helical structure in benign (aqueous buffer) and/or hydrophobic medium, there was a decrease in antibacterial activity relative to the linear counterparts. thus the preformation of alpha-helix in solution was not necessarily beneficial to antimicrobial activity. in the one case where the lactam bridge did result in increased antibacterial activity (lower minimal inhibitory concentration values) it did not increase alpha-helical content in benign or hydrophobic medium. broadly speaking, good activity of the peptides against pseudomonas aeruginosa correlated best (r2 = 0.88) with a helican parameter which was calculated as the induction of alpha-helix in a membrane-mimicking environment divided by the alpha-helix formation under benign  conditions. interestingly, the activity of the lactam bridge peptide constructs correlated in part with alterations in bacterial outer or cytoplasmic membrane permeability.

TI  == the effect of successful contact lens wear on mucosal immunity of the eye.
AB  == objective: this study aimed to assess the effect of contact lens wear on the mucosal defenses of the outer eye against infection. design: a case-controlled study of daily contact lens wearers in their initial 6 months of contact lens wear. participants: contact lens wearers (mean age, 23.1 years; 47 subjects) were compared with age-matched control subjects (mean age, 24.7 years; 44 subjects). intervention: outer eye defenses were studied by assay of tear constituents and quantitative conjunctival microbiology. main outcome measures: antimicrobial activity of tears was studied by assay of total immunoglobulin a (iga), iga isotype-specific antibodies reactive with escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus epidermidis, albumin and lysozyme, and the ocular surface microbial load determined using quantitative microbiology of the conjunctival sac. results: the iga isotype-specific antibodies reactive with e. coli (p = 0.03) and s. epidermidis (p = 0.068) were lower in contact lens wearers, but antibody:albumin ratios were not significantly different in the two  groups. contact lens wear also had no significant effect on tear iga, albumin, or lysozyme or its ratios with albumin. bacterial numbers and colonization rates for coagulase-negative staphylococci were greater in contact lens wearers than in age-matched control subjects. corynebacterium sp. and non-enterobacteriaceae (p = 0.007) were isolated more frequently and in greater numbers from contact lens wearers. colonization rates were increased for corynebacterium sp., but non-enterobacteriaceae were transient. in both daily contact lens wearers and age-matched control subjects, most conjunctival flora were transient rather than  colonizing, and no subject developed an outer eye infection during the study. conclusion: these results suggest that daily contact lens wear does not significantly alter the mucosal defenses of the outer eye that function to eliminate organisms from the conjunctival sac and prevent outer eye infection.

TI  == sclerosing peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients: one center's experience and review of the literature.
AB  == sclerosing peritonitis (sp) is a severe life-threatening condition for patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd). this report reviews  our experience and that reported in the literature concerning the prevalence of sp in capd patients, predisposing factors, and in particular, the role of peritonitis, its clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. a total of 1,288 end-stage renal disease (esrd) patients entered our peritoneal dialysis (pd) program between september 1977 and september 1997, seven of whom (0.54%) developed sp. the annual incidence of sp was 0.37 per 1,000 patient years, male-to-female ratio was 2.5 (m/f:5/2), mean age was 39+/-16 (median, 37;  range, 23 to 61) years, and the median duration on capd was 62 (range, 12 to 144) months. five patients were on capd for > or =4 years and two for less than 4 years before they were diagnosed with sp. all sp patients presented with clinical symptoms suggestive of intestinal obstruction, and five patients had decreased solute or fluid removal and had to increase the daily dialysate volume (3/7) or the tonicity of the fluid (4.25%) (3/7) or to combine a regular hemodialysis (hd) session with capd (2/7). there was a mean weight loss of 5+/-6 (median, 2; range, 0 to 18) kg. all patients had an episode of peritonitis at a mean time of 2+/-1 (median, 1; range, 1 to 3) months before the diagnosis of sp. the peritonitis was due to staphylococcus aureus in four and staphylococcus epidermidis, fungi, and escherichia coli in one each. the definitive diagnosis of sp was established by laparotomy in four patients or postmortem examination in one patient, while in the remaining two there was no surgical confirmation; however, we believe the diagnosis was extremely likely because of the presence of clinical and radiologic criteria for sp. after the diagnosis of sp, all patients had their catheters removed, capd was discontinued permanently, and they were transferred to hd. although there are isolated case reports of successful outcomes after surgical intervention, especially in patients in whom a peritoneal "cocoon" is related to  severe peritonitis, usually the prognosis following surgery is poor. treatment with immunosuppressive agents has been reported to be beneficial in the treatment of sp, although this has not been confirmed by all investigators. among our sp patients, five (72%) died of sepsis (3/5) in a mean period of 10+/-5 (median, 9;  range, 6 to 17) months after the diagnosis of sp and two are still alive on hd. sp is a rare but serious complication of capd. severe peritonitis, especially in  patients on dialysis for more than 4 years, may lead to sp as the prevalence of sp increases in patients on long-term capd, early detection is important because  of the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.

TI  == evaluation of an automated microbiologic blood culture device for detection of bacteria in platelet components.
AB  == background: automated culture methods have been used by several investigators to  detect bacterial contamination of cellular blood components. we investigated several factors affecting detection by automated culture of bacteria in platelet  concentrates (pcs). these factors included the initial contamination level in pcs, the pc sample volume, the pc sample time, and the white cell level in relation to bacteria levels in the pcs. study design and methods: staphylococcus  epidermidis or escherichia coli was inoculated into freshly prepared pcs or white cell-reduced pcs to yield colony-forming unit (cfu) levels of 10, 1, or 0.1 per ml. at the time of inoculation (t=0) and at t=6, t=24, and t=48 hours, 0.5, 1.0,  and 2.0 ml samples of the contaminated pcs were transferred into culture bottles. the presence of bacteria in the culture bottles was subsequently monitored by an  automated blood culturing instrument. bacteria levels in the pc at the time of first automated culture detection were determined by quantitative plating. results: e. coli was detected in 92 percent of experiments when 1.0- or 2.0-ml samples were taken at t=6 hours. at t=24 hours, 100-percent detection was observed with all tested inoculation volumes; however, by that time, >10(7) cfu per ml of bacteria were present in every pc. for s. epidermidis, 89 percent and 83 percent of contaminated pcs were detected with a t=24 hour sampling time and 2.0- or 1.0-ml sampling volume. seven of 36 pcs with a 2.0-ml sampling volume and 10 of 36 pcs with a 1.0-ml sampling volume contained >10(6) cfu per ml of s. epidermidis at the time of first detection. conclusion: data from this preliminary evaluation suggest that sampling times of 24 hours or more would be necessary to provide confidence in detection of e. coli or s. epidermidis in pcs  using this culture method.

TI  == changes in the biocide susceptibility of staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli cells associated with rapid attachment to plastic surfaces.
AB  == differences in opacity between wells of a microtitre plate containing different volumes of inoculated growth medium reflected planktonic growth without any contribution from cells attached at the well surface. simple algebra and a knowledge of the dependence of optical density upon sample path length (volume) for suspensions of differing cell density enables the generation of growth curves for attached populations (biofilms). in this manner, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined at various stages of growth (0-20 h), both  for cells growing attached to the bases of the plate wells and, simultaneously, for cells growing in suspension above them. biocides included cetrimide, polyhexamethylene biguanide, peracetic acid, phenoxyethanol and chloroxylenol. results, expressed as planktonic:biofilm mic ratios, showed susceptibility to change, not only as a function of attachment and biofilm formation, but also with respect to the nature of the chemical agent. in some instances, changes in susceptibility greater than twofold occurred immediately on attachment and could  occur in the presence of biocide concentrations which exceeded the mic.

AB  == polyurethane surface was modified with poly(ethylene glycol) (mol. wt. 1000, peg1k) carrying terminal hydroxyl, amino and sulfonate groups, poly(ethylene glucol) (mol. wt. 3350, peg3.4k) and peg3.4k-heparin, respectively. these surfaces were investigated for bacterial adhesion using s. epidermidis and e. coli in tryptic soya broth (tsb), brain heart infusion (bhi), and human plasma. all peg modified surfaces reduced bacterial adhesion significantly and the adhesion level differs depending on surfaces as well as media. in the case of peg1k surfaces, no reduction of s. epidermidis adhesion was demonstrated in tsb media, regardless of terminal functional groups of peg1k. however, adhesion in plasma was reduced to the different degree, depending on terminal groups of peg1k (least adhesion on sulfonated peg surface). relatively longer peg surface (peg3.4k) and peg3.4k-heparin surface minimized bacterial adhesion in both media. in the case of e. coli adhesion, significant reduction in adherent bacteria was observed on all peg1k, peg3.4k, and peg-heparin surfaces in both media compared to controls. in contrast, no reduction in bacterial adhesion was demonstrated on  poly(propylene glycol) (ppg1k) grafted pu surface as compared to control pu. these results suggest that surface modification with peg1k-so3, peg3.4k and peg3.4k-heparin seems to be effective for prevention of bacterial adhesion and subsequent infection.

TI  == management of animal bite injuries of the face: experience with 94 patients.
AB  == purpose: because of the large number of bacteria in the oral cavity, animal bite  wounds are generally contaminated, and their treatment is difficult because of the risk of infection, especially in extensive injuries. this report describes the management of a large series of patients and recommends treatment guidelines  on the basis of the results. patients and methods: ninety-four animal bite wounds on the face and head were analyzed according to the type of animal, location and  extent of the soft tissue wound, duration and type of surgical treatment, occurrence of infections and their pathogen spectrum, as well as the choice of antibiotic therapy. results: dogs caused 91% of the bite wounds. infections developed in 4 of 53 patients who underwent primary wound closure with minor edge excision and prophylactic administration of oral penicillin. without antibiotic administration, 2 of 15 patients had infections, which were treated on an outpatient basis. of 26 patients with initially delayed treatment, 18 showed clinical inflammatory symptoms with a wide spectrum of pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus, enterococcus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and proteus) on presentation. conclusion: extensive animal bite wounds on the face, even with soft tissue defects, should be treated according to the criteria of a esthetic reconstructive facial surgery. in view of the low infection rate, routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not justified.

TI  == cloning, purification and characterisation of the lipase from staphylococcus epidermidis--comparison of the substrate selectivity with those of other microbial lipases.
AB  == on the chromosome of staphylococcus epidermidis rp62a the lipase gene (gehse1) is immediately flanked by the icaaa'bc operon, which is involved in biofilm formation. since lipase production might play a role in staphylococcal skin colonisation as well, we studied the biochemical properties of the staphylococcal lipases more closely. the dna sequence and the deduced protein sequence revealed  that gehse1 is very similar to the lipase sequence of s. epidermidis strain 9. like other staphylococcal lipases, gehse1 is organised as a preproenzyme. the part of gehse1 coding for the mature lipase was cloned and overexpressed as a fusion protein with an n-terminal histidine tag in escherichia coli. the lipase was purified to homogeneity using a combination of precipitation techniques, metal-affinity chromatography and gel filtration. biochemical characterisation showed that this lipase is closely related to the lipase from staphylococcus aurelis nctc8530. both enzymes have a ph optimum around 6, are very stable at low ph, and need calcium as a cofactor for catalytic activity. the preferred substrates are small triacylglycerols, with a maximum activity toward tributyrylglycerol. comparison of the substrate selectivity with those of other microbial lipases showed that phospholipids are generally poor substrates for lipases. an exception is the lipase from staphylococcus hyicus, which prefers phospholipids as a substrate, distinguishing this staphylococcal lipase from other microbial lipases. these results are discussed in view of the structure/function relationships of staphylococcal lipases, and the possible involvement of these enzymes in biological processes such as skin colonisation and pathogenesis.

TI  == empiric therapy of bacterial infections in patients with severe neutropenia.
AB  == the urgent need to treat presumptive infections in neutropenic patients has meant that initial therapy is empiric based on the pathogens most likely to be responsible for the patient's rise in temperature or other symptoms of infection. the spectrum of causative pathogens has changed over time and reflects the availability and use of antimicrobial agents. gram-positive organisms predominated in the 1940s and onward until the widespread use of early penicillins and cephalosporins effectively addressed this problem. the upsurge in infections in the 1970s and 1980s caused by gram-negative organisms, particularly pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella spp., has been supplanted by a new wave of infections caused by gram-positive organisms, this time predominantly staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and the viridans streptococci. the fourth-generation cephalosporins (cefpirome) among other broad-spectrum beta-lactams, by virtue of their enhanced antimicrobial activity against gram-positive pathogens and greater beta-lactamase stability, are promising candidates for use in the empiric management of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients. early clinical trial results are promising and should lead  the way for further use of these compounds in this indication.

AB  == bacterial infection of the lung is associated with mucin overproduction. in partial explanation of this phenomenon, we recently reported that supernatant from the gram-negative organism pseudomonas (p.) aeruginosa contained an activity that upregulated transcription of the muc 2 mucin gene [j.-d. li, a. dohrman, m.  gallup, s. miyata, j. gum, y. kim, j. nadel, a. prince, c. basbaum, transcriptional activation of mucin by p. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis lung disease, proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a., 94 (1997) 967-972]. the purpose of the present study was to determine whether mucin  genes other than muc 2 are so regulated and whether gram-positive organisms also  contain mucin stimulatory activity. results from in situ hybridization and rnase  protection assays showed that p. aeruginosa upregulates muc 5ac as well as muc 2  in both bronchial explants and cultured airway epithelial cells. the upregulation of both genes by p. aeruginosa can be mimicked by lipopolysaccharide (lps) and can be blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. in addition, both genes are upregulated by a variety of gram-positive as well as gram-negative organisms showing the same rank order of potency. these data indicate the existence of a general mechanism by which epithelial cells respond to the presence of bacteria by increasing mucin synthesis.

AB  == antimicrobial coating of medical devices, including fracture fixation devices, has evolved as a potentially effective method for preventing device-related infections. we examined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of titanium cylinders coated with the antiseptic combination of chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol. the coated devices provided zones of inhibition against staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and candida albicans, at baseline and up to 8 weeks after incubation of the coated cylinders in human serum at 37 degrees c. this durable antimicrobial activity was attributed to the  relatively slow leaching of chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol from the coated cylinders as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. these results suggest that antiseptic-coated orthopaedic devices may provide broad-spectrum and durable antimicrobial protection against device-related infection.

TI  == genetic and biochemical analysis of mutacin 1140, a lantibiotic from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans jh1000 and its derivatives were previously shown (j. d. hillman, k. p. johnson, and b. i. yaphe, infect. immun. 44:141-144, 1984) to produce a low-molecular-weight, broad-spectrum bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis). the thermosensitive vector ptv1-ok harboring tn917 was used to  isolate a blis-deficient mutant, dm25, and the mutated gene was recovered by shotgun cloning in escherichia coli. sequence analysis of insert dna adjacent to  tn917 led to the identification of four open reading frames including two (lana and lanb) which have substantial homology to the staphylococcus epidermidis structural gene (epia) and a modifying enzyme gene (epib) for biosynthesis of the lantibiotic epidermin, respectively. although the blis activity could not be recovered from broth cultures, high yields were obtained from a solid medium consisting of todd-hewitt broth containing 0.5% agarose that was stab inoculated  with jh1140 (a spontaneous mutant of jh1000 that produces threefold-elevated amounts of activity). agar could not substitute for agarose. chloroform extraction of the spent medium produced a fraction which yielded two major bands  on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the faster-migrating band was absent in chloroform extracts of the mutant, dm25. the  amino acid sequence of this band was determined by edman sequencing and mass spectroscopy. the results showed that it is a lantibiotic, which we have named mutacin 1140, and that the sequence corresponded to that deduced from the lana sequence. we observed a number of similarities of mutacin 1140 to epidermin and an s. mutans lantibiotic, b-ny266, but it appears to have significant differences in the positions of its thioether bridges. it also has other unique features with regard to its leader sequence and posttranslational modification. a proposed structure for mutacin 1140 is presented.

TI  == solution structure of the antimicrobial peptide ranalexin and a study of its interaction with perdeuterated dodecylphosphocholine micelles.
AB  == ranalexin, a 20-residue peptide isolated from the skin of the bullfrog rana catesbeiana displays antimicrobial activity. this peptide contains two cysteine residues in positions 14 and 20 linked by a disulphide bridge. ranalexin was chemically synthesised and close antimicrobial activities were measured for the reduced and oxidised forms. the solution structure of ranalexin was determined by using circular dichroism, proton nmr spectroscopy and molecular modelling techniques. the reduced and oxidised forms of ranalexin are mainly unstructured in water but display an alpha-helical structure spanning residues 8-15 and 8-17,  respectively, in a trifluoroethanol/water mixture (3:7, by vol.). ranalexin was found to interact with micelles of dodecylphosphocholine and to adopt a similar helical structure. moreover, slow-exchanging amide protons located on the same side of the helix suggest that the hydrophobic face of the helix lies on the micelle surface. hydrophobic residues of the poorly structured n-terminal part which are important for the biological activity are also involved in the interaction with micelles. taken together, the results suggest that the disulphide bond does not strongly affect either the conformation or the antimicrobial activity of ranalexin.

TI  == in vitro efficacy of a hydrophilic central venous catheter loaded with silver to  prevent microbial colonization.
AB  == a method was developed to load the surface of a central venous catheter with silver to prevent bacterial colonization. silver confers a broad antimicrobial activity with a relatively low risk of resistance. catheters were incubated with  a silver nitrate solution in different concentrations. the solvent, incubation temperature and incubation period were varied to examine the influence on the catheter loading. with increasing incubation temperature, time and concentration  of silver nitrate, higher rates of silver elution were observed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. furthermore, by using ethanol-water as a solvent instead of pure water, the amount of silver bound to the catheter surface was enhanced. the release of silver from the catheter surface is mainly controlled by first order kinetics. antimicrobial efficacy of the modified catheter, in comparison to unloaded catheters, was tested in a stationary and a dynamic model with different microorganisms. adherence experiments with candida albicans showed almost complete inhibition of growth during a period of 72 hours, including initial adherence. while initial adherence of bacteria could not be prevented, these experiments showed an excellent reduction of bacterial colonization. in a perfusion model, adhesion of e. coli could be reduced for at least seven days. further studies are planned to examine prolonged antimicrobial effects.

AB  == background: although gram negative as well as gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of  gram positive bacteria is increasing. the objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. methods and results: the presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the haematological clinic in 1995. haemocultures (apparatus bact/alert 120, cultivation media organon-teknika) and urine were examined. the sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. in blood most frequently staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis and staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). in urine the following were detected: staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), enterococcus sp. (14.5%), escherichia coli (13.1%), enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). in all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. conclusions: investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.

TI  == bacterial and ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == objective: we designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) in whom gram-positive cocci (gpc), gram-negative bacilli (gnb), or ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of bpd. study design: we correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. bpd severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w pca) and at the time of discharge. two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. results: of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. gpc isolates from throat cultures were mainly staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus. a superimposed gnb colonization was present in 37% of these infants. most common isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. sepsis caused by gpc developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by gnb. infants infected with gnb remained receiving oxygen at 36 w pca and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. radiologic findings: hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. high radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w pca. infants infected with u. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. conclusion: gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. gnb-infected infants had the most severe bpd course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. u. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe bpd or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.

AB  == from 198 o 1996 (12 years) we saw 24 neonates and small infants with septic arthritis of the hip joint. a minority of these infants was simultaneously affected by osteomyelitis of the femoral neck or the acetabulum. clinical signs are a painful leg, pseudoparalysis, uneasiness and refusal to drink. quantitative measurements of c-reactive protein (crp) are more reliable then leucocyte count and sedimentation rate. ultrasound images yield early information about capsular  swelling and septic effusion; in late cases us can visualize femoral neck necrosis. emergency arthrotomy to relieve the joint from septic effusion, bacteriological specimens and capsular biopsy are mandatory. intravenous application of a second-generation cephalosporin as antibiotic has proven effective. we have been using cefuroxim for the past 10 years, changed if necessary according to the antibiogram. parenteral antibiotic treatment is continued for an average of 3 weeks, followed by oral treatment for another 3 weeks. crp normalisation monitors the cure from the disease. our 24 cases included 7 with group b streptococci 2 with staphylococcus aureus, 2 with staphylococcus epidermidis and 2 with escherichia coli. in 8 cases no germs could be cultured; 6 of them had outside antibiotic treatment before being transferred. if treatment was initiated within 3 days, healing without residuals was the rule. in 18 cases with early and sufficient treatment no sequelae were observed. with delay of treatment for several days, moderate osteomyelitic changes of the neck and the acetabulum were observed. in a case with delay of surgical treatment for  5 weeks, complete destruction of the hip joint occurred, causing a poor final result.

AB  == catheter associated bacteriuria is a common infection in hospitals and nursing homes. an infection inhibiting catheter material for fabricating urinary catheters is being developed. the material consists of silicone rubber elastomer  compounded with chlorhexidene gluconate (chg) matrix. the antibiotic is released  in sustained fashion over at least 4 weeks. a method was established for adding chg to silicone rubber. to protect the chg, it is suspended in a water soluble wax that also modulates chg release from the elastomer. it was found that chg is  randomly dispersed in the elastomer and that the primary release mechanism is by  diffusion. the antibacterial activity of the material with a range of 0.1 to 5% chg by weight was examined using in vitro zone inhibition testing. the new material demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against three pathogens tested (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus epidermidis.). the release rate of chg was measured in vitro using high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). with 5% chg loading, the antibiotic was released at a steady rate of approximately 8.4 mg/cm2/day for periods extending beyond 4 weeks. this new material for urinary catheters has the potential to provide protection against infection and surface colonization.

AB  == new pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. these fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). variations at the c-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. the activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the c-8 substituent was in the order f (c5-nh2) > f (c5-h) > naphthyridine > cl = ome = h against gram-positive organisms. in the case of gram-negative strains, activity was in the order f (c5-nh2) > naphthyridine = f (c5-h) > h > cl > ome. the advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. in addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. among these compounds, compound 20 (lb20304) showed the best in vivo  efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. the mics (microgram/ml) of lb20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: s. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), streptococcus epidermidis 887e (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), escherichia coli 3190y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), enterobacter cloacae p99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). on the basis of these promising results, lb20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.

TI  == in vivo reaction of affinity-tag-labelled epidermin precursor peptide with flavoenzyme epid.
AB  == the staphylococcus epidermidis genes encoding the his-tag-labelled epidermin precursor peptide epia and the flavoenzyme epid or the mutant protein epid-g93d,  which lacks the coenzyme, were co-expressed and the proteins were synthesized in  vivo in escherichia coli. only in the presence of epid was the precursor peptide  converted to a reaction product with a decrease in mass of 44-46 da. this result  confirms the in vitro experiments carried out with purified epia and purified epid from staphylococcus epidermidis [kupke et al. (1994) j. biol. chem. 269, 5653-5659]. epid catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of the c-terminal cysteine residue of epia to a [z]-enethiol structure. in the presence of epid, the amount of purified (modified) peptide epia was several-fold higher than in the presence of epid-g93d, indicating that the stabilization of epia against proteolysis is due to an interaction with epid or to the presence of the c-terminal modification. the presented experimental approach will be valuable for the analysis of enzymes that catalyze posttranslational modification reaction of  peptides and proteins.

AB  == the method for the determination of the antilysozyme activity (ala) of microorganisms, based on the photometric determination of the residual activity of enzyme with the use of micrococcus lysodeikticus test culture after the incubation of the strain under test and lysozyme, is proposed. the new method enhances the reliability of the determination of the ala of microorganisms due to an increase in the accuracy of the quantitative determination of ala. the elimination of the stage of interaction between the growing bacterial culture and lysozyme and the presence of the antilysozyme factor in the supernatant fluid confirm the constructive and secretory character of antilysozyme activity.

TI  == much ado about nothing: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the pathogenic methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) has received a  voluminous amount of notoriety. the four major reasons are its morbidity, mortality rate, cost of treatment, and constant appearance in intensive care units. both staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis (mrse) account for 82% of our gram-positive wound isolates, whereas the gram-negative account for 34% of all isolates. therefore we compared the morbidity, mortality rate, and cost factors related to mrsa-mrse and gram-negative infections for a 4-year period, assessing more than 214 documented infections. morbidity and mortality rates were minor for mrsa. pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli accounted for 57.5% of the total gram-negative isolates. gram-negative antimicrobial therapy usually  requires two therapeutic drugs, which increases morbidity and costs, whereas the  staphylococci usually can be treated by one antimicrobial. during this period there were 47 gram-negative infections requiring 10 to 15 additional days of hospital stay, with a daily antibiotic cost of $293.40. costs for mrsa or mrse are 28% less. therefore our preoccupation with mrsa or mrse infections is unwarranted and unsubstantiated.

TI  == microbial growth inside saline-filled breast implants.
AB  == in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to determine whether intraluminal saline in breast implants can support the growth of common wound-infecting microorganisms over a prolonged period of time. the bacteria tested were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, corynebacterium jeikeium, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. three fungal species also were tested: aspergillus fumigatus, paecilomyces variotii, and candida albicans. in the in vitro study, four organisms survived in flasks of sterile saline for the 2 weeks in which serial cultures were performed: k. pneumoniae, c. albicans, a. fumigatus, and p.  variotii. in the in vivo study, 61 white rabbits (122 implants) received both an  experimental implant inoculated with one of the test organisms and a control implant containing only sterile saline. they were sacrificed at 1-, 3-, or 6-month scheduled endpoints. none of the control implants containing sterile saline had positive cultures. in contrast, the intraluminal saline was culture positive for 7 of the 10 inoculated organisms after varying lengths of time: s. epidermidis, e. coli, e. cloacae, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, a. fumigatus, and p. variotii. samples of capsular tissue also were cultured. of the 122 capsular tissue specimens, 21 (17 percent) had positive cultures and surrounded both inoculated and sterile implants. in most instances, capsules that were culture positive contained an organism different from the one that had been inoculated in the group. in only 3 cases was the same organism cultured from both the periprosthetic tissue and the intraluminal saline, and these may represent instances of the inoculated organism migrating through the implants filler valves. the data show that several types of bacteria (particularly gram-negative  species) and fungi can grow and reproduce in a restricted saline environment for  extended periods of time.

TI  == susceptibility of antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant hospital bacteria to disinfectants.
AB  == objective: to evaluate whether hospital strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria  exhibited altered susceptibility to disinfectants. design: antibiotic-susceptible bacteria were obtained from american type culture collection: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella choleraesuis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. hospital strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria were obtained from clinical isolates, including: s  aureus, s epidermidis, e coli, enterococcus species, k pneumoniae, and p aeruginosa. the association of official analytical chemist's use-dilution method  was used to test these 12 strains of 7 bacterial pathogens for their susceptibility to a phenol and a quaternary ammonium compound. for five pathogens, we tested a susceptible and a more resistant strain in 20 comparative  trials (5 pathogens, 2 disinfectants, 2 dilutions per disinfectant). results: in  our 20 comparative trials, the antibiotic-resistant strains exhibited an increased resistance to the disinfectant in only a single instance. conclusions:  our data demonstrate that the development of antibiotic resistance does not appear to be correlated to increased resistance to disinfectants.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of du-6681a, a parent compound of dz-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and mic90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively. mic90s of du-6681a  were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic50 and mic90 of du-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a  activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) cfu), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to du-6681a was less  than or equal to those of the reference compounds. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of du-6681a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and h. influenzae.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 11 hospitals during the period of june 1995 to may 1996. of  the above bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were escherichia coli. susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. enterococcus faecalis ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm) showed the highest activities against e. faecalis isolated from patients with utis. the mic90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. vancomycin (vcm) and piperacillin (pipc) were also active with the  mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. the others had low activities with the mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus including mrsa vcm showed the highest activities against s. aureus isolated from  patients with utis. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml against both s. aureus and mrsa. arbekacin (abk) was also active with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. the other except minocycline (mino) had very low activities with the mic90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. staphylococcus epidermidis abk and mino showed the strongest activities against s. epidermidis isolated from patients with utis. the mic90s of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. vcm was also active with the mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. the mic90s of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml  in 1995. these results indicated that some resistances existed among s. epidermidis to cephems. 4. streptococcus agalactiae all drugs except gentamicin (gm) were active against s. agalactiae. abpc, cefmenoxime (cmx), ipm, erythromycin (em), clindamycin (cldm) and clarithromycin (cam) showed the highest activities. the mics for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. the mic90s of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. citrobacter freundii ipm showed the highest activity against c. freundii isolated from patients utis. its  mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. gm was also active with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. cefpirome (cpr), cefozopran (czop) and amikacin (amk) were also active with the mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems except cmx, cpr and czop showed low activities with mic90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. enterobacter  cloacae ipm showed the highest activity against e. cloacae. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. mino and tosufloxacin (tflx)  were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems except cpr and czop showed lower activities with the mic90s of 256 micrograms/ml  or above. 7. escherichia coli. most of the antimicrobial agents were active against e. coli. particularly cpr, czop and ipm showed the highest activities against e. coli. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. cmx and tflx were also active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. penicillins were slightly active with mic90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. klebsiella pneumoniae k. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml or below. carumonam (crmn) had the strongest activity against k. pneumoniae, the mics for all strains were equal to  or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of k. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. for example, the mic90s of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. proteus mirabilis p. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. cmx, ceftazidime (caz), cefixime (cfix), and crmn showed the highest activities against p. mirabilis isolated from patients with utis. mics of crmn for all

TI  == growth of bacteria in platelet concentrates obtained from whole blood stored for  16 hours at 22 degrees c before component preparation.
AB  == background: previous studies have shown that cooling whole blood to 22 degrees c  immediately after collection allows it to be held for up to 16 hours before component preparation (overnight-hold method) without a significant decrease in the quality of components obtained. a study was designated to evaluate the effect of the overnight-hold method on the growth of bacteria in experimentally contaminated blood units. study design and methods: twenty whole-blood units were inoculated with staphylococcus epidermidis (300 colony-forming units [cfu]/ml; n  = 10) or escherichia coli (50 cfu/ml; n = 10) immediately after collection. half  the units of each group were fractionated 6 hours after collection and the other  half after storage for 16 hours at 22 degrees c. twenty additional whole-blood units were divided in two equal parts, one of which was white cell reduced before inoculation. these 40 half-units were inoculated with s. epidermidis or e. coli and processed by the overnight-hold method. the growth of bacteria was assessed in platelet concentrates on the second and fifth days of storage, in packed red cells on day 35, and in fresh-frozen plasma after 60 days. results: no bacteria growth was detected in plasma or red cell units. on the second day of storage, both bacteria strains grew more slowly in platelet concentrates obtained from blood processed by the overnight-hold method. this difference disappeared for s.  epidermidis on the fifth day. when white cell-reduced and non-white cell-reduced  whole-blood units were compared, platelet concentrates from the latter showed a delayed growth of both bacterial strains on the second and fifty days of storage. conclusion: prolonged storage of whole-blood units at 22 degrees c before component preparation delays bacteria growth. this effect seems to be mediated by white cells.

TI  == bactericidal activity of 0.5% bupivacaine with preservatives on microorganisms in the human skin flora.
AB  == background and objectives: the bactericidal activity of 0.5% bupivacaine with preservatives at body temperature and at room temperature is not known. we studied the bactericidal activity of 0.5% bupivacaine with 0.08% methyl para-oxybenzoate and 0.02% propyl para-aminobenzoate as preservatives and of the  preservatives alone at 37 degrees c and at room temperature on two strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, two strains of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and one strain each of staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli. methods: the pathogen was exposed to 0.5% bupivacaine with preservatives or to the preservatives alone for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours at 37 degrees c and at room temperature. the inocula from these suspensions were cultured for 48 hours at 37 degrees c after the antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine was inactivated by 1:1,000 dilution with physiological saline. results: the 1- through 12-hour exposures of four strains of s. aureus to 0.5% bupivacaine with preservatives at room temperature reduced the mean colony count by 24.2%, 49.2%, 71.3%, and 89.6%, respectively, and the exposure at 37 degrees c reduced the count by 74.1%, 95.2%, 99.9%, and 99.8%, respectively. the  differences for 1- through 12-hour exposures were significant (p < .001). the percentage kill in the strains of e. coli and s. epidermidis was significantly higher than that in the strains of s. aureus at all exposure times at room temperature (e. coli, p < .001; s. epidermidis, p < .0001) and at 1- and 3-hour exposures at 37 degrees c (e. coli, p < .001; s. epidermidis, p < .0001). the bactericidal activity of the preservatives was markedly lower that that of 0.5% bupivacaine with preservatives (p < .0001). conclusions: the bactericidal activity of 0.5% bupivacaine with preservatives is stronger at body temperature than at room temperature; the bactericidal activity may be due, to a large extent, to bupivacaine rather than to the preservatives; and s. aureus is more resistant to the bactericidal activity of bupivacaine than are s. epidermidis and e. coli.

TI  == penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humours  of patients by different topical application modes.
AB  == objective: a prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humour. methods: two hundred and twenty-four patients undergoing cataract extraction received 0.3% ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin or ofloxacin eye drops by two different  administration modes with different frequencies and intervals of application. at  the beginning of cataract extraction (0.5-3 h after the last drop), 50-100 microliters aqueous fluid was aspirated from the anterior chamber and immediately stored at -80 degrees c. antibiotic concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: generally, topical ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin yielded aqueous humour levels higher than topical norfloxacin. the  highest concentrations of all tested fluoroquinolones were measured after using an application mode, in which one drop was given every 15 min between 0600 hours  and 0800 hours, prior to operation. when applied by this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 0.380 (+/- 0.328) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.033-1.388 micrograms.ml-1), norfloxacin 0.182 (0.118) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.038-0.480 microgram.ml-1) and ofloxacin 0.564 (0.372) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.064-1.455 micrograms.ml-1). these mean concentrations were above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90), concentrations required for inhibition of 90% of pathogen strains in vitro of gram-negative bacteria, such as proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. therapeutic values above the mic90 of staphylococcus epidermidis, the pathogen causing eye infections most frequently, were reached by 67.5% of patients after ofloxacin and by 41% after ciprofloxacin, but never after norfloxacin treatment. conclusion: of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humour concentration. this fluoroquinolone may be an useful ophthalmic agent for topical antibacterial  management, but it does not seem to be prophylactically effective against streptococcus pneumoniae or pseudomanas aeruginosa.

AB  == possible increasing of resistance to difuracil or n-(5-nitrofurfuryliden)-5-nitrofuran-2-(n'-acetyl) carboxamidohydrazon (pap-49) in staphylococcus sp., streptococcus sp. and escherichia coli was studied and the level of the resistance increasing was determined by the method of 30-fold passage of the cultures in subbacteriostatic concentrations of the drug. it was shown in vitro that the increase of the resistance to the new nitrofuran was insignificant. the most intensive adaptation was observed during the first 10 passages. during the following 10-15 passages the susceptibility level remained unchanged (e.coli) or was even somewhat higher (s. aureus and streptococcus sp.). after that a new increase of the resistance was observed. the most marked changes in the susceptibility were detected in streptococcus sp. and the least marked in  staphylococcus sp. and e.coli. combinations of difuracil in subbacteriostatic concentrations with various antibacterial drugs provided both additive and synergistic effects with respect to s.epidermidis, s. pneumonase, e.coli and p.mirabilis. the most active combinations were those of difuracil with aminoglycoside antibiotics, penicillins or chloramphenicol.

TI  == production of il-1 beta and tnf-alpha by peritoneal macrophages depends on the bacterial species and the inoculum.
AB  == peritoneal macrophages (pms) are very potent producers of proinflammatory stimuli, such as interleukin (il)-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha. after contact with invading micro-organisms, pms produce different cytokines, both pro- and anti-inflammatory. therefore, they are crucial in the regulation of inflammatory events. the aim of this study was to investigate whether the production of il-1 beta and tnf-alpha is dependent on the bacterial species used. pms were harvested from spent peritoneal dialysis effluent and subsequently stimulated with five strains of bacteria in two different concentrations. after 24 hours of stimulation, supernatants were harvested and analyzed for both il-1 beta and tnf-alpha content. il-1 beta was measured with a commercial elisa, and tnf-alpha was determined with a bioassay. both the il-1 beta and the tnf-alpha production were species-dependent. one strain of staphylococcus aureus and one strain of staphylococcus epidermidis induced a markedly higher response in both il-1 beta and tnf-alpha than the other species. this response was also dose-dependent, and this holds true for all species. in conclusion, the il-1 beta and tnf-alpha response by pms is both species- and dose-dependent.

AB  == end-point attached, covalently bound heparin has been shown to be effective in preventing activation of the coagulation cascade by biomaterials. data concerning its possible influence on bacterial attachment and resistance to biomaterial-associated infection are, so far, lacking. in the present work, the in vitro adherence of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli, one isolate of each species, to plain poly(vinyl chloride) (plain pvc) and heparin coated poly(vinyl chloride) (epa-pvc) segments was compared. also, the influence of precoating the segments with human normal plasma for 2 h was studied. 35s-methionine was used to radiolabel bacteria. the segments were exposed to bacterial suspensions of approximately 10(7) colony forming units (cfu) per milliliter at 37 degrees c for 0.5-6 h. following repeated washing in phosphate buffered saline (pbs), radioactivity associated with the segments was measured. plain pvc as compared to epa-pvc bound significantly more cells of all  three tested species. plasma precoating significantly decreased adherence of the  tested species to plain pvc but did not affect the binding to epa-pvc. however, after precoating with human plasma, epa-pvc compared to plain pvc showed a higher binding of s. aureus which might possibly be due to bridging effects of fibronectin or other plasma proteins, interacting with s. aureus.

AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

TI  == microbial evaluation: 139 implants removed from symptomatic patients.
AB  == possible adverse effects of microbial organisms have been implicated in symptomatic silicone implant patients. in the literature, numerous authors have investigated the possible role of infection with respect to implant problems. to  date, various bacterial species have been reported, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococci, and clostridium perfringens. infections in polyurethane-coated prostheses also have been shown to prolong morbidity. antibiotic use has been relatively empirical in this regard. the purpose of this study was, first, to determine the frequency, type, and clinical relevance of microbial colonization on implant surfaces removed from symptomatic patients and, second, to determine possible effects of microbial colonization on implant integrity (gel bleed, rupture). a total of 139 implants from 72 symptomatic patients were entered into the prospective clinical study between february of 1993 and july of 1994 at the ucla medical center. the implant shell types included smooth (79 percent), polyurethane (8 percent), textured (7 percent), and smooth and dacron (6 percent). the implant locations were subglandular (71 percent), submuscular (28 percent), and subcutaneous (1 percent). of the 139 implants removed, 69 percent were intact and 31 percent were ruptured. forty-seven percent of 139 implants were culture-positive. propionibacterium acnes was isolated most frequently (57.5 percent), followed by  staphylococcus epidermidis (41 percent), and then escherichia coli (1.5 percent). no fungal infections were identified. culture positivity was not significantly associated with systemic symptoms. sixty-seven percent of the positive culture implants were intact; 33 percent were ruptured. the frequency (47 percent) and types (p. acnes and s. epidermidis) of microbial colonization are determined in symptomatic silicone implant patients.

TI  == cloning and characterization of fema and femb from staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == a dna fragment was identified and cloned from staphylococcus epidermidis (se) using fema from s. aureus (sa) as a heterologous hybridization probe. dna sequence analysis of a portion of this clone revealed two complete orfs highly related to fema and femb of sa. the genomic arrangement of the se fema/b complex  was nearly identical to that observed in sa. intra- and interspecies relatedness  of these genes and conservation of genomic organization were consistent with gene duplication of one of these genes in an ancestral organism. recombinant fema, produced in escherichia coli (ec), was purified to near homogeneity. identity of  the purified protein was verified by n-terminal amino acid (aa) sequence analysis.

TI  == interleukin-10, interferon gamma, interleukin-2, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha detected during peritonitis in the dialysate and serum of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  == objective: to analyze interleukin (il)-10, interferon gamma (ifn-gamma), il-2, and soluble il-2 receptor alpha (sil-2r alpha) in the dialysate and serum of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd). design and patients: samples from dialysate bags were collected during the initial month of  dialysis. during peritonitis, samples were collected from the first three bags on the day of admittance to the hospital and from the night bags on days 3 and 10. serum samples were drawn on days 1 and 10. results: il-10 was detected in all dialysate samples except one on the first day of infection, with a peak median level of 50 pg/ml and a slow decrease thereafter. in serum the median levels never exceeded detectable levels. patients infected with escherichia coli or staphylococcus aureus had higher il-10 levels in dialysate on day 3 as compared to the remaining patients (p < 0.05). if the catheter had to be drawn, because of persistent cloudy dialysate, the il-10 levels remained elevated for a longer time (p < 0.05). ifn-gamma and il-2 were detected only in the dialysate of patients infected with either s. aureus or s. epidermidis. only one serum sample showed increased ifn-gamma. sil-2r alpha was found in all the serum and dialysis samples from the first day of infection. contrary to the analyzed cytokines, the receptor showed severalfold higher levels in serum as compared to the dialysate. during the infection the receptor levels in the dialysate increased, while they remained stationary in the serum, indicating a local production. conclusion: this is the first time il-10 has been demonstrated in the dialysate during peritonitis in capd patients. in view of its role as a suppressor of the immune and inflammatory responses, it is a potentially important observation, which might have clinical implications in the future.

TI  == in vitro activity of bay 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  == bay 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. the mic90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 8 mg/l. against  the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or  = 10-fold less active. mic90s for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. against gram-negative bacteria bay 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa.  against bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and clostridium spp. bay 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. the bactericidal activity against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin  g, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. as compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance  was less pronounced. the spontaneous mutation frequency towards bay 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in s. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

TI  == species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
AB  == siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, streptococcus suis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. in some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of  the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). e. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-oh-n-oh-delta-n-acetyl-l-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter  inhibition zone). b. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine b and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. p. multocida and p. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. individual siderophores did not promote s. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. the antibacterial activities of the  intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or  lost, even against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated  to siderophores. conjugate-resistant e. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.

TI  == measurement of bacterial growth rates on polymers.
AB  == a video microscope system and a mathematical model were developed to observe and  model the early stage of bacterial growth on polymer surfaces. glass slides were  coated with polyorthoester, poly(l-lactic acid), and polysulfone, and inserted into a laminar flow cell to expose them to bacterial cultures of staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or escherichia coli. the free energy of adhesion (delta fadh) was determined from contact-angle measurements. the microscopic observations along with the mathematical model allowed measurement of the rates of adhesion, release, and growth. the growth rate of p. aeruginosa on the various surfaces correlated to the delta fadh. the growth rates of all species on all of the surfaces were slower than the growth rates of the bacteria  in suspension. the mathematical model is valid for early growth before the bacteria form a complete monolayer, and is useful in predicting and modeling early growth of bacteria on implanted biomaterials.

TI  == a randomized prospective comparison of antibiotic tissue levels in the corpora cavernosa of patients undergoing penile prosthesis implantation using gentamicin  plus cefazolin versus an oral fluoroquinolone for prophylaxis.
AB  == purpose: we performed a prospective randomized trial comparing the efficacy, safety and cost of parenteral antibiotics and oral fluoroquinolones for prophylaxis in penile prosthesis surgery. materials and methods: we prospectively randomized 20 consecutive patients undergoing penile prosthesis surgery to receive ofloxacin orally or gentamicin and cefazolin parenterally followed by cephradine orally. intraoperatively corpora cavernosa tissue and simultaneous peripheral serum samples were evaluated for antibiotic levels. median followup was 16 months (range 8 to 21, mean 15.35). results: there were no implant losses  or reoperations and complications were comparable in the 2 groups. the difference in mean serum-to-tissue ratios of ofloxacin versus the combination of cefazolin and gentamicin was statistically significant (p < 0.03). the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin met or exceeded those of the 2 most common offending  organisms, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli, in 80% of patients, which was comparable to the results of the parenteral regimen. cost savings of the medications alone were more than $250,000 in the ofloxacin group. by eliminating a hospital stay of the 25,000 cases of penile prosthesis placement in the united states yearly a total cost savings of more than $36 million would be realized. conclusions: when oral ofloxacin is given for prophylaxis in penile implant surgery, the procedure may be performed on an outpatient basis and health care dollars are saved.

TI  == volume of blood required to detect common neonatal pathogens.
AB  == objective: to determine the minimum volume of blood and the absolute number of organisms required for detection of bacteremia and fungemia by an automated colorimetric blood culture system (bact/alert, organon teknika). design: common neonatal pathogens, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus (gbs): one american type culture collection (atcc) strain and one clinical isolate), staphylococcus epidermidis, and candida albicans, were seeded  into blood to produce bacteremia or fungemia with low colony counts (1 to 3 colony-forming units (cfu) per milliliter) and ultra-low colony counts (<1 cfu/ml). for each organism, 96 culture bottles were inoculated with either 0.25,  0.5, 1.0, or 4.0 ml of the two seeded blood concentrations. blood culture bottles were incubated in the bact/alert device for 5 days, and time to positivity was noted when applicable. all bottles were subcultured on plated media. data analysis: the poisson statistic was used to calculate the probability of finding  at least one viable cfu per inoculated culture bottle. the fraction of culture bottles with positive findings per group was divided by the probability of one or more organisms present to give the positivity index. results: plated subculture identified no growth of organisms not detected by the colorimetric detection system. the false-positive rate for the automated device was less than 1%. the positivity index for the gbs clinical isolate was 1.13, for the gbs atcc isolate  0.96, for s. epidermidis 0.94, for c. albicans 0.97, and for e. coli 0.95. there  was a statistically significant difference with time to positivity and inocula volume (p <0.01), but the difference was not clinically important. conclusions: if one or two viable colony-forming units are in the blood inoculated into culture media, the bact/alert system will detect growth rapidly. because there appears to be a sizable subset of neonates who are at risk of sepsis with a colony count less than 4 cfu/ml, then a 0.5 ml inoculum of blood into the culture media is inadequate for sensitive and timely detection of bacteremia. one to two  milliliters of blood should increase microorganism recovery in the face of low-colony-count sepsis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  == it has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an n-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. in an attempt to find such a precursor, a cdna clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cdna library from porcine bone marrow. in order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we  have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the c-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. we found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of vrrfpwwwpflrr had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. it showed potency against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus group d as well  as aspergillus fumigatus. the action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than  bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mm mgcl2. our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cdna indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.

AB  == a gene (fur) for a fur-like protein was identified on a 1.1 kb chromosomal dna fragment of staphylococcus epidermidis bn 280; the fur gene is followed by an open reading frame coding for the n-terminus of a putative superoxide dismutase.  within the -35 promoter region of both genes, as sequence motif was detected with low similarity to fur-binding regulatory dna segments, the so-called fur boxes. fur titration in escherichia coli strain h1717 demonstrated that the e. coli fur  protein binds to the fur box of the promoter region of the s. epidermidis fur gene. the s. epidermidis fur protein was expressed in e. coli as indicated by the formation of inactive dimers with the chimeric repressor ci(n)-fur(c) (stojiljkovic, i. and hantke. k.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cecropins.
AB  == the lytic peptides, cecropins, were originally isolated from the haemolymph of the giant silk moth, hyalophora cecropia and possess antibacterial and anticancer activity in vitro. this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of these peptides against human pathogens using standardised assay techniques, and the activity of cecropin b on outer and inner bacterial membranes. from a panel of 15 organisms, gram-negative bacteria were generally more sensitive to cecropins than gram-positive organisms, especially the lipopolysaccharide defective mutant, escherichia coli bue55. cecropins b and p1 shared similar mic values whereas shiva-1, a cecropin b analogue, was less active. through combination studies with hydrophobic antibiotics and electron microscopy, cecropin b was shown to disrupt  the bacterial outer membrane. protoplasts of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant to cecropin b, suggesting that the cytoplasmic membranes of gram-positive organisms were inherently more resistant to the peptide.

TI  == significance of endotoxin in lethal synergy between bacteria associated with sudden infant death syndrome: follow up study.
AB  == aim: to investigate the role of endotoxin in synergy between bacterial toxins associated with sudden infant death syndrome (sids). methods: extracellular toxins of 13 isolates of staphylococcus from sids victims and matched healthy infants were tested for lethal toxicity in chick embryos with and without standard endotoxin (used at 1.00 ng/embryo). endotoxin and toxins from staphylococci were used at dilutions with negligible lethality. results: simultaneous injection of non-lethal levels of endotoxin and toxins from 11 of the 13 staphylococcal isolates tested produced lethal toxicity that was 111 to 613% greater than expected by an additive effect alone. this was highly significant and occurred even in the absence of staphylococcal enterotoxins or toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. conclusion: endotoxin enhancement of staphylococcal toxin lethality could be partly responsible for the clinical outcome in sids.

TI  == bleed of and biologic response to triglyceride filler used in radiolucent breast  implants.
AB  == radiolucent breast implants filled with triglyceride oil have recently entered limited clinical trials. to investigate the questions of oil bleed and the fate of triglycerides that might escape from ruptured breast implants, experiments reported here used peanut oil labeled with radioisotopes so that it could be traced in the urine, feces, and organs of two groups of rabbits. in one experiment, 18 rabbits were implanted with peanut oil-filled implants labeled with tritium to determine whether triglycerides diffuse across silicone elastomer shells. in another experiment, 19 rabbits were injected with 14c-labeled peanut oil to study what might happen to the oil if an implant ruptures. at the end of the follow-up period, we measured radioisotope levels in tissue samples taken from the periprosthetic capsule or injection site of each rabbit, as well as from major organs and the subcutaneous fat on the dorsum opposite the experimental site. one experiment revealed that triglycerides do bleed across the implant shells. tritium levels were highest in the implant capsule, the omentum, the aorta, and the subcutaneous fat on the nonexperimental side. in the experiment simulating implant rupture, 14c levels were above the background radiation count  at the injection site and in the same tissue sites as in the bleed experiment. both in vivo radiolabeling studies indicate that triglycerides freed from implants by means of bleed or rupture would be absorbed, metabolized, and either  excreted or redistributed to the body's normal fat storage sites if they are not  needed for energy. in a third in vitro experiment, triglyceride oil specimens were inoculated with various microorganisms associated with wound infections: staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, and diphtheroids. the data demonstrate that neutral triglycerides used as a breast implant filler do not support growth of common infection-producing bacteria and suggest that triglycerides may have bactericidal properties.

AB  == in 1994, microbiology laboratories of ten portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. from 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples  significant numbers of escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida spp. were isolated. escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. a great variation in resistance values of p. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. resistance to methicillin in s. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an  average of 47%, and it was even higher with s. epidermidis (c.3000) and s. haemolyticus (c.650). only vancomycin was always active against these strains. in e. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. e. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.

TI  == variations in the fluorescence intensity of intact dapi-stained bacteria and their implications for rapid bacterial quantification.
AB  == as current techniques for the quantification of bacteria are laborious and often  imprecise, instrumental approaches such as sedimentation field-flow fractionation (sdfff) are attractive. in this technique, fluorogenic dyes specific for nucleic  acids are used to identify bacterial cells. bacterial biomass can be quantified directly with sdfff if the specific fluorescence of bacterial cells is constant.  the effect of different growth conditions on the specific fluorescence of one strain each of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus epidermidis stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was examined. specific fluorescence varied over a 500-fold range, from 0.22 to 103 arbitrary fluorescence units per cell. specific fluorescence was highest when cells were in log phase, and lowest when cells were in stationary phase. specific fluorescence decreased when cells harvested in log phase were starved for 7 d in  a carbon-free minimal medium, and increased rapidly (within 2 h) after cells were relieved from carbon limitation. such variations in specific fluorescence must be considered when using gross fluorescence as a direct indicator of bacterial numbers in the sdfff technique for quantifying bacterial biomass. moreover, they  have serious implications for the application of fluorescence techniques in other instrumental approaches for bacterial enumeration in environmental samples.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (cp-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (ipm), flomoxef, cefuzonam (czon) and cefotaxime. sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of ipm. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. in a killing kinetics study for haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a  concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. this effect was obtained at a concentration  8-fold lower than that of ipm. the protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. in murine experimental mixed infection with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ed50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than ipm. the therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its mic value. in guinea pigs experimental lung infection with klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than czon or cefotiam.

TI  == bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on latex and silicone t-tubes in relation to bacterial contamination of bile.
AB  == background: t-tube-related bacteriobilia causes infectious complications and obstruction. to prevent these, the choice of t-tube material may be of importance. methods: transected common bile ducts (cbds) of 17 piglets were sutured over latex or silicone t-tubes, or without a t-tube. results: after 6 weeks bacteriobilia was found in all of 12 cbds with and in 1 of 5 cbds without a t-tube (p < 0.05). by scanning electron microscopy (sem) four of five latex and none of five silicone t-tubes had bacterial biofilms (p < 0.05). all tubes remained patent. segments of t-tubes were incubated with five different bacterial strains. sonication and sem showed that 0.1-1.1% of 10(7) colony-forming units of inoculum adhered to t-tubes. two to six times more bacteria adhered to latex than to silicone (p < 0.05). conclusions: silicone offers better long-term patency than latex. less infectious complications occur if t-tubes are omitted.

TI  == endophthalmitis in patients with retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification.
AB  == purpose: to review the treatment and outcomes of patients presenting with concurrent endophthalmitis and retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification. methods: a retrospective chart review was conducted on patients presenting with culture-proven endophthalmitis and retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification between 1990 and 1994. results: five patients were identified with culture-proven endophthalmitis and retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification. in all patients, coagulase-negative staphylococci were cultured from the vitreous fluid. one patient also had positive cultures for proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. the interval between cataract surgery and treatment ranged from 5 days to 6 months. echography was beneficial in showing retained lens fragments in five of five patients when media opacities obscured the view of the fundus. four patients had vitrectomy and removal of retained lens fragments during their initial treatment. the fifth patient was treated with intravitreal antibiotics alone and continued to have marked inflammation, eventually requiring vitrectomy for removal of the retained lens fragments. a final visual acuity of 20/400 or better was achieved in four of the five patients. conclusions: patients may present with endophthalmitis in the setting of retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification. in such cases, the preferred initial management may be pars plana vitrectomy, removal of retained lens fragments, and injection of intraocular antibiotics. in eyes with endophthalmitis and opaque media, echography is a useful screening modality.

TI  == low-calcium peritoneal dialysis fluid should not impact peritonitis rates in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  == it has been suggested that reducing the calcium content of peritoneal dialysis fluid (pdf) to 2.5 meq/l decreases peritoneal macrophage (pmo) function and increases the incidence of peritonitis (especially staphylococcus epidermidis peritonitis) in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients. we studied the uptake and killing of s epidermidis and escherichia coli by pmos and peripheral blood leukocytes incubated in control buffer (hank's balanced salt solution containing 0.1% gelatin [ghbss]) and pdf containing varying concentrations of calcium (o to 3.5 meq/l) and magnesium (o to 1.5 meq/l) using ether diamine tetraacetic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid chelation, respectively. in addition, interleukin-1-beta-induced interleukin-6 production by human mesothelial cells was measured in the presence of concentrations of calcium increasing from 0 to 3.0 mmol/l. fc receptor- mediated uptake of s epidermidis by pmo in the complete absence of ca++ was comparable to that by pmo incubated in ghbss with calcium. in contrast, the complement-dependent uptake of e coli was significantly lower in ghbss devoid of ca++ (46% +/- 5% v 24% +/- 3%; 0.05 < p <  0.02). no effect on intracellular killing of either microorganism by pmo was observed. the same held true for the phagocytic and killing capacity of polymorphonuclear granulocytes and monocytes obtained from healthy donors. using  ca++ (2 to 3.5 meq/l) and mg++ (0.5 to 1.5 meq/l) concentrations as applied in commercial pdfs, however, phagocytes performed as well as in control buffer. interleukin-6 production by stimulated human mesothelial cells also required a small amount of ca++ only, being normal above the 0.1 to 3 mmol/l ca+ + range tested. thus, complement- dependent uptake of bacteria by phagocytes is calcium dependent, whereas antibody-dependent uptake of s epidermidis is not. the concentrations of calcium in the current pdfs, however, will not compromise human mesothelial cells and leukocyte functions, and therefore should not impact the peritonitis rate.

TI  == evidence that orthotopic transposition following rat heterotopic small bowel transplantation corrects overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == an overgrowth of pathogenic organisms occurs following rat heterotopic small bowel transplantation. this study assessed whether the bacterial microflora return to normal following subsequent orthotopic transposition of the graft. after 14 days the heterotopic graft was placed into continuity following resection of 15 cm of the host midintestinal loop. quantitative and qualitative analyses of the intraluminal bacteria were performed studying the resected host intestine, the heterotopic graft at 14 days, and the graft 14 days after transposition. a group of normal rats were used as controls. an overgrowth of staphylococcus epidermidis evident in the heterotopic graft at 14 days returned to a more normal bacterial profile following orthotopic transposition. these findings suggest that early interposition of a small bowel graft into an orthotopic position may prevent an alteration in the small bowel ecology toward potentially pathogenic organisms capable of translocation.

TI  == engineering of a novel thioether bridge and role of modified residues in the lantibiotic pep5.
AB  == pep5 is a 34-amino-acid antimicrobial peptide, produced by staphylococcus epidermidis 5, that contains the thioether amino acids lanthionine and methyllanthionine, which form three intramolecular ring structures. in addition,  two didehydrobutyrines are present in the central part of the lantibiotic and an  oxobutyryl residue is located at the n terminus. all rare amino acids are introduced by posttranslational modifications of a ribosomally made precursor peptide. to elucidate the function of the modified residues for the antimicrobial action of pep5, mutant peptides, in which single modified residues had been eliminated, were produced by site-directed mutagenesis. all of these peptides showed a reduced antimicrobial activity. in addition, those peptides from which the ring structures had been deleted became susceptible to proteolytic digest. this demonstrates that the ring structures serve as stabilizers of conformations  essential for activity, e.g., amphiphilicity, as well as for protecting pep5 against proteases of the producing strains. in addition, residues that could serve as precursors of new modified amino acids in lantibiotics were introduced into the pep5 precursor peptide. this way, a novel methyllanthionine and a didehydroalanine were inserted into the flexible central part of pep5, demonstrating that biosynthesis of modified amino acids is feasible by protein engineering and use of the lantibiotic modification system.

TI  == survival of nosocomial pathogenic bacteria at ambient temperature.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus and many gram-negative rods are prevalent nosocomial pathogens. the mechanisms by which these organisms persist and spread within the  hospital environment have not been clearly defined. we found that these bacteria  have an extraordinary capability for survival in the environment. the viabilities of staphylococcal and gram-negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolates were assessed on three environmental surfaces: a non-nutrient surface, a woven cotton fiber, and a blood protein coagulum. the bacteria were dried on these surfaces and quantitatively subcultured over six months. the viability was  consistently higher on dried blood surfaces. viability was next highest on cotton strings. for both of these environments, staphylococci appeared to lose viability between three and six months, while e. coli and p. aeruginosa survived longer. survival on a clean non-nutrient surface (tubes alone) for all organisms was much briefer and did not extend beyond four weeks. such extended survival on blood and fiber surfaces, as observed in part, explains the difficulty in controlling colonization of patients by and spread of these nosocomial pathogens.

AB  == semi-quantitative and qualitative bacterial assessment of the vaginal and cervical flora of a total of 202 women was carried out over a period of six months to determine the bacterial flora in three groups of women and changes caused by prior use of antibiotics. the number was made up of 32 healthy volunteers, 80 women with gynaecological problems and 90 women with gynaecological infections who had had antibiotic treatment prior to this study. standard methods were used for the investigations. five main genera of anaerobic  bacteria were isolated from all patients. they included, the bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and clostridium spp. five non-sporing gram negative anaerobic bacteria constituted the bulk of the flora including prevotella bivia, p. disiens, p. melanogenica, p. asaccharolytica and b. fragilis. the predominant flora was p. bivia occurring in 61 pc of cervical swab specimens of the 80 women with proven gynaecological infections who had not used antibiotics and accounting for 27 pc of the total number of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria isolated. escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequently encountered aerobic bacteria. the semi-quantitative counts of the different bacterial species in the patient group  were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy individuals (p < 0,025). similarly, prior antibiotic administration significantly reduced the population and quantitative count of the anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of polyurethane and silicone catheters containing low concentrations of silver: a new perspective in prevention of polymer-associated foreign-body-infections.
AB  == in modern medicine, infection is one of the most serious complications of implanted plastic devices. the host is not able to overcome this special type of  opportunistic infection despite having a normal immune response and a low virulence of most of the bacteria involved. antimicrobial therapy alone generally cannot cure the infection and the removal of catheters often remains the only choice of therapy. bacterial adhesion to the polymer surface of the catheter, be  it luminal or external, is an important step in the pathogenesis of catheter-associated infections. in this report, we describe new approaches to the prevention of infections by impregnation of polyurethane and silicone with silver by two different methods. the antimicrobial activity of these silver-impregnated  catheters is more than 10 fold higher for coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns)  compared to catheters without silver. similar results are obtained with other microbial organisms like staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the new polymers show no cytotoxic or thrombogenic side effects in vitro.

TI  == high sensitivity of mycobacterium species to the bactericidal activity by polylysine.
AB  == bactericidal effects of polylysine on different bacterial species were measured.  marked differences in sensitivity were observed. based on the concentration of polylysine required to reduce cell viability by 50%, mycobacterium smegmatis and  mycobacterium tuberculosis were found to be the most sensitive and escherichia coli the most resistant. in addition, two gram-positive organisms, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus salivarius exhibited significant differences in sensitivity which suggests that the relationship between sensitivity towards polylysine and bacterial cell type is not necessarily a function of the overall cell envelope structure. the high sensitivity of mycobacteria suggests the possible use of polylysine, or a conjugate of polylysine and another agent in anti-mycobacterial drug design.

TI  == quantification of the ease of removal of bacteria from surfaces.
AB  == this paper describes a technique which reproducibly quantifies the ease of removal of microorganisms from surfaces. tiles (22 mm x 22 mm) of various materials were colonised with staphylococcus epidermidis nctc 11047, escherichia  coli k12 hb101 or pseudomonas aeruginosa pawh, by submersion, for various times (2 min-48 h), in inoculated tryptone soya broth (37 degrees c). colonised tiles were blotted onto a tryptone soya agar plate for 1 min and the process was repeated through a succession of agar plates. the final plate contained tetrazolium salts (0.05% w/v) and was incubated in situ with the tile. tetrazolium plates indicated that very few organisms remained on the tiles after  15 successive blots. in all instances, the number of recovered colonies per plate decreased exponentially with plate succession number, according to the relationship, cfu = a.10-kn, where cfu is the number of colonies transferred, k is the removal exponent, a is the intercept and n is the plate succession number. removal exponents differed significantly between organisms (p > 0.95), depended on the nature of the test surface, and decreased as the inital attachment and colonisation time was increased from 2 min-48 h. intercept values (a) but not the gradients were dependent upon the initial numbers of bacteria in suspension. these data indicate that the gradients derived from counting recoverable viable cells from successive blots of test tiles onto agar is a measure of the strength  of attachment of the organisms to the surface.

AB  == four hundred and forty-one and 1048 episodes of bacteraemia were prospectively surveyed over a period of 18 months in two hospitals, a 450 bed community hospital and a 900 bed tertiary care urban university hospital. incidence of bacteraemia was 2.18 per 1000 hospitalization days (10.1 per 1000 admissions) in  the community hospital and 2.64 per 1000 hospitalization days (12.0 per 1000 admissions (p < 0.004)) in the university hospital. sixty six and 62% of episodes of bacteraemia were community acquired. the majority of bacteraemic episodes originated on the internal medicine wards of both hospital--46.7% and 58.7% respectively; the incidence of bacteraemia in the medical divisions of both hospitals was 23.1 and 17.5 per 1000 admissions respectively (p < 0.01). overall  mortality rates were 22% and 26.7% respectively. 39.9% and 44% of all isolates were gram-positive pathogens. escherichia coli was the commonest gram-negative pathogen in both hospitals, particularly the community hospital--47.5% vs 32.8% (p < 0.005) of all gram-negative pathogens, while pseudomonas spp. were significantly more common in the university hospital--18.5% vs 11.8% (p < 0.02).  non-enterococcal streptococci were more common in the community hospital while enterococci were far more common at the university hospital--15.1% vs 1% of all gram-positive pathogens (p < 0.05). staphylococcus epidermidis was more common among the community hospital gram-positive bacteraemias--31.1% vs 18.6% (p < 0.005). for almost all genera and species, antibiotic resistance was higher at the university hospital. twenty nine point four per cent of staphylococcus aureus isolates from the university hospital were methicillin resistant compared to 2.4% at the community hospital (p < 0.005). 29.4% of all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at the university hospital were penicillin resistant while no resistance was found at the community hospital. a high resistance rate to ofloxacin was found at the university hospital among s. aureus and pseudomonas sp. sources of bacteraemia did not differ significantly between the two hospitals. in conclusion, although outcome did not differ significantly for the two hospitals,  there were significant differences between blood culture isolates in these two different settings. these differences may influence clinical decision-making about antibiotic therapy for patients in these hospitals.

TI  == cloning and characterization of a novel, plasmid-encoded trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase from staphylococcus haemolyticus mur313.
AB  == in recent years resistance to the antibacterial agent trimethoprim (tmp) has become more widespread, and several trimethoprim-resistant (tmpr) dihydrofolate reductases (dhfrs) have been described from gram-negative bacteria. in staphylococci, only one tmpr dhfr has been described, the type s1 dhfr, which is  encoded by the dfra gene found on transposon tn4003. in order to investigate the  coincidence of high-level tmp resistance and the presence of dfra, we analyzed the dnas from various tmpr staphylococci for the presence of dfra sequences by pcr with primers specific for the thye-dfra genes from tn4003. we found that 30 or 33 isolates highly resistant to tmp (mics, > or = 512 micrograms/ml) contained dfra sequences, whereas among the tmpr (mics, < or = 256 micrograms/ml) and tmps  isolates only the staphylococcus epidermidis isolates (both tmpr and tmps) seemed to contain the dfra gene. furthermore, we have cloned and characterized a novel,  plasmid-encoded tmpr dhfr from staphylococcus haemolyticus mur313. the dfrd gene  of plasmid pabu17 is preceded by two putative shine-dalgarno sequences potentially allowing for the start of translation at two triplets separated by nine nucleotides. the predicted protein of 166 amino acids, designated s2dhfr, encoded by the longer open reading frame was overproduced in escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. the molecular size of the recombinant s2dhfr was determined by ion spray mass spectrometry to be 19,821.2 +/- 2 da, which is in agreement with the theoretical value of 19,822 da. in addition, the recombinant s2dhfr was shown to exhibit dhfr activity and to be highly resistant to tmp.

TI  == nosocomial bacteremia-induced increases in abscess formation correlate with in vitro upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to common nosocomial pathogens can alter the host response to a later, distant infectious insult (peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation), and that these changes are related to the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. design: a multiexperiment, randomized, controlled trial. setting: animal research laboratory of a university medical center. subjects: one hundred sixty-five balb/c mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were used for in vivo experiments and as the source of peritoneal macrophages for in vitro experiments. interventions: nine groups of mice (n = 10 to 18 per group) were twice systemically preexposed to sublethal amounts of live escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, or candida albicans, or to 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms e. coli lipopolysaccharide o26:b6. one week later, mice underwent the induction of mixed e. coli/bacteroides fragilis peritonitis, leading to abscess formation. in parallel experiments in vitro, 10(6) mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with similar amounts of nosocomial pathogens or lipopolysaccharide to determine the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. measurements and main results: the three gram-negative bacilli tested significantly upregulated both abscess formation and macrophage procoagulant activity, with a strong linear correlation between abscess formation and procoagulant activity. these effects were not seen with the gram-positive cocci or with c. albicans. pre-exposure of mice to endotoxin alone  did not alter later abscess formation, but did increase macrophage procoagulant activity. conclusions: sublethal exposure to some gram-negative nosocomial pathogens can significantly alter a host's response to a later, distant, infection, even when caused by different bacteria. in the case of peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation, these changes may be mediated by the upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity. the presence of endotoxin alone does not completely explain these phenomena.

TI  == pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis: report of a series of 23 patients.
AB  == vertebral osteomyelitis, an infectious disease with vague manifestations, can be  difficult to diagnose. although vertebral osteomyelitis represents only 2-4% of bone infections, the consequences are often grave and disabling, even fatal, when untreated. a series of 23 cases is reported in which patient records were reviewed to determine the etiology and appropriateness of diagnosis and management. information on treatment and follow-up after discharge was obtained from outpatient progress notes, records from subsequent hospital admissions, and  telephone interviews of patients. pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis was diagnosed  by positive needle or open biopsy tissue cultures, positive blood cultures in the appropriate clinical setting, or diagnostic histopathology. staphylococcus aureus was grown from 75% (15/20) of patient cultures, escherichia coli from 15%, and staphylococcus epidermidis from 10%. overall, 87% (20/23) of these patients were  disease-free at follow-up. the experience with this series of patients demonstrates that early diagnosis aided by mri ensures a high cure rate and low complication rate.

TI  == prospective study of plasma fibronectin in fulminant hepatitis: association with  infection and mortality.
AB  == background/aims: plasma fibronectin is an opsonic glycoprotein, normally synthesized by the liver, which decreases subsequent to severe liver damage and low levels of which may contribute to reticuloendothelial system dysfunction by compromising opsonic activity. this may result in an increased frequency of infection and death. the present study was conducted to evaluate the association  of plasma fibronectin activity with infection and mortality in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. methods: plasma fibronectin was estimated serially in  69 consecutive patients with fulminant hepatic failure, nine patients with uncomplicated acute viral hepatitis and 32 normal volunteers. results: plasma fibronectin levels in patients with fulminant hepatic failure (85.6 +/- 75.8 micrograms/ml) were significantly lower than in patients with uncomplicated acute viral hepatitis (295.5 +/- 88.5 micrograms/ml) and healthy volunteers (362.6 +/-  69.2 micrograms/ml). forty-nine (72%) patients with fulminant hepatic failure died. the initial values of fibronectin in fulminant hepatic failure did not correlate with mortality. patients with fulminant hepatic failure who survived showed a progressive rise in the fibronectin levels compared to the absence of an increase in fibronectin levels in the non-survivors. the mortality in patients with fulminant hepatic failure with infection (24/27) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared to those without infection (25/42). initial fibronectin levels in patients with infection (70.3 +/- 54.2 micrograms/ml) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in those without infection (92.3 +/- 64.4 micrograms/ml). we conclude that plasma fibronectin levels in patients with fulminant hepatic failure are decreased compared to healthy subjects and the absence of an increase in levels indicates a poor prognosis. low levels of fibronectin are associated with an increased incidence of infection, which increases the mortality in these  patients.

AB  == the bactericidal activity of two new 4-quinolones, du-6859a and dv-7751a, was investigated against strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. du-6859a and dv-7751a were more bactericidal than any 4-quinolone tested previously. furthermore, du-6859a was unique among 4-quinolones in being able to kill ent. faecalis after incubation for only 3 h in nutrient broth. the bactericidal mechanisms of dv-7551a were similar to those of other 4-quinolones, but, uniquely, du-6859a possessed additional bactericidal mechanisms against both str. pneumoniae and ent. faecalis. this may explain the unusually potent bactericidal  activity of this agent against these species. these results show that du-6859a is a unique extended-spectrum 4-quinolone, which should prove to be superior to established 4-quinolones.

TI  == subspecies discrimination of staphylococci from revision arthroplasties by ribotyping.
AB  == sixty-six cultures of staphylococcus spp. were obtained from bone and tissue samples collected from 37 patients during revision arthroplasties and were speciated and ribotyped to assess strain diversity in each species. there were 10 ribotypes among 51 isolates of s. epidermidis, three among three isolates of s. capitis, two among four isolates of s. aureus and two among two isolates of s. simulans. one ribotype was found among each of: two isolates of s. warneri; two isolates of s. haemolyticus and single isolates of s. cohnii and s. saprophyticus. low molecular weight bands of ribotype patterns characterized one  or two related species whereas high molecular weight bands were useful for distinguishing types within species. specimens from 17 patients yielded more than one isolate of staphylococcus spp. in 13 of these patients the isolates were representatives of a single species but in only eight did ribotyping show the isolates to be identical. the findings of multiple species and ribotypes from samples taken from the same patient may have implications for understanding the nature of infection in revision arthroplasty and for antibiotic therapy.

TI  == low birth weight and nosocomial infection of neonates in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == a one year prospective surveillance of nosocomial infections (ni) in a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) was performed. among 229 neonates the infection rate was 27.1%, the infection proportion 20.1%, and the incidence density 21.9 infections per 1000 patient days. infants were stratified into four birth weight  categories. degrees of infection ranged from 44.4% in the < or = 1000 g group to  10.1% in the > 2500 g group. differences between the groups were statistically significant (p < 0.01). the mean birth weight of infants with ni was significantly lower than that of infants without ni (1711 g, sd +/- 841 g vs. 2213 g, sd +/- 896 g; p < 0.01). mortality of < or = 1000 g babies was 44.4 and 7.6% in > 2500 g neonates. major sites of infection were pneumonia (32.3%), blood-stream infections (27.4%), infections of the skin, and surgical site infections (11.3% each). the predominant pathogen was staphylococcus aureus (24.2%) whilst gram-negative bacteria accounted for 22.7% of the total. other major infective agents were staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and group b streptococci. it is concluded, that low birth weight was a major risk factor for the acquisition of ni in the observed nicu population.

TI  == the high risk heart donor: potential pitfalls.
AB  == background: the use of potentially infected donor hearts has been advocated to extend the supply of available hearts for transplantation. methods: to determine  whether bacterial transmission from donor to recipient can occur with heart transplantation, we reviewed our experience with the 347 patients who received 360 heart transplants in the utah transplant affiliated hospitals from 1988 to 1993. results: during this time, nineteen donors had positive blood cultures before harvest. sixteen donors had gram-positive bacteremia: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 9), staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), streptococcus (n = 2). two donors had gram-negative bacteremia: serratia (n = 1) and acinetobacter (n = 1).  one donor had blood cultures positive for both escherichia coli and streptococcus. infectious complications occurred in two of three recipients who received a heart from a donor with gram-negative bacteremia: escherichia coli endocarditis, mediastinitis, sepsis and death in one, and serratia sepsis and mediastinitis in another. in each case the organisms and sensitivities were identical between donor and recipient. no infectious complications related to the donor heart occurred among the 16 recipients who received hearts from donors with gram-positive bacteremia. conclusions: (1) bacterial transmission from donor heart to recipient can occur, (2) bacterial transmission appears to be more common with gram-negative organisms, and (3) infection of the recipient with a gram-negative organism from the donor heart is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

TI  == in vivo verification of in vitro model of antibiotic treatment of device-related  infection.
AB  == device-related infections are difficult to treat with antibiotics alone. standard susceptibility tests do not correlate with treatment success. therefore, the utility of a pharmacokinetic in vitro model has been evaluated in comparison with the tissue-cage infection model in guinea pigs. the bactericidal activity of 28 treatment regimens has been studied by using three different test strains. in vitro efficacy was defined as reduction in the number of suspended or adherent bacteria, and in vivo efficacy was defined as reduction in the number of bacteria in tissue-cage fluid. test results between the two models (in vivo and in vitro)  correlated well, with correlation coefficients of 0.85 for in vivo efficacy versus in vitro efficacy against suspended bacteria and 0.72 for in vivo efficacy versus in vitro efficacy against adherent bacteria (p < 0.05) for staphylococcus  aureus, 0.96 and 0.82 (p < 0.05) for staphylococcus epidermidis, and 0.89 and 0.97 for escherichia coli, respectively. in contrast, standard susceptibility tests, ratios of mics to trough or peak levels, ratios of the area under the curve to the mic, or time above the mic were not predictive for therapeutic outcome in either the in vitro or in vivo model. in both models, the bactericidal activity levels with combination regimens were significantly higher than those with single-drug regimens (p < 0.001). furthermore, rifampin combinations with either vancomycin, teicoplanin, fleroxacin, or ciprofloxacin were significantly more bactericidal against adherent bacteria than netilmicin combinations with vancomycin or daptomycin (p < 0.01). thus, in vivo verification of the pharmacokinetic in vitro model correlated well with the animal model. the in vitro model offers an alternative to ther animal model in experiments that screen and assess antibiotic regimens against device-related infections.

TI  == cefotaxime for treatment of neonatal sepsis and meningitis.
AB  == neonatal sepsis is a clinical syndrome characterized by systemic signs and symptoms, and bacteremia during the first month of life. the incidence is relatively low (one to eight cases/1000 live births), yet the risk of mortality is approximately 25%. meningitis in the neonate is usually a sequela of bacteremia; however, it is discussed with neonatal sepsis, because they commonly  share etiology and pathogenesis. the incidence of meningitis is usually a fraction of the number of infants with sepsis, varying in different settings from one-fourth to one-third. the mortality rate is high, varying in some series from  15%-50%. there are two major forms of presentation of neonatal sepsis. early-onset disease presents as a fulminant, multisystemic illness during the first 5-7 days of life; late-onset disease is more commonly recognized after the  first weeks of life. because different microorganisms are responsible for the two forms of disease, the choice of antimicrobial agents also differs. some organisms such as escherichia coli, group b streptococci, and listeria monocytogenes may be responsible, whereas other pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa are usually associated with late-onset disease. classic initial (empiric) treatment of neonatal sepsis and meningitis consists of ampicillin and an aminoglycoside. with the advent of the third-generation cephalosporins, however, the empiric antimicrobial approach for  neonatal sepsis and meningitis has changed in most centers. third-generation cephalosporins cover more of the pathogens implicated in neonatal sepsis and meningitis, except for the enterococci and l. monocytogenes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a bacteriological work on surface infections was done among live births (study group i) and neonates admitted in hospital (study group ii). out of 134 cases of  conjunctivitis in group i gram-negative bacilli predominated (48.5%) with escherichia coli accounting for 29 (14.9%) cases, klebsiella species 15 (11.2%) cases, citrobacter freundii 3 (2.2%) cases, pseudomons aeruginosa 18 (13.4%) cases and aeromonas hydrophila 3 (2.2%) amongst pure isolates (73.9%). gonococcus was noted in 2 (1.5%) cases. in group ii, 41.7% were staphylococcus aureus in pure growth (75%), compared to only 9.0% in group i. skin infections were caused  by both staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the principal insolates from umbilical sepsis. pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated as pure growth from local site of noma neonatorum. anaerobic cultures were negative in all except in 2 cases of umbilical sepsis with tetanus neonatorum revealing clostridium tetani which however proved to be non-toxigenic. blood cultures were positive in 4 out of 14 cases bearing 50% correlation with bacteria from surface infections. a source study established partial correlation  with the cases of pseudomonas conjunctivitis. phage typing of staphylococcus aureus and biochemical typing failed to detect any definite marker of clinical entities, except that the skin infections were caused by group iii phages predominantly (65.0%).

TI  == comparison of bacteria growth in single and pooled platelet concentrates after deliberate inoculation and storage.
AB  == background: the ability to store pools of platelet concentrates (pcs) for extended periods would provide logistical flexibility. however, reports of severe adverse reactions due to the transfusion of contaminated pcs led to an examination of whether the total bacteria levels after storage of pools containing a deliberately inoculated platelet unit would be significantly different than the levels in paired unpooled concentrates. study design and methods: a single pc was deliberately inoculated on day 0 with one of three bacterial species (0.1-8.0 colony-forming units/ml). on day 1, the deliberately inoculated pc was divided into three equal parts and either 1) pooled with 5 half-volume, abo- and rh-identical pcs; 2) similarly pooled and white cell reduced; or 3) kept as a control. sterile connections were used during pooling; modified storage containers were used to ensure the correct surface-to-volume ratio of the single unit. results: between day 2 and day 5 of storage, in 26 of 36 paired samples, nonfiltered pools containing escherichia coli had greater total numbers of bacteria than did the paired single pcs. day 2 pools had total bacteria levels approximately five times higher (colony-forming units/ml x container volume) than those in single units (p < 0.05). there was rapid growth of staphylococcus aureus by day 2 in pooled and unpooled pcs; by day 3, total bacteria levels were approximately five times higher in pools than in single units (p < 0.05). between days 3 and 5 of storage, in 23 of 27 paired samples, nonfiltered pools containing s. aureus had greater total bacteria levels than the single pcs. by day 5, 15 of 16 non-white-cell reduced pools had total levels of staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria approximately five times those in the paired  single pcs. greater total bacteria levels in pooled units than in single units generally occurred when bacteria in pools reached the stationary phase of growth  (when bacteria concentration became constant), and they were well correlated with the sixfold volume of pooled units. white cell reduction did not substantially affect the time required to attain stationary phase. conclusion: the potential during storage for greater total bacteria levels in pools than in single pcs is a consequence of the greater volume of the pool.

TI  == use of ribotyping to investigate tracheal colonisation by staphylococcus epidermidis as a source of bacteremia in ventilated newborns.
AB  == ribotyping was used to determine whether a relationship exists between endotracheal tube colonisation with staphylococcus epidermidis and bacteremia with this organism. over a three-week period, four mechanically ventilated preterm babies presented with five episodes of infection and bacteremia. for each blood specimen obtained for culture a tracheal aspirate sample was collected at the same time by suctioning. after dna extraction and cleavage by ecori, hybridisation was performed with a digoxigenin-labelled 16s-rdna probe from escherichia coli. five different band patterns were recognised on the membrane. in two children the same band pattern was found in staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from both blood and tracheal aspirate. ribotyping thus could be used to  differentiate a series of infections from an outbreak and showed that a relationship may exist between tracheal colonisation and bacteremia in mechanically ventilated newborns.

TI  == development of wound infection or separation after cesarean delivery. prospective evaluation of 2,431 cases.
AB  == wound infections are a common surgical complication, often requiring a prolonged  hospital stay and leading to increased costs. over a one-year period, 2,431 patients were followed after cesarean delivery with prompt evaluation and culture of all suspicious wounds. seventy subjects (2.8%) developed confirmed wound infection, and 42 (1.7%) developed noninfected open surgical wounds. seven (0.3%) fascial dehiscences were diagnosed, requiring surgical repair. forty of 63 (64%)  infected wounds had positive bacterial cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis  (29%), enterococcus faecalis (17%), staphylococcus aureus (17%), escherichia coli (11%) and proteus mirabilis (10%) the most frequent isolates. only 7 of 42 (17%)  noninfected wounds had positive cultures, with only s aureus, s epidermidis and corynebacterium species isolated. ninety-five percent of the noninfected wounds had blood or serous collections present. rupture of membranes lasting longer than six hours, emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity were associated with a  statistically increased likelihood of the development of infected wounds. emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity, but not prolonged rupture of membranes, were associated with an increased likelihood of the development of noninfected wounds. therefore, it appears that at least two mechanisms are responsible for the development of postcesarean open wounds: (1) increased amniotic fluid and wound colonization due to prolonged rupture of membranes, resulting in a wound infection containing one or more bacterial species derived from the cervicovaginal flora, and (2) increased exogenous bacterial contamination and flora consistent with skin species or breaks in sterile technique, often accompanying difficult or emergency surgery.

TI  == antibiotic killing of bacteria: comparison of bacteria on surfaces and in liquid, growing and nongrowing.
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics for bacterial pathogens are  derived from broth suspensions (broth dilution) and from nutrient surfaces (agar  dilution). these concentrations may not apply when bacteria are on a nonnutrient  surface such as in a foreign body infection. we compared bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli) broth suspension mbcs with mbcs of the same bacteria when on a nonnutrient surface in broth the growing and nongrowing phases. bacteria growing on cotton surfaces were much less susceptible to antibiotic killing than when freely suspended in the liquid nutrient. these results alone, independent of host factors, would explain the failure of antibiotics to eradicate infections involving bacteria on foreign body surfaces.  the resistance of bacteria to antibiotic killing is not caused by a lack of antibiotic penetration to the site of the bacteria, but by an altered state of the bacteria when they are associated with a surface.

AB  == six widely used x-ray contrast media (xrc) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using xrc to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of  using xrc in divided doses to reduce cost. preparations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/ml (cfu/ml) were inoculated into the following xrc: conray 280, hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, omnipaque 350, ultravist 300 and optiray 320 each in two concentrations. sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees c and 4 degrees c. there were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the gram-negative organisms. conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. most effects were bacteriostatic. organisms were  most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with xrc. no effect was seen with dilute xrc. all weekly sterility checks were negative. non-ionic xrc have no significant effect on the growth of gram-positive organisms and little effect on gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of xrc occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of xrc utilization.

TI  == in vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  == many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. it has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary ph, with consequent stone formation. unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g.  escherichia coli). it has been recently reported that e. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. this study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa  and micrococcus luteus. subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (p < 0.003) reduce the uk activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. the urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, m. luteus, was, however,  the exception (p = 0.1079). in contrast to s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa and m. luteus (p < 0.0213), p. mirabilis and s. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase  activity (p < 0.4047). these results may explain why proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. according to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. these conditions may lead to renal stone formation. an increase in urinary ph resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. it is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double  role in renal stone formation.

TI  == the leucocyte protein l1 (calprotectin): a putative nonspecific defence factor at epithelial surfaces.
AB  == the l1 protein occurs at high concentrations in neutrophils, monocytes, certain reactive tissue macrophages, squamous mucosal epithelia, and reactive epidermis.  it constitutes in fact about 60% of the neutrophilic cytosol protein fraction. the two l1 chains (l1h and l1l) are referred to by a bewildering collection of names, various authors having different preferences (mrp-8 and mrp-14; cfa or calgranulin a and b). the most recent proposal is calprotectin because of its calcium-binding properties and antimicrobial effect shown in vitro. l1 belongs to the s-100 protein family and may be involved in the regulation of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. it exists at high levels in blood and interstitial tissue fluid in several infectious, inflammatory, and malignant disorders, and it is released abundantly in foci of granulocytes and macrophages. the c-terminal sequence of the l1h chain has been shown to be identical to the n-terminus of peptides known as neutrophil immobilizing factors. such an activity of l1 could be important for the accumulation of vital granulocytes, while l1 released from neutrophils, macrophages and epithelial cells might exert antimicrobial activity, perhaps by depriving microorganisms of zinc. the minimum  inhibitory concentrations of l1 in vitro were found to be 4-32 mg/l for candida albicans, 64 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, 64-256 mg/l for s. epidermidis, and  256 mg/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. killing was observed at 2-4 times higher concentrations. in patients with hiv infection, those who developed  oral candidiasis had significantly lower parotid l1 levels than those who did not (67 micrograms/l vs. 216 micrograms/l).

TI  == effects of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin on physicochemical surface properties of  staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == under clinical conditions, during antibiotic treatment, micro-organisms often grow at sub-inhibitory concentrations. this may lead to altered adhesive cell surface properties and to a disruption of the indigenous microflora, in addition  to the creation of a more pathogenic biofilm. the effects of growing staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli and lactobacilli in the presence of  sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin were determined. growing the cells under antibiotic burden sometimes led to altered cell surface hydrophobicity (by adhesion to hexadecane), changes in the ph-dependence of zeta  potentials, and elemental surface compositions or in different sds-page protein profiles. for several isolates only one of the surface properties was altered by  the presence of an antibiotic in the growth medium and no systematic effects were observed for all isolates representing a certain species or even strain. the important conclusion to be drawn from the results of this study is that the effects of growing cells under antibiotic burden on their adhesive cell surface properties can only be established when using a variety of techniques.

AB  == increasing reports of gentamicin-resistant bacteria contaminating donor corneas and causing endophthalmitis have indicated that preservation of corneal storage media with 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin alone needs reevaluation. we investigated the stability and possible cytotoxicity of streptomycin as a supplement to gentamicin in optisol corneal storage medium. the combination of gentamicin and streptomycin in optisol solution was stable at room temperature for at least 4 weeks and inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, alpha hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus group d, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, and diphtheroids, but not pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the addition of vancomycin did not significantly improve the antibacterial effectiveness of the gentamicin and streptomycin combination when stored at 4 degrees c. the growth of 15 of 20 clinical ocular isolates of ps. aeruginosa was suppressed by the gentamicin-streptomycin combination. streptomycin in concentrations of up to 1,000 micrograms/ml did not decrease the  mitotic activity of corneal endothelial cells as evaluated by the in vitro incorporation of tritiated thymidine or cause cytotoxicity. the addition of 200 micrograms/ml of streptomycin to optisol corneal storage medium containing 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin may significantly improve activity against gentamicin-sensitive and gentamicin-resistant contaminants.

AB  == to determine whether a single dose of intravenously administered immune globulin  (ivig) decreases late-onset sepsis in premature infants, we prospectively entered 753 neonates with birth weight 500 to 2000 gm, gestation < or = 34 weeks, and age < or = 12 hours into a multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial. infants were  randomly selected to receive a single intravenous infusion, 10 ml/kg, of either ivig (500 mg/kg) or albumin (5 mg/kg) and were observed for 8 weeks for infection. maternal and neonatal risk factors for infection did not differ between groups. although serum igg values before infusion were related to gestation (r = 0.62), the change in serum igg or half-life of igg after ivig infusion was not (r < or = 0.09). the serum igg concentration was increased (p <  0.05) in ivig-treated patients for 8 weeks. there were 88 episodes of late-onset  sepsis in 79 neonates (10.5%). causative organisms included the following: staphylococcus epidermidis (37 episodes), enterococcus (9), staphylococcus aureus (7), candida (6), escherichia coli (6), and multiple organisms (11). sepsis, death, and death as a result of infection were unaffected by treatment. we conclude that a single infusion of ivig, 500 mg/kg, shortly after birth was not effective prophylaxis for late-onset infection in premature neonates. future studies of late-onset sepsis prophylaxis should consider ivig with known pathogen-specific antibody concentrations against organisms causing these infections, in particular s. epidermidis.

TI  == opsonic activity of commercially available standard intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  == several standard intravenous immunoglobulin g (ivig) products are available in the united states and have been used with the intent to treat or prevent infections in neonates. we evaluated more than 100 lots of ivig, from 6 products, to determine the amount of opsonic antibody against neonatal pathogens. neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis was used to determine opsonic activity in  these preparations for staphylococcus epidermidis; haemophilus influenzae type b; streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 14 and 19; group b streptococcus serotypes  ia, ib, ia/c, ii and iii; and escherichia coli (k1). pathogen-specific opsonic activity of the lots tested ranged from undetectable to 1:80 and was detectable in < 10% to > 90% of lots tested depending on the organism and manufacturer. within an ivig lot there was variable opsonic activity against different strains  or serotypes of the same organism. opsonic activity was significantly (p < or = 0.05) affected by the manufacturer's donor pool and less so by the manufacturing  method. we conclude that the pathogen-specific opsonic antibody activity of an ivig lot is: (1) highly variable for several common neonatal pathogens; (2) predominantly dependent on the donor pool and not the manufacturing method. clinicians may more appropriately select therapy if the pathogen-specific antibody content of ivig products by lot are known. in the future neonatal ivig research should focus on using preparations with known pathogen-specific antibody activity.

TI  == differential effects of chlorination of bacteria on their capacity to generate no, tnf-alpha and il-6 in macrophages.
AB  == activated rodent macrophages produce high amounts of nitric oxide (no). no as a tumoricidal and defence molecule against intracellular parasites is commonly accepted. however, its role as an obligatory killing factor for extracellular bacteria is controversial. in the present study we stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages by heat-killed bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and escherichia coli). in some groups bacteria were pretreated with hocl, to replace  the chlorinating system in activated neutrophils that operates as a bactericidal  system in vivo. high levels of no, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) were detected after stimulation by all non-chlorinated bacteria strains tested. however, after chlorination gram-positive bacteria lost  their ability to induce no and tnf-alpha, whereas phagocytosis and il-6 production were not affected by chlorination.

TI  == construction of an expression system for engineering of the lantibiotic pep5.
AB  == pep5 is a lanthionine-containing antimicrobial peptide which is produced by staphylococcus epidermidis 5. its structural gene, pepa, is located on the 20-kb  plasmid ped503. a 6.2-kb fragment of ped503 containing pepa, the immunity gene pepi, and 5.4 kb of downstream sequence was able to direct biosynthesis of biologically active pep5 in a nonproducing variant of the producer strain which is devoid of ped503. in addition to producing wild-type pep5 with a molecular mass of 3,488 da, the clone produced a peptide with an eightfold-lower bactericidal activity and a mass of 3,506 da, indicative of incomplete dehydration of one hydroxyamino acid. for construction of the expression system,  this 6.2-kb fragment was cut into a 1.39-kb fragment containing pepa and pepi and a 4.8-kb fragment covering the remaining downstream region. this 4.8-kb fragment  was directly cloned into an escherichia coli-staphylococcus shuttle vector, yielding a new plasmid (pgb9) into which mutated pepa genes generated on the 1.39-kb fragment can be reinserted to yield a functional pep5 biosynthesis gene cluster. to test the expression system, two mutants were constructed. lys-18-pro  pep5 was produced in its dehydrated form and a partially hydrated form in amounts comparable to those of the wild-type peptide. in contrast, only small amounts of  phe-23-asp pep5 were excreted, indicating that some residues in the propeptide part of the prelantibiotic may be crucial for certain steps in the biosynthetic pathway of lantibiotics.

TI  == differential elimination of enteric bacteria by protists in a freshwater system.
AB  == the short-term (1 h) and long-term (3 d) elimination of low and high densities of five enteric bacteria, klebsiella pneumoniae, aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis, by flagellate and ciliate protists were measured in a freshwater system. in addition, the two processes, ingestion and digestion, which cause the disappearance of those enteric bacteria as time passes, were quantified. the results showed that the elimination of these enteric bacteria by protists depends on their initial density, which confirms that the lower the bacterial density the more difficult is their elimination. on the other hand, the short-term and long-term elimination rates of each enteric bacteria were different, and moreover, the order of priority for elimination in the two cases was not the same. escherichia coli showed the highest elimination rate in short-term experiments, while aer. hydrophila disappeared at highest rates in long-term experiments. this different  order of priority in the elimination rates and the different digestion rates on the five enteric bacteria by phagotrophic protists indicated that the elimination in time is very much influenced by the digestive capacity on each enteric bacteria of those protists. thus, the low digestion rates of ent. faecalis and staph. epidermidis by flagellates and ciliates as well as their low disappearance percentages in the long-term experiments confirm that enteric gram-positive bacteria are eliminated from the aquatic systems at lower rates, because their digestion is difficult.

TI  == ultrasonic enhancement of antibiotic action on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the effect of gentamicin upon planktonic cultures of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus aureus was measured with and without application of 67-khz ultrasonic stimulation. the ultrasound was applied at levels that had no inhibitory or bactericidal activity  against the bacteria. measurements of the mic and bactericidal activity of gentamicin against planktonic cultures of p. aeruginosa and e. coli demonstrated  that simultaneous application of 67-khz ultrasound enhanced the effectiveness of  the antibiotic. a synergistic effect was observed and bacterial viability was reduced several orders of magnitude when gentamicin concentrations and ultrasonic levels which by themselves did not reduce viability were combined. as the age of  the culture increased, the bacteria became more resistant to the effect of the antibiotic alone. application of ultrasound appeared to reverse this resistance.  the ultrasonic treatment-enhanced activity was evident with cultures of p. aeruginosa and e. coli but was not observed with cultures of gram-positive s. epidermidis and s. aureus. these results may have application in the treatment of bacterial biofilm infections on implant devices, which infections are usually more resistant to antibiotic therapy.

AB  == the role of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infection (uti) was studied with a view to the possibility that such bacteria are an etiological  factor in the development of bladder cancer. the bacterial strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis, isolated from patients with uti at the kyushu university hospital, were tested for their nitrate-reducing activity after 1 hr of incubation with sodium nitrate (3.57 mm) in a growth medium (ph 7.2) at 37 degrees c. of 35 strains tested, 27 strains (77%) showed the ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite with yields ranging from 2 to 310 microm no2-/hr/10(7) bacterial cells, but in 8 strains (23%) including all the 7 strains of e. faecalis no elevated activity (0.0-0.3 microm) could be detected. various kinetic profiles were observed for the nitrate-reducing bacteria, at various rate ranging from rapidly to slowly, during 5 hr of incubation. the effect of nitrate-reducing bacteria on mutagen formation in the human urine was examined. the mutagenic activity of smokers' or non-smokers' urine incubated with or without bacteria for 72 hr at 37 degrees c was assayed by the ames salmonella/microsome test (using ta100 or ta98 with s9-mix). the mutagenic activity increased in urine incubated with the nitrate-reducing s. marcescens or  p. aeruginosa, compared to controls which were incubated without bacteria. potent mutagenic activity could be induced when the urine concentrate prepared from smokers' urine with an xad-2 resin column was incubated with sodium nitrite (40 mm) at ph 3 for 4 hrs. the potent mutagenic activity observed here seems to be due to the class of direct-acting mutagen(s), because no metabolic activation was required. the mutagen formation at an optimal ph 4 proceeded rapidly during 4 hrs of incubation, but decreased thereafter. it was noted that even at a physiological ph 6 of human urine, a lower but significant level of mutagenic activity could still be detected. the mutagenic activity of individual urine concentrate from 14 male smokers and from 6 male non-smokers was assayed after 30 min of incubation with or without sodium nitrite (40 mm) at ph 6. mutagenic activity increased in most of these urine concentrates incubated with sodium nitrite. the levels were variable between individuals with a 1.3- to 53-fold increase compared with the controls incubated without sodium nitrite.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == effect of genetic variation on induced neutrophilia in mice.
AB  == mice from a variety of strains were injected with a sterile irritant (brewer's thioglycolate) and killed bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, or escherichia coli) to determine their effect on accumulation of neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity. peak accumulation occurred around 15 h postinjection and showed significant strain-related variation. c57bl/10 mice were identified as having a high-responder phenotype and balb/c mice a low-responder phenotype. inheritance of the high-responder phenotype followed simple mendelian  genetics: (balb/c x c57bl/10)f1 mice were found to be more responsive than either parental phenotype. major histocompatibility complex h-2d haplotype was found to  convey an augmented neutrophil response in conjunction with b10 background high-responder genes (b10.d2/n) but the h-2d haplotype per se was not the only factor in determining high responsiveness. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria appeared to activate different immune mechanisms. both gram-negative bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (lps) induced a response similar to, but less potent than, that induced by brewer's thioglycollate. neutralization of the lps content of brewer's thioglycolate abrogated the response.

TI  == staphylococcal glycocalyx activates macrophage prostaglandin e2 and interleukin 1 production and modulates tumor necrosis factor alpha and nitric oxide production.
AB  == we have examined the effect of staphylococcal glycocalyces on the ability of murine peritoneal macrophages to produce prostaglandin e2 (pge2) and the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 (il-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and to generate nitric oxide. glycocalyx partially purified under endotoxin-free conditions from defined liquid medium cultures of staphylococcus lugdunensis or staphylococcus epidermidis was a strong stimulator of pge2 and il-1 production. the addition of 10 to 100 micrograms of glycocalyx per ml induced levels of il-1 and pge2 production similar to that induced by 0.1 to 1 micrograms of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps) per ml. in contrast, glycocalyx induced ninefold less tnf-alpha and three- to fourfold less nitrite than lps. a modulatory effect was suggested by the observation that the amount of tnf-alpha and nitrite generated remained constant whether the macrophages were stimulated with 10 or 100 micrograms of glycocalyx per ml. a selective modulation of macrophage activation was confirmed by the demonstration that costimulation of macrophages with both glycocalyx and lps resulted in a reduction in tnf-alpha and nitrite generation relative to stimulation with lps alone even though costimulation had no effect on pge2 production and increased il-1 production. involvement of pge2 in this modulatory effect was suggested by the ability of indomethacin to augment glycocalyx-stimulated tnf-alpha production and to reverse the inhibitory effect of glycocalyx on lps induction of tnf-alpha production. however, the inability of indomethacin to reverse the inhibitory effect of glycocalyx on lps-induced nitric oxide generation suggests that the selective modulation of macrophage function by glycocalyx may be more complex than increased sensitivity to pge2 feedback inhibition.

TI  == [variations in the antibiotic sensitivity of bacterial strains after contact with the metals used for the construction of prosthetic implants].
AB  == the antibiotic sensitivity of 19 gram-positive bacterial strains (11 staphylococcus aureus and 8 staphylococcus epidermidis) and 16 gram-negative strains (8 escherichia coli and 8 proteus species) was evaluated after contact with stainless steel and with some metals compounding the alloys used for prosthetic devices. the hypothesis was that the resistance to antibiotic therapy  of infections associated with prosthetic implants is also due to a modification in the sensitivity of microorganisms. the results, compared to those obtained from control tests, showed only slight variations in the antibiotic sensitivity of the strains put in contact with the metals. in gram-positive strains, after contact with metals, the increase in sensitivity occurred more frequently than the reduction. in gram-negative strains, the decrease in sensitivity was more frequent than the increase. proteus strains showed sensitivity variations more frequently than escherichia coli strains. titanium and nickel induced the highest number of variations, both in gram-positive and gram-negative strains.

TI  == producer immunity towards the lantibiotic pep5: identification of the immunity gene pepi and localization and functional analysis of its gene product.
AB  == the lantibiotic pep5 is produced by staphylococcus epidermidis 5. pep5 production and producer immunity are associated with the 20-kb plasmid ped503. a 1.3-kb kpni fragment of ped503, containing the pep5 structural gene pepa, was subcloned into  the escherichia coli-staphylococcus shuttle vector pcu1, and the recombinant plasmid pmr2 was transferred to the pep5- and immunity-negative mutant s. epidermidis 5 pep5- (devoid of ped503). this clone did not produce active pep5 but showed the same degree of insensitivity towards pep5 as did the wild-type strain. sequencing of the 1.3-kb kpni-fragment and analysis of mutants demonstrated the involvement of two genes in pep5 immunity, the structural gene pepa itself and pepi, a short open reading frame upstream of pepa. to identify the 69-amino-acid pepi gene product, we constructed an e. coli maltose-binding protein-pepi fusion clone. the immunity peptide pepi was detected in the soluble  and membrane fractions of the wild-type strain and the immune mutants (harboring  the plasmids pmr2 and pmr11) by immunoblotting with anti-maltose-binding protein-pepi antiserum. strains harboring either pepi without pepa or pepi with incomplete pepa were not immune and did not produce pepi. washing the membrane with salts and edta reduced the amount of pepi in this fraction, and treatment with triton x-100 almost completely removed the peptide. furthermore, pepi was hydrolyzed by proteases added to osmotically stabilized protoplasts. this suggests that pepi is loosely attached to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. proline uptake and efflux experiments with immune and nonimmune strains also indicated that pepi may act at the membrane site.

AB  == we conducted a comprehensive analysis of bacterial, parasitic and viral agents present in stool samples of 23 necrotizing enterocolitis cases and 23 matched and 10 random controls. enterococcus spp., staphylococcus epidermidis, and escherichia coli were the most common aerobic bacterial species isolated. astrovirus was identified in a stool sample from one control. eight infants were  bacteremic; in 7 of 8 the same organism was also present in the stool. no one bacterial species or strain (as identified by plasmid profile analysis) was associated with occurrence of illness. plasmid analysis further suggested that each infant was colonized with his or her own distinctive aerobic bacterial flora. with the exception of isolates from two control patients which hybridized  with a probe for diffuse adherence, no diarrheagenic e. coli was identified. five (45%) of 11 case infants were colonized with coagulase-negative staphylococci (all s. epidermidis) that produced delta-hemolysin in vitro, as compared with 13  (87%) of 15 control infants. necrotizing enterocolitis was not associated with an increased ability to ferment carbohydrate, as measured by in vitro beta-galactosidase activity. our data do not support the hypothesis that endemic  necrotizing enterocolitis in our institution is caused by a single infectious agent, nor was there evidence that previously proposed virulence mechanisms such  as production of delta-hemolysin or increased in vitro carbohydrate fermentation  play a critical role in disease occurrence.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == development of bacterial biofilms on silastic catheter materials in peritoneal dialysis fluid.
AB  == a modified robbins' device was used to monitor the growth of bacteria associated  with clinical peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis fluid. to simulate bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on peritoneal catheters, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli were allowed to adhere  to silastic disks and were then grown in fresh or used dialysis fluid. adherent bacteria formed microcolonies and biofilms on silastics within 4 to 24 hours. our data showed that colonization of the silastic disks was related to the quantity of bacteria and there were significant differences between the growth of adherent bacteria in fresh and used dialysis fluid. adherent s epidermidis and p aeruginosa grew better in dialysis fluids than adherent e coli. these results suggest that s epidermidis and p aeruginosa are more likely to colonize silastic  catheters and to cause catheter-related peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients than e coli.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

TI  == antibacterial activity, antibiotic retention, and infection resistance of a rifampin-impregnated gelatin-sealed dacron graft.
AB  == purpose: a gelatin-sealed porous dacron graft impregnated with rifampin was evaluated in a two-part study of its use in preventing prosthetic infection. methods: the graft was impregnated by soaking it for 15 minutes in rifampin (1 mg/ml). in part 1 its antibacterial activity and rifampin retention over time were determined. infrarenal aortic replacement was performed in pigs, and the rifampin concentration of the graft, serum, and perigraft space was assayed up to 96 hours after surgery. in part 2, infection resistance was tested in pigs in which the retroperitoneum was contaminated with staphylococcus aureus after graft replacement. the postoperative infection rate was compared in three groups: pigs  given gelatin-sealed grafts without rifampin (controls), pigs receiving nonimpregnated grafts and intravenous rifampin (15 mg/kg) for 3 days after surgery, and those given the rifampin grafts. results: rifampin was present in the grafts for up to 72 hours after surgery and in the perigraft fluid for 24 hours but was never detected in the serum. the grafts had inhibitory activity in  vitro against s. aureus and the biofilm phase of staphylococcus epidermidis for up to 3 days and against escherichia coli for 2 days. pigs given intravenous rifampin had a significantly lower infection rate than had control pigs (7/12 vs  13/13; p = 0.02); those receiving the rifampin graft had a lower rate (2/13) than had either the control pigs (p < 0.001) or those given intravenous rifampin (p <  0.04). conclusions: this simple method of graft impregnation resulted in antibiotic retention for 3 days and appeared to be superior to intravenous antibiotic administration in preventing perioperative graft infection.

AB  == the in vitro activity of deferoxamine (dfo) both per se and in combination with the reductant ascorbic acid (aa) was determined against 10 e. coli strains, 5 p.  mirabilis strains, and 10 coagulase-negative staphylococci. in terms of interaction, the influence of dfo on the activities of cephalothin and gentamicin was furthermore investigated against the same panel of strains employing a macrobroth dilution technique and killing-curve kinetics. the mics of cephalothin and gentamicin were lowered for one half of the strains. moreover, dfo prolonged  the generation times of logarithmic growth phase considerably, especially when the reductant aa was present. the interactions between dfo or dfo+aa and subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were established by the application of growth constants, and resulted in synergy for 15 out of 25 strains with cephalothin and 9 out of 25 strains with gentamicin.

AB  == viability curves were recorded for a variety of bacteria suspended in rabbit primary aqueous humour. controls included neat rabbit serum, dilute rabbit serum  (1/50), dilute heat treated fetal bovine serum (1/50), and balanced salt solution. rabbit aqueous humour was bactericidal in vitro for staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. micrococcus spp, streptococcus pneumoniae and  escherichia coli were not affected. the factor mediating the bactericidal effect  survives filtration (0.2 micron porosity) and freezing in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees c) but is labile when stored in air at temperatures of 4 degrees c, 25 degrees c, and 37 degrees c for 1 hour. the bactericidal effect was stable when aqueous humour was stored in an atmosphere of 5% co2 at 37 degrees c for 3 hours. the antibacterial component in rabbit aqueous humour has yet to be identified.

TI  == differential binding capacity and internalisation of bacterial substrates as factors in growth rate of acanthamoeba spp.
AB  == acanthamoeba spp. are free-living predators that selectively feed on bacteria. adherence of the bacterial food source to the trophozoite membrane is followed by internalisation and digestion. through co-cultivation of a. castellanii and a. polyphaga, individually, with xanthomonas maltophilia, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa (despite the amoebicidal properties of the latter organism), specificity with regard to the preferred bacterial substrate was judged. x. maltophilia and p. aeruginosa adhered almost immediately forming a multilayered mantle of bacilli around trophozoites of both  species of amoebae. e. coli adhered to fewer trophozoites and in smaller numbers. x. maltophilia was readily internalised after co-cultivation for 8 h, whereas p.  aeruginosa, e. coli and s. epidermidis were not internalised even after co-cultivation for 24 h. these data suggest that the suitability of a bacterial food source for the acanthamoeba spp. studied is associated not only with the proclivity with which the bacterial species binds to the trophozoite surface, but also with the rate of its internalisation.

TI  == antibacterial peritoneal defence in automated peritoneal dialysis: advantages of  tidal over continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis?
AB  == in tidal peritoneal dialysis (tpd) only a part of the infused dialysate is drained with each exchange, leaving a residual volume on top of which fresh fluid is cycled. as the persistent presence of a buffered intraperitoneal reserve volume might favour peritoneal macrophage (pmo) function, pmo obtained from eight patients during a 3-h continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (ccpd) or tpd session were studied in a randomized cross-over trial. pmo were studied for uptake of e.  coli (complement-dependent) and s. epidermidis (antibody-dependent), as well as for their killing capacity and peak chemiluminescence response. in addition, dialysate was sampled during both treatment sessions and studied for ph, osmolality, and effect on the viability of donor phagocytes and mesothelial cells. tpd-derived pmo were significantly better able to phagocytose e. coli than ccpd-pmo (48 +/- 8 versus 33 +/- 6% uptake, p < 0.05), whereas the other tested functional capacities revealed no significant difference between tpd- and ccpd-pmo. during tpd dialysate ph ranged from 6 to 7 as compared to a ph range from 5 to 7 in ccpd. the presence of a residual dialysate volume resulted in less wash-out of cells and opsonins early in the treatment, and to some extent blunted the noxious effects of fresh dialysis solutions. overall, however, tidal pd appeared to have no advantage over ccpd regarding preservation of peritoneal defences.

AB  == between 1983 and 1986, 40 hip arthroplasties in 40 patients with documented deep  infection were reimplanted using palacos gentamicin at the hospital for special surgery. palacos gentamicin was added to the standard protocol, which included removal of the prosthesis, cement, if present, and a thorough debridement of infected and necrotic tissue, six weeks of intravenous antibiotics with a postpeak serum bactericidal titer of at least 1:8 against the infecting bacteria, followed by reimplantation of the hip. sixteen of the patients also had the placement of gentamicin-impregnated beads at the time of prosthetic removal. all  patients had a deep periprosthetic infection, 13 with staphylococcus epidermidis, seven staphylococcus aureus, four streptococcus, three enterococcus, three with gram-positive bacteria, four escherichia coli, two proteus, one pseudomonas, and  three anaerobic organisms. at an average follow-up period of five years (range, two to ten), two of the 40 hips (5%) developed recurrent infection. these cases recurred at one month in a patient immunocompromised by end-stage systemic lupus  erythematosus (s. epidermidis) and at five months in a patient with severe titanium metallosis (s. aureus). no recurrence was noted in eight cases with gram-negative organisms or in three cases of mixed infections. no infection recurred after five months in the remaining patients before their death or last follow-up examination. of the remaining 38 hips, 16 died of causes unrelated to the hip, leaving 21 with an average follow-up period of 7.5 years. clinical results in these patients were 14 excellent, five good, two fair, and no poor results.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in-vitro biocompatibility of alternative capd fluids; comparison of bicarbonate-buffered and glucose-polymer-based solutions.
AB  == evidence is accumulating that conventional dialysis fluids for capd are incompatible with peritoneal host defence. we therefore investigated the effect of alternative capd fluids on mononuclear leukocyte (pbmc) viability and cytokine production in vitro. fluids tested were bicarbonate-buffered solutions containing 1.5% or 4.25% glucose, 7.5% glucose polymer dialysis fluid (gpdf), and conventional 1.5% glucose fluid (g1.5%). pbmc were stimulated (2 h, 37 degrees c) in the different test fluids with a clinical isolate of staphylococcus epidermidis or escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. the cytokines tnf alpha and il-6 in pbmc supernatants were measured by specific enzyme immunoassays. induction of cytokine messenger rna was evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. conventional g1.5% (ph 5.5) inhibited cytokine release from activated pbmc by > 95%, whereas cell responses in low-glucose bicarbonate fluid were not significantly reduced. in contrast, high-glucose bicarbonate fluid exerted > 80% inhibition despite its neutral ph. gpdf was inhibitory at its initial low ph, whereas cytokine release was restored  following ph neutralization. cytokine mrna expression was suppressed by conventional g1.5% fluid and by high-glucose bicarbonate fluid. these data indicate that ph neutralization leads to a substantial improvement of dialysis fluid biocompatibility; however, hyperosmolality and/or high glucose content inhibit cell responsiveness even at normal ph. replacement of glucose by glucose  polymer might prove beneficial provided that the initial low ph is neutralized.

AB  == herpes simplex virus type-1 (hsv-1) induces fc- and c3b(i)-receptors on infected  cells. the role of these receptors in bacterial superinfection was studied by comparing the adherence of non-opsonised and opsonised bacteria to hsv-infected and non-infected hep-2 cells. a flow cytometric adherence assay, based on the fluorescent quantitation of fitc-labelled bacteria, was developed. opsonisation of staphylococcus epidermidis with human serum, resulted in a marked increase in  adherence to hsv-infected cells and revealed a role for c3b(i)r- and fcr-mediated adhesion. however, the enhanced adherence never exceeded the level of attachment  to non-infected cells. increased adherence of other pathogenic bacteria, including escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and  pseudomonas aeruginosa was not observed, indicating that the hsv-receptors play a minor role in secondary infections. bacterial adhesion factors such as the fimbriae of e. coli played a more dominant role in the adherence of bacteria to hsv-infected cells.

AB  == the in vitro adherence of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli (one strain of each species) to commercially available, microporous polytetrafluoroethylene (ptfe) and woven dacron vascular grafts before and after coating with human plasma was compared. standard size segments of the materials were incubated with 35s-labeled bacteria for 0.5-18 h and, following washes, the radioactivity associated with the segment was measured. the binding of each of the tested species to native dacron was higher than to ptfe. after coating with human plasma, however, the binding of all three species to ptfe was significantly enhanced, whereas the binding to dacron was reduced. in addition, the influence of coating with serum albumin (hsa), immunoglobulin g (igg), fibrinogen (fg) or fibronectin (fn) rather than whole plasma was tested. we found that coating with hsa reduced the binding of all three species to dacron and of staphylococci to ptfe. igg decreased the binding of s. epidermidis and e.  coli to dacron and of s. epidermidis to ptfe. in contrast, fg enhanced the binding of s. aureus both to dacron and ptfe, and that of e. coli to ptfe, but decreased the binding of s. epidermidis and e. coli to dacron. fn enhanced the binding of s. aureus to dacron, and of e. coli to ptfe, but decreased the binding of s. aureus to ptfe and of s. epidermidis both to ptfe and dacron. thus, both whole plasma and some isolated plasma proteins were found to modulate bacterial adherence to two tested graft materials. from a clinical point of view, bacterial binding to plasma-coated rather than native materials may more adequately determine the likelihood of in vivo colonization of the various materials. furthermore, precoating of materials with selected proteins may be of value in the prevention of graft colonization.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and ex vivo susceptibility of cefpodoxime proxetil in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  == pharmacokinetics of cefpodoxime, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin, were determined for eight noninfected patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd) and eight healthy volunteers. subjects were matched for sex, age  (+/- 6 years), and body weight (+/- 10 kg, except for one pair) and received a single 200-mg (cefpodoxime equivalents) oral dose of the prodrug cefpodoxime proxetil in an open-label, paired-design fashion. dialysate (capd group only), plasma, and urine samples were collected and assayed for cefpodoxime by a microbiologic method. in addition, mean bactericidal titers of the effluent dialysate against selected bacterial strains often associated with capd-related peritonitis were determined at 6 and 24 h after the dose. there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in all pharmacokinetic parameters between healthy and capd  subjects, except for lag time to absorption. the mean peak plasma cefpodoxime concentration of 1.88 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml occurred at 2.44 +/- 0.5 h for healthy volunteers, while the peak concentration of 3.25 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml occurred at 12.0 +/- 4.2 h for patients on capd. the average elimination half-life in capd patients was approximately 12 times greater than that seen in healthy volunteers. peritoneal dialysis had a minimal effect on cefpodoxime clearance. in healthy volunteers, 24.2% +/- 13% of the dose was recovered from the urine, in contrast to only 5.59% +/- 6.9% for capd patients. the mean bactericidal titers for all capd patients, at 6 and 24 h, were mostly less than 1:2 and did not exceed 1:4 for any of the isolates. because of the decreased renal clearance and negligible dialysate clearance of cefpodoxime, and delayed drug absorption, the dosage interval for cefpodoxime proxetil may need to be extended in capd patients.

TI  == the effects of electric current on bacteria colonising intravenous catheters.
AB  == the effect of a direct electric current (10 microa) on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis was investigated. when the ends of negatively-charged intravascular catheters were placed in nutrient agar seeded with bacteria, circular zones of inhibition of bacterial growth were observed around the catheters. the zones ranged from 6 to 16 mm in diameter according to the organism under test. zones of inhibition were not produced around positively-charged catheters. bacteria colonising the surfaces of catheters were  similarly affected by the application of a 10 microa electric current. a negative electric current applied to colonised catheters for 4 to 24 h significantly reduced the number of adherent viable organisms as compared to controls. the results demonstrated that a constant electric current of low amperage might be used to reduce bacterial colonisation of intravascular catheters. this may offer  a novel means of protecting catheters and other prosthetic devices from associated sepsis in vivo.

TI  == epidemiologic patterns of nosocomial infections in 10 oklahoma hospitals.
AB  == the epidemiology of nosocomial infections was studied for 5 years in 10 oklahoma  hospitals. these were categorized into small and large hospitals. the seven small hospitals averaged 47 beds and the three large hospitals averaged 266 beds. overall, most of the infected patients were < 5 years of > 60 years of age. females accounted for the majority of the infections. in general, the three most  common sites of infection were the urinary tract, surgical wounds, and the lower  respiratory tract. escherichia coli was the single most frequently identified agent followed by staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the most  frequently reported risk factors among patients acquiring a nosocomial infection  were the use of prior antibiotics, indwelling urinary catheters, and intravenous  catheters or cut-down. the specific problems associated with nosocomial infections, such as sites of infection, risks of infection, and the types of organisms isolated, essentially had not changed much since the 1960s, the 1970s,  and for most of the 1980s.

TI  == prevalence of beta-lactamase enzyme production in bacteria isolated from women with postpartum endometritis.
AB  == one hundred eighty-four postpartum patients with the diagnosis of endomyometritis underwent intrauterine culturing. beta-lactamase production was tested using nitrocephin-impregnated discs in 278 bacterial isolates from patients with postpartum endometritis. beta-lactamase production was found to be present in 149 of 278 (54%) isolates tested: 0 of 39 streptococcus faecalis (0%), 22 of 41 escherichia coli (54%), 66 of 68 bacteroides bivius (97%), 0 of 13 proteus mirabilis (0%) and 15 of 42 staphylococcus epidermidis (36%). anaerobes, as a group, had the highest rate of beta-lactamase production, 94 of 102 (93%), followed by gram negatives, 34 of 84 (40%), then gram positives, 21 of 91 (23%).  however, it was the beta-lactamase produced by the gram-negative bacteria that was most responsive to the addition of a beta-lactamase inhibitor. the frequent isolation of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria from patients with postpartum endometritis raises concern about the use of antibiotics not resistant to these enzymes. therefore, antibiotics combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor may have potential as single-agent therapy in obstetric and gynecologic infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of dv-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == we compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of dv-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. mics for 90% of the strains tested (mic90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. moreover, mic50s for dv-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. dv-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and peptostreptococcus spp. at  0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the mic90 level than the other quinolones tested. the activity of dv-7751a against pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the mic90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. dv-7751a showed activity comparable to  those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). dv-7751a activity  was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of dv-7751a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and p. aeruginosa. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to dv-7751a was less than or  equal to those of the reference drugs. dv-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of dna gyrases from s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.

TI  == ultraviolet disinfection of contact lenses.
AB  == to evaluate the efficacy of ultraviolet (uv) radiation as a method of disinfecting contact lenses and their storage solutions, we contaminated soft lenses (bausch & lomb optima 38), rigid gas permeable (rgp) lenses (oxyflow f-30), and their storage solutions with three common bacteria. escherichia coli (e.c.), staphylococcus epidermis (s.e.), and serratia marcescens (s.m.). the storage solutions used were saline solution and rgp conditioning solution. we determined the exposure times to 253.7-nm wavelength uv radiation necessary to disinfect the contact lenses and solutions. the decimal reduction values (d values) found for uv radiation were 10 to 200 hundred times shorter than reported for currently available disinfection systems. for e.c., sterilization was attained after 100 s of exposure. for s.e. and s.m., sterilization occurred after 300 s of exposure. different contact lens solutions transmit uv radiation to various degrees, with saline solution passing more than 90% of the uv radiation.  thus, our results indicate that uv radiation is an effective and rapid method of  disinfecting contact lenses and their storage solutions.

TI  == plasmodium falciparum: inhibition of sporogonic development in anopheles stephensi by gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == we investigated the effects of bacteria on plasmodium falciparum sporogonic development in anopheles stephensi. four gram-negative (escherichia coli h243, e. coli hb101, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ewingella americana) and two gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis) bacterial strains were used in the study. tenfold dilutions of bacteria suspended in phosphate-buffered saline were mixed with an infectious meal of gametocyte-enriched cultures and fed to adult mosquitoes. all gram-negative bacteria strains partially or completely inhibited oocyst formation at different  concentrations. additionally, geometric mean number of oocysts showed a correspondingly significant decrease with increasing bacterial concentration (p < 0.001). in contrast, gram-positive bacteria strains did not have any inhibitory effects on oocyst formation even at very high concentrations. oocyst development  was not affected by: (i) culture supernatants of e. americana, (ii) formalin-treated e. coli h243, (iii) lipopolysaccharide of e. coli j5 (mutant of  0111:b4). these studies show that gram-negative but not gram-positive bacteria affect sporogonic-stage development of p. falciparum in a. stephensi. inhibition  of parasite acquisition may be an attribute of specific or nonspecific cytoadherence properties of gram-negative bacteria to the parasites.

TI  == in vitro experiments on catheter-related infections due to gram-negative rods.
AB  == although many complications may arise with the use of central venous catheters, catheter-related bacteremia is considered to be the most serious complication. microflora on the patient's skin (coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus) is thought to represent the major source of microorganisms causing catheter-related infections. gram-negative rods are increasingly observed as causative agents. we therefore performed an in vitro study to elucidate the pathogenesis of polymer-associated infections caused by enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenters and to study the resistance of polymer surface-grown gram-negative  rods against antibiotics. using a modification of the semiquantitative method for culturing vascular cannulas on solid media described by maki et al., we studied the adherence of various gram-negative rods to 1-cm segments of silastic catheters, a material used for port-a-cath-systems. organisms were obtained from  the american type culture collection (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae). all organisms but klebsiella showed extensive irreversible adherence. production of an extracellular slime substance was observed only with antimicrobially treated pseudomonas. after 'infection', the silastic catheter segments were treated with  various antimicrobial agents. the following antibiotics were used either individually or in combination: cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, fosfomycin and gentamicin. despite the fact that the antibiotic concentrations used were many times greater than the respective mics of the various antibiotics, none of the antibiotics tested succeeded in eliminating the organisms. e. coli was found  to be the most susceptible organism. these in vitro data substantiate our clinical impression that it is hardly possible to successfully eliminate the colonization of central venous catheters with gram-negative rods by using the antimicrobial agents employed here.

TI  == [effect of ozone on airborne microorganisms].
AB  == the microbicidal effect of ozone in air was tested at concentrations between 50 and 600 micrograms/m3 against the species: staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, arthrobacter citreus, bacillus subtilis (veg.), escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas fluorescens and candida albicans. the microorganisms were exposed on membrane filters at 60-75% relative humidity and 21.5-22.5 degrees c. after exposure times between 1 min and 60 min, the filters were incubated on appropriate agar media. the effect of ozone was determined by comparing the number of colonies on exposed filters to the number on nonexposed filters. the die-off curves (colony count against time) proved not to be rectilinear, but to become steeper with increasing time of exposure. furthermore, the velocity of reduction increased more than proportional with increasing concentration of ozone. therefore, the bacterial decay seems not  to follow first order reaction kinetics. the values presented for k (constant of  the velocity of die-off) and d (decimal reduction time) are valid only for narrow ranges of the initial part of the exposure. concentrations of 50 to 100 micrograms (0)3/m3 for 1 h resulted only in little reduction, whereas 500 to 600  micrograms/m3 for one hour led to 99% reduction in all bacterial species tested.  the gram-positive species seemed to be more sensitive than the gram-negative species, c. albicans proved to be more resistant than the bacteria.

TI  == construction and overexpression in escherichia coli of genetically engineered derivatives of penicillin-binding protein 2' of staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == removal of the putative amino-terminal membrane spanning region of penicillin-binding protein 2' (pbp-2') of staphylococcus epidermidis wt55 was carried out by truncating the amino terminus-coding end of the meca gene. pcr and site directed mutagenesis were used to introduce unique restriction sites at position 68 (hindiii) and at position 80 (ncoi) of the meca gene, respectively. the coupling of the shortened coding regions to the trc promoter and gene fusion  to the lacz gene, aimed to facilitate subsequent protein purifications, resulted  in strong expression in the cytoplasm of escherichia coli and partial sequestration into insoluble protein granules. the truncated pbp-2' retained its  penicillin-binding ability and also bound the monoclonal antibody directed against pbp-2' of staphylococcus aureus.

AB  == for the investigation of enzymes involved in epidermin biosynthesis it is necessary to produce sufficient amounts of preepidermin (epia) as a substrate and to design epia detection systems. therefore, epia was expressed in escherichia coli using a male-epia fusion. the identity of purified epia was confirmed by ion spray mass spectrometry and amino acid sequencing. for epia detection, anti-epia  antisera were raised. upon prolonged incubation, factor xa not only cleaved epia  from the fusion protein, but also less efficiently cleaved epia internally between r-1 and i+1. the internal factor xa cleavage site of epia was masked by altering the sequence -a(-4)-e-p-r(-1)- to -a(-4)-e-p-q(-1)- by site-directed mutagenesis.

AB  == a controlled clinical comparison was made of the isolator (wampole laboratories,  cranbury, n.j.) and the septi-chek release bottle (roche diagnostics, nutley, n.j.). from 6,345 blood culture sets fulfilling minimum criteria for volume of blood cultured, 840 strains were isolated, of which only 691 (82%) were considered to be representative of bloodstream infection according to centers for disease control definitions. statistically significant differences were found between the systems for the following organisms, which were all detected more frequently in the isolator system: staphylococcus aureus (p = 0.0001), alcaligenes xylosoxidans (p = 0.008), klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.05), salmonella spp. (p = 0.03), and candida albicans (p = 0.02). the septi-chek release system required a longer period of time than the isolator system for detection of the following organisms:s. aureus (p = 0.0001), enterococcus spp. (p = 0.0001), enterobacter cloacae (p = 0.03), escherichia coli (p = 0.0001), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.03), k. pneumoniae (p = 0.02), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.002), and c. albicans (p = 0.005). there were 430 episodes of bloodstream  infections identified in the study; of these episodes, only those due to s. aureus were detected significantly more frequently (p = 0.0001) by the isolator system than by the septi-chek release system. however, episodes of bloodstream infections due to s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus spp., and e. coli were detected significantly faster by the isolator system.

TI  == regulation of epidermin biosynthetic genes by epiq.
AB  == we investigated the role of epiq in the biosynthesis of the lantibiotic epidermin. epiq was essential for epidermin production. it was shown that epiq controls epidermin production by transcriptionally activating the epia promoter,  used for transcription of most of the epidermin biosynthetic genes. additional copies of epiq increased epidermin production in the epidermin-producing wild-type strain staphylococcus epidermidis tu3298. the epia promoter region was  characterized by primer extension analysis. two inverted repeats, putative operator sites for epiq binding, are located upstream of the -35 region and one is localized downstream of the -10 region. crude protein extracts from s. epidermidis tu3298 and epiq expressing escherichia coli cells led to gel mobility shifts of a dna fragment bearing the inverted repeat which is located immediately upstream of the -35 region. dna fragments bearing the other two inverted repeats  were not shifted. the epiq gene product could be detected by overexpression in the e. coli t7 system using antiserum raised against synthetic peptides of epiq.  furthermore, epiq, like other dna-binding proteins, was shown to bind strongly to heparin sepharose.

AB  == bacteria that commonly cause infections of the normal urinary tract (eg escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus saprophyticus) do so because they possess specific urovirulence factors. adhesions of various types (often fimbriae) seem to be the most important of these. in e. coli several other factors have been recognized, and sub-sets of defined uropathogenic clones exist. on the other hand, urovirulence determinants are less easy to distinguish in species such as s. epidermidis and klebsiella pneumoniae, that rarely cause such  infections, or are pathogenic only in the presence of some abnormality or deficiency in host defences.

TI  == efflux-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == transport processes are used by all organisms to obtain essential nutrients and to expel wastes and other potentially harmful substances from cells. such processes are important means by which resistance to selected antimicrobial agents in bacteria is achieved. the recently described staphylococcus aureus nora gene encodes a membrane-associated protein that mediates active efflux of fluoroquinolones from cells. sa-1199b is a fluoroquinolone-resistant strain of s. aureus from which we cloned an allele of nora (nora1199). similar to that of nora, the protein product of nora1199 preferentially mediates efflux of hydrophilic fluoroquinolones in both s. aureus and an escherichia coli host, a process driven by the proton motive force. determination of the nucleotide sequence of nora1199 revealed an encoded 388-amino-acid hydrophobic polypeptide 95% homologous with the nora-encoded protein. significant homology with other proteins involved in transport processes also exists, but especially with tetracycline efflux proteins and with the bacillus subtilis bmr protein that mediates active efflux of structurally unrelated compounds, including fluoroquinolones. in s. aureus, the nora1199-encoded protein also appears to function as a multidrug efflux transporter. southern hybridization studies indicated that nora1199 (or an allele of it) is a naturally occurring s. aureus gene and that related sequences are present in the s. epidermidis genome. the nucleotide sequence of the wild-type allele of nora1199, cloned from the fluoroquinolone-susceptible parent strain of sa-1199b, did not differ from that of nora1199 throughout the coding region. northern (rna) and southern hybridization studies showed that increased transcription, and not gene amplification, of nora1199 is the basis for fluoroquinolone resistance in sa-1199b.

TI  == isolation and characterization of transposon mutants of staphylococcus epidermidis deficient in capsular polysaccharide/adhesin and slime.
AB  == we used transposon (tn) mutagenesis to study the role of capsular polysaccharide/adhesin (ps/a) and slime in adherence of staphylococcus epidermidis to catheters. pltv1, containing tn917-ltv1, was transformed into s. epidermidis m187 by protoplast fusion with s. aureus rn4220(pltv1), creating m187(pltv1). tn mutants were isolated following growth at 42 degrees c; mutants deficient in ps/a and slime production were selected. ps/a- and slime-deficient tn mutants had a 10-fold decrease in vitro in the initial phase of adherence to catheters, comparable to levels of strains that do not produce ps/a. introduction of tn917-ltv1-interrupted dna from ps/a-deficient mutant m187sn3 into the parental strain via transformation of protoplasts yielded recipients with inserts identical to those of the tn mutant that were ps/a and slime deficient. chromosomal dna flanking the tn in mutant m187sn3 was cloned into escherichia coli. the cloned dna was found to hybridize to approximately 5-kb ecori fragments from the parental strain and from control tn mutants that express parental levels of ps/a and to either approximately 9- or approximately 14-kb ecori fragments from other highly adherent, ps/a-producing strains. mapping studies demonstrated  that in the eight ps/a-deficient mutants that have been isolated, the tn insertions all occur within a region of approximately 11.6 kb that is defined by  three ecori sites. these results support previous findings indicating that in s.  epidermidis ps/a is involved with in vitro adherence to plastic biomaterials and  elaboration of ps/a is closely associated with slime production.

TI  == in vitro activity of clarithromycin, cefprozil, and other common oral antimicrobial agents against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == macrolide and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents are frequently used for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin or skin structure infections. to evaluate the relative in vitro activity of these antimicrobial drugs against organisms commonly involved in these infections, we tested clarithromycin, erythromycin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline against 174 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae. manual broth microdilution susceptibility testing was used with a standard inoculum of 5 x 10(4) colony-forming units/well at ph of 7.2. clarithromycin was the most active agent against streptococci. methicillin-susceptible s aureus exhibited resistance to both clarithromycin and  erythromycin, but was susceptible to cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline. cefprozil was at least as active as cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cephalexin against all organisms tested, but was fourfold less active than doxycycline against e coli and 16-fold less active than clarithromycin versus s pneumoniae. the gram-negative isolates tested showed resistance to clarithromycin and erythromycin; however, cefprozil was as active as amoxicillin/clavulanate against k pneumoniae and e coli. these results demonstrate that clarithromycin provides superior in vitro activity against common streptococci, while cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline provide greater activity against methicillin-susceptible s aureus, k  pneumoniae, and e coli. prospective clinical trials are needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  == an agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and haemophilus influenzae with an mic90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and legionella pneumophila with an mic of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin inhibited staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. norfloxacin  and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (mic90) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and some other gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. the results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against gram-negative and gram-positive species.

TI  == migration of bacteria along synthetic polymeric fibers.
AB  == e. coli, s. epidermidis, and b. distasonis were observed to migrate readily along polymer fibers impressed upon the surface of nutrient agar. e. coli was also observed to migrate readily along polymer fibers embedded in brain-heart infusion agar. within periods of about 24 h, migration distances of about several centimeters were observed. no migration was observed in control experiments conducted on or in the same media, but without fibers. migration speed was greatest for e. coli and slowest for b. distasonis. cell population density was found to decrease rapidly with distance from a source culture. swimming motility  or natural convection in liquid between fiber and gel appears to be improbable based on the expected dimensions of capillary-condensed liquid between fiber and  gel.

TI  == [nosocomial infection in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation].
AB  == during a two-year period (1988-1989), were studied newborns treated with intermittent mandatory ventilation (imv). the goal was to know incidence of infections in these patients and characteristics of these process. of 187, 40 (21.3%) were infected. for these neonates the mean gestational age was 33 +/- 3 weeks and average for birth weight was 1755 +/- 644 g. in 32 the infecting agent  was isolated, being the most common coagulase negative staphylococcus, it was found in 18 (45%), klebsiella sp in 7 (17%), escherichia coli in 1 and candida albicans in 1. in the remaining 8 (20%) with negative cultures, postmortem confirmation was made in 5 and in 3 by clinical, radiologic or hematologic evidence. of the 17 positive blood cultures and 3 spinal fluid culture, the same  bacteria grew as in the bronchial aspirate. were found, thrombocytopenia in 22 (55%) and leucocytosis in 19 (47%) as the most common blood changes. pneumonia was the most common form of infection; it was found in 30 (75%); 22 of 40 died (55%). we concluded that 21.3% of neonates under imv without infections, may get  infected later in the hospital. s. epidermidis is the etiologic agent that predominates through the whole year, except during epidemics caused by others agents.

TI  == biosynthesis of the lantibiotic nisin: genomic organization and membrane localization of the nisb protein.
AB  == nisin produced by lactococcus lactis 6f3 is used as a food preservative and is the most important member of a group of peptide-antibiotics containing lanthionine bridges (lantibiotics) (n. schnell, k.-d. entian, u. schneider, f. gotz, h. zahner, r. kellner, and g. jung, nature [london] 333:276-278, 1988). nisin is ribosomally synthesized, and its structural gene, nisa, encodes a prepeptide that is posttranslationally modified, revealing the active lantibiotic (c. kaletta and k.-d. entian, j. bacteriol. 171:1597-1601, 1989). adjacent to nisa, the additional genes nisb, nist, and nisc were identified. over their entire sequences, these genes were homologous to genes recently identified as important for the biosynthesis of lantibiotics, that is, subtilin from bacillus subtilis atcc 6633 and epidermin from staphylococcus epidermidis tu 3298. genes nisb, nist, and nisc corresponded to open reading frames of 993, 600, and 418 amino acid residues, respectively. the nist open reading frame is homologous to proteins of the hlyb (hemolysin b protein of escherichia coli) subfamily. proteins of this subfamily are responsible for the secretion of a variety of compounds, including large polypeptides, polysaccharides, and anti-drug tumors, indicating that nist may be involved in nisin transport. northern (rna) blot analysis revealed a 0.3-kb transcript for the nisa structural gene, and the transcriptional start point of the nisa gene was determined by primer extension.  additionally, a mrna of at least 3 kb was identified by using a hybridization probe specific to nisb. antibodies were raised against the nisb protein, and western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed a molecular weight of about 115 kda,  which is in accordance with the theoretical protein size of 117.5 kda as calculated from the nisb open reading frame. several amphipathic transmembrane alpha-helices indicated that nisb is associated with the membrane. this was confirmed by preparing l. lactis vesicles. the nisb protein was tightly associated with the vesicle fraction and was released by sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment only. these results suggest that nisb is membrane associated and that nisin biosynthesis occurs at the cell membrane.

TI  == evaluation of progesterone treatment to create a model for equine endometritis.
AB  == to investigate a model for equine endometritis, 12 mares with normal reproductive tracts were divided into 2 groups. all mares received progesterone in oil, 250 mg im, daily. at 5 days after initiation of progesterone administration, the uteri were inoculated with 10(6) colony forming units of pseudomonas aeruginosa. the day of inoculation was designated day 0. on day 6, endometrial swab samples yielded p. aeruginosa in 5 mares; samples from the other 7 mares yielded heavy growth of escherichia coli, streptococcus zooepidemicus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., citrobacter diversus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus morbillorum. on days 6, 7 and 8, group a mares received intrauterine infusions of 6 g ticarcillin disodium and 0.2 g clavulanate potassium in 100 ml sterile saline. group b mares received infusions of saline only. the incidence of swab specimens yielding no bacterial growth was significantly higher in group a than group b mares on days 8 and 13 (4/6 vs 0/6). swab samples from 5 of the 6 mares in group a yielded growth of fungi on days 13  and 19. mares in group b were then similarly treated with ticarcillin/clavulanate infusions, on days 19, 20 and 21. the incidence of swab specimens yielding no bacterial growth was 2/6 and 1/6 on days 21 and 26, respectively; fungi were not  recovered from these mares at any time. the incidence of no-growth swabs after antibiotic treatment tended to be higher in group a and incidence of fungal recovery after antibiotic treatment was significantly higher in group a.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == efficacy and tolerability of norfloxacin vs. ciprofloxacin in complicated urinary tract infection.
AB  == this prospective, open, randomized clinical study compared the efficacy and tolerability of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in adult patients with complicated  urinary tract infection, defined as infection in the presence of an underlying anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract. seventy-two patients were randomized, 37 received norfloxacin (400 mg orally twice daily for 10-21 days) and 35 received ciprofloxacin (500 mg orally every 12 hours for 14-21 days). patients were clinically assessed, and urine cultures were obtained following two to four days of therapy, and five to nine days and four to six weeks after discontinuation of therapy. seventy-two percent of the norfloxacin group and 79 percent of the ciprofloxacin group were considered cured. this difference was not significant. one failure of norfloxacin therapy was associated with the emergence of resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. following norfloxacin therapy, in 2 patients superinfections developed with resistant organisms (staphylococcus epidermidis [1] and pseudomonas maltophilia [1]). twelve patients, 6 in each group, experienced adverse reactions, which were considered related to the study drug therapy in only four instances. our results indicated comparable efficacy and tolerability of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection in adults.

TI  == microbial adhesion and biofilm formation on ureteral stents in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == thirty ureteral stents, inserted for 5 to 128 days following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, were examined for the presence of bacterial biofilms. of these, 90% had adherent pathogens (44% mixed organisms) on the stents, 45% of which were present in low numbers (10(1)-10(2) per 1 cm3 section) and 55% were in small and  large microcolony biofilms (> 2 x 10(2)-10(7)). the organisms were recovered from the stents even though urine culture was only positive in 27% of patients. of the organisms isolated, 77% were gram positive cocci, 15% gram negative rods and 8% candida. no blockage of the stents occurred. all of the patients had received antimicrobial therapy post-insertion, and in 15 cases biofilms were found while on treatment. none of the patients received therapy for urinary tract infections  while the stent remained in place. in vitro experiments demonstrated the ability  of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis uropathogens to adhere and form biofilms on ureteral stents within 24 hours. clearly, bacterial biofilms do occur on ureteral stents and urinary culture may not detect their presence. the high recovery rate of gram positive organisms may indicate a preferential adhesion to the biomaterial surface. the findings also indicate that unlike biofilm formation on many other prosthetic implants, colonization with gram positive organisms on ureteral stents does not necessarily coincide with the development symptomatic infection.

TI  == differentiation of round cells in semen by means of monoclonal antibodies and relationship with male fertility.
AB  == objective: to differentiate round cells in semen samples of subfertile men and evaluate the clinical significance during infertility investigation. patients: one hundred and eight randomly chosen couples with a median duration of infertility of 4 (range, 1 to 20) years presenting at the outpatient infertility  clinic of the university of heidelberg, germany. main outcome measures: differentiation of round cells in semen by means of monoclonal antibodies (mabs)  and a streptavidin-biotin system for staining. correlation of results with medical history, outcome of clinical examination, sperm analysis, microbial screening of both partners, evaluation of sperm functional capacity in vivo by means of the postcoital test (pct) and in vitro with the standardized crossed sperm-cervical mucus penetration test (scmpt) and the subsequent fertility in a prospective study. results: the method used for differentiation of round cells proved to be practical and suitable for routine use. the percentage of leukocytes ranged from 0% to 58% with a median of 3%. number of round cells and percentage of leukocytes did not differ markedly with regard to andrologic history, clinical findings, for example, varicocele, results of standard sperm analysis, and microbial colonization of semen samples. however, high rates of leukocytes of the round cells correlated with reduced sperm count and morphology and results of pct. leukocyte-positive (> 15% leukocytes) specimens were also significantly more frequent in case of inadequate scmpt and reduced sperm penetration ability in vitro. conclusions: in asymptomatic patients (in terms of genital tract infection), the majority of round cells consist of immature germ cells and < 5% are white blood cells. the streptavidin-biotin system and the mabs used in this study proved to be useful to identify patients with elevated rates of leukocytes  in semen possibly reflecting subclinical genital tract infection with influence on sperm functional capacity and subsequent fertility. thus the procedure can be  recommended to be included in a comprehensive evaluation of male fertility.

AB  == the genetic determinant encoding gentamicin resistance (gmr) on the beta-lactamase encoding plasmid pbem10 of enterococcus faecalis hh22 is carried on a transposon, termed tn5281, that is highly related to the staphylococcal gmr  transposons tn4001 found in australian isolates of staphylococcus aureus and tn4031 found in united states isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis. we have now studied plasmid dna from gmr strains of e. faecalis isolated from diverse geographical locations (houston, pennsylvania, thailand, and chile) by using restriction endonuclease analysis and dna-dna hybridization to determine whether  other gmr e. faecalis carry tn5281 or a similar type of element. we also compared these enterococci to several united states isolates of staphylococcus aureus with nonmobile gmr determinants. three e. faecalis isolates (from houston and chile) carried tn5281-like elements, whereas two isolates (from houston and pennsylvania) had restriction endonuclease and dna-dna hybridization patterns more similar to those of the tn4001-is257 hybrid found in the nonmobile gmr determinants in united states isolates of s. aureus. a strain from thailand had a third pattern unrelated to either tn5281 or the nonmobile gmr determinants present in united states isolates of s. aureus. our results demonstrate that there is both similarity and diversity between the gmr determinant of strains of  e. faecalis isolated in diverse geographic locations.

TI  == acanthamoeba keratitis: synergy between amebic and bacterial cocontaminants in contact lens care systems as a prelude to infection.
AB  == we encountered a patient with acanthamoeba keratitis whose contact lens care solution contained numerous trophozoites and cysts admixed with xanthomonas maltophilia organisms, many of which were adherent to the trophozoite surface and internalized within endocytic vacuoles. because of this finding, we investigated  the role of bacterial cocontaminants in contact lens care systems as substrates for the growth of acanthamoeba spp. individual cocultivation of acanthamoeba castellanii and a. polyphaga with x. maltophilia, flavobacterium breve, and pseudomonas paucimobilis showed better enhancement (1.5x) of ameba growth after 96 h than that obtained in the presence of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and escherichia coli, the standard cocultivation species used for isolation of amebae from clinical specimens. our data suggest that contamination of contact lens care systems with acanthamoeba spp. and a bacterial species capable of supporting amebic growth may be the first step in the pathogenesis of ameba-induced keratitis by the provision of large inocula of amebae.

TI  == purification and characterization of epid, a flavoprotein involved in the biosynthesis of the lantibiotic epidermin.
AB  == the plasmid-encoded epidermin biosynthesis gene, epid, of staphylococcus epidermidis tu3298 was expressed in escherichia coli by using both the male fusion system and the t7 rna polymerase-promoter system. epid was identified by western blotting (immunoblotting) with anti-maltose-binding protein (mbp)-epid antiserum. epid and the mbp-epid fusion protein, which were mainly present in the soluble protein fraction, were purified from the respective e. coli clones. purified epid showed the typical absorption spectrum of an oxidized flavoprotein  with maxima at 274, 382, and 453 nm. the coenzyme released from epid by heat treatment was identified as flavin mononucleotide. s. epidermidis tu3298/ems11, containing a mutation within epid, was unable to synthesize active epidermin. this mutated gene, epid*, was cloned in e. coli and expressed as an mbp-epid* fusion protein. dna sequencing of epid* identified a point mutation that led to replacement of gly-93 with asp. unlike mbp-epid, the fusion protein mbp-epid* could not bind flavin mononucleotide. we propose that epid catalyzes the removal  of two reducing equivalents from the cysteine residue of the c-terminal meso-lanthionine to form a --c==c-- double bond and is therefore involved in formation of the unusual s-[(z)-2-aminovinyl[-d-cysteine structure in epidermin.

AB  == during the 20-year period, 1972-1991, 286 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 200  (45%) of 445 patients with acute leukemia in a hematology ward, giving an incidence of 482 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. the frequency of bacteremia was almost unchanged throughout the study period. the frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of all the isolates for the first half of the study period to 50% for the latter half. despite the common use of ceftazidime and imipenem during the last 5-year period, pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in frequency to be the most frequent organism. this was opposite to the decreased frequencies of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the isolates of p. aeruginosa obtained during this period, all of which proved sensitive to ceftazidime and/or imipenem, were almost equally distributed among five serogroups, although a temporal preponderance of a limited number of serogroups was observed during the preceding 15-year period. on the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9% in the first decade to 35% in the latter decade. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species and, to a lesser extent, staphylococcus aureus  were ranked as major pathogens. among the recent isolates of s. aureus, methicillin-resistant strains virtually replaced methicillin-sensitive ones. therefore, until more effective means for control of p. aeruginosa bacteremia in  particular become available, the occurrence of this infection will continue to limit the successful treatment of acute leukemia.

TI  == development of cutaneous microflora in premature neonates.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococci (c-ns) are a frequent cause of bacteraemia in premature neonates. it is likely that the strains of c-ns causing bacterial sepsis in premature neonates have their origin on the patient's skin surface. we  have studied the quantitative development of the skin microflora at eight sites on premature neonates. a swab wash method was used to sample and enumerate the cutaneous microflora of premature neonates admitted to an intensive care unit with respiratory distress syndrome. the numbers of bacteria present on the skin increased rapidly by 100-fold in the first week of life. the species of c-ns found on neonatal skin were similar to those found on adult skin. however, the bacterial population was 10(3) lower by comparison. there was considerable variation in numbers of bacteria and in the proportion resistant to antibiotics from day to day. there appeared to be no association between antibiotic usage and the proportion of isolates resistant to antibiotics, although the resident bacteria were in many cases resistant to a variety of antibiotics. c-ns were isolated from 92% of samples from which bacteria were isolated. staphylococcus epidermidis was found at all sites and accounted for 82% of each colonial type of staphylococcus isolated. other organisms isolated included propionibacterium sp,  alpha-haemolytic streptococci, aerobic spore-bearing bacilli, aerobic coryneforms, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, pityrosporum sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. the results of this study suggest that the skin of premature neonates is colonised with antibiotic resistant c-ns during the first week of life and that the chance of contamination of an intravascular catheter at insertion increases during this period.

AB  == trospectomycin sulfate (trospectomycin, trs) is a novel, broad-spectrum, aminocyclitol antibiotic that is being developed clinically for the treatment of  upper respiratory tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and gonorrhea. this study investigated the bactericidal activity (by time-kill kinetics) and the postantibiotic effect (pae) of trs. species-dependent bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity was observed for trs; the antibiotic was bacteriostatic for staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and escherichia coli, and bactericidal for haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis (one of two test strains). when trs was tested at four times its minimum inhibitory concentration  or at a maximum test concentration of 32 micrograms/ml, with a 1-hr exposure period, the following pae values were recorded: s. epidermidis 30032, 1.8 hr, en. faecalis atcc 29212, 1.6 hr, e. coli uc 311, 1.5 hr, e. coli uc 9451, 1.5 hr, h.  influenzae 30063, greater than 4.0 hr, b. fragilis atcc 25285, 5.2 hr, and b. fragilis uc 12199, 6.7 hr. the broad-spectrum pae that was observed for trs is somewhat unique compared with other antibiotics.

TI  == influence of transient salivary flora on assessment of mutans streptococci level  by the "strip mutans" method.
AB  == the dentocult sm ("strip mutans") method occasionally shows decoloration of broth and of colonies of mutans streptococci on the plastic strip, thereby making interpretation difficult. in an attempt to explain the phenomenon and to investigate the influence of the salivary flora on the "strip mutans" method, a total of 46 subjects were sampled. saliva was analyzed using the "strip mutans" method and conventional plating techniques to identify mutans streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, and yeasts. approximately 85% of the "strip mutans" scores coincided with the conventional msb-plating method. two samples showed decolored mutans streptococci colonies on the "strip mutans" strip. enterococcus spp. were present in the saliva of these test subjects and could grow in the "strip mutans" broth. enterococcus faecalis was able to induce  the same type of decoloration under experimental pure culture conditions. three "strip mutans" samples showed small colonies of mutans streptococci, visible only under magnification (x 10-20). staphylococcus epidermidis was present in these saliva samples and showed heavy growth in the broth. under experimental pure culture conditions s. epidermidis also inhibited the growth of mutans streptococci to some extent.

TI  == evaluation of strategies for central venous catheter replacement.
AB  == objectives: to assess the consequences of leaving a bacterially colonized central venous catheter in place and to compare the effects of three catheter replacement strategies for catheter repair control in an animal model. design: prospective study. setting: laboratory and animal facility of a large university. subjects: eighteen healthy, female, adult sheep. interventions: radiopaque-siliconized elastomer central venous catheters were inserted into the jugular veins and colonized with either escherichia coli or staphylococcus epidermidis. after 7 days of infection, the catheters were either: a) exchanged using a guidewire; b)  removed and replaced with a new catheter in a new jugular vein site after a 48-hr interval; or c) exchanged using a guidewire and antibiotics (tobramycin, cephaloridine) injected into the catheter. animals were euthanized 7 days after insertion of the new catheter. quantitative microbiology was performed on blood samples collected daily from the catheters and a peripheral vein, as well as from catheters and tissue recovered from the sheep at the time of autopsy. measurements and main result: when catheters were changed using a guidewire, they became colonized by bacteria within 48 hrs, and the sheep had embolic pneumonia and vegetative endocarditis at autopsy. similar consequences were observed when antibiotics were administered into the catheter lumen. if colonized catheters were removed and a new catheter was inserted after a 48-hr interval, recolonization, pneumonia, and endocarditis were not observed. conclusions: replacement of a biofilm-colonized central venous catheter over a guidewire is associated with rapid colonization of the replacement catheter and production of  detached, slime-enclosed, antibiotic-resistant aggregates that colonize other catheters or initiate endocarditis or pneumonia by dissemination in the bloodstream.

TI  == ribotyping of coagulase-negative staphylococci with special emphasis on intraspecific typing of staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), particularly staphylococcus epidermidis, are increasingly being recognized as opportunistic pathogens. they are often multiply antibiotic resistant and can cause nosocomial outbreaks. for clinical and epidemiological reasons, accurate species identification and typing are imperative. ribotyping, i.e., the generation of characteristic fragment patterns  by hybridization of restriction endonuclease fragments of total dna with labeled  standard rrna from escherichia coli, has been applied to cons for species identification by various investigators. the present study, involving 115 randomly collected clinical isolates of cons, provides ambiguous evidence with respect to those findings. eighty six s. epidermidis strains were ribotyped intraspecifically. eleven different ribotypes were found after digestion with ecori, and 10 were found with hindiii. a combination of the two restriction endonucleases resulted in an increase in the discriminatory power (dp) from 14.3  to 31.6%. a combination of ribotyping with biotyping raised the dp to a maximum of 48.6%. the reproducibility of ribotyping was 100% after greater than 400 generations of growth. no correlation between methicillin resistance and certain  ribotypes among the s. epidermidis strains was observed. ribotyping is considered a useful tool for the intraspecific typing of cons for epidemiological purposes.  the dp can be increased by the use of additional restriction endonucleases.

AB  == the meca gene from methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus 27r, which encodes the membrane-bound penicillin-binding protein 2a (pbp 2a), was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli. pbp 2a is the major factor that mediates methicillin resistance in staphylococci. the dna sequence of the meca gene from strain 27r was greater than 99% identical to the dna sequence of other s. aureus  meca genes and the meca gene from staphylococcus epidermidis. analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of pbp 2a from strain 27r revealed a hydrophobic region at the amino terminus that possessed characteristics of an uncleaved signal peptide such as those found in type ii integral membrane proteins. site-specific mutagenesis was used to modify the strain 27r meca gene to permit removal of the region encoding the putative transmembrane region (amino acids 2 to 22). when it was expressed in e. coli, the modified meca gene from strain 27r  encoded a water-soluble form of pbp 2a that was detectable in the cytoplasm of transformants. the water-soluble form of pbp 2a protein from s. aureus 27r retained the same binding efficiency for beta-lactam antibiotics as the unmodified membrane-bound pbp 2a from s. aureus 27r.

(this combination of elements is dominated in the present measurements by the behavior of the normalized s34 matrix element, as is indicated by the notation defined on the right side of the equation.) the resulting graph in each case shows an oscillating function of angle. this function is compressed toward smaller angles  when the bacteria are in the exponential phase of growth in comparison with results for a suspension of the same bacteria in the stationary (starving-smaller cells) phase of growth. microscopic measurements were made to determine, for each case, the average dimensions of the bacterial population. graphs were then plotted of the peak positions from the mueller matrix function plots vs either cell length or cell diameter. the function was shown to be strongly correlated with cell diameter under the conditions of this experiment and poorly correlated  with cell length. the measurements were shown to have a sensitivity to changes in average diameter of about 20 nm.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  == cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its mic90 is 0.125 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for haemophilus spp., neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of m. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. less than 1 mg/l is needed for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp. and shigella spp. the mic90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, morganella morganii, providencia spp. and most strains of serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and most strains of pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. cefodizime has high affinity for pbp 3 and pbp ia and ib (escherichia coli); in s. aureus it shows the highest affinity for pbp 1.

TI  == septicemia in granulocytopenic patients: a shift in bacterial etiology.
AB  == 35 episodes of septicemia in 33 patients occurred among 269 consecutive patients  with granulocytopenia (granulocyte cell count less than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9)/l) during the 7-year period 1982-1988. 59% of isolated bacteria were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, streptococcus species and pneumococcus) and 41% gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter, acinetobacter and citrobacter). compared to the 7-year period 1975-1981, there was a decrease in the relative number of patients with gram-negative septicemia. thus, a shift from a predominating gram-negative etiology in the 1975-1981 period to a predominating gram-positive etiology in the 1982-1988 period was noted. in both periods the mortality rate was high in patients with gram-negative septicemia, especially in  patients with a ps, aeruginosa infection.

AB  == from january 1984 to april 1987, we have prospectively studied 210 consecutive episodes of bacteremia recorded in patients who underwent major surgical procedures. the incidence rate was 6.4 episodes/1000 surgical procedures. men were responsible of 73.8% of episodes. the highest incidence was recorded in general surgery patients and the lowest in ob & gyn patients. bacteremia-related  mortality was 15.2% (overall mortality 29.5%). the five most common microorganisms isolated were: staphylococcus epidermidis (17.7%), staphylococcus  aureus (14.7%), polymicrobial flora (13.3%), escherichia coli (11.4%) and pseudomonas sp. (9.5%). the common sources of bacteremia were intravascular devices (34.7%), surgical wound infection (28.5%) and urinary tract infection (12.8%). multivariant analysis identified six variables that influence an adverse prognosis: complications, source of sepsis in a joint or unknown, admission in trauma or vascular surgery department, development of sepsis between the second and eight postoperative day, chronic illness or fatal underlying disease and sepsis after clean surgical procedures.

AB  == rat defensins were purified and tested for in vitro bactericidal assay against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. staphylococcus aureus (209p, cowan i, smith diffuse and smith compact) were resistant to defensins, whereas staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, micrococcus lysodeikticus and bacillus subtilis were less sensitive. gram-negative bacteria,  such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and k) and klebsiella pneumoniae (chedid,  277, and 8n3 which were heavily capsulated, moderately capsulated and noncapsulated, respectively) were all very sensitive to defensins and killed within 20 min. escherichia coli was moderately sensitive and the rough mutants of lipopolysaccharide (lps) of salmonella typhimurium lt2, such as ra, rc, rd, and re were equally sensitive to defensins, being killed within 40 min. lysozyme did  not show any bactericidal activity except against m. lysodeikticus and b. subtilis, whereas it enhanced the bactericidal activity of defensins against p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae and suppressed the killing activity of defensins against s. typhimurium and s. aureus. with regard to the three synthetic rabbit defensins, np1, np4, and np5, np1 showed strong bactericidal activity against k. pneumoniae 277, comparable to that of rat defensins. neither  np4 nor np5 showed any bactericidal activity, while np5 rather enhanced the bactericidal activity of np1 against k. pneumoniae 277.

TI  == exit-site and tunnel infections in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  == one hundred two exit-site infections (esi) were diagnosed in 63 of 163 (38.6%) patients, with an incidence of one episode every 23.7 patient-months in patients  with a history of esi, whereas in the overall continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd) population the incidence was one episode every 48.7 patient-months. in diminishing order of frequency, the bacteria isolated were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. the probability of remaining free of esi was 72% at 1 year and  45% at 5 years. the esi that led to catheter removal were due to s aureus and gram-negative rods. in 13 (48%) of 27 s aureus esi unresponsive to antibiotics and local care, deroofing and outer cuff shaving completely resolved the esi. despite this treatment, the catheters of the remaining 14 patients had to be removed because of peritonitis associated with the tunnel infection. in conclusion, esi is a major cause of capd failure. in our series, shaving the cuff as a rescue treatment was effective for almost 50% of the patients with antibiotic-resistant s aureus esi.

AB  == eighty-eight women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection (at least  four attacks in the preceding 12 months) were randomized to take either norfloxacin 200 mg at night (45 patients) or macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin 100  mg at night (43 patients) for 12 months. a decrease in the number of symptomatic  attacks while taking this prophylaxis was observed in 94 per cent of the patients and this improvement was maintained during the 6 months following the end of prophylaxis in 69 per cent. the mean interval between symptomatic episodes while  taking prophylaxis was 7.2-fold and 6.9-fold greater, respectively, than in the 12 months before starting prophylaxis. there were only nine breakthrough infections during 74 patient-years of prophylaxis, four in patients taking norfloxacin (two enterococci, one staphylococcus epidermidis, one escherichia coli), and five in those taking macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin (four e. coli, one klebsiella pneumoniae). adverse events caused four patients taking norfloxacin (8 per cent) and seven taking macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin (14 per cent) to stop prophylaxis. norfloxacin had a marked suppressive effect on the coliform part of the faecal flora, with no emergence of resistance. thus, norfloxacin appears to be an excellent alternative agent to macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin for the prevention of recurrent urinary infections.

AB  == the cefoperazone and sulbactam concentrations in human prostatic fluid were measured following intravenous administration of sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) and its clinical efficacy and safety in the treatment of 11 patients with acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis were evaluated. cefoperazone concentrations in prostatic fluid (pf) one hour after an intravenous infusion of sbt/cpz at a dose  of 1 g and 2 g were 0.57 +/- 0.26 micrograms/ml and 1.37 +/- 0.86 micrograms/ml,  respectively, both exceeding the mic against most of the isolated strains from expressed prostatic secretion (eps). the sulbactam levels in pf at doses of 1 g and 2 g of sbt/cpz were 0.30 +/- 0.18 micrograms/ml and 0.38 +/- 0.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, both of which were high enough to potentiate antimicrobial activity of cefoperazone. the peak of mic distribution of sulbactam/cefoperazone against e. coli (14 strains) and s. epidermidis (21 strains) isolated from eps of patients with bacterial prostatitis was in a range  of 0.1-0.2 micrograms/ml and 0.2-0.78 micrograms/ml as described for the cefoperazone concentration, respectively, which were superior to those of cefoperazone, ceftazidime and piperacillin, all compared as control, sbt/cpz exhibited 8 fold or more potent antimicrobial activity than cefoperazone against  beta-lactamase producing e. coli and cns. clinically, sbt/cpz was given to 11 patients diagnosed as having bacterial prostatitis in a daily dose of 2-4 g for 5 to 8 days. the drug was found to be effective in all (100%) of 5 patients with acute prostatitis and in 3 (75.0%) of 4 patients who were judged to be assessable among 6 chronic patients. no side effects of any kind were observed in any of the patients treated. in laboratory tests, a transient thrombocytopenia was reported  for one patient. sbt/cpz is particularly useful in the treatment of acute bacterial prostatitis caused by gnr. this drug is useful for chronic prostatitis  those, caused primarily by cns which is susceptible to this agent. this drug is available as an injectable form, subjects for its appropriate usage will be those who show acute exacerbation of infection or who do not respond to oral therapy.

TI  == effect of nacl-induced osmotic stress on intracellular concentrations of glycine  betaine and potassium in escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococci.
AB  == staphylococci are more salt tolerant than are enterococci or escherichia coli. they have a more rigid cell wall and higher internal turgor pressure. the mechanisms of nacl-induced osmotic tolerance among these bacteria were examined by determining the generation of osmoprotective activity of cellular extracts and intracellular concentrations of glycine betaine and potassium (k+) in response to graded amounts of nacl. staphylococci as well as e. coli were shown to require choline or glycine betaine to achieve maximal salt tolerance. in response to 0.9  mol/l nacl, e. coli exhibited a marked increase in osmoprotective activity, a 168-fold rise in glycine betaine, and a 2.3-fold rise in k+. enterococcus faealis exhibited a small increase in osmoprotective activity, a 9.3-fold increase in glycine betaine, and a twofold increase in k+. in contrast, strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. saprophyticus were found to have considerably greater osmoprotective activity, glycine betaine, and k+ than other  organisms, even in the absence of external osmotic stress. glycine betaine rose in some strains, but k+ remained virtually unchanged as the concentration of nacl was increased. the high concentrations of glycine betaine and k+ in staphylococci, even in the absence of osmotic stress, may explain in part their remarkable salt tolerance and high turgor pressure.

TI  == white cells protect donor blood against bacterial contamination.
AB  == the possible beneficial role of white cells (wbcs) in donor blood has been investigated with respect to their capacity to remove bacteria. preparations of buffy coat and whole blood, containing as well as reduced of wbcs, were inoculated with staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and propionibacterium species. upon storage at room temperature, the presence of wbcs resulted in a reduction of the bacterial content. units inoculated with s. epidermidis and e. coli were completely cleared of bacteria within 5 to 24 hours. on the other hand, s. aureus, after an initial  reduction in number, started to multiply. in wbc-reduced units, the initial bacterial content remained unchanged for 5 hours, but the bacteria then exhibited vigorous growth within 48 hours in buffy coat and slower growth in whole blood. propionibacterium sp. did not grow with or without wbcs. p. aeruginosa did not grow in buffy coat but showed a growth pattern similar to that of s. aureus in whole blood. the presence of wbcs in the donor blood during the first hours after collection thus seems to rid the blood of at least some species of bacteria. these results indicate that it would be favorable not to perform wbc reduction during blood collection and that several hours of contact can be needed to obtain sterility.

TI  == relative availability of transferrin-bound iron and cell-derived iron to aerobactin-producing and enterochelin-producing strains of escherichia coli and to other microorganisms.
AB  == a method is described for determination of the relative availability of transferrin-bound iron and cell-derived iron to microbial iron-scavenging mechanisms. this involved incubation of parallel cultures of microorganisms in dialysis tubes placed in rpmi 1640 tissue culture medium containing 30%-iron-saturated transferrin and k562 erythroleukemia cells. in one culture the transferrin was labelled with 59fe and in the other the cells were labelled, and  the relative uptake of radioiron by the microorganisms determined. the results showed that staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus acquired iron predominantly from cells, while candida albicans and the enteropathogenic escherichia coli nctc 8623 tended to acquire iron from transferrin. e. coli k-12  strains w3110 and lg1705, which (like nctc 8623) produce the siderophore enterochelin but not aerobactin, acquired predominantly transferrin-bound iron, whereas the related e. coli strains lg1315 and lg1628, which produce aerobactin but not enterochelin, showed a preference for cell-derived iron. when the cells were incubated in the presence of 59fe-labelled transferrin and 55fe-labelled ferritin, no difference in relative availability of iron to e. coli was observed, suggesting that differences in the ability of aerobactin and enterochelin to remove iron from intracellular ferritin were not responsible for this preference. these results may help to explain why production of aerobactin, despite its relatively low affinity for iron, is more closely associated with invasiveness in e. coli than is enterochelin production. reduced availability of cell-bound iron  during inflammation may contribute to antimicrobial defenses.

AB  == cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and  negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. cefcanel had excellent activity against  methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, mic90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. however, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, mic greater than or equal to  16 micrograms/ml. streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the mics were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for bacteroides spp. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the mics of cefixime. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, mics greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and  50% of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii were resistant. cefcanel was hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-3 and moraxella bro-1 beta-lactamases. escherichia coli  containing tem-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel mics of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited haemophilus influenzae carrying tem-1.

TI  == surface characteristics and adhesion of escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == surface hydrophobicity, surface electrokinetic potential and the ability to adhere to nitric-acid cleansed glass surfaces has been assessed throughout the growth, in batch culture, of escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. in  both instances adhesiveness and surface hydrophobicity decreased in early- to mid-exponential phase. cell surface charge, on the other hand became more electro-negative for e. coli but electro-neutral for staph. epidermidis as the cells proceeded to divide. adhesiveness correlated directly with surface electronegativity and hydrophobicity for staph. epidermidis but inversely with surface electro-negativity for e. coli.

TI  == staphylococcus epidermidis induces complement activation, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1, a shock-like state and tissue injury in rabbits without endotoxemia. comparison to escherichia coli.
AB  == tumor necrosis factor (tnf) and il-1 are thought to mediate many of the pathophysiologic changes of endotoxemia and gram-negative bacteremia. in these studies, heat-killed staphylococcus epidermidis were infused into rabbits to determine whether an endotoxin (lps)-free microorganism also elicits cytokinemia  and the physiologic abnormalities seen in gram-negative bacteremia. s. epidermidis induced complement activation, circulating tnf and il-1, and hypotension to the same degree as did one-twentieth the number of heat-killed escherichia coli. circulating il-1 beta levels had a greater correlation coefficient (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001) with the degree of hypotension than tnf levels (r = 0.48, p less than 0.02). leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, diffuse pulmonary capillary aggregation of neutrophils, and hepatic necrosis with neutrophil infiltration were observed to the same extent after either s. epidermidis or e. coli infusion. however, s. epidermidis infusion did not induce  significant (less than 60 pg/ml) endotoxemia, whereas e. coli infusion resulted in high (11,000 pg/ml) serum endotoxin levels. s. epidermidis, e. coli, lps, or s. epidermidis-derived lipoteichoic acid (lta) induced tnf and il-1 from blood mononuclear cells in vitro. e. coli organisms and lps were at least 100-fold more potent than s. epidermidis or lta. thus, a shock-like state with similar levels of complement activation as well as circulating levels of il-1 and tnf were observed following either s. epidermidis or e. coli. these data provide further evidence that host factors such as il-1 and tnf are common mediators of the septic shock syndrome regardless of the organism.

TI  == the occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  == minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees c) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the ph of the mix to 4.5-4.7. significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis. micrococcus varians and micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. less growth was exhibited by bacillus megaterium and yeasts. pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (p. pentosaceus and l. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. the growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. inoculated escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella sofia, and staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. lesser growth occurred for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with p. acidilactici.

TI  == effect of plastic catheter material on bacterial adherence and viability.
AB  == the kinetics of adherence of single isolates of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli to catheters made of polyvinyl chloride (pvc), teflon, siliconised latex, polyurethane and vialon was  evaluated by a radiometric assay. radiolabelled bacteria (10(8) cfu/ml) were incubated in vials containing 1-cm lengths of catheter for up to 3 days. the peak of maximal adherence to each biomaterial was reached after 24 h for p. aeruginosa and after 72 h for the other strains. bacterial adherence to pvc and siliconised  latex was significantly higher (2-6 times; p less than 0.05) than to the other biomaterials for all the strains. the lowest values of adherence were observed with polyurethane and vialon for the staphylococci but with teflon for e. coli and p. aeruginosa. bacterial viability and growth was evaluated in eluates obtained from incubation of segments of each catheter in buffer for 24 h. none of the eluates affected the viability of the staphylococci. however, all of them, significantly increased the growth of e. coli and p. aeruginosa with the exception of the eluate from siliconised latex, in which the inoculum count was reduced to an undetectable level for e. coli. we conclude that bacterial adherence to catheters may depend in part on the nature of the biomaterial and that certain substances eluted from the catheters may affect the viability and growth of different micro-organisms.

TI  == characterization of the gentamicin resistance transposon tn5281 from enterococcus faecalis and comparison to staphylococcal transposons tn4001 and tn4031.
AB  == in enterococcus faecalis, the genetic determinant encoding gentamicin resistance  (gmr) on the conjugative plasmid pbem10 previously has been shown to be on a mobile element. in the current study, this element, termed tn5281, was shown to relocate in the absence of homologous recombination in e. faecalis uv202. on the  basis of restriction endonuclease analysis and dna-dna hybridization studies, tn5281 was shown to be similar, if not identical, to the gmr transposons tn4001 found in australian isolates of staphylococcus aureus and tn4031 found in u.s. isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, since all three of these transposons have symmetrically located hindiii (2.5 kb apart), clai (slightly more than 2.5 kb apart), and haeiii (3.9 kb apart) sites. restriction endonuclease digestion patterns of tn5281 generated with hincii, scai, and alui were also consistent with tn4001 and tn4031. by using a probe specific for the external portion of the terminal inverted repeat of tn4031, it was determined that each terminus of tn5281 contained a 0.35-kb haeiii fragment and a 0.7-kb hindiii-haeiii fragment.  the sizes of these fragments are identical to those found in the staphylococcal transposons, which is a further indication that inverted repeats like is256 are present in tn5281. a 1-kb haeiii fragment in pbem10 also hybridized with this probe, which indicates that tn5281 in pbem10 contains a double copy of the inverted repeat at one end.

TI  == susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  == fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. two hundred thirty-one  patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90%  of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of enterococcus faecalis were  4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates  of escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of proteus mirabilis 0.25  and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. in summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety  of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.

TI  == factors in pin tract infections.
AB  == to determine the factors pertinent to the etiology of pin tract infections, 214 pins in 42 patients were examined prospectively at the time of pin removal. eighty-nine (41.6%) pin tracts were inflamed, 49 (22.9%) pins had loose anchorages, and 160 (74.8%) pin tips cultured positive for bacteria. the predominant organism cultured was staphylococcus epidermidis (90.6%), considered  nonvirulent, followed by virulent staphylococcus aureus (37.5%), and escherichia  coli (9.4%). there were 32 loose, inflamed pin tracts. this correlation was statistically significant (p less than .005). there were 40 loose pins whose pin  tips had positive cultures. loose pins correlated for infection with virulent species of bacteria at a highly significant level (p less than .005). results demonstrate that most pins possess bacterial colonization. clinically, this means that either inflamed pin tracts or pins with cultures positive for invasive organisms are probably loose and should be removed. also, mechanical factors are  the critical variable in determining the flora of external fixation pins.

AB  == ocp 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at c-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at c-3. ocp 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog me 1228 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia  stuartii, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. activity against enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii was equivalent. ocp 9-176 was twofold less active than me-1228 against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. activity of the two agents was similar against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. although ocp 9-176 inhibited e. coli containing tem-1 and tem-2, it was less active than me-1228. klebsiella organisms with shv-1 and k-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but tem-3-containing isolates had mics of 16  micrograms/ml. ocp 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by tem-1, pse-1, k-1, and p99,  and it was a poor inhibitor of p99. replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at c-3.

AB  == in 45 centers from eight african countries, 2,888 bacterial isolates were collected from patients with community-acquired infections. isolated pathogens included staphylococcus aureus (29%), escherichia coli (20%), neisseria gonorrhoeae (6%), proteus species (6%), klebsiella species (6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (4%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (4%). an overall sensitivity of 16.2% was shown to penicillin g (number of isolates tested = 2,467), 31.8% to ampicillin (2,687), 45% to amoxicillin (1,959), and 84.9% to cefuroxime (2,888).  beta-lactamase presence was measured by a chromogenic method. beta-lactamase was  found in 75% of all pathogens tested, including 69.5% of gram-negative and 83.3%  of gram-positive pathogens; 73% of e coli isolates, 76% of n gonorrhoeae, 75% of  klebsiella species, and 84% of s aureus were beta-lactamase positive. beta-lactamase presence was associated with bacterial resistance for penicillin g, ampicillin, and amoxicillin, but not cefuroxime, whose sensitivity remained high. the higher resistance rates and beta-lactamase prevalence in africa suggest the need for national antibiotic prescribing policies and surveillance schemes and replacement of relatively ineffective penicillins with newer agents such as cefuroxime.

TI  == sonication provides maximal recovery of staphylococcus epidermidis from slime-coated vascular prosthetics.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epidermidis) prosthetic vascular graft infections  are often difficult to detect. a reliable culture method is needed so that appropriate therapeutic decisions can be initiated in a timely fashion. sonication of graft material has been proposed as a method of enhancing bacterial recovery. theoretically, however, this could cause cell lysis and false-negative  culture results. several methods of obtaining bacterial cultures were compared to determine the best method of quantitative bacterial recovery from infected graft  material. polytetrafluoroetehylene (ptfe) and knitted dacron graft segments (n =  192) were exposed to a slime-producing strain of s. epidermidis or escherichia coli (e. coli) at four different bacterial concentrations. recovery of bacteria from the segments was then compared using three different methods to obtain organisms. one-third of the segments were pressed directly onto the agar to transfer bacteria while the other two-thirds were placed in broth and then either sonicated or vortexed prior to plating onto agar. the direct technique was significantly less effective (p less than 0.01) at recovering bacteria than either sonicating or vortexing for both graft materials at bacterial concentrations of 10, 10(2), and 10(4) cfu/ml of s. epidermidis. sonication was significantly better at recovery from either material at 10(2) and 10(4) cfu/ml of s. epidermidis than vortexing (p less than 0.05). e. coli graft adherence was  poor, and significant recovery occurred only at 10(8) cfu/ml. sonication is necessary to maximally recover s. epidermidis from infected prosthetic grafts.

AB  == in 1988 the university of wisconsin solution was introduced into clinical transplantation. this solution is unique in that it contains no glucose but rather raffinose, lactobionate, and hydroxyethyl starch. in addition, it contains two antibiotics, penicillin and bactrim. prior studies have shown that other preservation solutions allow the transmission of bacterial contamination from organ donor to recipient. however, there are no data on whether uw solution, with its unique composition and extended preservation times, allows bacterial transmission. we undertook the present study to establish if bacteria remain viable in uw solution at extended preservation times. cultures of both aerobic (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and anaerobic (bacteroides fragilis) bacteria were suspended at 10(5), 10(4), 10(2), and 10(1) org./ml (calibrated from a .5 macfarland turbidity standard) in both eurocollins and uw preservation solutions. samples were then stored in an ice bath to stimulate organ preservation. the organisms were removed and plated on blood and chocolate agar at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 hr postsuspension. the samples were then incubated at 37 degrees c and read for growth at 24-48 hr after plating. our results showed growth of all organisms except s epi in both preservation solutions, at all dilutions and preservation times. s epi grew in the eurocollins solution at all dilutions and preservation times but did not grow in the uw solution. when the experiment was repeated omitting penicillin from the uw solution, s epi grew at all dilutions and preservation times. these results demonstrate that in spite of the inclusion of two different antibiotics, the majority of the common bacterial contaminants of the organ donor remain viable in uw solution with extended preservation times. it may be possible therefore to omit these antibiotics from the uw solution and obtain similar results. it is also important to note that routine culturing remains an expensive but necessary part of organ procurement and preservation.

TI  == inactivation of metronidazole by enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the in-vitro inactivation of metronidazole by different clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis was investigated by means of association experiments in which ent. faecalis strains and bacteroides fragilis group strains were cultured  in the same liquid medium. all of the tested ent. faecalis strains (20 isolates)  were able to protect the b. fragilis group strains against the killing effect of  metronidazole at a concentration four or eight times higher than the normal mic.  different strains of streptococcus (14), staphylococcus aureus (10), staph, epidermidis (10) and escherichia coli (8) failed to exhibit the same effect. when ent. faecalis strains were cultured anaerobically for 24 h in the presence of 4 mg metronidazole/l, either alone or together with different b. fragilis group strains, no metronidazole could be detected subsequently in the culture supernatants by hplc. concomitantly an increase of four or five logs in the viable counts of the co-cultured bacteroides strains was observed compared with bacteroides strains cultured alone. sonicated cell extracts of ent. faecalis cultured either aerobically or anaerobically were found to inactivate metronidazole to the same extent, whereas the culture supernatants had no such effect.

AB  == lysozyme from equine neutrophil granulocytes was isolated in a pure form by fast  performance liquid chromatography, i.e. ion-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography. the lysozyme lysed micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus lentus and was also bactericidal against the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, bordetella bronchiseptica, and serratia marcescens. staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were not lysed. the lysozyme was only very slightly bactericidal for  s. epidermidis and s. aureus. equine neutrophil lysozyme was found to be bactericidal for gram-positive as well as for gram-negative bacteria without further treatment. equine and chicken egg white lysozymes were found to be immunologically related when examined using specific antisera against each of them. both lysozymes also had very similar specific enzymatic activities against  m. luteus membranes.

TI  == septicemia in patients with hematological disorders and neutropenia. a retrospective study of causative agents and their resistance profile.
AB  == in order to identify the cause of septicemia and the resistance patterns of bacteria in swedish patients with hematological disorders, all positive blood cultures collected at a hematological ward during 1980-1986 were evaluated retrospectively. 198 episodes of septicemia in 129 patients were recorded. 54% were males and 46% women with a median age of 67 years (range 16-88). patients with acute leukemia (46%), lymphoma (19%) and myeloma (19%) dominated. the absolute neutrophil count (anc) was less than 0.5 x 10(9)/l in 76% of the bacteremic episodes. a total of 253 consecutive isolates were found with 53% gram-negatives and 47% gram-positives. the dominating pathogens were escherichia  coli (27%), klebsiella/enterobacter (15%), pseudomonas (7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (13%), alpha-streptococci (13%), staphylococcus aureus (10%) and anaerobes (6%). coagulase negative staphylococci showed a significant increase in isolation rate during the study period. the majority of e. coli were resistant to ampicillin. the susceptibility of klebsiella/enterobacter to ceftazidime and cefuroxime was reduced, while no imipenem resistant strains occurred. among coagulase negative staphylococci 61% were resistant to isoxazolylpenicillin, none to vancomycin. no dramatic changes in the etiology of septicemia or the susceptibility pattern during the study period were noticed. coagulase negative staphylococci, s. epidermidis in particular, constitute an increasing problem among granulocytopenic patients.

TI  == mechanisms of zidovudine resistance in bacteria.
AB  == unlike their parent strains, zidovudine-resistant derivatives of escherichia coli kl16 and salmonella typhimurium nctc 5710 were found to be incapable of incorporating radiolabelled thymidine into their chromosomal dna. since incorporation was still prevented in the presence of edta, resistance to zidovudine was not associated with a permeability barrier, but appeared to result from the loss of thymidine kinase activity, required for the phosphorylation of zidovudine. pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is intrinsically zidovudine-resistant,  was also shown to be incapable of incorporating thymidine into its dna, but staphylococcus epidermidis sk360 and staph. aureus e3t, which are also intrinsically zidovudine-resistant, possessed thymidine kinase activity. this suggests that two distinct mechanisms of resistance to zidovudine exist in bacteria. zidovudine resistance did not appear to confer resistance to other antibacterial agents.

AB  == the pattern of neonatal bacterial infection, its management and the types of infection control policy were ascertained in 20 neonatal intensive care units (nicu) in australia by questionnaire survey. group b streptococcus and escherichia coli were the predominant organisms responsible for perinatally acquired infection for which the most common antibiotic combination used was penicillin and gentamicin. staphylococcus epidermidis and aureus (majority methicillin resistant) were the predominant organisms responsible for nosocomial  infection for which the most common antibiotic combination used was vancomycin and cefotaxime. a serratia epidemic was experienced in four nicu. lumbar and suprapubic punctures were frequently done as part of the diagnostic workup in nosocomial infections but not with perinatally acquired infections. haematological indices considered useful as a diagnosis aid varied between nicu and acute phase reactants were rarely relied upon for diagnosis or for monitoring treatment response. granulocyte transfusion and intravenous immunoglobulins were  infrequently used in therapy. no consensus was found on infection control policies. eight nicu required routine gowning on entry, two restricted sibling visiting and four restricted visiting by relatives and friends. although routine  bacteriological surveillance on staff or equipment was uncommon, serial cultures  were carried out in infants from the body surface in six nicu and from the endotracheal aspirate in 17 nicu. antiseptics used with technical procedures included iodine, chlorhexidine and alcohol used singly or in combination. skin and umbilical cord care also varied between nicu. the literature was reviewed to  determine the effectiveness or otherwise of some of the existing policies in the  prevention or management of neonatal infection to encourage consensus towards a more rational approach to neonatal infection in australia.

TI  == separation of sublethal and lethal effects of polymorphonuclear leukocytes on escherichia coli.
AB  == escherichia coli ingested by pmn promptly stop growing and form no colonies in nutrient agar, but metabolize near normally for up to several hours. the bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (bpi) of pmn also inhibits e. coli growth without initial metabolic impairment. we recently showed that bpi-treated  e. coli, although unable to grow in normal nutrient agar, can form colonies in this medium plus 0.1% bsa, as long as their metabolism is maintained, indicating  that biochemical impairment is a better indicator of death than growth arrest (1990. j. clin. invest. 85:853-860). we have now reexamined the fate of ingested  e. coli. rabbit pmn ingest greater than 85% of several rough e. coli strains in 15 min, but greater than 80% of these bacteria, while unable to form colonies in  conventional agar, grow normally on agar plus 0.1% bsa. thus, the pmn under these conditions promptly stop growth of ingested e. coli without killing. adding nonlethal concentrations of normal human serum (nhs) before, but not after ingestion, accelerates killing and, in parallel, loss of bacterial metabolism (t1/2 less than 0.5 h vs. greater than 3 h, respectively, with and without nhs).  the rapid killing of both rough and smooth e. coli pretreated with nhs is lost after c7 depletion (c7-d) and restored when c7 is replenished. similar results are obtained with human pmn. in contrast, ingested staphylococcus epidermidis, opsonized with either nhs or c7-d serum rapidly stop metabolizing and do not form colonies in nutrient agar with or without bsa. respiratory burst activity is the  same during ingestion of e. coli (with or without nhs) and s. epidermidis. killing of e. coli j5 (however, not of o111-b4) by bpi is also accelerated by pretreatment with nhs but not c7-d human serum. these findings indicate that late complement components are needed for efficient killing of both rough and smooth e. coli by pmn, and that bpi is the principal intracellular agent acting on ingested rough e. coli.

AB  == bacteria were grown from 63 (69%) of 91 specimens from necrotic tumours in 63 patients. of the tumours, 14 were abdominal, 5 pelvic, 23 of the head and neck, 4 of the lungs, 4 mediastinal, 2 lymphatic, 3 of the breast, and 8 were miscellaneous. aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 (19%) specimens, anaerobes only in 10 (16%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 41 (65%). a total of 83 anaerobic and 47 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were isolated. the predominant anaerobic bacteria were bacteroides spp. (36 isolates), and anaerobic cocci (21) and propionibacterium acnes (22). the aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria most frequently isolated were staphylococcus aureus, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, escherichia coli (seven isolates each), s. epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa (five isolates each). these data demonstrate that infection of tumours is usually polymicrobial.

AB  == the new fluoroquinolones have not been tested in children despite their wide spectrum of in vitro activity and efficacy, because of an observed damage to cartilage in young animals. however, in some cases they may be life-saving. we present three pediatric patients with life threatening infections in whom the fluoroquinolones were used when other antibiotics failed: a seven-year-old boy with meningitis due to multiresistant acinetobacter calcoaceticus, a three-year-old boy with job's syndrome with line sepsis due to staphylococcus epidermidis and a four month-old boy with agammaglobulinemia with mixed infection due to escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter spp. all three children were cured of their infections.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ljc10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of  imipenem and ceftazidime. ljc10,627 had broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates. the mics of this compound for  90% of members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested (mic90s), including strains resistant to ceftazidime, ranged from 0.1 to 25 micrograms/ml. ljc10,627  inhibited pseudomonas aeruginosa at an mic90 of 3.13 micrograms/ml; it thus was twofold more active than imipenem. this compound inhibited haemophilus, neisseria, and branhamella species at mic90s of 3.13, 0.1, and 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. ljc10,627 was two- to fourfold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at mic90s of 0.1 and 0.39 microgram/ml. however, the compound was found to be twofold more active than imipenem against bacteroides fragilis at an mic90 of 1.56 microgram/ml. ljc10,627 was very stable to various beta-lactamases except for xanthomonas maltophilia oxyiminocephalosporinase type ii. ljc10,627 was minimally hydrolyzed by swine renal dehydropeptidase i; its residual activity was 93.0% after 2 h. killing kinetics of this compound for escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that bactericidal action occurred at concentrations above the mic (0.05 and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively). ljc10,627 had a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 2, 4, and 1b(s) of escherichia coli and  pseudomonas aeruginosa and penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of staphylococcus  aureus.

AB  == a model was developed in mice to study the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections caused by staphylococcus saprophyticus strains lm-1 and lm-2, escherichia coli sp444 and s. epidermidis e001. murine urinary bladders were inoculated with 10(8) bacteria via a temporary urinary catheter and samples of urine and bladder were removed at days 1, 3, 5 and 10 after inoculation. they were examined both bacteriologically and by electronmicroscopy. severe disruption of the urothelium was present immediately and the urothelium had become oedematous and ulcerated with increased urothelial exfoliation. disruption of the urothelium was similar with all the four pathogens studied. the three strains of  coagulase-negative staphylococci preferentially attached to the urothelial cell tight junctions and were not associated with polymorphonuclear leucocytes. in comparison, e. coli sp444 was randomly attached over the entire urothelium and was often in association with macrophages. phagocytosis of e. coli by superficial urothelial cells also occurred.

TI  == a new approach to optimal antibiotic dosage regimen by coupling pharmacokinetics  and killing curve parameters.
AB  == antibiotic therapy is directed against bacteria responsible for infectious pathology which are able to resist treatment mainly when the dosage is misadapted. the choice of the initial dosage regimen actually takes into account  toxicological, bacteriological and pharmacokinetic parameters. the determination  of the classical bacteriological data is performed in vitro using fixed drug concentrations that are far from human therapy conditions, and moreover the efficiency is not well defined. the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters  is realized in animals, healthy subjects or ill patients but takes into account only the drug disposition without correspondence with the kinetics of the antibiotic effect on the bacteria. thus, each type of evaluation is made independently from the others without any correlation between the observed phenomena. it appears, therefore, interesting to propose a new approach including pharmacokinetic and bacteriological data to enable approximation of drug efficacy. the coupled evaluation of individual pharmacokinetic estimation and the killing curve determinations of an antibiotic will allow this type of development. on the basis of these data, a preliminary profile of the optimal dosage would be possible. this methodology has been applied to three antibiotics: teicoplanin, amikacin and ofloxacin and demonstrates a time- or dose-dependent activity, with interesting possibilities for optimization of dosage.

AB  == twenty-two (15 female and 7 male) patients with continuous ambulatory peritoneal  dialysis (capd) associated peritonitis were entered into an open non-comparative  evaluation of oral pefloxacin mesylate. an initial loading dose of 800 mg was followed by 400 mg twice daily. five patients were subsequently excluded or withdrawn. the mean age of the patients was 44 +/- 12.6 years. all three gram-negative infections (escherichia coli, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, serratia liquefaciens) and all three culture negative infections were cured after 21 days  treatment. in contrast one of four (25%) staphylococcus aureus infections was cured, two persisted during treatment and one relapsed, after treatments of between 10 and 25 days. one of seven (14%) staph. epidermidis infections was cured, three persisted and three relapsed after treatments of between nine and 25 days. two of the five persistent isolates became resistant: all four relapsed isolates remained sensitive. twelve of the 22 (55%) patients had 16 side effects, most commonly skin or musculo-skeletal. three stopped pefloxacin because of them, though one had taken an excessive dose in error. pefloxacin mesylate is not optimal treatment for gram-positive coccal peritonitis in patients on capd, but its role in gram-negative disease needs further evaluation.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of a new quinolone, win 57273, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, win 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. agar inclusion and broth dilution  in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the  staphylococci. the mic for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (mic90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the mic90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. against enterococci the mic90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group a and group b streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. in general, the mic90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. exceptions were serratia marcescens (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), citrobacter freundii (mic90,  4 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). the greatest potency was observed against haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp., with mic90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with mic90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. the in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for  all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. with the exception of the pseudomonas  infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. win 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial  infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).

TI  == the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in st  thomas' hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  == we have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. among the gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. the enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to  the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. we have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. although  many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.

TI  == exclusion of uropathogen adhesion to polymer surfaces by lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == the ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is a major cause of concern in the  use of biomaterial substrates. the adhesion of staphylococcus epidermidis strain  1938 was examined using image analysis and was found not to correlate with polymer surface tension, unlike that of lactobacillus acidophilus, which adhered  to more hydrophobic polymers. a fimbriated uropathogenic e. coli strain showed very low levels of adherence to the biomaterials. precoating the polymers with lactobacilli significantly reduced the staphylococcal and e. coli adhesion, a result which could have clinical significance. an additional finding was that the interaction of staphylococci and e. coli with lactobacilli coated polymers altered the adhesion profile of the latter. lactobacilli appeared to detach from  polymers of low surface tension and reattach to polymers with high surface tensions. this resulted in the highest levels of exclusion of uropathogens being  found for lactobacilli-coated glass and sulfonated polystyrene, both of which are hydrophilic (with high surface tensions). these results demonstrate that lactobacilli can be used to coat biomaterial surfaces leading to a reduced adhesion of uropathogens.

AB  == we examined the serum requirements for surface phagocytosis of staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli and for the subsequent chemiluminescent response of human neutrophils. substantial surface phagocytosis of s. epidermidis occurred in the absence of opsonins, although the presence of 10% pooled or heat-inactivated serum significantly increased phagocytosis. there was no significant difference between these opsonins, indicating that surface phagocytosis of s. epidermidis did not require complement. unopsonized e. coli were not as readily phagocytized as s. epidermidis (33% versus 57%). in contrast  to s. epidermidis optimal phagocytosis of e. coli required complement as 10% heat inactivated donor serum (hhs) was significantly less effective as an opsonin than 10% pooled healthy donor serum (phs). the time kinetics for phagocytosis of each  organism were similar, with most of the phagocytosis occurring in the first 10 min. the chemiluminescent response of neutrophils produced discrepant results. maximal chemiluminescence was observed when neutrophils were stimulated with bacteria opsonized in phs. the response to hhs-opsonized bacteria was less, and chemiluminescence to unopsonized bacteria was only marginally higher than the control, even though there was relatively good phagocytosis. these results define the opsonic requirements for surface phagocytosis of s. epidermidis and e. coli and indicate that although complement may not be required for phagocytosis, it is necessary for generation of a maximal oxidative burst, and thus may be essential  for efficient intracellular killing.

AB  == the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among staphylococcus epidermidis, staph. aureus and escherichia coli isolated in a university hospital, and the usage of antimicrobial agents within and outside the hospital was established for a seven-year period. the overall resistance to antimicrobial agents increased markedly for staph. epidermidis but remained constant for the two other species.  in staph. epidermidis, a pronounced increase was seen in prevalence of resistance to penicillin, sulphonamides, trimethoprim, erythromycin and chloramphenicol, whereas resistance to streptomycin and tetracycline decreased. the trends in usage of beta-lactam antibiotics were identical within and outside hospital as opposed to the use of erythromycin and sulphonamides. the highest degree of correlation between antimicrobial usage and resistance to an antimicrobial was obtained using a corrected figure for antimicrobial usage paying regard not only  to the use of a particular antimicrobial agent but also to a fraction of the usage of other antimicrobials which may co-select for the resistance trait.

TI  == evaluation of pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the treatment of thirty-nine cases of chronic osteomyelitis.
AB  == from october 1983 to october 1986, 39 patients with chronic osteomyelitis (of at  least two month's duration) were treated with either pefloxacin (n = 15), ofloxacin (n = 17), or ciprofloxacin (n = 7). the length of treatment ranged from 3 to 6 months; follow-up examinations were performed up until july 1988. the infecting bacterial strains (19 staphylococcus aureus, 2 staphylococcus epidermidis, 10 escherichia coli, 8 pseudomonas aeruginosa) were all sensitive to the quinolone prescribed. twenty-nine of the 38 evaluable patients had a satisfactory outcome at follow-up examinations 14 to 48 months after the end of treatment. fourteen of the 21 patients with gram-positive bacterial infections responded satisfactorily, as did 15 of the 17 patients infected by gram-negative  bacteria. nine cases of failure were observed (2 for pefloxacin, 4 for ofloxacin, 3 for ciprofloxacin). the infecting bacteria were staphylococcus aureus in six cases (3 on ofloxacin, 3 on ciprofloxacin). the infecting bacteria were staphylococcus aureus in six cases (3 on ofloxacin, 3 on ciprofloxacin), and staphylococcus epidermidis (ofloxacin), escherichia coli (pefloxacin), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (pefloxacin) in one case each. in all these cases, local conditions (presence of a foreign body in 5 cases, sequestra in 3, and post-radiotherapy necrosis in 1) could have been responsible for treatment failure. tolerance was good; adverse effects observed in the pefloxacin and ofloxacin groups disappeared after treatment was ended. bone levels varied but were always superior to the mic for the pathogen. in view of the satisfactory results, the possibility of oral administration, and the good tolerance, these quinolones should be considered as alternative agents for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis.

TI  == in vitro bacteriological study of a new hub model for intravascular catheters and infusion equipment.
AB  == we investigated in vitro the antibacterial properties of a simulated new hub model in which the female part has an antiseptic chamber through which the needle (male part) must pass before connection of the set and the catheter. to establish the time needed for disinfection, the magnitude of reduction of the contaminating inocula by the new hub model, and the antibacterial properties of the different components of the hub, we used needles contaminated with solutions containing high inocula (1.9 x 10(7) to 1.2 x 10(11) cfu/ml) of microorganisms involved in hub-related catheter sepsis. sterilization of the needles was accomplished by allowing them to remain in the antiseptic chamber for 10 s in all assays with staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and candida albicans. the rubber closures limiting the antiseptic chamber and the dilution effect of the antiseptic itself accounted for a minor part of the inoculum reduction achieved by the new hub model. this simulated hub provides good protection against endoluminal contamination. further studies seem warranted to prove its industrial viability and clinical efficacy.

TI  == randomized, double-blind comparative study of intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  == we compared intravenously administered ciprofloxacin with ceftazidime in a randomized, double-blind study. patients received ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours or ceftazidime 2 g intravenously every eight hours,  with placebo infusions to maintain blinding. therapy with metronidazole was added for suspected or documented intra-abdominal infection. thirty-two of the 57 ciprofloxacin-treated patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 34 sites. thirty-six of the 56 ceftazidime patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 38 sites. seven of 35 bacteremic patients had no identifiable primary focus. the most commonly isolated pathogens were escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and klebsiella pneumoniae. cure  rates and bacteriologic eradication rates were comparable. nine patients did not  improve. patients with treatment failures in the ciprofloxacin group included a quadriplegic patient with relapse of urinary tract infection with bacteremia (k.  pneumoniae). another patient with bacteremia (pseudomonas aeruginosa), pneumonia  (proteus vulgaris), and urinary tract infection (p. vulgaris, providencia sp.) died on the first treatment day. the third patient (s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia) had a new aspiration pneumonia develop on the third day; the pneumococcus also persisted. undrained s. pneumoniae empyema caused the fourth ciprofloxacin treatment failure, and the fifth patient had a relapse of s. aureus pneumonia with bacteremia. one ceftazidime-treated patient died of pneumococcal pneumonia on the first day. another had persistent staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria bacteremia despite 48 hours of treatment. two other patients had pneumonia (s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, respectively) and completed  full courses of ceftazidime therapy without improvement. five patients had pneumococcal bacteremia; four patients were cured: one of two patients in the ciprofloxacin group and three of three patients in the ceftazidime group. significant increases in the number of platelets (four patients with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) and declines in  the number of platelets (one patient with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) were observed. intravenously administered ciprofloxacin is comparable with ceftazidime and is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of patients with serious infections, including bacteremia.

TI  == ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. the spanish group for the study of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. according to the criteria of mccabe and jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. the clinical condition  of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or  good in 28. sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. the causative micro-organisms were: escherichia coli (18 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), salmonella sp. (seven episodes), enterobacter sp. (six episodes), proteus sp. (four episodes), serratia sp. (four episodes), haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), klebsiella sp. (three episodes), staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and morganella morganii (two episodes). overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). five organisms persisted: acinetobacter sp. (two patients), p. aeruginosa (one patient), enterobacter sp. (one patient), and serratia sp. (one patient). side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). superinfecting organisms and sites  were as follows: enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). ciprofloxacin administered either  intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.

TI  == immune response in patients with intraabdominal infections treated with imipenem. swedish study group.
AB  == in the present investigation the humoral immune response against isolated microorganisms in patients treated with imipenem was studied. sixty-six patients  (34 men and 32 women, 18-86 years of age) with suspicion of intraabdominal infections entered the study. five patients were excluded for various reasons and the remaining 61 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin 0.5-1.0 g t.i.d.  for 5-29 days (median nine days). three serum samples were taken from each patient, the first sample at admission, the second between three and seven days after the first dose of imipenem/cilastatin and the third between 14 and 31 days  after the first dose. one third of the patients had a malignant disease and the verified intraabdominal infections were judged to be severe in 23 and moderately  severe in 33 of the patients. fifty-six patients (92%) were cured and five patients (8%) were considered improved after the treatment. the immune response against isolated microorganisms was measured in the three serum samples by indirect immunofluorescence tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. among the aerobic microorganisms isolated escherichia coli (46 strains) staphylococcus  epidermidis (22 strains), streptococcus milleri (15 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (11 strains) dominated and among the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis (39 strains). thirty-two patients had significant immune responses against one or more of the isolated microorganisms. e. coli and b. fragilis gave  rises in antibody titers in 13 and 20 cases respectively, while significant titers against s. epidermidis were noticed in only three cases, against s. milleri in two cases and against e. faecalis in three cases.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  == in vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mics and the results of disk susceptibility tests. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at  an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the mic80s of imipenem (ipm) against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal mic distribution. however, the distribution of mics against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. group a streptococcus, enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by ipm at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. ipm inhibited escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a mic of 25 micrograms/ml, serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with mic greater than 100 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. indole (-) proteus and indole (+) proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the ipm disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and  also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. for the interpretation of the showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa ipm disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). with showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml  cannot be achieved. in this study, however, the differentiation of strains with mics less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set mic break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. according to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == deficient intracellular killing of bacteria by murine alveolar macrophages.
AB  == microbiologic methods were used to assess the in vitro phagocytosis and intracellular killing of various species of bacteria by freshly isolated murine peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. peritoneal macrophages showed effective phagocytosis of opsonized streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes, and moderate ingestion of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. alveolar macrophages were poor in phagocytosing opsonized s. pyogenes, s. aureus, and e. coli; ingestion of s. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. epidermidis was moderate. peritoneal macrophages killed 40 to 80% of these bacteria intracellularly, but alveolar macrophages showed almost no intracellular killing of bacteria. to find  out whether there is a correlation between the poor bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages and the oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms of these cells, we determined the uptake of oxygen and the release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by macrophages at rest and after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (pma) or opsonized s. aureus. upon exposure to these stimuli, peritoneal macrophages, but not alveolar macrophages, showed an increased uptake  of oxygen and release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. because alveolar macrophages contain surface active material (sam), we investigated the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria and the release of hydrogen peroxide by peritoneal macrophages pretreated with sam. the results showed reduced phagocytosis and impaired intracellular killing of s. epidermidis by these macrophages. the release of hydrogen peroxide by sam-pretreated peritoneal  macrophages upon stimulation with pma or opsonized s. aureus was equal to that of the control peritoneal macrophages.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

(1987) lancet ii, 514]. in the present communication the binding of bone sialoprotein to staphylococcal cells is characterized in more detail. 125i-labelled bone sialoprotein bound to suspended  staphylococcal cells in a time-dependent, saturable and reversible manner. binding was inhibited by unlabelled bone sialoprotein and by an amino-terminal cnbr fragment of bone sialoprotein that did not contain the eukaryotic cell-binding site. binding was furthermore inhibited by lysates obtained from escherichia coli lysogens carrying a lambda gt11 phage-encoding bone sialoprotein. in contrast, binding was not inhibited by a bacterial lysate from an osteopontin lambda gt11 lysogen, nor by n-linked oligosaccharide isolated from bone sialoprotein or by proteoglycan from rat chondrosarcoma containing clustered o-linked oligosaccharides of the same structure as those of bone sialoprotein. these results indicate that the major staphylococcal-binding site resides in the  bone sialoprotein core protein and not in the carbohydrate side chains. no inhibition of bone sialoprotein binding could be detected for whole human serum or purified plasma proteins such as fibronectin, fibrinogen and igg. likewise, staphylococcal protein a or rat collagen type i did not inhibit the binding of bone sialoprotein. the latter results indicate that the binding site for bone sialoprotein on staphylococcal cells was not any of the hitherto described staphylococcal cell-surface proteins. binding data indicated an average of 1000 bone-sialoprotein-binding sites/bacterial cell.

AB  == pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr, cs-807), a newly developed oral cephem, were carried out in the treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics. 1. since cpdx demonstrates very powerful antimicrobial actions against such gram-negative bacilli as escherichia coli, salmonella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia sp., such gram-positive cocci as streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing branhamella catarrhalis and haemophilus  influenzae, this drug was thought to be useful for the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases when main causative bacteria in the field of pediatrics were  taken into account. 2. when changes in blood and urine concentrations of cpdx following the administration of this drug at 3.7 mg/kg before meal were determined, cmax and t1/2 were found to be 2.98 micrograms/ml at 2-hour and 1.73  hours, respectively; an urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours and a maximum urine concentration were 32.5% and 52 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. clinically, 8 of 8 patients with the upper respiratory tract infections (100%), 28 of 29 patients with bronchitis and/or pneumonia (96.6%), 3 of 4 patients with otitis media (75%), 2 of 2 patients with sinusitis (100%), 3 of 3 patients with the skin soft tissue infections (100%), 1 of 1 patient with bacterial enteritis (100%) and 11 of 14 patients with urinary tract infections (78.6%) responded well to the treatment with cpdx-pr, showing a 91.8% efficacy rate in all the patients treated. 4. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, b. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, e. coli and salmonella typhimurium were all eradicated from 5, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, 11 and 1 patient, respectively. an eradication rate in all the patients examined was 97.5% (39/40). 5. gastrointestinal symptoms appeared as side effects in 2 of 71 patients (vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1), hence, an incidence of side effects was 2.8% (2/71). as for abnormal laboratory findings, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and increases in got and gpt were observed in 3 of 39 patients examined (7.7%), 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) and 2 of 34 patients (5.9%), respectively. in addition, we also examined the effect of the drug on the hemostatic system, but found no changes upon the treatment. based on these results, it appeared that cpdx-pr was a useful and safe drug in treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics when administered 2-3 times a day  at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg.

TI  == bacterial colonization of intravenous catheter materials in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == four different intravenous catheter materials, brands teflon, silastic, vialon, and tecoflex, were evaluated in vitro for bacterial adherence after 2 and 24 hours' incubation in trypticase soy broth and after 2 hours' incubation in nutrient-free phosphate buffer (ph 7.2). the organisms used were pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the significant differences in in vitro adherence of the different bacterial species to the various catheters were then evaluated in vivo by intravenous injection of a single bolus of 1 x 10(5) organisms via tail vein of rats with previously placed catheters in their superior venae cavae. there was no association between the in vitro bacterial adherence and the tendency of the in vivo catheters to become colonized. results of scanning electron microscopy of clean catheters and those removed from the rats showed obvious differences in surface characteristics and in clot adhesion between the catheters. these characteristics did not correlate with bacterial adherence in vitro or colonization in vivo. it is concluded that laboratory studies of bacterial adherence to, physical characteristics of, and thrombogenicity of intravenous catheters do not necessarily translate into resistance to clinical catheter sepsis.

TI  == bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin sc 47111 (ny-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  == the bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x mic)  and suprainhibitory (4 x mic) concentrations. five strains each of the following  microorganisms were studied: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by mics. however, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x mic and 4 x mic were tested. for many of  the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. the low mics seen for the gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x mic were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == il-1 induction-capacity of defined lipopolysaccharide partial structures.
AB  == natural and synthetic lipid a as well as natural and synthetic oligosaccharide partial structures of lps were examined in dose-response experiments to define the minimal structure necessary for il-1 induction and release in cultures of human mononuclear cells. wild type lps (s. abortus equi) and rough mutant lps was active in minimal-doses of 1 to 100 pg/ml, whereas synthetic heptaacyl and hexaacyl lipid a (salmonella minnesota and escherichia coli lipid a, respectively) induced il-1 in minimal-doses of 100 to 1,000 pg/ml and 10 to 1,000 pg/ml, respectively. nanogram amounts (0.1 to 10 ng/ml) of synthetic monodephospho partial structures of e. coli lipid a were necessary for il-1 induction. synthetic pentaacyl partial structures induced il-1 very weakly. synthetic tetraacyl and bisacyl partial structures lacking non-hydroxylated fatty acids were not active. compared to lps million-fold higher doses of natural and synthetic 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid containing core oligosaccharides were  necessary for il-1 induction. dose-response investigations with lps and natural or synthetic partial structures established the following hierarchy in il-1 induction-capacity: lps greater than lipid a much greater than lipid a partial structures greater than core oligosaccharides greater than oligoacyl lipid a. lipid a was shown here to be the portion of lps mainly responsible for induction  of il-1 activity. the high potency of lipid a in inducing il-1 release and the failure of the precursor ia of lipid a to induce il-1 production and release was  also observed measuring intracellular il-1 activity after freeze-thawing the cells. levels of il-1 beta mrna in extracts of mononuclear cells correlated with  biologic activity. in co-incubation experiments, precursor ia of lipid a produced dose-dependent inhibition of production and release of il-1 activity induced by lipid a or lps, but not by staphylococcus epidermidis or pha. incubation of cells with precursor ia for 1h, followed by a medium change and further incubation of stimulus without precursor ia of lipid a also resulted in inhibition. we conclude that lipid a is the main portion of lps responsible for induction of il-1, and that specific activation- and/or binding-mechanisms are involved in stimulation of cells with lps and/or lipid a.

TI  == adherence of microorganisms to breast prostheses: an in vitro study.
AB  == the quantitative and morphological characteristics of microbial adherence of four organisms--staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, escherichia coli and candida albicans--to the surfaces of different breast prostheses were observed. semiquantitative adherence studies based on a modification of maki's roll culture technique even after short contact times showed (1) increased microbial adherence at higher concentrations of the organisms and (2) differences in adherence properties between gram-positive bacteria and other organisms tested, noted also  at lower organism concentrations. scanning electron microscopy (sem) to identify  microorganisms on foam-covered prostheses, however, revealed organisms in the interstitial spaces that were not recovered by the plating technique. other features on sem were extracellular "slime" produced by s. epidermidis, which appears to act as a cement by which bacteria are held against prosthetic surfaces. these in-vitro findings suggest that brief exposure of the prostheses to a few organisms, particularly gram-positive bacteria, at the time of implantation would be sufficient inoculum for bacterial adherence to prosthetic surfaces.

TI  == bacterial infection: the main cause of acute cholestasis in newborn infants receiving short-term parenteral nutrition.
AB  == to test the hypothesis that bacterial infections are the main cause of acute cholestasis in short-term intravenously fed newborns, two groups were studied. group i consisted of 152 newborn infants who were fed intravenously for at least  7 days and in whom severe bacterial infections developed. group ii was formed of  92 newborn infants who were matched to the group i cases with respect to the year of birth, birth weight and gestational age, apgar scores, and duration of parenteral nutrition but who did not have infections. bacterial infections were diagnosed on the basis of impaired microcirculation with prolonged capillary filling time, a shift to the left in the white cell differential, and a positive  blood culture. cholestasis was diagnosed when the total serum bilirubin level was greater than 4 mg/dl and the conjugated fraction made up more than 40% of the total. the results were that all 40 cases of cholestasis were found in the first  group of infected infants. all of the other factors were distributed equally between both groups and could not be attributed as a major factor in the etiology of idiopathic neonatal cholestasis. the conclusion was that bacterial infections  are the main cause of acute cholestasis in intravenously fed newborn infants.

TI  == intra-abdominal sepsis after hepatic resection.
AB  == one hundred and thirty hepatic resections performed over an 8-year period were reviewed for evidence of postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis. of 126 patients who survived for more than 24 hours after operation, 36 developed culture positive intra-abdominal collections (28.6%). significant independent variables associated with the development of intra-abdominal sepsis were diagnoses of trauma or cholangiocarcinoma, and the need for reoperation to control hemorrhage  during the postoperative period. before 1984, infected fluid collections were treated predominantly by operative drainage, but this has largely been replaced by percutaneous methods, which have proven effective in most cases. eighteen (50%) of the infections were caused by a mixed bacterial culture, with streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli being the most common isolates. six patients with clinical signs of sepsis had a sterile fluid collection drained with complete relief of symptoms. this review suggests that intra-abdominal sepsis is a frequent complication after hepatic resection, and can often be managed successfully by nonoperative percutaneous drainage.

AB  == the prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from linko chang-gung memorial hospital (2,300 beds) in the period january 1985 to december 1986 and from taipei veterans general hospital (2,300 beds) during the period january 1986 to december 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) the isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were  gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) of these gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were enterobacteriaceae were enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious gram negative bacilli. (iv) the more common species among the members of enterobacteriaceae were escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). the other common species included enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii and proteus vulgaris. the frequencies of salmonella species and shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. the most common isolate among other glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli was aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). the finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in taiwan. (v) of these glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) pseudomonas species. (vi) the most common bacteria among fastidious gram negative bacilli was haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) of these gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) n. meningitidis. (viii) the more common isolates of gram positive bacilli included bacillus species and corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) of these gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of staphylococcus species and streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. the most common isolate among gram positive cocci was staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then s. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). the less common isolates were streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and s. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [prospective study of 75 episodes of sepsis in hemodialysed patients].
AB  == during a 38-month period the bacteremias developing in patients on hemodialysis from three centers of the barcelona area were evaluated to assess their incidence, characteristics, and response to therapy. in the overall 13376 months  of hemodialysis of the study, 75 episodes of bacteremia were detected in 64 patients; this amounts to an incidence of 5.6 episodes per 1000 hemodialysis months. the most common sources of becteremia were intravenous catheters (44%), which were mainly used as temporary vascular access, followed by the definitive vascular access (26%), the genitourinary system (10%), and the lung (6%). twenty-seven episodes of bacteremia developed in 24 patients in whom dialysis had been started in the two previous months (11% of the overall number of new patients), and, in them, 77% originated in an intravenous catheter, while this was the origin of bacteremia in only 23% of the remaining patients. 72% of bacteremias were caused by gram positive organisms, particularly staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis (60%), followed, in frequency order, by aerobic gram negative bacilli (25%), particularly escherichia coli and pseudomonas. stpahylococci were significantly associated with the vascular access, either if this was a catheter or not (81% of instances), while gram negative bacilli were associated with sources different from the vascular access  (48% of instances). severe complications included 2 cases of aortic valve endocarditis, one hemorrhagic shock caused by rupture of an infected vascular access, and one suppurative phlebitis associated with a hemodialysis catheter. staphylococcal sepsis was randomly treated with vancomycin or vancomycin plus gentamicin, without differences in the results.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == distribution and expression of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 gene among staphylococcus aureus isolates of toxic shock syndrome and non-toxic shock syndrome origin.
AB  == toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (tsst-1), plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of tss. tsst-1 production is subject to physiologic and environmental constraints. thus, dna probes that detect the chromosomal gene encoding the toxin are of value diagnostically, epidemiologically, and for studies of gene expression. several synthetic oligonucleotide probes complementary to two regions of the tsst-1 gene were used to ascertain the presence of this gene in the chromosomal dna of 261 strains of s. aureus from various tss-related and non-tss-related sources. isolates were from clinically confirmed menstrual and nonmenstrual cases of tss and from healthy vaginal carriers of s. aureus. other strains tested included clinical non-tss isolates and food poisoning-associated staphylococcal isolates. detection of the tsst-1 gene by the labeled gene probes correlated in all but two cases with production of tsst-1. ten centers for disease control (cdc) strains that were isolated from  tss patients and did not produce tsst-1 were also examined, as were several strains of staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from patients with suspected tss.  neither group of strains possessed the tsst-1 gene. finally, a 7-kilobase dna restriction fragment of s. aureus containing the entire tsst-1 gene was transformed into escherichia coli strains hb101 and dh5 alpha via a plasmid vector.

AB  == a survey of blood culture-confirmed neonatal septicaemia was carried out in seven delivery hospitals in 1981-85, for a second successive five-year period. the total number of cases was 377, to compare with 410 in the previous five-year period. group b streptococcus (gbs) was throughout the major pathogen (29%), followed by staphylococcus aureus (15%) and escherichia coli (14%), while staphylococcus epidermidis (10%) has emerged as a significant new causative agent. septicaemia with very early onset was predominant: 49% of the cases had onset within the first 24 hours; in the majority the symptoms were present from birth. gbs was responsible for 49% of the cases detected in the first 24 hours of life. the overall mortality was 20% as compared to 23% in the previous five-year  period, whereas in the very early onset septicaemia mortality was now 18%, down from the preceding 30%. despite the modest progress, gbs septicaemia with very early onset remains a significant problem, and effective preventive measures are  needed.

TI  == the deconjugation ability of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids in the blind loop syndrome with high 14co2 excretion--using the breath analysis technique and thin-layer chromatography.
AB  == five patients with blind loop syndrome (billroth ii) were examined by measuring 14co2 specific activity of expired breath samples taken at intervals after a meal containing glycine-1-14c cholate. the 5 patients tested showed a marked increase  of 14co2 specific activity. furthermore, the ability of deconjugation of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids in the efferent loop of these patients was tested by thin layer chromatography. the bacterial species identified from the samples were as follows: enterococcus, lactobacillus (l) buchneri, l. bifidus, l. brevis, eubacterium (e) lentum, bacteroides (b) vulgaricus, b. filamentosum, corynebacterium (c) granulosum, escherichia (e) coli, staphylococcus (s) epidermidis, and aerobacter (a) aerogenes. these species of bacteria, except e. coli and a. aerogenes, showed the deconjugation ability by which conjugated bile  acids in ox gall was hydrolyzed. administration of chloramphenicol (1g per day for 14 days orally divided doses) to the 5 patients reduced 14co2 specific activity significantly. on the other hand, 9 healthy men (control subjects) who were tested showed a flat curve, and 8 of the 9 had no growth of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids. the remaining healthy man showed an overgrowth  of e. coli and pseudomonas (p) aeruginosa, but the species did not have the ability of deconjugation. thus, we concluded that the patients with blind loop syndrome(billroth ii) had the bacterial overgrowth in the efferent loop that contained species with deconjugation ability, and, as a result the bacterial overgrowth contributed to causing abnormalities (increased deconjugation) in the  metabolism of bile acids in the small intestine. when the concentration of conjugated bile acids in the small intestine was reduced to levels below the critical micellar concentration by several factors, fat malabsorption and subsequent steatorrhea were induced (1,-4). furthermore, h. fromm and a. f. hofmann presented in vivo that the patients with blind loop syndrome had fat malabsorption and the patients who had a high 14co2 output after oral administration of glycine-1-14c cholate showed a low 14co2 output after oral administration of antibiotic drug (5,6). however, there has been no report on the deconjugation ability of bile acids of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids  in the efferent loop of patients with billroth ii who had positive breath tests.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == two related studies were done to determine the incidence of bacterial contamination in enteral delivery systems that were used for 15 and 7.5 hr, rinsed after each use, and reused daily in vitro for 7 and 5 days, respectively.  in the first study, systems infusing either a premixed formula (ensure) or a hand-mixed formula (vivonex) did not show bacterial growth until the 4th day, 1.0-2.0 x 10 colony-forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) of staphylococcus epidermidis. thereafter there was sporadic growth of different organisms but never increasing growth during the 7 days of infusion. in the second study, systems with ensure were initially contaminated with staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli and reused for 5 days. s. aureus was eliminated by rinsing, but  e. coli persisted in the delivery system at concentrations of 10(3)-10(6) cfu/ml. we conclude that clean enteral nutrition systems can be rinsed after short-infusion periods and reused up to 7 days in vitro without significant contamination; however, once a bag has become heavily contaminated some bacteria  cannot be eradicated from the system by rinsing.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) is a preparation containing cpz and sbt, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. the antimicrobial activity of sbt/cpz was stronger than that of cpz alone. this increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of sbt was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and mic values. the mic80 of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of cpz alone was 50 micrograms/ml. mic80s of sbt/cpz against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of cpz, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. however, mic80s of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and  proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of cpz alone, and mic80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which  contained 30 micrograms of cpz and 30 micrograms of sbt. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate mic values. to interpret results of the showa sbt/cpz disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than mic  less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml  less than mic less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points  of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of s. aureus, e. faecalis, and p. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to mics. however, if different break points against p. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of  mics. antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacteremia complicating acute leukemia with special reference to its incidence and changing etiological patterns.
AB  == over the 15-yr period, 1972-1986, 194 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 132 patients with acute leukemia at the third department of medicine, kanazawa university hospital, giving an incidence of 478 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. this incidence was at least twice as high as that in patients with chronic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma or aplastic anemia, and about 40-fold higher than that in patients with all other internal diseases. the  rate of occurrence of bacteremia, whether unimicrobial or polymicrobial, remained almost unchanged throughout the study period. the frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of the total isolates for the  first 10-yr period to 50% for the second 5-yr period. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in markedly decreasing frequency, but pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae in relatively constant frequency. the majority of p. aeruginosa isolates belonged to a limited number of o-antigen  groups, suggesting the possibility of nosocomial infection. on the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9 to 36%. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species, and staphylococcus aureus emerged as important pathogens. such a change in the spectrum of organisms was considered to coincide  with the common use of the so-called second- and third-generation cephalosporins  and central venous catheters. it is thus suggested that vancomycin be added to empiric antibiotic therapy, especially when gram-positive infections are clinically or microbiologically suspected, and that reducing the acquisition of p. aeruginosa from the hospital environment remains a priority in infection prevention.

TI  == in vitro quantitative model of catheter infection during simulated parenteral nutrition.
AB  == we developed a quantitative in vitro model of catheter infection. colonization was initiated by inoculating the catheter lumen with a small number of bacteria (approximately 5 x 10(3) viable organisms). then the inoculated catheters were used for simulated total parenteral nutrition therapy consisting of infusions for 9 h a day, and bacteria were counted in the effluent fluid against time, enabling us to monitor catheter colonization quantitatively. bacterial colonization of prosthetic devices is a progressive process, as evidenced by the slow day-to-day  increase of bacterial release seen here. on the other hand, bacterial strains of  various representative species exhibited significant differences in their ability to infect catheters. these results suggest that the in vitro model presented here is a reliable tool for monitoring the degree of catheter colonization under standardized conditions and could be used for further studying the main factors of catheter-related sepsis or the treatment of this information.

AB  == for many years now, the combination trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole (active ingredients of bactrim) has proved to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including beta-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, pneumococci, haemophilus influenza, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, proteus  vulgaris, klebsiella, enterobacter and citrobacter. in this comparative study, the antibacterial activity of the combination against 2,229 gram-negative and 1,338 gram-positive strains encountered in domiciliary practice was tested and compared with that of other commonly used antimicrobials. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined in microtitre plates using serial dilutions. with regard to the gram-negative strains, trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole, with an mic90 of less than 2 mg/l for most isolates, was the most active substance apart from norfloxacin. the combination also had a powerful inhibitory effect on gram-positive strains, the mic90 being between 2 and 4 mg/l  for all strains except staphylococcus epidermidis.

TI  == [the microbial factor in the chemiluminescence of the peripheral blood neutrophils of patients with suppurative surgical infection].
AB  == the luminol-dependent chemiluminescence of neutrophils in the peripheral blood of 30 healthy adults and 39 patients with the local and generalized forms of purulent infection was studied. nonstimulated chemiluminescence and the index of  chemiluminescence stimulation in the presence of opsonized staphylococcus aureus  added in vitro were determined. the former characteristic was found to be directly and the latter one, inversely related to the concentration of s. aureus, escherichia coli and candida albicans, but not e. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa or citrobacter, in the primary focus. at the microbial concentration exceeding 10(4) cells/g of tissue, the former characteristic was essentially higher than the level of chemiluminescence in healthy persons. with the improvement of the general state of the patients and in the absence of microorganisms in the wound as the result of complex treatment this characteristic decreased to values comparable with the reaction of neutrophils in healthy persons.

TI  == molecular cloning and genetic analysis of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase determinant from clostridium difficile.
AB  == a gene bank from a clinical isolate of clostridium difficile expressing high chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was constructed by cloning sau3a-cleaved clostridial dna fragments into the plasmid vector puc13. among 1,020 clones tested, 11 were resistant to chloramphenicol; 1 of these, with an insert size of 1.9 kilobases (pppm9), was studied further. the clone pppm9 was mapped using a variety of restriction enzymes, and a 0.27-kilobase ecorv-taqi restriction fragment was shown to be within the chloramphenicol resistance (cmr)  gene by using transposon (tn1000) mutagenesis. the 0.27-kilobase fragment and the 1.9-kilobase insert were radiolabeled and used as dna probes in hybridization studies. southern blot analysis with the gene probes against chromosomal dna from cmr strains of c. difficile obtained from five distinct geographical locations revealed that at least two copies of the same chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene were present for each strain. hybridization of the gene probes against cmr strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella edwardsii, escherichia coli, and to four other clostridial species revealed no homology even under conditions of low stringency.

TI  == ciprofloxacin activity in cyst fluid from polycystic kidneys.
AB  == renal cyst infection in patients with polycystic kidney disease (pkd) is often unresponsive to standard antimicrobial therapy, in part because of the failure of most antibiotics to adequately penetrate cyst fluid. ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic, possesses in vitro activity against most pathogens likely to be encountered in renal cyst infection. to study the potential usefulness of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of cyst infection, fluid from 70 cysts was obtained from seven patients with polycystic kidney disease who were receiving the drug. cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by the sodium concentration in the fluid. the ciprofloxacin concentration within cysts was measured, and the cyst fluid bactericidal activity against likely cyst fluid pathogens was determined. the mean (+/- standard error) ciprofloxacin concentration was 12.7 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml. preferential accumulation of ciprofloxacin occurred in gradient cysts; these levels exceeded levels in serum by more than fourfold. cyst fluid bactericidal activity titers were uniformly high against escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis, while less activity was observed against streptococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis.

TI  == comparison of translocation rates of various indigenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph node.
AB  == bacterial translocation is defined as the passage of indigenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal (gi) tract through the lamina propria to the mesenteric lymph nodes (mln) and other organs. we compared the relative abilities of various aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, and obligately anaerobic bacteria to translocate from the gi tract to the mln in gnotobiotic mice colonized with single strains of bacteria. indigenous gram-negative enteric bacilli translocated in large numbers to the mln, whereas gram-positive bacteria translocated at intermediate levels and obligately anaerobic bacteria at only very low levels. our results suggest that enteric bacilli such as escherichia coli, proteus, and enterobacter are associated with a higher incidence of bacteremia in debilitated  patients, because these bacteria translocate more efficiently from the gi tract than do other bacteria, especially obligate anaerobes.

TI  == efficacy of various methods of sterilization of acupuncture needles.
AB  == the iatrogenic transmission of hepatitis b virus by inadequately sterilized acupuncture needles recently has been reported. because some licensed chiropractors use acupuncture as a therapeutic modality, we have evaluated sterilization methods for these needles, which would be adaptable for use in a chiropractic office. dry heat, boiling water, pressurized steam, sodium hypochlorite, and 70% alcohol were compared with a glass bead dry heat sterilizer originally developed for dental instruments. presterilized acupuncture needles were contaminated with bacillus stearothermophilus, escherichia coli or staphylococcus epidermidis and sterilized for intervals ranging from 5 sec to 30  min. the needles were then cultured to determine the efficacy of the sterilization regimen. seventy percent alcohol was ineffective as a sterilization method. in terms of both time and convenience, the glass bead apparatus was the most efficient of the remaining methods tested. b. stearothermophilus-contaminated acupuncture needles were sterilized within 10 sec of exposure to preheated glass beads. less than 10 sec exposure killed e. coli and s. epidermidis. a significant advantage of the glass bead sterilizer over the other methods was the absence of physical damage to the needles.

TI  == late infections of total joint prostheses. a review and recommendations for prevention.
AB  == the incidence of late infection of total joint prostheses is 0.6%. because this incidence has increased from 0.08% in 1978, the authors reviewed their experience and the literature in search of pathogenetic and preventative measures. the most  common pathogen responsible for late prosthetic joint infections was staphylococcus (54%; both staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis),  even when infection was of dental origin. the three most common origins of infection were skin and soft tissue (46%), dental (15%), and urinary (13%). escherichia coli was the most common pathogen when the source was the urinary tract. mortality and cost calculations indicate that chemoprophylaxis is justified for dental procedures and probably also for other surgical procedures in organs containing microflora. prophylaxis must include antistaphylococcal drugs. the first generation cephalosporin antibiotics are recommended.

TI  == effect of ofloxacin on oral and gastrointestinal microflora in patients undergoing gastric surgery.
AB  == the effect of ofloxacin on the microflora in saliva, gastric juice, and feces was evaluated in 24 patients undergoing gastric surgery. a single peroral dose of 400 mg ofloxacin was given to each patient 2-4 h before surgery. the concentrations of ofloxacin in serum, saliva, gastric juice, and gastric mucosa tissue were assayed. only branhamella cocci were affected in the saliva. in the gastric juice, both the aerobic and anaerobic flora were suppressed on the day of surgery, but increased in number afterwards. there was a significant correlation  between gastric ph and the number of microorganisms isolated in the gastric juice on day 0. in faeces, the aerobic and part of the anaerobic flora were suppressed  by the administration of ofloxacin. ofloxacin was well tolerated by the patients. four of 24 patients developed postoperative complications. microorganisms isolated from wound sepsis and intraabdominal sepsis (three patients) were staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, hemolytic streptococci group a, streptococcus sp. and escherichia coli. all related infections occurred in patients with very low ofloxacin serum concentrations, probably due to impaired absorption. oral antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in patients in whom impaired gastric emptying can be expected.

TI  == the microbiology of multiple organ failure. the proximal gastrointestinal tract as an occult reservoir of pathogens.
AB  == the microbiology of infection acquired in the intensive care unit (icu) was studied prospectively in 205 consecutive patients admitted to a surgical intensive care unit. a multiple organ failure (mof) score was calculated for each admission. susceptibility to icu-acquired infection increased with increasing mof scores. while escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and enterococci were the most common isolates from infections present at the time of icu admission, staphylococcus epidermidis, candida, and pseudomonas dominated infections occurring in patients with high mof scores. mortality correlated highly with infection due to s epidermidis or candida and only poorly with infection due to pseudomonas or e coli; significant foci of invasive infection were frequently absent at autopsy. quantitative cultures of proximal gastrointestinal fluid in 16 of these patients showed candida, s epidermidis, and pseudomonas to be the most common isolates, and all but one patient colonized with these organisms had invasive infection with the same organism. the proximal gastrointestinal tract appears to be an important occult reservoir of the predominant pathogens in mof.

AB  == we have investigated relationships between patients' backgrounds and isolates from urinary tract infections in reference to various conditions, such as sexes,  age distribution by sex, species of causative organisms by sex, age distribution  according to species and types of infections, species and infections before and after treatment with antibacterial agents, and species and detected places. as for the relationship between sexes and types of infections, although simple urinary tract infections were consistently found at about 20% in men and at about 80% in women between 1981 and 1983, these infections were seen at 24.4% in men and at 75.6% in women in 1984, and at 26.6% and at 73.4% in 1985, indicating slight decreases in the ratio of women. by contrast, complex urinary tract infections were found in men at about 60-70% from 1981 up to 1985, regardless of  the presence or absence of indwelling catheter. there were no noticeable changes  according to age during this 5-year period in incidences of infections including  simple urinary tract infection and complex urinary tract infection with or without indwelling catheter. thus, backgrounds of patients with urinary tract infections, including sex, age and simple or complex infections, were fairly consistent throughout this period, while there were relatively large changes in species of isolates. enterococcus faecalis was isolated at about 8% of both men and women in 1982 and 1983, but its isolation rates were increased to 22.5% of men and 17.9% of women in 1984. in 1985 this species was isolated in 14.9% of men and 7.6% of women, and in 11.2% of all patients. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus spp. and enterococcus spp. were detected at rates of 3.2%, 8.1%, 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively, and 24.2% of isolated strains were gram-positive organisms. when species of isolates before treatment with antibacterial agents and their isolation rates were analyzed, it was found that the isolation rate of e. faecalis increased dramatically in 1983,  and that this tendency was still seen in 1984. the isolation rate of gram-positive organisms was 25% in 1984 and 24.3% in 1985. escherichia coli was consistently isolated at about 40%, but, as far as simple urinary tract infections are concerned, its isolation rate decreased by about 10% in 1985, compared to 1982 and 1983. these results suggested that causative organisms for simple urinary tract infections became similar to those for complex urinary tract infections. in other words, isolates obtained from complex urinary tract infections before treatment were similar to those of simple infections.(abstract  truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == signal blood culture system for detection of bacteremia in neonates.
AB  == in the signal (oxoid ltd., basingstoke, united kingdom) blood culture system, gas produced by bacterial metabolism displaces medium from the culture bottle into an upper reservoir via a hollow needle. displacement of media may provide a visual indication of the presence of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms in a single medium. the single-bottle signal system was compared with paired bactec 16b and 7d (johnston laboratories, inc., towson, md.) radiometric system bottles by using bacterial inocula and conditions which simulated those found in neonatal and pediatric populations. the single signal bottle was a good as the combined bactec media for escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus, but was slower for candida  spp., haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, group b streptococci, alpha-streptococci, and pneumococci. the signal system failed to detect four of five isolates of neisseria meningitidis and four of eight anaerobic organisms. the signal system is not suitable for neonatal blood cultures at its present state of development.

TI  == the value of prophylactic antibiotics during the insertion of long-term indwelling silastic right atrial catheters in cancer patients.
AB  == over a 3.5 year period from august 1982 to december 1985, 200 hickman catheters (evermed, medina, wa) were inserted into patients at the king faisal specialist hospital and research centre (kfshrc), riyadh, saudi arabia. one hundred sixty catheters were placed in patients with malignant disease, many of whom were immunosuppressed at the time of catheter insertion. seventy of 160 (44%) patients received prophylactic antibiotics and 90 (56%) did not. the mean age of each group was 23 years (range, 2 to 70 years), and the patients in each group were statistically similar in sex, underlying disease, and routine preoperative hematologic and biochemical evaluation. exit-site wound infections occurred in 50 of 90 (55.5%) patients who did not receive prophylaxis and in 12 of 70 (17%) patients who received prophylaxis (p less than 0.0001). there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of tunnel and incision site infections. the mean duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was 2.9 days (sd, 1.2 days). organisms cultured from catheter associated infections, included staphylococcus epidermidis 36, s. aureus 30, klebsiella pneumoniae 1, pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, escherichia coli 1, and diphtheroids non-cdc-jk 3. vancomycin was used as antibiotic prophylaxis in 64 patients, kefzol (eli lilly, indianapolis, in) in one, oxacillin in three, nafcillin in one, and septra (burroughs wellcome, research triangle park, nc) in one. the data indicate that the use of intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduces exit site infection and may reduce both tunnel and incision site infection. prophylactic antibiotic coverage should  be provided to patients during insertion of long-term indwelling right atrial catheters.

TI  == comparison of techniques for the selection of bacteria-free sperm preparations.
AB  == the authors compared the three most commonly used sperm preparation techniques--swim-up, fall-down, and percoll gradient--for their ability to recover highly motile sperm and minimize bacterial contamination. eleven human semen samples collected by masturbation were used and run in parallel with the three methods. a semiquantitative bacterial analysis was performed in all samples and results expressed in colony-forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml). the percoll gradient technique resulted in an average sperm concentration of 5.81 +/- 4.4 x 10(6) ml, and the average bacterial concentration dropped from 8.66 +/- 12.96 x 10(3) cfu/ml in semen to 0.01 +/- 0.03 x 10(3) cfu/ml. the bacterial count was not significantly different when the raw semen was compared with the swim-up or the fall-down preparations. the authors conclude that the percoll gradient method yields an adequate sperm concentration, with high motility and improved morphology, while eliminating bacterial contamination.

AB  == particulate fraction associated protein kinase activity was studied in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated by bacteria. staphylococcus aureus was found to increase particulate fraction associated protein kinase c activity in a  time and concentration dependent manner. the increase comprised both the phospholipid dependent and independent kinase activity and was augmented by addition of serum. similar observations were done using staphylococcus epidermidis and klebsiellae pneumoniae. however, escherichia coli only increased  the phospholipid independent kinase activity in the particulate fraction, which suggests the presence of protease activity.

TI  == endotoxin provocation of experimental renal cystic disease.
AB  == germ free rats provide a unique model in which to assess biological response to environment. in 48 germ-free male, sprague-dawley rats we examined the consequences of oral exposure to nordihydroguaiaretic acid (ndga), a nephrotoxin; to staphylococcus epidermidis and bacillus species, non-endotoxin-containing bacteria; to escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis, endotoxin-containing bacteria; and injected e. coli endotoxin on peripheral leukocyte counts and renal morphology. morphological changes were evaluated by light microscopy and scored blindly on a 0 to 4+ scale for 15 parameters of renal structure. means of these renal "pathology scores" correlated with counts of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. the highest counts and scores were found in rats given ndga and exposed to endotoxin, either by injection or by oral feeding of endotoxin-containing bacteria. counts and scores were lower in the absence of endotoxin and with non-endotoxin-containing bacteria, given alone or in combination with either ndga or endotoxin. results exclude bacterial colonization and intrarenal accumulation of ndga as causes of nephropathy. they indicate that endotoxin and ndga act synergistically to provoke renal damage in the germ free ndga-fed rat and suggest that leukocytes are involved in the process.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-807, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == cs-807 is a new oral prodrug of r-3746, a cephalosporin derivative, with potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to r-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. ninety percent or more of pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative proteus spp., providencia rettgeri, and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at  concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of staphylococcus epidermidis, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. pseudomonas aeruginosa and xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to r-3746. the activity of r-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. r-3746 was highly resistant to  hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of r-3746 at concentrations above the mic. r-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding  proteins 1, 3, and 4 of staphylococcus aureus and 1a, 1bs, and 3 of escherichia coli. systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of cs-807.

TI  == non-ige-dependent bacteria-induced histamine release from human lung and tonsillar mast cells.
AB  == a wide spectrum of formalin-killed bacteria have been tested for their ability to release histamine from human dispersed lung and tonsillar mast cells. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca and k. pneumoniae were the most effective histamine releasers. further studies on tonsillar mast cells showed that e. coli-induced histamine release differed from ige-dependent release with respect to its kinetics, temperature and ph profiles and its sensitivity to calcium deprivation and metabolic inhibitors. a lectin-mediated mechanism may operate, but other non-immunological mechanisms might also be involved in the release. escherichia coli and anti-ige did not synergize in inducing histamine release. the production of pgd2 and the failure to detect lactate dehydrogenase following incubation of mast cells with e. coli suggests that histamine release is not due to cytotoxicity.

AB  == fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (l-105, czon), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. antibacterial activities of czon against clinically isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and h. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox), cefoperazone (cpz), cefmetazole (cmz), cefotiam (ctm) and cefazolin (cez). czon was nearly as active as cez against s. aureus and s. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other gram-positive cocci. against gram-negative rods, czon was as active as cmx and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of czon at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. mean serum concentrations of czon at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. mean cumulative urinary excretion rates  within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2,  acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, uti 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with czon at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. the overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. no adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of got and gpt in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. these results clearly indicate the usefulness of czon in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == congenital and nosocomial sepsis in infants born in a regional perinatal unit: cause, outcome, and white blood cell response.
AB  == the incidence, cause, and outcome of sepsis and the white blood cell response were studied in 6315 infants born in a regional perinatal unit. the incidence of  neonatal sepsis was 6.5 per 1000 live births. congenital sepsis (12 cases) was overwhelming, with associated maternal infection (92%), neutropenia (75%), and high rate of mortality (50%). the most common organism was escherichia coli (58%). gestational age and birth weight were similar in survivors and nonsurvivors. there was a strong correlation between total white blood cell count and both mature and immature neutrophil counts in survivors but this correlation  decreased substantially in neonates that died. analysis of variance indicated that the means for polymorphonuclear leukocyte and immature neutrophil counts were significantly higher in survivors. nosocomial sepsis (38 cases) occurred in  premature low birth weight infants receiving invasive, intensive care. the most common organism was staphylococcus epidermidis (76%). total white blood cell, polymorphonuclear leukocyte, and immature neutrophil counts rose significantly in response to sepsis. none died. prevention of congenital sepsis requires methods to detect early maternal-fetal infection. providing granulocytes to neutropenic neonates with congenital sepsis might improve outcome.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. observation from mic and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of ceftizoxime (czx) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. czx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 0.20 microgram/ml. it was also active against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes with mic85 of  3.13 micrograms/ml. czx was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml.  czx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. the  reliability of czx disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter  discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of czx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the czx disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of czx, except against p. aeruginosa and e.  faecalis. for the interpretation of czx disc tests, a 3 category system has been  used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows: resistant (r) mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (ms) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

AB  == to evaluate peritoneal immunological defences and to find a possible cure for alterations in the mechanism, we studied the capacity of peritoneal dialysis effluent (pde) to opsonize bacteria and the phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages (pm). subjects were 40 uremic patients followed for a mean period of  36 months and 40 normal women who underwent laparoscopy (controls). opsonic capacity for s.epidermidis of undiluted pde from capd patients with low peritonitis occurrence (lpi) proved similar to that of 10% control serum. it was, however, noticeably inferior when patients were of high peritonitis incidence (hpi). in these cases igg concentration in pde was lower than in patients of lpi. a significant correlation was revealed between opsonization capacity for bacteria and igg concentration values in pde. we found inverse correlation between opsonic capacity of pde and number of episodes of peritonitis. phagocytic capacity of pm  from capd patients was similar to that of control pm when microorganisms were preopsonized by control serum. intraperitoneal immunoglobulin treatment raised pde opsonization capacity and lowered peritonitis incidence in patients of previously hpi, thus demonstrating the importance of abnormal organization in capd peritonitis and the possibility of preventing infections by intraperitoneal  immunoglobulin treatment. these prevention results do not occur with intravenous  immunoglobulin treatment.

AB  == a 5-year analysis comprising all positive blood culture isolates from a 222-bed university pediatric hospital in helsinki revealed 369 bacteremic but only 8 fungemic cases. haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus, 19% of the total material each, were the most common pathogens isolated, followed by s. epidermidis (11%), escherichia coli (8%), pneumococci (8%), and group b beta-hemolytic streptococci (6%). remarkable differences in distribution of the pathogens were observed in different hospital units. however, 5 most common microorganisms covered 62-86% of the spectrum in each unit. two bacteria, h. influenzae in the unit for infectious diseases and s. aureus in the hematology-oncology unit were significantly (p less than 0.001 or less than 0.01, respectively) more common than any other organism in those units. the average case fatality rate was 14% with a range from 1.5% to 40%, depending upon the causative agent isolated. also, the mortality was much higher in neonates than in other age groups. we conclude that by monitoring the blood isolates separately in each unit one can find remarkable differences in the same hospital. on the other  hand, characteristics of an individual hospital may vary significantly from those described in textbooks. these characteristics should be recognized and taken into account in the antimicrobial policy.

TI  == silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.

TI  == the incidence and clinical significance of intravenous fat emulsion contamination during infusion.
AB  == so that the actual contamination rate of intravenous fat emulsions, as well as the type of microbial contamination, could be quantified, 103 bottles of 10% fat  emulsion were collected near infusion completion from patients' bedsides. all samples were cultured and compared according to actual hanging time, in addition  to the amount and type of microbial contamination. recovered organisms included escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids, and micrococcus. sample analysis failed to demonstrate significant differences in extrinsic microbial contamination rate or organism multiplication between samples infusing  for less than or equal to 12 hr and those infusing longer. although these products support microbial growth, the contaminants introduced into the infusate  by environmental or touch contamination yielded minimal colony growth. no patient developed signs or symptoms of bacteremia during the study period. therefore, infusion of intravenous fat emulsion products over extended periods of time in this study did not increase the risk of developing infectious complications.

TI  == the comparison of myocardial dysfunction in three forms of experimental septic shock.
AB  == a rabbit model of septic shock was used to determine if myocardial dysfunction is a common component of shock due to diverse neonatal pathogens, and prostaglandins modulate septic myocardial dysfunction. the infusion of heat-killed escherichia coli (group i), haemophilus influenzae (group ii), or staphylococcus epidermidis  (group iii) produced significant decreases in the first derivative of left ventricular pressure with respect to time (p less than 0.05). each organism also  produced significant changes in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and heart rate, while pulmonary artery pressure was altered in groups i and iii. saline-infused control animals (group iv) exhibited no significant changes in any hemodynamic variable. blood gas variables were not significantly changed in any group. these cardiovascular changes appeared dependent on arachidonic acid metabolism since indomethacin pretreatment prevented the cardiovascular changes induced by bacterial infusion. these results suggest that septic myocardial dysfunction is a common component of gram-negative and gram-positive septic shock, and that myocardial dysfunction is modulated by prostaglandin products.

AB  == appropriately mixed, compatible solutions of glucose, amino acids and lipid have  recently become available for clinical use. while a single hyperalimentation solution has several advantages over the conventional two-bottle technique, its effect on infusion-related septicemia is unknown. an in vitro, mock infusion system identical to that used in our new-born intensive care unit was set up to assess the relative growth rates of three microorganisms in several parenteral nutrition mixtures. growth of staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli and candida albicans was measured in seven different alimentation solutions, including two combined solutions. generally, microbial growth was the same or decreased in combined solutions as compared to fat alone although considerably greater than that observed in nonlipid containing solutions. in addition, the ability of these organisms to pass in-line terminal filters of pore size 0.22 and 1.2 microns was assessed.

TI  == synthesis and biological activity of benzothiazolo[3,2-a]quinolone antibacterial  agents.
AB  == a new class of heterocyclic compounds with potent antibacterial activity, namely, 2-substituted amino-3-fluoro-5,12-dihydro-5-oxobenzothiazolo[3, 2-a]quinoline-6-carboxylic acids, is described. the compounds are conformationally restricted analogues of 7-substituted amino-6-fluoro-1-aryl-1, 4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids. compounds 7 and 10, having a 4-methylpiperazinyl and a piperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, respectively, possess in vitro antibacterial activities comparable to norfloxacin (15). compound 8, which has a 4-acetylpiperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, is active against gram-positive organisms and nearly inactive against gram-negative organisms. an efficient and short synthesis of this novel heterocyclic system via an intramolecular nucleophilic displacement cyclization reaction is reported.

TI  == microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  == the charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. all patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. the most common organisms cultured were: staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10  patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, enterobacter, 16  cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. the classic isolates, escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. to determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and s. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. the spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically  ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those  with acute peritonitis. despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dilute povidone-iodine solutions used for ocular surface disinfection in dogs.
AB  == bacterial cultures of specimens from healthy canine eyelids and ocular surfaces were found to demonstrate bacterial growth in 69.7% (53/76) of the eyes sampled.  organisms most commonly isolated included: staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus sp, s epidermidis, and escherichia coli. evaluation of dilute povidone-iodine solutions for effectiveness as ocular surface disinfectants was conducted. bacterial growth initially detected in 32 of 46 eyes was not detected  after disinfection with a 2-minute scrub and 2-minute soaking procedure, using 1:2, 1:10, or 1:50 dilutions of a povidone-iodine solution that contained 1% available iodine. the eyelid and ocular surfaces of 16 eyes were disinfected with 1:100 povidone-iodine solution. bacterial growth initially present in 10 of 16 eyes was present in 1 eye after disinfection and consisted of a single colony of  e coli. after eyes were disinfected with 1:10, 1:50, or 1:100 povidone-iodine solutions, there was no evidence of corneal epithelial edema or sloughing. in 15  eyes subjected to disinfection with the 1:2 dilution, one instance of epithelial  corneal edema was noticed. a 1:50 dilution of povidone-iodine is recommended as an ocular surface disinfectant for use in presurgical situations.

AB  == the adherent behaviour of the gram-positive staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and the gram-negative escherichia coli on cotton, polyester and their blends through contact in aqueous suspensions was studied. staphylococcus epidermidis was found to adhere to fabrics much more so than staph. aureus. the adherence of both staph. epidermidis and staph. aureus to fabrics increased as the content of polyester fibres in the fabrics increased. the attachment of e. coli to all fabrics was very low and was not affected by the fibre contents. total numbers of adherent bacteria on cotton and polyester fabrics were related directly to the concentrations of the bacterial suspensions. the extents of adherence, expressed by the percentage of adherent bacteria from the suspension, however, were independent of the concentration. the length of contact with bacteria was also found to affect the adherence of bacteria on fabrics studied.

TI  == plasmid-encoded trimethoprim resistance in staphylococci.
AB  == high-level (greater than 1,000 micrograms/ml) resistance to the antimicrobial agent trimethoprim was found in 17 of 101 (17%) coagulase-negative staphylococci  and 5 of 51 (10%) staphylococcus aureus from a number of different hospitals in the united states. resistance was plasmid encoded and could be transferred by conjugation in 4 of the 17 (24%) tpr coagulase-negative staphylococci and 3 of the 5 (60%) tpr s. aureus. a 1.2-kilobase segment of plasmid dna from one of the  plasmids (pg01) was cloned on a high-copy-number vector in escherichia coli and expressed high-level tpr (mic, 1,025 micrograms/ml) in the gram-negative host. in situ filter hybridization demonstrated homology between the cloned tpr gene probe and plasmid dna from each conjugative tpr plasmid, a single nonconjugative plasmid from a united states staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, a nonconjugative plasmid from an australian methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolate, and chromosomal dna from three tpr s. epidermidis isolates that did not contain any plasmid dna that was homologous with the probe. no homology was seen between the  probe and staphylococcal plasmids not mediating tpr, plasmid dna from 12 tpr s. epidermidis isolates not transferring tpr by conjugation, or plasmid-encoded tpr  genes derived from gram-negative bacteria. plasmid-encoded tpr appears to be a relatively new gene in staphylococci and, because it can be transferred by conjugation, could become more prevalent in nonsocomial isolates.

TI  == timentin in combination with tobramycin as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  == timentin (5.2 g tds) and tobramycin (40 mg tds) were administered to 51 patients  (22 male, 29 female, age range 17-72, mean age 40.4) with acute leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic crisis, severe aplastic anaemia and acute agranulocytopenia. all patients had neutropenia (pmn less than 1000/mm3) and fever (greater than 38 degrees c). febrile episodes consisted of 22 proved septicaemias due to gram-positive organisms (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus) in 11 cases and to gram-negative organisms (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, alkaligenes faecalis, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae) in 10 cases. one patient had a polymicrobial infection (p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, non-haemolytic streptococcus). twenty-nine infections were diagnosed only clinically. the mean duration of treatment was 11.1 days (range 4-20 days). eighty-seven per cent of evaluable febrile episodes  improved. among 11 infections due to gram-positive cocci, eight (72%) resolved, and in nine (90%) of ten cases due to gram-negative bacilli success was obtained. the polymicrobial infection also resolved. in only four patients were mild side effects seen, e.g. exanthema, pruritus, phlebitis: renal toxicity was not observed. these data suggest that the combination of timentin and tobramycin is an effective and safe empirical antibiotic regimen in febrile neutropenic patients.

TI  == bacterial adherence to vascular prostheses. a determinant of graft infectivity.
AB  == an in vitro model was developed to quantitatively measure bacterial adherence to  the surface of prosthetic vascular graft material. four strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, nonmucin-producing s. epidermidis [sp-2], mucin-producing s. epidermidis [rp-12], and escherichia coli) were used to inoculate expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (eptfe), woven dacron, and velour knitted dacron graft material. after graft specimens were incubated in a 10(7) suspension of bacteria, they were washed to remove nonadherent organisms and ultrasonically oscillated to dislodge adherent organisms. quantitative culture of the sonication effluent was  used to calculate bacterial adherence, expressed as the number of colony-forming  units found in each square centimeter of graft material per 10(7) inoculum. all bacterial strains had a greater affinity to velour knitted dacron graft than to eptfe (p less than 0.025). e. coli and s. aureus adhered to velour knitted dacron in greater numbers than to woven dacron (p less than 0.04). the production of extracellular polysaccharide (mucin) by the rp-12 strain significantly increased  adherence to both eptfe and dacron grafts compared with the other three bacterial strains tested (p less than 0.04). although e. coli was less adherent to eptfe than nonmucin-producing staphylococcal strains (s. aureus and sp-2), no difference in adherence to knitted or woven dacron graft material was demonstrated. the differential adherence of bacteria to prosthetic vascular grafts pays an important role in the pathogenesis of graft sepsis and determines  relative graft infectivity. the in vitro model developed is well suited for further study of the mechanisms by which bacteria adhere to and colonize vascular grafts.

TI  == survey of disc diffusion antimicrobial sensitivity testing in avian bacteriology  laboratories and the evaluation of a standardised method.
AB  == a survey was conducted in which 15 laboratories involved in avian bacteriology tested the antimicrobial sensitivity of cultures of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, alcaligenes faecalis and salmonella typhimurium, using the disc diffusion test as routinely practised in each laboratory. up to 28 different antimicrobials or antimicrobial combinations were used. the most commonly tested agents were ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, furazolidone, neomycin, streptomycin, sulphonamide, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulphonamide. results between laboratories were compared according to the width of the zone of inhibition (annular radius) where 5 or more laboratories used the same disc content of a particular antimicrobial agent, and  on whether a culture was interpreted as being sensitive or resistant to a particular agent. the variation in annular radii about the mean values were less  than +/- 2 sd in 39.5% and greater than +/- 3 sd in 32.6% of 43 different antimicrobial/culture combinations involving 8 different agents. the range of annular radii measurements was greatest with trimethoprim/sulphonamide and streptomycin discs and with the s. epidermidis culture. variation in the interpretation of test results was greatest with the gram-negative bacteria, where for each of the more frequently tested agents at least one, commonly 2 and  sometimes all 3 cultures were reported as sensitive and resistant to the same agent by different laboratories. the calibrated dichotomous sensitivity (cds) test of bell (1975, 1984) was evaluated as a standardised disc diffusion procedure and was found to be reproducible and accurate. results obtained using antimicrobial agents calibrated for use in the cds test were compared with results obtained in the survey using the same agents or agents showing identical  resistance patterns.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a disinfectant (2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether: irgasan, ciba-geigy) was incorporated into plastic washers fabricated from ethylvinyl acetate (eva), polyethylene, polypropylene or tpx. plastics containing 0.2 and 2% irgasan gave zones of inhibition on nutrient and blood agar plates seeded with micro-organisms (staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis or candida albicans) even after thorough washing. exceptionally, c. albicans was  inhibited only by 2% irgasan, and eva gave good inhibition only against the staphylococci. similar washers of each plastic were implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of rabbits; before insertion each was washed, had thread woven into it and was surrounded by a plasma clot containing 2 x 10(8) staph. aureus. all the plastics without irgasan gave rise to abscesses, none of the plastics impregnated with 2% irgasan did, though from 2 out of 12 sites small numbers of staph. aureus were isolated at post mortem. using either clinical or bacteriological criteria,  the results were highly significant (p less than 0.00001 and p less than 0.001 respectively), demonstrating the effectiveness of this technique in preventing plastic-associated infection.

TI  == in-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.

TI  == bacterial colonization of hemasite access devices.
AB  == vascular access ports (hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. all were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. one hemasite from which staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. another hemasite from which  proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting  of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular  products. this direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the  resolution of the associated infection.

TI  == does the hygroscopic property of the laminaria tent imply a risk for ascending infection in legal abortions? a microbiological study.
AB  == in 53 women admitted for first-trimester abortion, the cervical canal was dilated with laminaria tents prior to vacuum aspiration. before insertion of the tents, endocervical specimens were taken for microbiological investigations, including chlamydia trachomatis, and both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. the laminaria tents, widened by their hygroscopic properties, were removed just before the vacuum aspiration and sent for cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. the gram-positive aerobic cocci, staph. epidermidis, strept. faecalis and strept. agalactiae as well as escherichia coli and klebsiella/enterobacter were the most frequent microorganism among the aerobic isolates from the endocervices as well as from the laminaria tents. these microorganisms were identified on the tents in greater numbers than in the cervices. staph. aureus was isolated from three laminaria tents, but only one of  these 3 women was proved to be primarily colonized endocervically. among the anaerobes, bacteroidaceae followed by peptococci and peptostreptococci were the predominant genera found in the cervix as well as on the removed laminaria tents. these three groups of anaerobic microorganisms were found markedly less frequently on the laminaria tents than in the endocervix. on the other hand, strept. intermedius, another anaerobe of possible enteric origin, was recovered from 9 laminaria tents but not in the cervices. since no cases of clinically verified endometritis/salpingitis were registered in the present study it is concluded that the risk of a pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) due to the laminaria tent is negligible as long as the laminaria treatment does not exceed 24 hours.

AB  == the adherence to eukaryotic cells of escherichia coli, neisseria gonorrhoeae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and the yeast candida albicans was studied by light microscopy with an in vitro micromethod involving different cell lines. the method is inexpensive, consumes little time and material, and is reproducible. it was used to show that the gram-positive cowan i strain of s. aureus, which naturally forms protein a on its surface, adheres in much larger numbers to human lung fibroblasts than the protein a-free wood 46 strain, the strain of s. epidermidis, and the encapsulated smith strain. the presence of a capsule on the latter strain apparently prevented its attachment to the fibroblasts. among the gram-negative species studied, a piliated clinical isolate of n. gonorrhoeae, displaying the opaque colonial phenotype, adhered in larger numbers than another isolate lacking pili and displaying the transparent phenotype. e. coli k12 attached slightly to the cell line, whereas p. aeruginosa adhered to it moderately. one strain of c. albicans tested did not attach in any detectable numbers. no clear correlation between bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity, as evaluated by the hexadecane assay, and  adherence to eukaryotic cells could be demonstrated for these microorganisms. with our method, bacterial attachment proceeded best at 37 degrees c and did not  require more than 1 h of contact with the cell monolayer. the method described revealed differences in the adherence to eukaryotic cells, not only among species, but also between strains of the same species.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. the activity of ofloxacin was two  to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was more active against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp., legionella spp., and bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin,  enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with s. aureus, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa. ofloxacin strongly inhibited dna supercoiling activity of dna gyrase purified from e. coli kl-16. there is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and  its inhibitory action against dna gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of e. coli. these results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against dna gyrase in bacterial cells.

TI  == microbial adhesion to fibronectin in vitro correlates with production of endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  == microbial adhesion to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (nbte) is an important early event in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. fibronectin is a ubiquitous mammalian glycoprotein with diverse functions which binds to certain bacteria but not to others. in this study, we determined that fibronectin is present on the surface of nbte (after catheter-induced aortic valve trauma) but not on normal rabbit cardiac valvular endothelium. the adhesion of various bacteria and yeasts to human fibronectin in tissue culture wells was then measured. microorganisms with a high isolation frequency from endocarditis cases (staphylococcus aureus, candida tropicalis, c. albicans, streptococcus faecalis, s. sanguis) bound significantly better (p less than 0.01) to fibronectin in vitro than other organisms (escherichia coli, c. krusei, pseudomonas aeruginosa) rarely implicated in this disease. microbial adhesion to  fibronectin correlated closely with the propensity of each organism to produce endocarditis in rabbits (e.g., id50) with preexistent nbte. a similar distribution was noted after binding of soluble radiolabeled fibronectin to bacteria in suspension. the results suggest that fibronectin, expressed on the surface of nbte, may mediate microbial adhesion of circulating organisms to initiate colonization during the early pathogenesis of infective endocarditis.

AB  == the potential of octenidine hydrochloride (win 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. semilogarithmic survival curves were  plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against staphylococcus aureus. the microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and candida albicans. death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microm (0.94 microgram/ml)  caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and e. coli and c. albicans were the least susceptible. octenidine was more active than  chlorhexidine against each test strain. skin-degerming activities of aqueous and  formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. aqueous  octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.

TI  == further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  == various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21). taking the specific tk activity of escherichia coli k12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific tk activities. in the gram-positive cocci, staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of strep. pyogenes (29%). neisseria sicca, a gram-negative coccus, lacked tk. gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (bacillus, 13-51%; clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of b. megaterium (2%) and c. difficile (1-3%). among the gram-positive asporogenous rods, listeria monocytogenes and six species of lactobacillus (especially l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. lactis and l. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). of the species of pseudomonas studied, most  lacked tk but ps. fluorescens and ps. maltophilia had significant tk activity (15-53%). of the gram-negative facultative anaerobes, vibrio lacked tk, while enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella (148-1120%), escherichia (59-141%), klebsiella (78-299%) and serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'pr. rettgerella' (307%). propionibacterium and bifidobacterium and related organisms other than streptomyces, nocardia, rhodococcus, corynebacterium and mycobacterium lacked tk. the seven species of candida tested, and cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked tk.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bovine neutrophils ingest but do not kill haemophilus somnus in vitro.
AB  == phagocytosis of haemophilus somnus by bovine blood neutrophils required opsonization of the bacteria with antibodies against h. somnus. few bacteria were phagocytosed in the absence of serum; in addition, absorption of immune serum with formalin-killed h. somnus significantly reduced ingestion of h. somnus. heat inactivation of antiserum (56 degrees c for 30 min) to eliminate complement activity had little effect on its ability to opsonize h. somnus for uptake by bovine neutrophils. antiserum from an h. somnus-immunized calf and autologous sera from adult cattle supported equivalent phagocytosis of h. somnus by bovine neutrophils, suggesting that normal, healthy cattle may contain sufficient antibodies in their sera to facilitate phagocytosis of h. somnus. although bovine neutrophils readily ingested h. somnus, they were unable to kill the bacterium in vitro. these same neutrophils readily killed opsonized escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that h. somnus is able to survive and perhaps multiply within bovine neutrophils. because bovine neutrophils stimulated with opsonized h. somnus demonstrated a reduced oxidative burst (as measured by chemiluminescence) compared with neutrophils stimulated by opsonized e. coli, we  suggest that reduced production of reactive oxygen intermediates during the phagocytosis of h. somnus may account, in part, for the enhanced survival of h. somnus in bovine neutrophils.

TI  == infection control during parenteral nutrition therapy.
AB  == parenteral nutrition therapy can achieve an anabolic state in patients who are unable to maintain normal nitrogen balance; however, it may be associated with infectious complications. infections may be related to contamination of the cannula and the cannula wound, of the infusate, or of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. a variety of microorganisms has been associated with these infections. the exact mechanisms that initiate cannula-related infection are poorly understood. susceptibility of the host, the method and site of cannula insertion, colonization of parenteral nutrition cannulas, use of parenteral nutrition systems for multiple purposes, cannula material, and other factors may  all play some role. controlling infections depend on many factors, including quality control processes to ensure sterility of parenteral nutrition solutions,  attention to aseptic technique during cannula insertion, procedures to prevent in-use contamination, proper care of the cannula insertion site, and proper management of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. in addition, infectious complications appear to be reduced by an organized team that follows infection control protocols. many facets of parenteral nutrition therapy are based on data from uncontrolled clinical investigations. well-designed, controlled clinical trials may provide data that will further minimize the risks  associated with parenteral nutrition therapy.

TI  == infectious complications and cost-effectiveness of open resuscitation in the surgical intensive care unit after cardiac surgery.
AB  == from july, 1982, to may, 1984, 2,412 patients underwent cardiac surgery. open resuscitation through a midline sternotomy was performed in the surgical intensive care unit (sicu) 88 times in 64 patients one minute to 10 days after admission. there were 49 initial survivors; 31 patients had primary closure in the sicu (group 1), and 18 patients had delayed closure (group 2). in group 1 there was 1 death. wound infection developed in 2 of the 30 survivors--escherichia coli in 1 and staphylococcus epidermidis in 1. the latter  required subsequent debridement. in group 2 there were 8 survivors and no wound infections. fifteen patients could not be resuscitated because of ventricular arrhythmia (13%), asystole (33%), cardiogenic shock (47%), and tamponade (7%). only 2 of 38 patients, or 5%, experienced wound infections. this study demonstrates that open resuscitation in the sicu is a safe, rapid, and cost-effective procedure that will allow earlier intervention, diagnosis, and treatment. in no instance was death attributed to wound infection, and at our institution, this method resulted in cost savings of more than $1,000 per patient.

TI  == the influence of skeletal implants on incidence of infection. experiments in a canine model.
AB  == we have performed experiments in 187 dogs in order to evaluate the effect of commonly used implant materials on rate of infection. we opened the femoral canal with a hand drill and awl, instilled a suspension of bacteria, and then inserted  one of the implants. the implants--stainless-steel and cobalt-chromium alloys, high-density polyethylene, prepolymerized polymethylmethacrylate, and polymethylmethacrylate polymerized in vivo--were compared with no implant (control). the effect of the different implants on the incidence of infection with staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli was  compared by determining the number of bacteria required to produce infection in 50 per cent of the femora. all of the implants were significantly more likely than the controls to be associated with infection with staphylococcus aureus. polymethylmethacrylate polymerized in vivo was found to be significantly more likely than all other implants to be associated with infection with escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. in addition to evaluating all specimens bacteriologically, we carried out a histological evaluation, and found that infection was highly correlated with an increased inflammatory response for all three bacteria. however, even with this highly statistically significant correlation, the correlation was not absolute; when only limited portions of randomly selected specimens of tissue were examined, the correlation was reduced.

TI  == role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  == experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or hemophilus influenzae. the third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. cefotaxime has produced high cure  rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or h. influenzae. several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, or h. influenzae. moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. of 14 patients with pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by enterobacter, serratia, or acinetobacter. more, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.

AB  == the multilamellar lecithin-cholesterol liposomes entrapping carboxyfluorescence as a specific marker were prepared to be incubated with mycobacteria. the extent  of resulting liposomal lysis was measured by marker release. mycobacteria were highly active in this respect regardless of the species. staphylococci were much  less active and e. coli was completely inactive. molecular species of lecithin and their ratio to cholesterol were related with the liposome sensitivity to mycobacteria. ultrastructural and biochemical study showed that liposomes can be  in close contact with mycobacteria and lecithins are degraded so that released fatty acids are incorporated into bacterial lipids, especially in virulent species. liposomes-mycobacteria interaction was discussed as a partial model of the phagocyte-parasite interaction at the membrane level.

TI  == recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  == recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. the survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. all species survived well or grew in serum. haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and group a streptococci were killed in all urine samples. the number of colony-forming units of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus and group b streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. these data suggest  that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.

TI  == culture of the surfaces of urinary catheters to sample urethral flora and study the effect of antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == at the time indwelling urinary catheters were removed, the urethral flora was sampled by rolling the catheters onto culture plates. cultures were obtained from 398 patients with sterile urine. catheter surfaces were colonized less often in males than in females (16.8 and 67.0%, respectively) and yielded correspondingly  fewer bacterial species per catheter. in both sexes, gram-positive species were isolated more frequently than gram-negative species (428 and 131 isolates, respectively). the bacteria most commonly isolated were staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis. staphylococcus saprophyticus was not recovered despite the large proportion of young, sexually active women in the study population. gram-negative bacteria, mainly escherichia coli, gradually colonized the catheters over time but at all times were recovered in lower amounts the gram-positive organisms and less often in males than in females. slime production by coagulase-negative staphylococci did not relate to the density of organisms recovered from the catheters or influence the presence of gram-negative bacteria. despite frequent use of antibiotics in this population, the urethral flora remained highly susceptible to these drugs. antibacterial activity was not detected on the catheters despite high concentrations in the urine. this suggests that systemic antibiotics have a very limited effect on resident urethral flora. despite relatively small numbers in the urethra, gram-negative bacteria readily produce urinary tract infections in catheterized patients.

TI  == antimicrobial therapy of bacterial sepsis in the newborn infant.
AB  == septicemia continues to be an important cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. the bacteria most commonly responsible are group b beta-hemolytic streptococci and escherichia coli, but regional differences exist. recently sepsis caused by staphylococcus epidermidis has occurred with increasing frequency in several neonatal intensive care units. other organisms are less commonly responsible. the choice of antibiotics for suspected sepsis is based on  the possible organisms involved and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns, which vary from hospital to hospital and at different times in the same hospital. currently recommended initial therapy consists of a penicillin and an aminoglycoside, usually ampicillin and gentamicin. the addition of vancomycin is  indicated when staphylococcal septicemia is suspected. during outbreaks of neonatal sepsis caused by aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative bacteria, the use of third-generation cephalosporins or acylaminopenicillins may be appropriate, depending on the results of susceptibility tests. continuing efforts to develop antibiotics for the treatment of neonatal sepsis are warranted.

TI  == effect of fibronectin on adherence of staphylococcus aureus to fibrin thrombi in  vitro.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus binds to purified fibronectin in solution and may bind to fibronectin present in wound tissue. when incorporated into a solid fibrin thrombus, however, plasma fibronectin may fail to bind s. aureus, because the s.  aureus-binding sites on fibronectin may be occupied by fibrin. both s. aureus and fibrin bind to the same 27-kilodalton amino-terminal fragment of fibronectin. to  determine whether fibronectin incorporated into fibrin still promotes the adherence of s. aureus, we clotted citrated normal plasma and fibronectin-depleted plasma onto petri dishes. we then measured bacterial adherence to these in vitro fibrin thrombi. we found that the adherence of five of seven s. aureus strains decreased significantly (by 26 to 58%) when fibronectin had been depleted from the fibrin thrombi. adding fibronectin back reversed this decrease in adherence. the reversal was dose dependent; the increase was in proportion to the amount of fibronectin added back to the plasma. bacteria known not to bind to fibronectin (escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis) adhered 100-fold less than s. aureus, and their adherence was unaffected by the absence of fibronectin in the fibrin thrombus. we conclude that fibronectin incorporated into solid fibrin thrombi does mediate the adherence of  most s. aureus strains to fibrin thrombi. fibronectin may be an important molecule that mediates the adherence of s. aureus to fibrin in wounds.

AB  == a group of 27 female and 2 male urological patients, aged 19 to 80 years (mean 44 years), were treated with intravenous temocillin 500 mg twice daily for 5 to 7 days. the diagnoses were acute pyelonephritis (n = 20), acute cystitis (n = 6), and acute cystitis and pyelonephritis combined (3). the causative organisms were  escherichia coli (n = 20). proteus species (n = 9). klebsiella species (n = 4). streptococcus faecalis (n = 2). staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 1), and providencia stuartii (n = 1). 27 of the 29 patients (93%) were clinically and bacteriologically cured; bacteriuria persisted in 2 patients with prolonged obstructive uropathy. in acute non-obstructive pyelonephritis, the urinary excretion of beta-2-microglobulin rapidly decreased, documenting a prompt renal tubular restitution during therapy. the drug was well tolerated and proved very safe with regard to haematological, hepatic and renal parameters. also, candida haemagglutination titres did not increase significantly during therapy. temocillin therapy should preferably be commenced after the results of the urine  culture are available.

AB  == fortimicins are bicyclic aminoglycoside antibiotics that contain a fortamine moiety instead of the deoxystreptamine found in other aminoglysides. fortimicin a had a bactericidal effect on escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis and  was found to inhibit protein synthesis in vivo. in vitro, fortimicin a inhibited  polyuridylic acid-directed phenylalanine polymerization and induced misreading, as shown by leucine incorporation. in contrast, fortimicin b had no effect on either polymerization or misreading. in assays programmed with natural mrna, only a weak polymerization inhibition effect was observed with fortimicin a, whereas a strong stimulation was seen in the presence of fortimicin b. both fortimicins a and b inhibited dissociation of 70s ribosomes into their subunits and neither was able to displace [3h]dihydrostreptomycin, [3h]tobramycin, or [3h]gentamicin from  their respective binding sites on the 70s particle.

AB  == the intradermal injection of 140 micrograms of propionibacterium acnes (cn 6134)  into the ears of female sprague-dawley rats produced a chronic inflammation with  formation of acneiform lesions. inflammation was characterized by more than a doubling of ear thickness at 24 h and a peak of 3-4 times control levels at day 21. at 42 days post injection ears were still 3 times normal thickness. histologically there was early polymorph accumulation giving way to macrophages and lymphocytes by day 7. pilosebaceous follicles overlying the inflamed area lost their sebaceous glands and became hyperplastic cords of cells that grew down and encapsulated inflammatory loci. by day 9 many of these follicles had become secondary comedones. three isolates of p. acnes from inflammatory acne lesions and 4 of 5 isolates from non-acne patients produced results similar to that of the strain cn 6134. in these cases the number of histologically evident secondary comedones was correlated with ear thickness. in contrast, samples of streptococcus lactis, escherichia coli b, and staphylococcus epidermidis failed to produce this combination of chronic inflammation and high lesion count. benzoyl peroxide, tetracycline, erythromycin, phenidone, naproxen, and cis and trans retinoic acid were inactive as inhibitors of p. acnes cn 6134-induced ear thickening. the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide produced dramatic suppression of inflammation, but upon cessation of treatment the ears returned to inflamed levels. the specificity for p. acnes, the formation of acneiform lesions, and the recalcitrance of the inflammation suggest our model is indeed relevant to acne.

TI  == antimicrobial agent susceptibility patterns of bacteria in hospitals from 1971 to 1982.
AB  == bacterial susceptibility to 16 commonly used antibiotics was analyzed for a 12-year period (from 1971 to 1982, inclusive). susceptibilities of 5,828,243 strains isolated from a mean of 242 hospitals nationwide and of 194,575 strains isolated at the massachusetts general hospital, boston, mass., and the bronx lebanon hospital center, new york, n.y., were compared. strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed virtually the same susceptibilities to antibiotics throughout the 12-year  period, whereas streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant increases in resistance to most antibiotics. the close similarity between antibiotic susceptibilities shown at both the 242 hospitals and the 2 individual hospitals suggests that this analysis accurately reflects trends of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in u.s. hospitals. since most of the species  analyzed produce serious disease and high mortality, their susceptibility to antibiotics is relevant both to physicians treating infectious diseases and to epidemiologists.

[3h]thymidine incorporation into bacterial, but not fibroblast, dna was efficiently and promptly inhibited by the antimicrobial polypeptide preparation. this suggests that its main target is a component of the system, which catalyzes and regulates the biosynthesis of bacterial dna.

TI  == relationships between linear type scores, objective type measures, and indicators of mastitis.
AB  == objectives were to examine the usefulness of objective measures of conformation and linear scores for type for predicting indicators of mastitis. approximately 300 cows in five herds were scored in the experimental linear classification program of the holstein-friesian association of america, measured objectively for numerous components of conformation, and evaluated for four indicators of mastitis. indicators of mastitis were average natural logarithm of somatic cell counts during the lactation, percent of samples (taken approximately every 3 mo)  infected during a lactation, percent of samples infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella, and percent of samples with signs of mastitic milk. relationships between conformation and mastitis often were inconsistent because of moderate or low correlations between  indicators of mastitis. indicators of mastitis were predicted from results of multiple regression analyses with subjective scores and objective measures of type as independent variables. largest differences of predicted indicators of mastitis from variation in any single type trait were sufficient to be important  economically, but average differences were much smaller. selection to reduce frequencies of cows with deep udders, especially low rear udders, widely placed teats, rear teats too far back, and teats that are short and wide, may augment, modestly, efforts to reduce incidence of mastitis through improved sanitation, antibiotic treatment, and proper milking procedures.

TI  == current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  == the mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. most resistance currently seen is the  result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. however, extensive use  of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. s. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. streptococcus fecalis has  become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol  transacetylase has been encountered. beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of serratia marcescens and pseudomonas  aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.

AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis peritonitis frequently complicates the clinical course of patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd). since  bacterial opsonization is critical to the effective defense of the peritoneal cavity by phagocytic cells, we prospectively evaluated the opsonic activity of peritoneal dialysis effluent obtained from 17 capd patients during 102 patient months. samples of peritoneal dialysis effluent contained concentrations of opsonins against s. epidermidis that were less than 2% of that observed in serum. moreover, heat-labile opsonic activity against escherichia coli was absent from all dialysis effluents. during the study, there were ten episodes of peritonitis  in nine capd patients (1 per 10.2 patient months). s. epidermidis was isolated in seven episodes, a gram-negative bacillus in one, and two episodes were culture negative. the incidence of s. epidermidis peritonitis was 1 per 62 patient months in the patients with "high" peritoneal dialysis effluent opsonic activity against s. epidermidis but was nearly tenfold greater in patients with "low" opsonic activity (1 per 6.7 patient months). we conclude that peritoneal dialysis effluent opsonic activity predicts which capd patients are at an increased risk to develop s. epidermidis peritonitis.

AB  == the cervical-vaginal bacterial flora of 57 patients with invasive carcinoma of the cervix were found to be identical to those reported in studies of different population groups, except for a lower frequency of anaerobic bacteria. radiation  suppressed significantly both the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. following 4,000 rads of external irradiation, 47.4% of the cervical cultures were bacteriologically sterile. during the first and second radium treatment, 21% and  25.5% of the patients respectively developed fever of 38 degrees c or more, the cause of which could not definitely be established. the significance of fever during radium treatment is discussed.

TI  == polyamino acid enhancement of bacterial phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and peritoneal macrophages.
AB  == cationic polyamino acids are known to enhance a variety of cell-cell interactions by virtue of their ability to alter electrostatic forces of cell surfaces. in this study, the effect of polyamino acids on phagocytosis of 3h-labeled bacteria  by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) and peritoneal macrophages was investigated. negatively charged and neutral polyamino acids did not influence phagocytosis of unopsonized staphylococcus epidermidis, whereas protamine, poly-l-arginine, and poly-l-lysine stimulated phagocytosis in a dose-dependent manner. at 50 micrograms/ml, greater than 30% uptake by pmns was seen with each of these cationic polyamino acids. although cationic polyamino acids promoted pmn and peritoneal macrophage phagocytosis of unopsonized s. epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus m (encapsulated) and m variant (unencapsulated), and escherichia coli j5, little effect was seen with the parent e. coli o111:b4 or a  serotype o222:h16 strain. pretreatment of bacteria and phagocytes separately demonstrated that the phagocytosis-promoting property of polyamino acids is manifest predominantly on the bacteria. bacteria pretreated with cationic polyamino acids also elicited a pmn chemiluminescent response, and pmn-associated bacteria were killed, as determined by a fluorochrome microassay. thus, cationic  polyamino acids promote the phagocytosis and killing of many but not all bacterial strains, and in this respect polyamino acids function as opsonins.

AB  == the identity and antibiotic sensitivity of the isolated bacteria from 179 patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate were analysed. the patients were randomized into a group receiving a short course of cefotaxime in conjunction with the operation and a control group given no antibiotics. preoperatively 70 patients had bacteriuria (greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu/l) with a predominance of gram-negative bacteria (57 isolates, mainly escherichia coli, enterobacter, klebsiella ssp, proteus ssp), although gram-positive species  (24 isolates, mainly enterococci and staphylococcus epidermidis) were also frequently encountered. preoperatively isolated pathogens were evenly distributed in both groups and the sensitivity pattern was comparable. in the cefotaxime group postoperative recurrence of the preoperatively identified bacteria occurred in a lower frequency (11/43) than persistence in the control group (24/38). only  gram-negative pathogens were isolated from patients with postoperative septicemia and upper urinary tract infections indicating that it is most important to direct prophylaxis against gram-negative bacteria. a high degree of sensitivity against  cefotaxime, gentamicin, trimethoprim, co-trimazine and a combination of ampicillin and mecillinam was recorded among both pre- and postoperatively isolated bacteria.

AB  == urethral meatal colonization with potential urinary tract pathogens was studied before bacteriuria in 31 consecutive acute spinal cord injury patients on an open ward (137 cultures) and 18 renal homotransplant patients in reverse isolation (80 cultures). all patients required indwelling urethral catheterization and no antimicrobials were given. daily quantitative cultures of the urethral meatus, and bladder and drainage bag urine were obtained. the urethra was the source for  11 of 31 episodes of bacteriuria (35 per cent). urethral meatal colonization with the organism responsible for bacteriuria, that is escherichia coli (5 episodes),  staphylococcus aureus (2), streptococcus faecalis (2) and staphylococcus epidermidis (2), was persistent and present from 2 to 5 days before bacteriuria.  in each ward 81 per cent or more of the cultures obtained on day 1 of catheterization showed no gram-negative colonization. subsequently, the gram-negative colonization density increased in both groups but the increase was  significant (p less than 0.001) only for patients on the open ward. similar trends were observed for gram-positive colonization. the prevalence of potential  pathogens was similar for patients whether or not they suffered bacteriuria. an increased density of bacterial colonization was associated with increased susceptibility to bacteriuria but the specific urethral meatal flora was not always predictive of the species responsible for bacteriuria.

TI  == [bacterial species recently isolated from urinary tract infections and their antibiotic susceptibility, with special reference to acute cystitis].
AB  == numbers of the strains of each bacterial species isolated from urinary tract infections were summed and their incidences were calculated for each a half year  from the second half of 1980 to the first half of 1982. the incidences of escherichia coli strains were found to be greatly reduced and those of streptococcus faecalis strains were greatly increased. those of staphylococcus epidermidis strains were also increased. this trend was thought to be caused by the extensive and exclusive use of cephalosporin derivatives. minimal inhibitory  concentrations of gentamicin (gm), amikacin (amk), ampicillin (abpc), cefazolin (cez), ceftizoxime (czx), latamoxef (lmox) and minocycline (mino) against these isolated strains were estimated. the most sensitive drugs for e. coli were found  to be czx, lmox, gm and amk, czx and mino for klebsiella, czx and lmox for proteus, and gm for pseudomonas aeruginosa. all gram-positive cocci were found generally to be most susceptible to mino, but s. faecalis and other pseudomonas were also sensitive to abpc. exclusive use of cephalosporins for the treatment may induce selective increases of the resistant species in normal flora. since these flora could be the causative agents for various infections, these selections caused by the exclusive use of the monotype drugs are not preferable,  and various different drugs should be used for the suitable cases.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial multiplication by the iron chelator deferoxamine: potentiating effect of ascorbic acid.
AB  == since iron is essential for the multiplication of microorganisms, the effect of the iron chelator deferoxamine, with or without ascorbic acid, on the growth of 43 strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, alcaligenes faecalis, neisseria meningitidis and species of salmonella, enterobacter, pseudomonas and providencia, was investigated with the use of an automated turbidimeter. addition of deferoxamine (25-400 micrograms/ml) to the incubation medium was inhibitory in a dose-dependent fashion. at concentrations between 200-400 micrograms/ml, growth was about 25% lower than control values. however, when ascorbic acid (100 micrograms/ml) was added to the culture medium, this antimicrobial activity of deferoxamine was significantly increased to on average 75% of the control value (p less than 0.05). ascorbic acid alone had no bacteriostatic properties. growth  in the presence of 200 micrograms/ml deferoxamine combined with 100 micrograms/ml ascorbic acid was significantly lower than that in control media without additions (p less than 0.001). addition of ferric citrate to the culture medium at a concentration sufficient to saturate all of the deferoxamine with iron, abolished the growth inhibiting effect of deferoxamine. the results provide evidence that deferoxamine is bacteriostatic due to its capacity to deplete iron  which would otherwise be used for bacterial multiplication, and that ascorbic acid enhances this antibacterial property of deferoxamine.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in intensive care unit areas.
AB  == the incidence of nosocomial infections and antimicrobial resistance rates of nosocomial pathogens vary considerably among countries and even among intensive care units (icus) within one hospital. such differences might be partly due to the selection pressure exerted by certain antibiotics, since intensive care patients are given more antimicrobials than any other group of patients. we therefore compared resistance rates of four important nosocomial pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients in general wards and icus. there were few trends toward higher resistance of icu isolates, and most differences were found with klebsiella pneumoniae. we also tried to relate antibiotic use in icus and frequency of antibiotic resistance of five selected nosocomial pathogens. the ampicillin and cephalosporin resistance of e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae arose along with an increase in usage of both drugs. decreasing prescription of cotrimoxazole was not reflected by decrease in resistance of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. increasing prescriptions of tetracyclines  were followed by an increasing resistance of e. coli, but not of staphylococci. the oxacillin resistance of staphylococcus epidermidis almost paralleled the consumption, the opposite was true for staphylococcus aureus. there seemed to be  a rather close relationship between the incidence of resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains and the quantities of gentamicin, tobramycin and azlocillin prescribed. the increase or decrease of prescriptions of certain antimicrobials increased or decreased their  resistance rate to the respective drugs of only certain bacterial strains in one  icu, but not in the other. the findings in our hospital cannot necessarily be applied to other hospitals.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == aerobic urethral flora of women with infertility and gynecologic problems.
AB  == one hundred eighty-five urine specimens were collected from an unselected group of non-gravid nigerian women patients attending the infertility and gynaecologic  clinics in ile-ife, nigeria to investigate the aerobic urethral microflora. the specimens revealed that 25.9% of the total collected and processed contained bacteria flora. the most common aerobes isolated were escherichia coli, p. mirabilis and s. epidermidis, in that order. the study has shown that there are changes in the urethral microflora from one physiologic age group to the other and that colonization of the urethral and urinogenital tract is important in the  development of urinary tract infections.

AB  == bacteriologic, mycologic, and serologic investigations of cows and calves and three experiments with rabbits were carried out to shed light on the bacteriology and mycology of the intrauterine infections in cows. the following organisms were isolated from the investigated cows that exhibited disturbances in their reproduction, and had abortions, or gave birth to calves that were affected with  diseases or died: escherichia coli (17.84%), association of bacteria (7.64%); vibrio genitalis (3.86%); streptococcus sp. (2.78%); moulds (2.54%); staphylococcus aureus (2.20%); proteus sp. (1.62%); staphylococcus epidermidis (1.39%); pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.39%); pasteurella multocida (0.11%). the serologic investigation of a total of 231 blood samples from cows that miscarried, gave birth to dead calves, or failed to conceive revealed that in 15.58 per cent there was vibriosis, and in 6.06 per cent--leptospirosis. demonstrated was the etiologic link between cows with reproductive disturbances and diseased calves with regard to vibriosis and leptospirosis. the tests with rabbits were indicative of bacterial carriers (with special reference to the genitalia) up to the 60th day following infection. there were abortions, sterility, and death cases and the birth of unviable bunnies in the case of reproduced coital infections with escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == the clinical significance of positive blood cultures: a comprehensive analysis of 500 episodes of bacteremia and fungemia in adults. i. laboratory and epidemiologic observations.
AB  == five hundred episodes of septicemia were reviewed, with emphasis on laboratory and epidemiologic findings. the isolation of facultative and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and gram-positive cocci (except viridans streptococci and staphylococcus epidermidis) almost always indicated true bacteremia, whereas the isolation of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacilli, including clostridium species, often represented contamination. more than 99% of  all episodes were detected when two samples of blood (a total of 30 ml) were cultured. the five most common isolates were escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the incidence of septicemia was highest among medical patients and lowest among obstetric-gynecologic patients. two-thirds of all episodes were nosocomial; s. aureus, enterococci, facultative gram-negative bacilli, and fungi  were especially common nosocomial pathogens. the microorganisms isolated varied with the hospital service; polymicrobial episodes were especially common among surgical patients and transplant recipients. the most common sources of bacteremia were the respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tracts; however, the source was unknown in nearly one-third of episodes. microorganisms causing septicemia in neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients were not different; however, polymicrobial infections were more frequent in the presence of neutropenia. after antimicrobial susceptibility data became available, therapy was appropriate greater than 90% of the time.

TI  == synergism of the antimicrobial agents miconazole, bacitracin and polymyxin b.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a combination of miconazole with bacitracin against staphylococcus epidermidis or staphylococcus aureus, was greater than the sum of  the effects observed with the two drugs independently. since no uptake changes were observed, this synergism may originate from a combined effect of miconazole  and bacitracin on the biosynthesis of the carrier lipid, undecaprenyl-phosphate,  resulting in an impairment of cell wall integrity. the synergism between these drugs and polymyxin b may be due to an increased accessibility of the cell membrane to polymyxin b. miconazole and bacitracin, alone or in combination, are  completely inactive against escherichia coli. since polymyxin b disturbs the permeability barrier and stimulates the uptake of miconazole, the synergism of polymyxin b, miconazole and bacitracin may originate from the ability of miconazole and bacitracin to penetrate the bacterial membranes in the presence of polymyxin b.

TI  == killing of gram-negative bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes: role of an o2-independent bactericidal system.
AB  == previous studies have suggested that a cationic bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi) present in both rabbit and human polymorphonuclear leukocytes is the principal o2-independent bactericidal agent of these cells toward several strains of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium (1978. j. biol. chem. 253: 2664--2672; 1979. j. biol. chem. 254: 11000--11009). to further evaluate the possible role of this protein in the killing of gram-negative bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, we have measured the bactericidal activity of intact rabbit peritoneal exudate leukocytes under aerobic or anaerobic conditions and of intact human leukocytes from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease. anaerobic conditions were created by  flushing the cells under a nitrogen stream. effective removal of oxygen was demonstrated by the inability of nitrogen-flushed leukocytes to mount a respiratory burst (measured as increased conversion of 1-[14c]glucose leads to 14co2 or by superoxide production) during bacterial ingestion. at a bacteria/leukocyte ratio of 10:1, killing of gram-positive, bpi-resistant, staphylococcus epidermidis is markedly impaired in the absence of oxygen (76.4 +/- 3.3% killing in room air, 29.2 +/- 8.2% killing in nitrogen). essentially all increased bacterial survival is intracellular. in contrast, both a nonopsonized rough strain (mr-10) and an opsonized smooth strain (ms) of s. typhimurium 395 are killed equally well in room air and nitrogen. a maximum of 70--80 mr-10 and 30--40 ms are killed per leukocyte either in the presence or absence of oxygen. there is no intracellular bacterial survival in either condition indicating that  intracellular o2-independent bactericidal system(s) of rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes can at least match the leukocyte's ingestive capacity. whole homogenates and crude acid extracts manifest similar bactericidal capacity toward s. typhimurium 395. this activity can be accounted for by the bpi content of these cell fractions and is virtually eliminated by immune (anti-bpi), but not by preimmune goat igg-rich fractions. opsonization of smooth ms, required for bacterial killing by intact leukocytes, does not alter bacterial sensitivity to bpi in crude or purified form. leukocytes of a patient with chronic granulomatous disease killed ingested s. typhimurium 396 ms nearly as well as did normal leukocytes. the bactericidal activity toward e. coli (j5) of crude acid extracts  of the cgd and normal human leukocytes was virtually the same and was nearly completely inhibited by anti-bpi igg-rich fractions, but not by preimmune igg-rich fractions. these findings suggest that the killing of gram-negative bacteria such as s. typhimurium by intact polymorphonuclear leukocytes may also be attributed to the action of bpi.

AB  == thirteen women and two preadolescent girls who suffered recurrences after six months of prophylaxis with trimethoprim (tmp; 40 mg) and sulfamethoxazole (smz; 200 mg) taken thrice weekly at bedtime were enrolled in a 24-month study of prophylaxis with the same region. during 29.1 cumulative patient-years of prophylaxis, two infections due to escherichia coli and one each due to staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis occurred (0.14 infection/patient-year). mics for these isolates were less than or equal to 2 micrograms of tmp/ml and greater than 512 micrograms of smz/ml. during prophylaxis, 106 of 116 cultures from the periurethral area and 66 of 97 cultures from the anal and canal yielded no aerobic gram-negative bacilli. in three patients, the periurethral area was colonized with aerobic gram-negative bacilli  with mics of greater than or equal to 2 micrograms of tmp/ml. thirteen patients were followed after the discontinuation of prophylaxis. eight suffered recurrences, seven with organisms susceptible to tmp. after one year the remaining five had experienced no recurrences. it is concluded that long-term prophylaxis with 40 mg of tmp and 200 mg of smz thrice weekly is an effective, well-tolerated regimen that can maintain an infection-free state in women with histories of frequent urinary reinfections.

TI  == efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  == ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. the clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. the bacteria isolated included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, other bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. there were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. no serious drug toxicities were observed. at a dosage regimen of 1 g  every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.

TI  == role of lymphatic vessels in bacterial clearance from early soft-tissue infection.
AB  == a popular concept regarding the pathophysiologic characteristics of infection is  that early bacterial clearance from tissue is an important host defense mechanism. staphylococcus aureus, s epidermidis, escherichia coli, enterococcus,  and klebsiella pneumoniae were radiolabeled with tritiated thymidine and injected subcutaneously into rabbit ears. negligible clearance occurred at five hours, and less than 30% of injected bacteria cleared in 24 hours. lymphatic function measured by clearance with bovine serum albumin labeled with iodine 125 was normal at all times during the first 24 hours. clearance of live s aureus, radiolabeled by tritiated thymidine, was not accelerated by preexisting 12- or 24-hour hold-old inflammatory lesions. clearance of bacteria rendered nonviable in vitro by antibiotics and heat were cleared in proportion to the degree of bacterial cell lysis. bacterial clearance of s aureus correlated with the rate of bacterial lysis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro. these data support the  hypothesis that lymphatic clearance of bacteria from soft tissues is of negligible importance as a host defense mechanism in the decisive period of soft-tissue infection.

AB  == two groups of infertile males (65 and 132 patients) have been investigated in two different laboratories, with two different methods to obtain semen. the bacteriological results are quite similar in the two groups. the microorganisms which have been isolated are : beta-hemolytic streptococcus, proteus, epidermidis staphylococcus, micrococcus, corynebacter, viridans streptococcus, klebsiella, pseudomonas, enterobacter, bacillus, neisseria, escherichia coli, anaerobic staphylococcus, anaerobic streptococcus, anaerobic corynebacter type iv, fungus,  achromobacter. 20 p. cent of the patients are chronically infected without any clinical signs. this infection is probably of prostatic origin with an important  number of bacteria in the semen (more than 3,000/ml). no relation has been shown  between the bacteriological data and the physical and cytological characteristics of the sperm, except the ph : semens with a low ph are generally azoospermic and  highly contaminated.

TI  == bactericidal properties of commercial u.s.p. formulated insulin.
AB  == this study examined the suitability of commercial u.s.p. insulin as a bacterial growth medium. purified port insulin (iletin ii, eli lilly & co., indianapolis, indiana) was inoculated with approximately 500,000 bacteria per ml of: (1) staphylococcus epidermidis, (2) staphylococcus aureus, or (3) escherichia coli. all three bacterial cultures were sterilized by the insulin within 24 h at 37 degrees c. however, staph epidermidis was the most sensitive and escherichia coli was least sensitive to the bactericidal effects of commercial u.s.p. insulin. components of commercial u.s.p. insulin were then examined for their bactericidal activity against escherichia coli. phenol (230 mg/dl), glycerol (1.6 d/dl), and zinc cations (4.0, 2.0, and 1.0 mg/dl) demonstrated bactericidal activity, whereas dialyzed insulin demonstrated minimal effects. we conclude that insulin contaminated with 5 x 10(5) bacteria commonly found on the skin will self-sterilize within 24 h. this effect is secondary to the additives placed in the insulin and not to the insulin itself.

AB  == in a prospective clinical and microbiological study covering 67 prepubertal children the vaginal flora of 31 asymptomatic children was compared to 36 children suffering from abnormal vaginal discharge and/or vulvovaginitis. vaginoscopy was employed to obtain bacteriological specimens without contamination. swabs were inoculated into prereduced transportmedia (port a cul,  bbl) and cultured aerobically and anaerobically. the most prevalent aerobic organisms were staphylococcus epidermidis. enterococci and escherichia coli; the  predominant anaerobic bacteria were peptococcus and peptostreptococcus, veillonella parvula, eubacteria, propionibacterium and bacteroides species. a similar microbiological pattern was found in both groups, although anaerobes, like peptococci and peptostreptococci and bacteroides species, as well as yeasts, like candida albicans were significantly more frequent in the group with signs and symptoms. lactobacilli were less common in this group.

AB  == multiple-organism bacteremia (mob), as defined by the growth of two or more organisms in the same blood culture, was studied in the surgical intensive care unit at the royal victoria hospital. over the 2 years encompassing 1977 and 1978, there were 125 bacteremic episodes in 83 patients; of this total, 32 episodes of  mob were present in 27 patients. the mortality rate associated with mob was 48% compared to 25% in those patients with a single organism in their blood (p less than 0.025). three patients had two episodes of mob, and one had three episodes;  all died. the etiology in two patients was, surprisingly, intravascular devices.  two patients with four episodes of mob had severe burns, whereas aspiration pneumonia and an infected amputation stump accounted for two more episodes. in the remaining 21 patients (78%) with 24 episodes of mob (75%), all had intraperitoneal pathologic findings. of these cases, 19 (59%) episodes were clearly related to intraperitoneal sepsis. the remaining five appeared related to intraperitoneal causes but were without confirmation. there was no difference in  the incidence of bacteroides and staphylococcus epidermidis. the incidences of enterococci and escherichia coli were significantly higher (p less than 0.005 for both) and dominant in multiple- versus single-organism bacteremia. multiple-organism bacteremia is associated with an increased mortality rate, with origins characteristic of polymicrobial infections. the most important source is  intraperitoneal and the occurrence of mob should alert the surgeon to the likelihood of intraperitoneal sepsis.

TI  == human fibronectin binding to staphylococcal surface protein and its relative inefficiency in promoting phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, and alveolar macrophages.
AB  == the interaction between human fibronectin and 17 strains of staphylococci was studied in an attempt to elucidate the staphylococcal cell wall component(s) involved in fibronectin binding and to determine the influence of fibronectin upon phagocytosis by three types of phagocytic cells. purified, radiolabeled fibronectin bound to a similar degree to six laboratory strains and three fresh clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus; similar binding of fibronectin was found with s. aureus strains deficient in cell wall teichoic acid or clumping factor and coagulase, as well as with three strains of s. epidermidis. there was  minimal binding of fibronectin to encapsulated s. aureus and to escherichia coli. fibronectin bound to intact cells and to a crude cell wall preparation of s. aureus h, but not to purified cell walls or peptidoglycan. trypsinization of staphylococci prevented subsequent fibronectin binding, but binding did not correlate well with the protein a content in s. aureus cell walls. at physiological concentrations, fibronectin binding to staphylococci did not promote phagocytosis of bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, or alveolar macrophages. also, depletion of fibronectin from normal human serum did not result in a measurable loss of opsonic activity for staphylococci. it is concluded that fibronectin binding to staphylococci involves a surface protein shared among strains of s. aureus and s. epidermidis, and that  in comparison to c3b and igg, fibronectin plays a relatively minor role as an opsonin for staphylococci.

TI  == premature labor. ii. bacterial sources of phospholipase.
AB  == human term labor is thought to be initiated by amniotic and chorionic phospholipase a2, an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid esters from the phospholipids of these membranes, leading to the synthesis of prostaglandins by the placental membranes. the striking association of premature labor with intrauterine infection or contamination, urinary tract infection, and early neonatal sepsis led us to study the microorganisms present in these infections for phospholipase a2 activity. activity was found in bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus viridans, streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus a and b, escherichia coli, klebsiella, staphylococcus epidermidis, pneumococcus, lactobacillus, and mycoplasma hominis.  bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium, and s viridans had the highest activities. the specific activities of phospholipase a2 from these organisms were several times higher than that of the membrane phospholipase a2 of the amnion and chorion. we postulate that premature labor may be initiated by microorganisms with phospholipase a2 activity from endocervical and/or intrauterine contamination or infection, producing deacylation of arachidonic acid from amniotic phospholipids with increased concentrations of free arachidonic acid and increased prostaglandin synthesis, which triggers labor.

AB  == staphylococcus saprophyticus biotype 3 (micrococcus subgroup 3 or m3) has usually been shown to be the second commonset cause of urinary tract infections in european women who are not in hospital. it generally causes pyuria and symptoms as severe as those caused by escherichia coli. unlike s. epidermidis it is seldom found as a contaminant in midstream urine specimens, and almost exclusively infects women in their reproductive years. however, s. saprophyticus is seldom differentiated from s. epidermidis in canadian clinical laboratories. urinary isolates of s. saprophyticus were presumptively differentiated from other coagulase-negative micrococcaceae by their resistance to novobiocin as demonstrated by a simple disc susceptibility test that misidentified the infecting organism in only 3.4% of specimens. these novobiocin-resistant, coagulase-negative organisms caused similar proportions of the urinary tract infections in young women in york, england and vancouver -- 6.6% and 6.9% respectively. in york these organisms were associated with significantly greater  pyuria than novobiocin-sensitive organisms or bile-tolerant streptococci but not  s. aureus or enterobacteriaceae. in both communities novobiocin-sensitive, coagulase-negative micrococcaceae were appreciably more resistant to penicillin than novobiocin-resistant organisms. thus, differentiating s. saprophyticus from  novobiocin-sensitive, coagulase-negative organisms provides information that is clinically useful, particularly for primary care practitioners working in the community or in outpatient clinics.

AB  == new qualitative and quantitative methods are described for the investigation of the antibacterial activity of lipids on solid media by the application of lipid-impregnated filter paper over a lawn of the organisms. the methods have been used to investigate the antibacterial activity of unsaturated fatty acids that are important in skin defence. oleic and linoleic acids inhibited streptococcus pyogenes markedly, staphylococcus aureus and staph epidermidis to a lesser extent and had no effect on escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the inhibition of growth of a strain of str. pyogenes from a sore throat was greater than that of a strain from an outbreak of impetigo. linoleic acid was a more potent inhibitor of bacterial growth than oleic acid, and with both acids inhibition was more pronounced under aerobic than under anaerobic conditions of incubation. the methods described could be applied in other fields such as pharmacology, horticulture and industry.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  == as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of  haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though  several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae,  5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of  cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case,  the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.

TI  == quantitative culture of intravenous catheters and other intravascular inserts.
AB  == quantitative cultures were done on 149 intravenous catheters and 40 additional intravascular inserts. intradermal and intravascular segments of the insert were  cultured separately. the inserts were immersed in broth and flushed. the number of colony-forming units (cfu) per insert was estimated by surface culture of serial dilution of the broth. nonquantitative culture of undiluted broth was also done. since all inserts associated with bacteremia had at least 10(3) cfu, inserts greater than 10(3) cfu were considered infected. staphylococcus epidermidis was more likely than more virulent organisms to colonize an insert without causing bacteremia. the inserts in one bacteremic patient were infected from a distant bloodstream focus; however, in the majority of patients, quantitative intradermal cultures suggested that the insertion site was the portal of entry. in bacteremic patients, either a positive quantitative or a nonquantitative culture identified an infected insert. however, only 33% of positive nonquantitative insert cultures from nonbacteremic patients were confirmed by quantitative insert culture.

TI  == response of escherichia coli to beta-lactam antibiotics: effect of the concomitant presence of staphylococci exhibiting inducible beta-lactamase activity.
AB  == the response to beta-lactam antibiotics of mixed cultures of escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis was studied in static culture and in an in vitro model which simulates the dynamic conditions in which bacteria are exposed to antibiotics in the treatment of urinary infection. in static cultures, the concomitant presence of staphylococci exhibiting inducible beta-lactamase activity substantially reduced the efficacy of benzylpenicillin and ampicillin (but not cefuroxime) against e. coli. in the conditions of the bladder model some interference with the activity of beta-lactam antibiotics by beta-lactamase producing staphylococci was also demonstrated. nevertheless, relatively modest doses of ampicillin were still able to suppress growth of susceptible e. coli for periods exceeding the normal interdose interval, even in the presence of enzyme-producing staphylococci.

AB  == single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to  determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. at heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 u/ml, the effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter spp. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. all 10 isolates of s. aureus and all 10 of s. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 u/ml. three e. coli, four p. aeruginosa, and nine c. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 u of heparin per ml. none of the k. pneumoniae, e. aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 u/ml. heparin inhibition  of s. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 u of heparin per ml could be  quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. these data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.

TI  == comparison of direct and standard antimicrobial disk susceptibility testing for bacteria isolated from blood.
AB  == to determine the reliability of early antimicrobial susceptibility testing, we compared the results of direct and standard single-disk diffusion methods for 581 positive blood cultures processed routinely by the clinical microbiology laboratory. the direct procedure differed from the standard one only in that the  0.5 mcfarland inoculum was prepared from 1 ml of turbid broth rather than five isolated colonies from a subculture plate. a major discrepancy in results was defined as a change from susceptible to resistant or vice versa according to interpretive standards for zone diameters, whereas a minor discrepancy was defined as a shift to or from the intermediate category when paired direct and standard tests were compared. the overall agreement between the two methods was 94.6% of 2,308 comparisons. there were 119 minor (5.2%) and 6 major (0.3%) discrepancies. the major discrepancies were seen with three strains of staphylococcus epidermidis and one strain each of s. aureus, escherichia coli, and enterobacter sp. direct susceptibility testing of positive blood cultures that were pure by gram-stained smear provided reliable results 24 to 36 h earlier than conventional procedures; therefore, we recommended this procedure to guide early antimicrobial therapy in patients with bacterial sepsis.

TI  == requirement of extracellular complement and immunoglobulin for intracellular killing of micro-organisms by human monocytes.
AB  == the role of serum factors in the intracellular killing of bacteria by monocytes was studied on the basis of an assay independent of phagocytosis. after 3 min of  phagocytosis of preopsonized bacteria and removal of noningested bacteria, the monocytes containing bacteria are reincubated for various periods and the number  of unkilled bacteria is determined by a microbiological method after lysis of the cells. evidence that this assay measures the killing of ingested bacteria was provided by scanning electron microscopy, lysostaphin treatment, and the effect on the rate of intracellular killing of inactivated serum lacking specific opsonic activity. intracellular killing of staphylococcus aureaus, s. epidermidis, and escherichia coli by human monocytes does not occur or is low in  the absence of serum, and maximal killing is only reached when fresh serum is present; intermediate values are obtained in the presence of heat-inactivated serum. these findings indicate that complement stimulates intracellular killing.  isolated heterogeneous immunoglobulin (ig)g, pfc fragments of heterogeneous igg,  and both igg1 and igg3 stimulate intracellular killing of s. aureaus by monocytes to the same degree as heat-inactivated serum. sphingomyelinase, which decreases the number of fc receptors, and neuraminidase, which increases these receptors, respectively, decreased and increased the intracellular killing, whereas anti-monocyte serum completely abolished the stimulation of intracellular killing by inactivated serum. these results prove that interaction of the fc receptor with the fc part of igg is required for the intracellular killing. inhibition of  the activation of complement components via the alternative pathway gave a considerable reduction in the intracellular killing of s. aureaus; impairment of  the activation via the classical pathway had no effect. the addition of complement components to heat-inactivated serum showed that intracellular killing is maximal only when c3b is generated. reduction of the number of c3b receptors in the membrane by trypsin or pronase decreased intracellular killing in the presence of fresh serum; anti-monocyte serum completely abolished the stimulation of intracellular killing by fresh serum. these results lead to the conclusion that intracellular killing is also dependent on the interaction between c3b and its receptor in the membrane.

(1) pc-904 was administered 20 approximately 30 mg/kg. the serum peak level of pc-904 after drip intravenous infusion over 1 hour was 66.7 microgram/ml at 1 hour and t 1/2 of pc-904 was 67.8 minutes. pc-904 was  administered 25 approximately 30 mg/kg intravenous one shot injection was 49.4 microgram/ml at 1 hour and t 1/2 of pc-904 was 52.2 minutes. (2) urinary excretion rate was about 20% up to 6 hours after drip intravenous infusion of 20  mg/kg. in a case of intravenous one shot injection of 25 approximately 30 mg/kg,  the excretion rate was 11.9 approximately 19.9%. (3) pc-904 was administered 60 approximately 120 mg/kg/day for 3 approximately 48 days to 5 cases of sepsis and  bacterial endocarditis, 6 of pneumonia, 2 of sss syndrome (staphylococcal scald skin syndrome) and 3 of pyelonephritis. clinical effects were excellent in 11 cases and good in 5 cases, effective ratio being 100%. (4) pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus viridans, acinetobacter anitratus and hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared  by the treatment of pc-904, and hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of pc-904. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae reduced. (5) as to the side effect by pc-904, s-got and s-gpt were elevated in 2 cases. anemia, rash and fever were observed in each 1 case out of 16 patients though the causal relation with the agent was unknown.

TI  == the effect of methylmethacrylate on chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == the effect of methylmethacrylate on chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes was evaluated by an in vitro method that involved migration of human leukocytes under agarose. chemotactic factors produced during growth of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli remained chemotactically active in the presence of a methylmethacrylate concentration of 1.25 per cent, which was the highest tested. the methylmethacrylate also did not alter the activity of the chemotactic factor produced by zymosan activation of normal human serum. however, when methylmethacrylate was added to normal human serum prior to  zymosan activation, a methylmethacrylate concentration of 0.312 per cent significantly depressed the subsequent zymosan-induced chemotactic activity and concentrations above 0.312 per cent abolished it. when methylmethacrylate was added to the polymorphonuclear leukocyte suspensions, there was significant depression of the migration of cells at a concentration of 0.312 per cent, and at concentrations of 0.625 and 1.25 per cent no leukocyte migration occurred.

TI  == immunohistochemical localization of a choriogonadotropin-like protein in bacteria isolated from cancer patients.
AB  == by the use of specific antibody to human chorionic gonadotropin (cg) as well as to its beta-subunit, and the application of the indirect fluorescein-labeled and  peroxidase-labeled antibody techniques, we have demonstrated the presence of a membrane (wall)-associated cg-similar immunoreactive protein in 15 strains of bacteria isolated from tissues of patients bearing malignant neoplasms. these microorganisms were classified as s. epidermidis, (12) e. coli (2), and a single  strain of p. maltophilia (atcc 13637). the absence of the cg-like antigen in other "cancer associated bacteria", streptococcus faecalis (atcc 12818) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (from patient with cancer of colon), demonstrated that not every "cancer associated bacteria" has the capability to synthesize the trophoblastic-like protein. the negative results obtained with a number of "noncancer control" bacteria of known origin, obtained from atcc and from clinical samples, strongly supported the idea that the existance of these cg-like protein producing microorganisms is not a ubiquitous finding. the demonstration of a de novo bacterial biosynthesis of a protein having similar antigenic and biophysical properties to those of the human trophoblastic hormone, has great biological implications, especially if its biosynthesis is proven only in bacterial strains growing in the presence of cancer cells in which we have already demonstrated the presence of a similar antigen. the explanation of the phenomenon is unknown. because of their origin, the potential of "genetic exchange" with subsequent expression of the mammalian gene by the bacterial cells becomes a possibility. it is also possible that the gene coding for the cg-like protein is normally present but inactive or repressed in all bacteria.

AB  == a study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. groups of germfree akr mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: streptococcus faecalis. lactobacillus brevis. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and torulopsis sp. all species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of e. coli or p. aeruginosa. the presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the  colonization of p. aeruginosa and not of e. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.

TI  == nitrate, fumarate, and oxygen as electron acceptors for a late step in microbial  heme synthesis.
AB  == nitrate can serve as anaerobic electron acceptor for the oxidation of protoporphyrinogen to protoporphyrin in cell-free extracts of escherichia coli grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate. two kinds of experiments indicated this: anaerobic protoporphyrin formation from protoporphyrinogen, followed spectrophotometrically, was markedly stimulated by addition of nitrate;  and anaerobic protoheme formation from protoporphyrinogen, determined by extraction procedures, was markedly stimulated by addition of nitrate. in contrast, anaerobic protoheme formation from protoporphyrin was not dependent upon addition of nitrate. this was the first demonstration of the ability of nitrate to serve as electron acceptor for this late step of heme synthesis. previous studies with mammalian and yeast mitochondria had indicated an obligatory requirement for molecular oxygen at this step. in confirmation of our  previous preliminary report, fumarate was also shown to be an electron acceptor for anaerobic protoporphyrinogen oxidation in extracts of e. coli grown anaerobically on fumarate. for the first time, anaerobic protoheme formation from protoporphyrinogen, but not from protoporphyrin, was shown to be dependent upon the addition of fumarate. the importance of these findings is 2-fold. first, they establish that enzymatic protoporphyrinogen oxidation can occur in the absence of molecular oxygen, in contrast to previous observations using mammalian and yeast  mitochondria. secondly, these findings help explain the ability of some facultative and anaerobic bacteria to form very large amounts of heme compounds,  such as cytochrome pigments, when grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate  or fumarate. in fact, denitrifying bacteria are known to form more cytochromes when grown anaerobically than during aerobic growth. an unexpected finding was that extracts of another bacterium, staphylococcus epidermidis, exhibited very little ability to oxidize protoporphyrinogen to protoporphyrin as compared to e.  coli extracts. this finding suggests some fundamental differences in these two organisms in this key step in heme synthesis. it is known that these two facultative organisms also differ in that e. coli synthesizes cytochrome during both aerobic and anaerobic growth, while staphylococcus only synthesizes cytochromes when grown aerobically.

TI  == meatal recolonization in bitches.
AB  == colonization of the urethrovaginal area precedes urinary tract infection in women. among the potential factors limiting colonization by fecal pathogens is bacterial interference, the ability of established commensals to inhibit colonization by pathogenic bacteria. since the microcontour of the canine distal  urethra possesses microvilli like those in the vagina rather than the microplicae found at higher levels and also has similarities in cellular glycogen content the meatal area would be expected to respond to hormonal influences like the vagina.  the normal canine urethrovaginal flora was determined by serial cultures. it consisted principally of staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium and acinetobacter-haemophilus. estrus produced a selective overgrowth of beta-streptococcus and acinetobacter-haemophilus. a normal canine transient, escherichia coli, and a normal resident, corynebacterium, persisted only for a short time (4.5 days) unless inoculated during estrus, when they remained for a mean period of 70 days. in contrast, human escherichia coli and pseudomonas persisted only a short time, whether during anestrus (4.8 days) or during estrus  (8.5 days). the commensals had returned fully by 14 days after sterilization, while those in estrus overresponded. thus, indigenous bacteria inhibit establishment of certain foreign species in the urethra and hormones enhance the  susceptibility to colonization.

AB  == operation wounds were sampled quantitatively for aerobic bacteria in 56 patients  by the velvet pad rinse technique in a prospective, randomised study of abdominal operations (1) truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty, (2) gastric or (3) colo-rectal  operations, and (4) exploratory laparotomy. on entering the peritoneal cavity and prior to incision of the gastro-intestinal tract the bacterial density in the wounds did not differ significantly between these four types of operations, the median being 5.4x10(-1) viable counts/cm2 (range 0.7-135.8). in all series of operations the median bacterial density was increased prior to closure of the wounds, significantly so after colo-retal operations, being 21.3x10(-1) viable counts/cm2 (range 1.1-144.4), caused by a rise in density of aerobic intestinal species, especially escherichia coli. regardless of type of operation, all wounds were contaminated during operation by aerobic commensals of the skin and mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract, in particular by staphylococcus epidermidis, this species not differing significiantly in density from the beginning to the end of operation. this same study revealed that within the operation wound, sites of low or even zero bacterial density were close to sites  with a high density. it is suggested that postoperative wound infection is closely related to the density of the different species of bacteria present in the operation wound at closure.

TI  == experimental evaluation of the velvet pad rinse technique as a microbiological sampling method.
AB  == the use of velvet pads glued to aluminium foil has been evaluated as a microbiological sampling method in quantitative bacterial recovery experiments, and the efficiency and precision have been determined. the velvet pads uptake of  staphylococcus epidermidis was 0.93 (or 93 per cent) after sampling from a test surface on blood agar, while the release by subsequent imprinting on blood agar was 0.02, the median effective transfer being 0.02. a mechanical rinse and shake  procedure of the velvet pad in 0.9 per cent saline followed by centrifugation and surface plating significantly increased the median release to 0.66, the median effective transfer being 0.61. there was no difference in uptake, release and effective transfer between a pure culture of s. epidermidis and a mixed culture of s. epiderimidis and escherichia coli. storage of the velvet pad in 0.9 per cent saline for 2 h at room temperature did not influence bacterial recovery significantly, in contrast to a significant decrease after storage in saline for  24 h or storage in a dry petri dish for 2 h. the high and fairly constant efficiency of bacterial recovery of the velvet pad rinse technique suggests that  it could be employed clinically.

TI  == endotoxin-like properties of the peptidoglycan.
AB  == peptidoglycan is responsible for the endotoxin-like properties of the streptococcus cell wall. the pyrogenic response of rabbit to group a streptococcus peptidoglycan prepared by hot formamide or tca is dose-dependent and is increased if the material is ultrasonically solubilized. the pyrogenicity  can be eliminated by the antiserum to the peptidoglycan or by the degradation of  the material by lysozyme. peptidoglycans prepared from cell walls of group b and  l streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae produce fever effects comparable to the response after group a streptococcus peptidoglycan. spirillum serpens and escherichia coli contain in addition to endotoxin the peptidoglycan which is also pyrogenic. repeated injections of bacterial peptidoglycan to rabbit result in tolerance to the fever effect. cross-tolerance was recorded only exceptionally. rabbits tolerant to endotoxin respond with a lower fever to s. aureus and group a streptococcus peptidoglycans. intravenous administration of peptidoglycan to rabbit causes extensive alterations in the heart characterized by various stages  of the degenerative and necrotic process. local shwartzman reaction can be elicited in rabbit by peptidoglycan used either as a preparative or as a provocative dose in combination with endotoxin, or it can be used for both doses. the results obtained with peptidoglycans prepared from various bacteria are fully comparable. non-specific resistance of mice to infection induced by streptococcus cell walls was found to be dependent on the peptidoglycan activity; cell wall proteins and polysaccharide are inactive. these properties of peptidoglycan resemble those known from endotoxin studies. the data presented suggest the role  of peptidoglycan in pathological reactions resulting from host-parasite interaction.

TI  == effect of sodium cyanate upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclaer leukocytes.
AB  == sodium cyanate, a drug that prevents sickling of hemoglobin s by virtue of its irreversible carbamylation of the n-terminal amino group of valine, was studied for its effect upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclear luekocytes. in concentrations of 500 and 100 mug/ml, sodium cyanate was found to inhibit killing by neutrophils of staphylococcus epidermidis and eschierichia coli but not of streptococcus faecalis. viability of cells and phagocytosis were not affected by  cyanate; however, production of [14-c] carbon dioxide from [1-14-c] glucose and the iodination of 125-i during phagocytosis were significantly impaired. cyanate  is thought to inbibit the bacterixidal activity of neutrophils by interfering with the oxidative metabolism of gluxose via the hexose monophosphate shunt (theraby decreasing production of h-2-o-2) and by inbibiting iodination of ingested bacteria (either by competing with iodide as the oxidizable cofactor or  by inhibiting myeloperoxidase). since these effects of cyanate were all reversible by washing the nurtrophils free of the drug, it is unlikely that they  are due to amino carbamylation.

TI  == the effectiveness of various antibiotics in methyl methacrylate.
AB  == the effectiveness of different antibiotics mixed with simplex p has been tested in vitro. a laboratory model was designed to simulate the constant immersion of bone cement in tissue fluid. clindamycin, and to a lesser extent cephalothin, were shown to be effective when used in this manner against staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis. effective inhibition of gram-negative organisms could not be demonstrated with any of the antibiotics tested. the addition of up to 3 grams of antibiotic powder per unit of 40 grams of simplex p did not appear to alter the expansive properties of the cement. such release of antibiotics as did occur was  thought to be related to the slow absorption of water by the slightly porous methyl methacrylate.

TI  == biological defense mechanisms. evidence for the participation of superoxide in bacterial killing by xanthine oxidase.
AB  == incubation of either staphylococcus epidermidis or escherichia coli with a sufficiently high concentration of xanthine oxidase, an enzyme capable of reducing oxygen to superoxide (o2-), resulted in the death of the microorganisms. protection against the killing os s. epidermidis by xanthine oxidase was afforded by superoxide dismutase, an enzyme which converts o2- to o2 and h2o2, and also by catalase, which destroys h2o2. these findings indicate that neither o2- nor h2o2  were able to kill s. epidermidis under the experimental conditions, but that the  bactericidal agent was the product of a reaction between o2- and h2o2. by contrast, e. coli was protected by catalase but not by superoxide dismutase. with this organism, therefore, h2o2 appears to have been the bactericidal agent.

TI  == susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  == the susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. the three strains of listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. there was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of salmonellae, citrobacter sp., enterobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas sp. cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., serratia sp., indole-positive proteus sp., providence sp., flavobacter sp., herellea vaginicola, and mima polymorpha. cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against bacteroides sp. thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.

TI  == lipid peroxidation by human blood phagocytes.
AB  == cell suspensions enriched in human blood monocytes, obtained from normal peripheral blood by sedimentation on sodium diatrizoate-ficoll gradients or from  the blood of patients with neutropenia and monocytosis, accumulated malonyldialdehyde, a labile catabolite of lipid peroxidation, during incubations  with polystyrene beads or heat-killed staphylococcus epidermidis. mixed blood leukocytes principally composed of granulocytes or granulocytes purified by density gradient sedimentation did not accumulate malonyldialdehyde during incubations with these particles, but did when ingesting particles containing linolenate. the phospholipid fatty acid composition of monocyte-enriched and purified granulocyte preparations from the same donors were compared. the molar fraction of arachidonate (20:4) in phospholipids from monocyte-rich preparations  was 62% greater than that of purified granulocytes. the findings indicate that human monocytes, possibly because of a greater content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in their membranes, peroxidize a greater quantity of endogenous lipids than granulocytes during endocytosis. normal human granulocytes have the capacity to peroxidize ingested lipids. however, mixed leukocytes from two patients with chronic granulomatous disease produced little malonyldialdehyde when engulfing linolenate-containing particles. therefore the capacity to peroxidize lipid is related to cellular oxygen metabolism, a function in which chronic granulomatous  disease granulocytes are dificient. malonyldialdehyde chemically prepared by hydrolysis of tetramethoxypropane, by extraction from peroxidized linolenic acid, or purified from extracts of phagocytizing rabbit alveolar macrophages had bactericidal activity against escherichia coli and s. epidermidis. therefore, toxic catabolites of lipid hydroperoxides may potentiate the bactericidal activity of hydrogen peroxide in mononuclear phagocytes.

TI  == enhanced toxicity for mice of 6-mercaptopurine with bacterial endotoxin.
AB  == the toxicity of 6-mercaptopurine was potentiated by 2 mg of either escherichia coli 026:b6 b endotoxin or salmonella typhosa 0901 w endotoxin per kg. nonlethal  doses of heat-killed, gram-negative bacteria were also capable of potentiating the lethality of 6-mercaptopurine (6-mp). salmonella minnesota s, the wild-type strain, and s. minnesota re 595, a mutant containing only the lipid a and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate moiety of the endotoxin molecule, exhibited the same capability to enhance the toxic action of 6-mp. endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [lps]) did not affect the clearance of 6-mp from the circulation, but did alter its apparent metabolism as indicated by blood levels of a metabolite, 6-thiouric  acid. the concentration of blood urea nitrogen (bun) in mice 18 h after injection of 100 mg of 6-mp per kg simultaneously with 2 mg of lps per kg was significantly elevated over normal values. however, these bun values were significantly less than those resulting from the administration of one mean lethal dose of either agent. the clearance from the circulation of the gram-negative organism e. coli hb, or the gram-positive organism staphylococcus epidermidis s, was not affected  by 6-mp. endotoxin had no effect on the clearance of s. epidermidis s, but inhibited that of e. coli hb. when 6-mp and lps were administered simultaneously  with either bacterial species, only the clearance of e. coli hb was inhibited. mice were protected from the lethality associated with combinations of 6-mp and lps by (i) prior treatment with phenobarbital, (ii) caffeine, (iii) methylprednisolone, and (iv) polymyxin b sulfate. with the exception of caffeine, each regimen protected mice against the lethal effects of 400 mg of 6-mp per kg,  and methylprednisolone or polymyxin b protected mice against 8 mg of lps per kg.

AB  == fusariotoxin t-2 is a mycotoxin produced by fusarium tricinctum which was implicated in moldy corn toxicosis of farm animals. graded concentrations of dietary fusariotoxin t-2 (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 mug/g, respectively) were given to groups of 40 chickens. raised yellowish-white lesions on the mouth parts were  produced by all concentrations, and the size of the lesions was dose-related. the growth rate was reduced significantly (p < 0.05) by concentrations of 4, 8, and 16 mug/g. the mouth fluid of the affected birds contained greatly increased numbers of bacteria, including staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli, which proved avirulent when inoculated into scarified tissue of control birds. microscopy examinations of the lesions revealed a fibrinous surface layer, intermediate layers containing invaginations filled with rods and cocci, and a heavy infiltration of the underlying tissues with granular leukocytes. these data suggest that the role of fusariotoxin t-2 in field cases of moldy corn toxicosis  should be reinvestigated since oral lesions were not mentioned in the original descriptions of the disease. however, the lesions bear some features of those characteristic of the third or septic angina stage of alimentary toxic aleukia, a nutritional toxicosis of humans produced by eating grains infested with f. tricinctum.

TI  == influence of glucose levels on the in vitro phagocytosis of bacteria by human neutrophils.
AB  == a previously developed in vitro method for studying the phagocytosis of bacteria  and particles by human neutrophils was used to investigate the influence of different glucose levels on phagocytosis. it was found that high glucose levels (200, 400, and 800 mg of glucose/100 ml) significantly depressed the phagocytosis of staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, and escherichia coli. at very low glucose levels, a somewhat decreased phagocytic activity was noted. the strongest phagocytic activity occurred at glucose concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/100 ml. a second effect noted at the higher (200, 400 and 800 mg/100 ml) glucose concentrations was a decreased adhesiveness of the neutrophils to solid surfaces. the mechanism of the decrease in phagocytosis and in neutrophil adhesiveness at higher glucose levels is unknown, but it is not linked to increased osmotic pressures due to the presence of glucose, as ethanol, at the same and even higher osmolal concentrations, had no effect on the phagocytosis. these results show that not only the phagocytic activity of those neutrophils that do adhere to a solid surface is diminished at higher glucose concentrations but also that fewer  neutrophils adhere to solid surfaces at higher glucose levels. these two phenomena combined may provide at least part of the explanation for the well-known decrease in resistance to bacterial infections of diabetics.
