TI  == [new insight into bacterial zoonotic pathogens posing health hazards to humans].
AB  == this article presents the problem of evolutionary changes of zoonotic pathogens responsible for human diseases. everyone is exposed to the risk of zoonotic infection, particularly employees having direct contact with animals, i.e. veterinarians, breeders, butchers and workers of animal products' processing industry. the article focuses on pathogens monitored by the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc), which has been collecting statistical data on zoonoses from all european union countries for 19 years and publishing collected data in annual epidemiological reports. currently, the most important 11 pathogens responsible for causing human zoonotic diseases are being monitored, of which seven are bacteria: salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium bovis, brucella spp., coxiella burnetti and verotoxin-producing e. coli (vtec)/shiga-like toxin producing e. coli (stec). as  particularly important are considered foodborne pathogens. the article also includes new emerging zoonotic bacteria, which are not currently monitored by ecdc but might pose a serious epidemiological problem in a foreseeable future: streptococcus iniae, s. suis, s. dysgalactiae and staphylococci: staphylococcus intermedius, s. pseudintermedius. those species have just crossed the animal-human interspecies barrier. the exact mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown, it is connected, however, with genetic variability, capability to survive in changing environment. these abilities derive from dna rearrangement and horizontal gene transfer between bacterial cells. substantial increase in the number of scientific publications on this subject, observed over the last few years, illustrates the importance of the problem.

TI  == aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  == in a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in grenada, west indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth,  nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. a total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to  species level and 46 to genus level. a commercial bacterial identification system (api/biomerieux), was used for this purpose. the most common species was escherichia coli (n=60), followed by staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), s. hominis (16), s. haemolyticus (12), streptococcus canis (9), proteus mirabilis (8), pasteurella multocida (7), streptococcus mitis (7), staphylococcus xylosus (7), s. capitis (6), s. chromogenes (4), s. sciuri (3), s. auricularis (2), s. lentus (2), s. hyicus (2), streptococcus suis (2) and pseudomonas argentinensis (2). sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. a molecular method  using 16s rrna sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. e. coli and s. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. s. felis/simulans was the most  common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. p. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. staphylococcus aureus, or s. intemedius/s. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested  against, including tetracycline.
