TI  == one-step high-efficiency crispr/cas9-mediated genome editing in streptomyces.
AB  == the rna-guided dna editing technology crisprs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/cas9 had been used to introduce double-stranded breaks into genomes and to direct subsequent site-specific insertions/deletions or the replacement of genetic material in bacteria, such as escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumonia, and lactobacillus reuteri. in this study, we established a high-efficiency crispr/cas9 genome editing plasmid pkccas9do for use in streptomyces genetic manipulation, which comprises a target-specific guide rna, a codon-optimized cas9, and two homology-directed repair templates. by delivering pkccas9do series editing plasmids into the model strain streptomyces coelicolor m145, through one-step intergeneric transfer, we achieved the genome editing at different levels with high efficiencies of 60%-100%, including single gene deletion, such as actii-orf4, redd, and glnr, and single large-size gene cluster  deletion, such as the antibiotic biosynthetic clusters of actinorhodin (act) (21.3 kb), undecylprodigiosin (red) (31.6 kb), and ca(2+)-dependent antibiotic (82.8 kb). furthermore, we also realized simultaneous deletions of actii-orf4 and redd, and of the act and red biosynthetic gene clusters with high efficiencies of 54% and 45%, respectively. finally, we applied this system to introduce nucleotide point mutations into the rpsl gene, which conferred the mutants with resistance to streptomycin. notably, using this system, the time required for one round of genome modification is reduced by one-third or one-half of those for conventional methods. these results clearly indicate that the established crispr/cas9 genome editing system substantially improves the genome editing efficiency compared with the currently existing methods in streptomyces, and it has promise for application to genome modification in other actinomyces species.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of lactobacillus reuteri on cariogenic bacteria streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, and periodontal diseases actinomyces naeslundii and tannerella forsythia.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are well known for their beneficial effects on human health in the intestine and immune system; however, there are few studies on the  impact they can generate in oral health. the aim of this study was to test and compare in vitro antimicrobial activity of l. reuteri on pathogenic bacteria involved in the formation of dental caries: s. mutans, s. gordonii, and periodontal disease: a. naeslundii and t. forsythia. also, we determined the growth kinetics of each bacterium involved in this study. before determining the  antimicrobial action of l. reuteri on cariogenic bacteria and periodontal disease, the behavior and cell development time of each pathogenic bacterium were studied. once the conditions for good cell growth of each of selected pathogens were established according to their metabolic requirements, maximum exponential growth was determined, this being the reference point for analyzing the development or inhibition by lab using the kirby bauer method. chlorhexidine 0.12 % was positive control. l. reuteri was shown to have an inhibitory effect against s. mutans, followed by t. forsythia and s. gordonii, and a less significant effect against a. naeslundii. regarding the effect shown by l. reuteri on the two major pathogens, we consider its potential use as a possible functional food in the prevention or treatment of oral diseases.
