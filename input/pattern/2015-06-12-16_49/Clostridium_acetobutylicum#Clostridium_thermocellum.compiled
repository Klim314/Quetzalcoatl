TI  - Secretion and assembly of functional mini-cellulosomes from synthetic chromosomal operons in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) is reliant on the simultaneous enzyme production, saccharification of biomass, and fermentation of released sugars into valuable products such as butanol. Clostridial species that produce butanol are, however, unable to grow on crystalline cellulose. In contrast, those saccharolytic species that produce predominantly ethanol, such as Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulolyticum, degrade crystalline cellulose with high efficiency due to their possession of a multienzyme complex termed the cellulosome. This has led to studies directed at endowing butanol-producing species with the genetic potential to produce a cellulosome, albeit by localising the necessary transgenes to unstable autonomous plasmids. Here we have explored the potential of our previously described Allele-Coupled Exchange (ACE) technology for creating strains of the butanol producing species Clostridium acetobutylicum in which the genes encoding the various cellulosome components are stably integrated into the genome. RESULTS: We used BioBrick2 (BB2) standardised parts to assemble a range of synthetic genes encoding C. thermocellum cellulosomal scaffoldin proteins (CipA variants) and glycoside hydrolases (GHs, Cel8A, Cel9B, Cel48S and Cel9K) as well as synthetic cellulosomal operons that direct the synthesis of Cel8A, Cel9B and a truncated form of CipA. All synthetic genes and operons were integrated into the C. acetobutylicum genome using the recently developed ACE technology. Heterologous protein expression levels and mini-cellulosome self-assembly were assayed by western blot and native PAGE analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the successful expression, secretion and self-assembly of cellulosomal subunits by the recombinant C. acetobutylicum strains, providing a platform for the construction of novel cellulosomes.
TI  - Enhancement of photoheterotrophic biohydrogen production at elevated temperatures by the expression of a thermophilic clostridial hydrogenase.
AB  - The working temperature of a photobioreactor under sunlight can be elevated above the optimal growth temperature of a microorganism. To improve the biohydrogen productivity of photosynthetic bacteria at higher temperatures, a [FeFe]-hydrogenase gene from the thermophile Clostridium thermocellum was expressed in the mesophile Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009 (strain CGA-CThydA) using a log-phase expression promoter P( pckA ) to drive the expression of heterogeneous hydrogenase gene. In contrast, a mesophilic Clostridium acetobutylicum [FeFe]-hydrogenase gene was also constructed and expressed in R. palustris (strain CGA-CAhydA). Both transgenic strains were tested for cell growth, in vivo hydrogen production rate, and in vitro hydrogenase activity at elevated temperatures. Although both CGA-CThydA and CGA-CAhydA strains demonstrated enhanced growth over the vector control at temperatures above 38 degrees C, CGA-CThydA produced more hydrogen than the other strains. The in vitro hydrogenase activity assay, measured at 40 degrees C, confirmed that the activity of the CGA-CThydA hydrogenase was higher than the CGA-CAhydA hydrogenase. These results showed that the expression of a thermophilic [FeFe]-hydrogenase in R. palustris increased the growth rate and biohydrogen production at elevated temperatures. This transgenic strategy can be applied to a broad range of purple photosynthetic bacteria used to produce biohydrogen under sunlight.
TI  - ClosTron-mediated engineering of Clostridium.
AB  - The genus Clostridium is a diverse assemblage of Gram positive, anaerobic, endospore-forming bacteria. Whilst certain species have achieved notoriety as important animal and human pathogens (e.g. Clostridium difficile, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium tetani, and Clostridium perfringens), the vast majority of the genus are entirely benign, and are able to undertake all manner of useful biotransformations. Prominent amongst them are those species able to produce the biofuels, butanol and ethanol from biomass-derived residues, such as Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium beijerinkii, Clostridium thermocellum, and Clostridium phytofermentans. The prominence of the genus in disease and biotechnology has led to the need for more effective means of genetic modification. The historical absence of methods based on conventional strategies for "knock-in" and "knock-out" in Clostridium has led to the adoption of recombination-independent procedures, typified by ClosTron technology. The ClosTron uses a retargeted group II intron and a retro-transposition-activated marker to selectively insert DNA into defined sites within the genome, to bring about gene inactivation and/or cargo DNA delivery. The procedure is extremely efficient, rapid, and requires minimal effort by the operator.
TI  - Butanol production from crystalline cellulose by cocultured Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4.
AB  - We investigated butanol production from crystalline cellulose by cocultured cellulolytic Clostridium thermocellum and the butanol-producing strain, Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum (strain N1-4). Butanol was produced from Avicel cellulose after it was incubated with C. thermocellum for at least 24 h at 60 degrees C before the addition of strain N1-4. Butanol produced by strain N1-4 on 4% Avicel cellulose peaked (7.9 g/liter) after 9 days of incubation at 30 degrees C, and acetone was undetectable in this coculture system. Less butanol was produced by cocultured Clostridium acetobutylicum and Clostridium beijerinckii than by strain N1-4, indicating that strain N1-4 was the optimal strain for producing butanol from crystalline cellulose in this coculture system.
TI  - Small RNAs in the genus Clostridium.
AB  - The genus Clostridium includes major human pathogens and species important to cellulose degradation, the carbon cycle, and biotechnology. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are emerging as crucial regulatory molecules in all organisms, but they have not been investigated in clostridia. Research on sRNAs in clostridia is hindered by the absence of a systematic method to identify sRNA candidates, thus delegating clostridial sRNA research to a hit-and-miss process. Thus, we wanted to develop a method to identify potential sRNAs in the Clostridium genus to open up the field of sRNA research in clostridia. Using comparative genomics analyses combined with predictions of rho-independent terminators and promoters, we predicted sRNAs in 21 clostridial genomes: Clostridium acetobutylicum, C. beijerinckii, C. botulinum (eight strains), C. cellulolyticum, C. difficile, C. kluyveri (two strains), C. novyi, C. perfringens (three strains), C. phytofermentans, C. tetani, and C. thermocellum. Although more than one-third of predicted sRNAs have Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences, only one-sixth have a start codon downstream of SD sequences; thus, most of the predicted sRNAs are noncoding RNAs. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) and Northern analysis were employed to test the presence of a randomly chosen set of sRNAs in C. acetobutylicum and several C. botulinum strains, leading to the confirmation of a large fraction of the tested sRNAs. We identified a conserved, novel sRNA which, together with the downstream gene coding for an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene, responds to the antibiotic clindamycin. The number of predicted sRNAs correlated with the physiological function of the species (high for pathogens, low for cellulolytic, and intermediate for solventogenic), but not with 16S rRNA-based phylogeny.
TI  - Production of heterologous and chimeric scaffoldins by Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 converts sugars and various polysaccharides into acids and solvents. This bacterium, however, is unable to utilize cellulosic substrates, since it is able to secrete very small amounts of cellulosomes. To promote the utilization of crystalline cellulose, the strategy we chose aims at producing heterologous minicellulosomes, containing two different cellulases bound to a miniscaffoldin, in C. acetobutylicum. A first step toward this goal describes the production of miniCipC1, a truncated form of CipC from Clostridium cellulolyticum, and the hybrid scaffoldin Scaf 3, which bears an additional cohesin domain derived from CipA from Clostridium thermocellum. Both proteins were correctly matured and secreted in the medium, and their various domains were found to be functional.
TI  - Phylogenetic reconstruction of Gram-positive organisms based on comparative sequence analysis of molecular chaperones from the ruminal microorganism Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1.
AB  - Primers designed on the basis of nucleotide sequences conserved in DnaK and GroEL from Gram-positive organisms were used to PCR amplify internal regions of the cognate genes from the anaerobic ruminal cellulolytic bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1. Genome walking was then utilized to elucidate the remainder of the sequences in addition to upstream and downstream regions. The full sequence of the gene encoding the GroES protein (groES) was found directly upstream from groEL. The deduced amino acid sequence of the groEL gene showed the highest homology with the amino acid sequence of the Clostridium thermocellum GroEL protein (72% amino acid identity). Similarly, translation of the groES nucleotide sequence showed highest homology to the C. thermocellum GroES protein (61% amino acid identity). Analysis of the upstream region of this chaperonin operon revealed a CIRCE regulatory element 45 bp upstream from the putative start of the groES ORF. The deduced amino acid sequence of the putative dnaK gene showed the highest homology with the amino acid sequence of the Clostridium acetobutylicum DnaK protein (68% amino acid identity). Phylogenetic analyses based on the translated sequences reiterate this relationship between R. flavefaciens and the Clostridia. However, when the nucleotide sequences of Gram-positive organisms are analyzed, a different topology occurs of the relationship between high- and low-G+C Gram-positive organisms to the 16S rRNA interpretation.
TI  - Physiology of carbohydrate to solvent conversion by clostridia.
AB  - The solvent-forming clostridia have attracted interest because of their ability to convert a range of carbohydrates to end-products such as acetone, butanol and ethanol. Polymeric substrates such as cellulose, hemicellulose and starch are degraded by extracellular enzymes. The majority of cellulolytic clostridia, typified by Clostridium thermocellum, produce a multi-enzyme cellulase complex in which the organization of components is critical for activity against the crystalline substrate. A variety of enzymes involved in degradation of hemicellulose and starch have been identified in different strains. The products of degradation, and other soluble substrates, are accumulated via membrane-bound transport systems which are generally poorly characterized. It is clear, however, that the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) plays a major role in solute uptake in several species. Accumulated substrates are converted by intracellular enzymes to end-products characteristic of the organism, with production of ATP to support growth. The metabolic pathways have been described, but understanding of mechanisms of regulation of metabolism is incomplete. Synthesis of extracellular enzymes and membrane-bound transport systems is commonly subject to catabolite repression in the presence of a readily metabolized source of carbon and energy. While many genes encoding cellulases, xylanases and amylases have been cloned and sequenced, little is known of control of their expression. Although the mechanism of catabolite repression in clostridia is not understood, some recent findings implicate a role for the PTS as in other low G-C Gram-positive bacteria. Emphasis has been placed on describing the mechanisms underlying the switch of C. acetobutylicum fermentations from acidogenic to solventogenic metabolism at the end of the growth phase. Factors involved include a lowered pH and accumulation of undissociated butyric acid, intracellular concentration of ATP and reduced pyridine nucleotides, nutrient limitation, and the interplay between pathways of carbon and electron flow. Genes encoding enzymes of solvent pathways have been cloned and sequenced, and their expression correlated with the pattern of end-product formation in fermentations. There is evidence that the initiation of solvent formation may be subject to control mechanisms similar to other stationary-phase phenomena, including sporulation. The application of recently developed techniques for genetic manipulation of the bacterium is improving understanding of the regulatory circuits, but a complete molecular description of the control of solvent formation remains elusive. Experimental manipulation of the pathways of electron flow in other species has been shown to influence the range and yield of fermentation end-products. Acid-forming clostridia can, under appropriate conditions, be induced to form atypical solvents as products. While the mechanisms of regulation of gene expression are not at all understood, the capacity to adapt in this way further illustrates the metabolic flexibility of clostridial strains.
TI  - Sequence and transcriptional analysis of groES and groEL genes from the thermophilic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - The groESL operon from Clostridium thermocellum (Ct) has been isolated and sequenced, revealing two ORFs of 285 and 1626 nt, separated by 48 nt. The first ORF encoded a 94-aa 10.6-kDa GroES homologue; the second encoded a 541-aa polypeptide of 57.6 kDa, that exhibited 61% and 77% sequence identity with GroEL from Escherichia coli (Ec) and Clostridium acetobutylicum (Ca), respectively. A putative tsp, preceded by -10 and -35 consensus promoters, was identified upstream of groES. This was followed by an inverted repeat observed previously in bacterial heat shock genes. A 15-nt palindrome characteristic of a Rho-independent transcription terminator, was located downstream of groEL. The first nt of the groES translational start codon was preceded (7 nt) by a putative RBS (AGGAGG); a second RBS sequence was located 8 nt upstream of the groEL start. Production of GroE homologues by Ct was constitutive, but was enhanced significantly during a temperature upshift from 60 degrees C to 70 degrees C. The Ct GroEL, expressed in Ec as a fusion protein with GST, was purified, free of contaminating Ec GroEL.
TI  - Sigma factor and sporulation genes in Clostridium.
AB  - The genus Clostridium, represented by Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria, is well known for its clinical importance and considerable biotechnological potential. Recently, evidence for a functional role of the transcription factors sigma A, sigma E, sigma G, and sigma K in this genus was provided by cloning and sequencing these genes from C. acetobutylicum. In C. kluyveri, a partially sequenced open reading frame was found to encode the N terminus of the putative sigma factor L with significant similarity to members of the sigma 54 family. The identification of sequences with high similarity to the Bacillus sigma F (C. acetobutylicum), sigma H (several clostridial species), and sigma D (C. thermocellum)-controlled consensus promoters renders the existence of these transcription factors in clostridia very likely. These data are in agreement with information obtained by RNA transcript mapping (sigma A, sigma H), heterologous DNA hybridization (sigma D, sigma H), and immuno characterization of purified proteins (sigma A) from various clostridial species. Thus, the picture emerges that a fundamental similarity exists at the genetic level between the regulation of various cellular responses, in particular sporulation, in the genera Bacillus and Clostridium. The different induction patterns of sporulation in Bacillus spp. (nutrient starvation) and many clostridial species (cessation of growth or exposure to oxygen in the presence of excess nutrients) are most interestingly not reflected in the general regulatory features of this developmental process.
TI  - The release of fermentable carbohydrate from peat by steam explosion and its use  in the microbial production of solvents.
AB  - Steam treatment of peat at 200 degrees C for 3 min, followed by instantaneous decompression (steam explosion), solubilized up to 28% of the dry matter. Seventy-five percent of the solubilized material was carbohydrate, 33% of which was composed of mono- and disaccharides, including galactose, glucose, xylose, mannose, arabinose, and cellobiose, in order of decreasing concentration. The solubilized materials served as the sole source of carbohydrate for growth and solvent production by Clostridium acetobutylicum and C. butylicum which utilized up to 40% of the carbohydrate. Of the saccharides in this mixture, galactose was the least readily utilized. Approximately 30% of the fermentable carbohydrate used was converted to fatty acids and solvents, with the primary fermentation product being butyrate. Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum was able to utilize ca. 50% of the carbohydrate, and simultaneously produced slightly more than 1 mol ethanol/mol saccharide metabolized. This organism, like other strains tested, used galactose less readily than the other sugars. The residue from the steam explosion process contained 24% cellulose, but it could not serve as a source of carbohydrate for the growth of either Bacteroides succinogenes or Clostridium thermocellum, suggesting that inhibitors were released during the steam treatment.
