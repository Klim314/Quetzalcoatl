TI  == keratinolytic activity of cutaneous and oral bacteria.
AB  == a test was developed to measure the keratinolytic activity of cutaneous and oral  bacteria. keratin, labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, was used in a phosphate buffer (ph 7.2) with 1 mm dithiothreitol. the degradation of keratin was estimated by measuring the fluorescence of the degradation products in the supernatant of the reaction mixtures in a luminescence spectrometer. several oral and cutaneous bacteria were investigated: bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, treponema denticola, actinomyces odontolyticus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis, staphylococcus  saprophyticus, brevibacterium epidermidis, brevibacterium lines, corynebacterium  glutamicum, corynebacterium minutissimum, corynebacterium ovis, and rhodococcus equi. the dermatophyte trichophyton rubrum was used as a control organism. the test offered a simple and quantitative method for the estimation of keratin degradation and enabled us to show keratinolytic activity in trichophyton rubrum, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, b. linens, b. epidermidis, bacteroides gingivalis, and treponema denticola. the keratinolytic activity was cell bound and heat sensitive. the presence of dithiothreitol stimulated the degradation of  keratin to mainly high-molecular-weight products.
