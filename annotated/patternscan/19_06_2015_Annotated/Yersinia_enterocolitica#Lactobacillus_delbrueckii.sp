TI  == mitogenic response and probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from indigenously pickled vegetables and fermented beverages.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria from indigenous pickled vegetables and fermented beverages (fermented rice and madhuca longifolia flowers) were isolated and investigated for their functional characteristics in vitro as potential new probiotic strains. four isolates (all lactobacillus spp.) selected on the basis of high tolerance to bile (0.2%) were identified by standard and molecular methods (16s rdna) as l. helveticus, l. casei, l. delbrueckii and l. bulgaricus from pickled vegetables and fermented beverages respectively. these selected strains had antibiotic resistance, tolerance to artificial gastric juice and phenol (0.4%), enzymatic profile, and antagonistic activity against enteric pathogens (enterobacter sakazakii, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri 2a, listeria monocytogenes,  yersinia enterocolitica and aeromonas hydrophila). all strains survived well in artificial gastric juice at low ph (3.0) values for 4 h, possessed bile salt hydrolase activity and were susceptible to most antibiotics including vancomycin. additionally, the isolates exhibited high tolerance to phenol, high cell surface  hydrophobicity (>60%) and induced proliferation of murine splenocytes. all the four strains of present study suppressed the con a-stimulated proliferation of the mouse spleen cells, although l. casei had the strongest suppressive effect. the results of this study suggest a potential application of the strains (following human clinical trials), for developing probiotic foods.

TI  == production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  == a total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. for detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. lactobacillus sake lb790, listeria monocytogenes li6, staphylococcus aureus st44 and escherichia coli nrrl b-3704 were used as indicator organisms. strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against clostridium perfringens 4ttk, clostridium botulinum type a. 7948,  bacillus cereus nrrl b-3711, micrococcus luteus nrrl b-4376 and yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following:  19 lactobacillus plantarum, 4 l. curvatus, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 p. acidilactici, 2 l. pentosus, 2 l. sake, 1 l. delbrueckii, 1 l. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified lactobacillus spp. p. pentosaceus 416, p. acidilactici 413, 419 and  446, l. curvatus 348, l. plantarum 452 and 495, and lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.

TI  == detection and characterization of a novel antibacterial substance produced by a lactobacillus delbrueckii strain 1043.
AB  == a novel antibacterial substance produced by a strain isolated from bulgarian yellow cheese was characterized. the producer strain was identified by molecular  typing to belong to the species lactobacillus delbrueckii, which is a rare producer of bacteriocins. the inhibitory agent was heat stable and active against lactic acid bacteria species and several food-borne pathogens: listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. its sensitivity to amylolitic  enzymes and lipase suggested that a lipid and carbohydrate moiety could be important for the activity. the amino acid content of the purified bacteriocin was estimated to 29 amino acids. the bacteriocin was shown to be small (3.6-6 kda) by three different methods: hplc gel-filtration, sds-page and amino acid contents.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus thermophilus 81.
AB  == a new bacteriocin, produced by streptococcus thermophilus 81 has been isolated, purified and characterized. by its heat sensitivity and broad inhibitory spectrum it does not resemble any other s. thermophilus bacteriocin. the mode of action is bacteriostatic. this peptide of 32 amino acids is efficient against several bacillus species, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia enterocolitica. this bacteriocin is heat labile but its activity was not altered by ph variation from 3 to 10. six months of storage at 40 degrees c did not influence the activity. the inactivation by detergents and the inability to resolve the protein in sds-page supposes a more complex structure or a possible stabilizing effect of other molecules. the low sensitivity of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to  the isolated bacteriocin suggests that s. thermophilus 81 may be used in yoghurt  starters.
