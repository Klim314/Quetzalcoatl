TI  == development and pyrosequencing analysis of an in-vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  == background: dental caries and periodontal disease are the commonest bacterial diseases of man and can result in tooth loss. the principal method of prevention  is the mechanical removal of dental plaque augmented by active agents incorporated into toothpastes and mouthrinses. in-vitro assays that include complex oral bacterial biofilms are required to accurately predict the efficacy of novel active agents in vivo. the aim of this study was to develop an oral biofilm model using the calgary biofilm device (cbd) seeded with a natural saliva inoculum and analysed by next generation sequencing. the specific objectives were to determine the reproducibility and stability of the model by comparing the composition of the biofilms over time derived from (i) the same volunteers at different time points, and (ii) different panels of volunteers. results: pyrosequencing yielded 280,093 sequences with a mean length of 432 bases after filtering. a mean of 320 and 250 otus were detected in pooled saliva and biofilm  samples, respectively. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots based on community membership and structure showed that replicate biofilm samples were highly similar and clustered together. in addition, there were no significant differences between biofilms derived from the same panel at different times using analysis of molecular variance (amova). there were significant differences between biofilms from different panels (amova, p < 0.002). pcoa revealed that there was a shift in biofilm composition between seven and 14 days (amova, p < 0.001). veillonella parvula, veillonella atypica/dispar/parvula and peptostreptococcus stomatis were the predominant otus detected in seven-day biofilms, whilst prevotella oralis, v. parvula and streptococcus constellatus were predominant in 14-day biofilms. conclusions: diverse oral biofilms were successfully grown and maintained using the cbd. biofilms derived from the same panel of volunteers were highly reproducible. this model could be used to screen  both antimicrobial-containing oral care products and also novel approaches aiming to modify plaque composition, such as pre- or probiotics.

TI  == comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == background: bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. we investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). by using culture-independent 16s rrna approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. results: dgge fingerprints showed  variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. the clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria,  fusobacteria, actinobacteria and uncultivated tm7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. in combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. bacterial species, streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, peptostreptococcus stomatis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, johnsonella ignava and streptococcus parasanguinis i were highly associated with tumor site where as granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. conclusions: the underlying changes in  the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of oscc subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. these most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be  associated with oscc and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.

TI  == peptostreptococcus russellii sp. nov., isolated from a swine-manure storage pit.
AB  == using a polyphasic approach, a taxonomic study was performed on seven strains of  an unknown gram-reaction-positive, non-spore-forming, obligately anaerobic coccus-shaped bacterium, isolated from a swine-manure storage pit. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing confirmed that all seven isolates were highly related to each other and formed a hitherto unknown lineage within the clostridial rrna xi cluster of organisms. pairwise analysis demonstrated that the novel organism was  most closely related to peptostreptococcus anaerobius ccug 7835(t) and peptostreptococcus stomatis ccug 51858(t) with 16s rrna gene sequence similarities of 95.5 and 93.0 %, respectively. the peptidoglycan type of the cell wall was determined to be a4alpha l-lys-d-asp and glucose, xylose and traces of mannose were detected as the cell-wall sugars. based on biochemical, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic evidence the unknown bacterium represents a new species of the genus peptostreptococcus, for which the name peptostreptococcus russellii sp. nov, is proposed. the type strain is rt-10b(t) ( = ccug 58235(t) =  nrrl b-59380(t) = dsm 23041(t)).

TI  == analysis of microbiota associated with peri-implantitis using 16s rrna gene clone library.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis (pi) is an inflammatory disease which leads to the destruction of soft and hard tissues around osseointegrated implants. the subgingival microbiota appears to be responsible for peri-implant lesions and although the complexity of the microbiota has been reported in pi, the microbiota responsible for pi has not been identified. objective: the purpose of this study  was to identify the microbiota in subjects who have pi, clinically healthy implants, and periodontitis-affected teeth using 16s rrna gene clone library analysis to clarify the microbial differences. design: three subjects participated in this study. the conditions around the teeth and implants were evaluated based on clinical and radiographic examinations and diseased implants,  clinically healthy implants, and periodontally diseased teeth were selected. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest pockets using sterile paper points. prevalence and identity of bacteria was analyzed using a 16s rrna gene clone library technique. results: a total of 112 different species were identified from 335 clones sequenced. among the 112 species, 51 (46%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which 22 were novel phylotypes. the numbers of bacterial species identified at the sites of pi, periodontitis, and periodontally healthy implants were 77, 57, and 12, respectively. microbiota in pi mainly included gram-negative species and the composition was more diverse when compared to that of the healthy implant and periodontitis. the phyla chloroflexi, tenericutes, and synergistetes were only detected at pi sites, as were parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus stomatis, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and solobacterium moorei. low levels of periodontopathic bacteria, such as porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were seen in  peri-implant lesions. conclusions: the biofilm in pi showed a more complex microbiota when compared to periodontitis and periodontally healthy teeth, and it was mainly composed of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. common periodontopathic  bacteria showed low prevalence, and several bacteria were identified as candidate pathogens in pi.

TI  == development of 16s rrna-based probes for the identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  == fluorescent probes targeted at 16s rrna were designed for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus stomatis (pana134), parvimonas micra (pamic1435), finegoldia magna (fmag1250), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (pnasa1254), peptoniphilus ivorii (pnivo731), peptoniphilus harei (pnhar1466), anaerococcus vaginalis (avag1280) and anaerococcus lactolyticus (alac1438), based on the 16s rrna sequences of reference strains and 88 randomly chosen clinical isolates. these strains were also used for validation of the probes. application  of the probes to an additional group of 100 clinical isolates revealed that 87% of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) could be identified with this set of probes. the 16s rrnas of 13 clinical isolates that could not be identified were sequenced. most of these isolates were gpac that were not targeted by the probes. no clinical isolates of pn. asaccharolyticus were encountered. near full-length sequences were obtained from 71 of 101 (n = 88 + 13) sequenced clinical isolates. of these, 25 showed <98% similarity with the homologues of the closest established species. the fmag1250, pamic1435, pnhar1466, pana134, pnasa1254 and pnivo731 probes allowed reliable identification and hybridised with all corresponding isolates. the avag1280 and alac1438 probes failed to hybridise with two isolates and one isolate, respectively, because of intra-species variation. however, overall, the set of probes yielded fast and reliable identification for  the majority of clinical isolates.

TI  == prospective study of bacteremia and complications with eus fna of rectal and perirectal lesions.
AB  == background & aims: recent studies showed that endoscopic ultrasound (eus)-guided  fine-needle aspiration (fna) is a low-risk procedure for causing bacteremia and infectious complications when sampling solid lesions of the upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract. as a result, antibiotics are not recommended for prophylaxis against endocarditis. our aim was to prospectively evaluate the risk  of bacteremia and other infectious complications in patients undergoing eus fna of lower gi tract lesions. methods: patients referred for eus fna of lower gi tract lesions were considered for enrollment. patients were excluded if there was an indication for preprocedure antibiotic administration based on american society for gastrointestinal endoscopy guidelines, had taken antibiotics within the prior 7 days, or if they had a cystic lesion. blood cultures were obtained immediately before the procedure, after flexible sigmoidoscopy/radial eus, and 15 minutes after eus fna. results: one hundred patients underwent a total of 471 fnas (mean, 4.7 fnas/patient; range, 1-10 fnas/patient). blood cultures were positive in 6 patients. cultures from 4 patients (4.0%, 95% confidence interval,  1.6%-9.8%) grew coagulase-negative staphylococcus (n = 2), peptostreptococcus stomatis (n = 1), or moraxella (n = 1), which were considered contaminants. two patients (2.0%, 95% confidence interval, 0.6%-7%) developed bacteremia: bacteroides fragilis (n = 1) and gemella morbillorum (n = 1). no signs or symptoms of infection developed in any patient. conclusions: eus fna of solid lesions in the lower gi tract should be considered a low-risk procedure for infectious complications that does not warrant prophylactic administration of antibiotics for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and the newly described peptostreptococcus stomatis isolated from various human sources.
AB  == peptostreptococcus anaerobius sensu lato, currently including two closely related species, p. anaerobius and p. stomatis, is known to be more resistant than other  gram-positive anaerobic cocci. we reidentified potential peptostreptococcus isolates and tested their susceptibilities to eight antimicrobials. notably, p. anaerobius had constantly higher values for the mic at which 50% of the isolates  are inhibited (mic(50)) and the mic(90) than p. stomatis.

TI  == peptostreptococcus stomatis sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == seven strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci isolated from human oral sites were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that the strains constituted a homogeneous group that was distinct from species with validly published names, but related to peptostreptococcus anaerobius. all oral strains tested belonged to this group, whereas all non-oral strains studied were confirmed as p. anaerobius. a novel species, peptostreptococcus stomatis sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these oral strains. p. stomatis is weakly saccharolytic and produces acetic, butyric, isobutyric, isovaleric and isocaproic acids as end products of fermentation. the  type strain of p. stomatis is w2278t (=dsm 17678t = ccug 51858t); the g+c content of the dna of this strain is 36 mol%.
