TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

TI  == utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  == human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are not digested in the proximal intestine. in distal intestine, hmos collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the hmos is not well defined. here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated hmos in anaerobic culture. this allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific hmos on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. most bifidobacteria spp. and bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-l-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (scfas) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-fl), 3-fl, and lactodifucotetraose (ldft). lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and streptococcus thermophilus atcc19258 exhibited slight growth, ph reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-fl or 3-fl, but not ldft. supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-sl) and 6'-sl promoted moderate growth of bifidobacterium longum jcm7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, atcc15708, bacteroides vulgatus atcc8482, and b. thetaiotaomicron atcc29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, scfa, or both. lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830 also consumed 6'-sl. in contrast, clostridium spp., l. rhamnosus atcc53103, e. faecalis atcc29200, staphylococcus spp., enterobacter spp., and escherichia coli k12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. specific bifidobacteria and bacteroides differentially digest specific individual hmos, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. this suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.

TI  == evaluation of lactic acid bacteria and yeast diversity in traditional white pickled and fresh soft cheeses from the mountain regions of serbia and lowland regions of croatia.
AB  == the goal of this study was the characterisation of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts isolated from nine white pickled (bg) and nine fresh soft (zg) artisanal cheeses collected in serbia and croatia. while lab were present in all of the cheeses collected, yeasts were found in all bg cheeses but  only in three zg cheese samples. high lab and yeast species diversity was determined (average h'(l)=0.4 and h'(y)=0.8, respectively). the predominant lab species in white pickled (bg) cheeses were lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, while in fresh soft (zg) cheeses the most dominant lab species were l. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and leuconostoc  pseudomesenteroides. among the 20 yeast species found, debaryomyces hansenii, candida zeylanoides, and torulaspora delbrueckii were found to be predominant in  bg cheeses, while yarrowia lipolytica was predominant in zg cheeses. the characterisation of metabolic and technological potentials revealed that 53.4% of lab isolates produced antimicrobial compounds, 44.3% of lab strains showed proteolytic activity, while most of the yeast species possessed either lipolytic  or proteolytic activity. in conclusion, the results obtained in this study showed that the composition of lab and yeast populations in white pickled and fresh soft cheeses is region specific. the knowledge gained in this study could eventually be used to select region specific lab and yeast strains for the production of white pickled and fresh soft artisanal cheeses with geographically specific origins under controlled conditions.

TI  == determination of the mode of action of enterolysin a, produced by enterococcus faecalis b9510.
AB  == aim: the current study aimed to visualize the damage caused by enterolysin a to the cells of sensitive strains and to find out cleavage site within the peptidoglycan moiety of bacterial cell walls. methods and results: enterolysin a  produced by a local isolate, enterococcus faecalis b9510 was found to rapidly kill cells of the sensitive strain lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris 2144 during 120 min of treatment as compared to the untreated control where no such effect was observed. transmission electron microscopy of the enterolysin a-treated cells revealed leaking of the cytoplasmic contents ultimately resulting in complete lysis of cell walls. to find the cleavage site, purified cell walls of l. lactis  ssp. cremoris 2144, pediococcus pentosaceus 43201 and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 were treated with enterolysin a, and liberated amino acids were derivatized for n and c terminals and analysed using thin layer chromatography on silica gel with isopropanol as solvent. the results showed that enterolysin a cleaves the peptide bonds at two locations within peptidoglycan subunits. the first location is between l-alanine and d-glutamic acid of the stem peptide and the other location is between l-lysine of the stem peptide and d-aspartic acid of the interpeptide bridge. conclusions: enterolysin a cleaves the peptide bonds within the stem peptide as well as in the interpeptide bridge of gram-positive bacterial cell walls. this gives a possible reason for the broad spectrum of enterolysin a activity. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report identifying the cleavage site of enterolysin a within the cell walls of sensitive bacteria. this will help in identifying potential applications for enterolysin a.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == potential beneficial properties of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from smoked salmon.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the probiotic properties of strains isolated from smoked salmon and previously identified as bacteriocin producers. methods and results: strains  lactobacillus curvatus et06, et30 and et31, lactobacillus fermentum et35, lactobacillus delbrueckii et32, pediococcus acidilactici et34 and enterococcus faecium et05, et12 and et88 survived conditions simulating the gastrointestinal tract (git) and produced bacteriocins active against several strains of listeria  monocytogenes, but presented very low activity against other lactic acid bacteria (lab). cell-free supernatants containing bacteriocins, added to 3-h-old cultures  of l. monocytogenes 603, suppressed growth over 12 h. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values ranged from 7.2% for et35 to 12.1% for et05. various  degrees of co-aggregation with l. monocytogenes 603, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 19443 were observed. adherence of the bacteriocinogenic strains to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. the highest levels of hydrophobicity were recorded for lact. curvatus (61.9-64.6%), lact. fermentum (78.9%), lact. delbrueckii (43.7%) and ped. acidilactici (51.3%), which are higher than the one recorded for lact. rhamnosus gg (53.3%). these strains were highly sensitive to several antibiotics and affected by several drugs from different generic groups in a strain-dependent manner. conclusions: smoked salmon is a rich source of probiotic lab. all strains survived conditions simulating the git and produced bacteriocins active against various pathogens. adherence to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lact. rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. in addition, the high hydrophobicity readings recorded define the strains as good probiotics.

TI  == selection and use of autochthonous multiple strain cultures for the manufacture of high-moisture traditional mozzarella cheese.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum 18a, lactobacillus helveticus 2b, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis 20f, streptococcus thermophilus 22c, enterococcus faecalis 32c and enterococcus durans 16e were the most acidifying strains within  146 isolates for natural whey starters. the effect of media and temperature on 2  autochthonous multiple strain cultures (amsi: 18a, 2b, 20f and 22c, 32c and 16e and amsii: 18a, 2b, 20f and 22c) was studied. genomic analysis showed a constant  cell numbers for amsii during 16 days of propagation in whey milk. mozzarella cheese was made by using amsii, commercial starter (cs) or citric acid (da). compared to other cheeses, the da had a lower level of protein, ash, ca, free amino acids and a higher level of moisture. based on confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis, amsii cheese showed the lowest microstructural variations during the period of storage compared to other cheeses. all the sensory attributes were scored highest for amsii cheese. asmii extend the shelf-life to ca. 12-15 days instead of the 5-7 days of traditional high-moisture mozzarella cheese.

TI  == characterization of paraplantaricin c7, a novel bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus paraplantarum c7 isolated from kimchi.
AB  == a lactobacillus paraplantarum strain producing a bacteriocin was isolated from kimchi using the spot-on-the lawn method and named l. paraplantarum c7. the bacteriocin, paraplantaricin c7, was found to inhibit certain lactobacillus strains, including l. plantarum, l. pentosus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. it also inhibited enterococcus faecalis, yet did not inhibit most of the other lab (lactic acid bacteria) tested. the maximum level of paraplantaricin c7 activity was observed under the culture conditions of 25 degrees c and a constant ph of 4.5. paraplantaricin c7 retained 90% of its activity after 10 min of treatment at 100 degrees c and remained stable within a ph range of 2-8. based on a culture supernatant, paraplantaricin c7 was purified by deae-sephacel column chromatography and c18 reverse-phase hplc. sds-page and activity staining were then conducted using the purified paraplantaricin c7, and its molecular mass determined to be about 3,800 da. the 28 n-terminal amino acids from the purified  paraplantaricin c7 were determined, and the structural gene encoding paraplantaricin c7, ppnc7, was cloned by pcr using degenerate primers based on the n-terminal amino acid sequence. the nucleotide sequences for ppnc7 and other  neighboring orfs exhibited a limited homology to the previously reported plantaricin operon genes. paraplantaricin c7 is a novel type ii bacteriocin containing a double glycine leader sequence.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == a novel bacteriocin-like substance produced by enterococcus faecium 3587.
AB  == secretion of a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance from enterococcus faecium 3587 is described herein for the first time. whereas some bacteriocins receive their denomination based on the species or genus name of the producer microorganism, the newly discovered bacteriocin-like substance was named "enterocin 3587." the growth characteristics of the producer strain, as well as the type of production and the primary characteristic of the peptide, were investigated. it was found by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that the molecule possesses a molecular weight <6.5 kda; its secretion is growth-phase dependent; and it shows activities only against other closely related enterococci but not against other gram-positive bacteria, such as l. innocua, s. aureus 209, and lactobacillus delbrueckii b2, nor against some gram-negative species, such as escherichia coli hb101.

TI  == evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
AB  == to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of  the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method  under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == the potential of a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach in evaluating microbial diversity of natural whey cultures for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production: bias of  culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses.
AB  == a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (nwcs) for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production. total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing dna directly extracted from the original samples of nwc. in addition, dna extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. the 16s rdna v3 region was amplified using dna from nwc as well as dna from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by dgge.  the microbial entities occurring in nwcs were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing of dgge bands: four lactic acid bacteria (lab) closest relative of streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of dna directly extracted from nwc while two other lab, lactobacillus fermentum and enterococcus faecalis,  were identified by analyzing dna from the cultivable community. the developed pcr-dgge analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from nwc and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.

TI  == antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  == seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.

TI  == detection and characterization of a novel antibacterial substance produced by a lactobacillus delbrueckii strain 1043.
AB  == a novel antibacterial substance produced by a strain isolated from bulgarian yellow cheese was characterized. the producer strain was identified by molecular  typing to belong to the species lactobacillus delbrueckii, which is a rare producer of bacteriocins. the inhibitory agent was heat stable and active against lactic acid bacteria species and several food-borne pathogens: listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. its sensitivity to amylolitic  enzymes and lipase suggested that a lipid and carbohydrate moiety could be important for the activity. the amino acid content of the purified bacteriocin was estimated to 29 amino acids. the bacteriocin was shown to be small (3.6-6 kda) by three different methods: hplc gel-filtration, sds-page and amino acid contents.

TI  == plasmid integration in a wide range of bacteria mediated by the integrase of lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  == bacteriophage mv4 is a temperate phage infecting lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. during lysogenization, the phage integrates its genome into the host  chromosome at the 3' end of a trna(ser) gene through a site-specific recombination process (l. dupont et al., j. bacteriol., 177:586-595, 1995). a nonreplicative vector (pmc1) based on the mv4 integrative elements (attp site and integrase-coding int gene) is able to integrate into the chromosome of a wide range of bacterial hosts, including lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei  (two strains), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. integrative recombination of pmc1 into the chromosomes  of all of these species is dependent on the int gene product and occurs specifically at the pmc1 attp site. the isolation and sequencing of pmc1 integration sites from these bacteria showed that in lactobacilli, pmc1 integrated into the conserved trna(ser) gene. in the other bacterial species where this trna gene is less or not conserved; secondary integration sites either in potential protein-coding regions or in intergenic dna were used. a consensus sequence was deduced from the analysis of the different integration sites. the comparison of these sequences demonstrated the flexibility of the integrase for the bacterial integration site and suggested the importance of the trinucleotide  cct at the 5' end of the core in the strand exchange reaction.

TI  == antilisterial activity by enterococci in a model predicting the temperature evolution of taleggio, an italian soft cheese.
AB  == enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against listeria innocua and listeria monocytogenes. inhibition of l. innocua in milk by  different starter cultures was evaluated. milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h  of taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of l. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of ph decrease and bacteriocin production. overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of taleggio cheese during ripening, when l. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.

TI  == kinetic studies of the action of lactacin f, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus johnsonii that forms poration complexes in the cytoplasmic membrane.
AB  == the bacteriocin lactacin f is bactericidal against lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus, and enterococcus faecalis. activity against l. delbrueckii was recently shown to be dependent on two peptides, lafa and lafx, which are encoded within the lactacin f operon (t. r. klaenhammer, fems microbiol. rev. 12:39-87, 1993). it has been proposed that two peptides form an active lactacin f complex. in this study, the action of lactacin f against e. faecalis atcc 19443 and the effects of various environmental parameters were investigated in detail. addition of lactacin f induced the loss of k+ from cells  of l. delbrueckii, lactobacillus johnsonii 88-4, and e. faecalis, while the lactacin f producer l. johnsonii vpi 11088 was not affected by the bacteriocin. lactacin f caused an immediate loss of cellular k+, depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane, and hydrolysis of internal atp in e. faecalis. lactacin f induced loss of k+ in 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide-treated cells, indicating that pores are formed in the absence of a proton motive force. atp hydrolysis was not due to dissipation of the proton motive force but was most likely caused by efflux of inorganic phosphate, resulting in a shift of the atp hydrolysis equilibrium. action of lactacin f was optimal at acidic ph values and  was reduced in the presence of di- and trivalent cations. the lanthanide gadolinium (gd3+) prevented action of lactacin f completely at a concentration of 0.2 mm. lactacin f-induced loss of cell k+ was severely reduced at low temperatures, presumably as a result of increased ordering of the lipid hydrocarbon chains in the cytoplasmic membrane.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  == forty bacteriocin-producing (bac+) lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. of the 40 bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). by direct plating, bac+ lab were detected at levels up to 2.4 x  10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. the bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, sds-page protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; sds-page proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique bac+ isolates. bac+ lab included enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus curvatus, lb. delbrueckii, lb. plantarum, lactococcus lactis, and pediococcus acidilactici. lb. curvatus (four strains) and lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus. some lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine gram-positive genera. lb. curvatus fs47 and fs65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees c; however, lc. lactis fs56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. the high incidence of bac+ lab detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of bac+ lab that occur as natural contaminants. these data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.

TI  == heme-dependent catalase activity of lactobacilli.
AB  == the heme-dependent catalase in lactobacillus pentosus, l. sake, l. delbrueckii and enterococcus faecalis was studied. the catalase was formed by cells grown aerobically in the presence of hematin or for lactobacilli when grown without added hematin, after incubation of buffered cells in the presence of hematin. the kinetics of the production of catalase revealed maximum activity for l. pentosus  and e. faecalis at late stationary and late logarithmic growth phase, respectively. the physiological role of catalase was studied with l. sake. the presence of hematin allows higher growth yields, since it protects the cells against hydrogen peroxide formed endogenously up to concentrations of 4.6 mmol/l.

TI  == transport and metabolism of vitamin b6 in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis 8043 concentrates extracellular [3h]pyridoxal or [3h]pyridoxamine primarily as the corresponding 5'-phosphates. accumulation of pyridoxamine requires an exogenous energy source and is inhibited by glycolysis inhibitors. a membrane potential is not required for transport of pyridoxamine, and an artificially generated potential does not drive uptake in this organism. based on this and other evidence, it is concluded that s. faecalis accumulates pyridoxamine by facilitated diffusion in conjunction with trapping by pyridoxal kinase. pyridoxamine-p is not concentrated, but equilibrates with that provided externally. lactobacillus casei 7469 concentrates radioactivity only from pyridoxal, which appears internally as pyridoxal-p, suggesting that it too absorbs the vitamin by facilitated diffusion plus trapping. the specificity of the growth requirement of s. faecalis and l. casei for vitamin b6 parallels the specificity of the transport systems for this vitamin in these organisms. lactobacillus delbrueckii 7469, however, which specifically requires pyridoxamine-p or pyridoxal-p for growth, accumulates both these compounds and pyridoxine-p from the medium, apparently by active transport, but not pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, or pyridoxal. while pyridoxal-p and pyridoxamine-p are interconvertible in this organism, pyridoxine-p is not further metabolized, thus  accounting for the specificity of the growth requirement. these and previous results show (a) that different organisms may employ quite different transport machinery in utilization of a given external nutrient, and (b) that the specificity of the growth requirement for a given form of a vitamin frequently arises from the specificity of transport, but that internal metabolism of the compounds also plays a significant role in some organisms.
