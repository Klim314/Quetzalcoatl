TI  == molecular analysis of tet(w) gene-mediated tetracycline resistance in dominant intestinal bifidobacterium species from healthy humans.
AB  == tet(w) was found responsible for tetracycline resistance (mics, 4 to > or =32 microg ml(-1)) in dominant bifidobacterial species from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy humans. the gene from bifidobacterium longum h66 proved to be identical over a 2.6-kbp region to the recently described tet(w) determinant of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens.

TI  == comparative analysis of sequences flanking tet(w) resistance genes in multiple species of gut bacteria.
AB  == tet(w) is one of the most abundant tetracycline resistance genes found in bacteria from the mammalian gut and was first identified in the rumen anaerobe butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 1.230, where it is highly mobile and its transfer is associated with the transposable chromosomal element tnb1230. in order to compare the genetic basis for tet(w) carriage in different bacteria, we studied sequences flanking tet(w) in representatives of seven bacterial genera originating in diverse gut environments. the sequences 657 bp upstream and 43 bp downstream of tet(w) were 96 to 100% similar in all strains examined. a common open reading frame (orf) was identified downstream of tet(w) in five different bacteria, while another conserved orf that flanked tet(w) in b. fibrisolvens 1.230 was also present upstream of tet(w) in a human colonic roseburia isolate and in another rumen b. fibrisolvens isolate. in one species, bifidobacterium longum (strain f8), a novel transposase was located within the conserved 657-bp region upstream  of tet(w) and was flanked by imperfect direct repeats. additional direct repeats  6 bp long were identified on each end of a chromosomal orf interrupted by the insertion of the putative transposase and the tet(w) gene. this tet(w) gene was transferable at low frequencies between bifidobacterium strains. a putative minielement carrying a copy of tet(w) was identified in b. fibrisolvens transconjugants that had acquired the tet(w) gene on tnb1230. several different mechanisms, including mechanisms involving plasmids and conjugative transposons,  appear to be involved in the horizontal transfer of tet(w) genes, but small core  regions that may function as minielements are conserved.

TI  == occurrence of the new tetracycline resistance gene tet(w) in bacteria from the human gut.
AB  == members of our group recently identified a new tetracycline resistance gene, tet(w), in three genera of rumen obligate anaerobes. here, we show that tet(w) is also present in bacteria isolated from human feces. the tet(w) genes found in human fusobacterium prausnitzii and bifidobacterium longum isolates were more than 99.9% identical to those from a rumen isolate of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens.
